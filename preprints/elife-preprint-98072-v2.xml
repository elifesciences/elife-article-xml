<abstract>
<p>The pathogenesis of many rare tumor types is poorly understood, preventing the design of effective treatments. Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) are neoplasms of mesenchymal origin that affect 1/1,000,000 individuals every year and are clinically assimilated to soft tissue sarcomas. SFTs can arise throughout the body and are usually managed surgically. However, 30-40% of SFTs will relapse local-regionally or metastasize. There are no systemic therapies with durable activity for malignant SFTs to date. The molecular hallmark of SFTs is a gene fusion between the <italic>NAB2</italic> and <italic>STAT6</italic> loci on chromosome 12, resulting in a chimeric protein of poorly characterized function called NAB2-STAT6. We use primary samples and an inducible cell model to discover that NAB2-STAT6 operates as a transcriptional coactivator for a specific set of enhancers and promoters that are normally targeted by the EGR1 transcription factor. In physiological conditions, NAB2 is primarily localized to the cytoplasm and only a small nuclear fraction is available to operate as a co-activator of EGR1 targets. NAB2-STAT6 redirects NAB1, NAB2, and additional EGR1 to the nucleus and bolster the expression of neuronal EGR1 targets. The STAT6 moiety of the fusion protein is a major driver of its nuclear localization and further contributes to NAB2’s co-activating abilities. In primary tumors, NAB2-STAT6 activates a neuroendocrine gene signature that sets it apart from most sarcomas. These discoveries provide new insight into the pathogenesis of SFTs and reveal new targets with therapeutic potential.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The pathogenesis of many rare tumor types is poorly understood, preventing the design of effective treatments. For some of these tumors, the discovery of gene fusion events and the characterization of their biological repercussions has led to the design of effective treatments and improved patient outcomes. Notable examples include the MLL fusions that cause early onset mixed-lineage leukemias, the NUT-BRD4 fusions in NUT carcinoma and the SS18 (SWI/SNF) fusions in synovial sarcoma(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) are rare mesenchymal tumors with an estimated incidence rate of 1 in 1 million people per year(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). They can develop in any location in the body, but most commonly arise in pleural, dural, or pelvic soft tissues. The majority of these sarcomas are indolent and can be surgically removed with curative intent. However, 30-40% of tumors recur local-regionally or metastasize and have no curative treatment options. Histology demonstrates that tumor masses present peculiar vascular features (hemangiopericytoma-like vessels) and are made up of patternless fibroblastic cells that are CD34+(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). SFTs present no recurrent mutations at known oncogenes or tumor suppressors loci. However, an intrachromosomal inversion on chromosome 12 was identified as the molecular hallmark of SFTs in 2013(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The inversion on the long arm of chromosome 12 results in a gene fusion between <italic>NAB2</italic> and <italic>STAT6.</italic> Immunohistochemistry using antibodies targeting the C-terminus of STAT6 reveals strong nuclear staining in the presence of the chimeric protein NAB2-STAT6, leading to STAT6 nuclear staining as a diagnostic tool for SFTs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>Hemangiopericytomas were previously diagnosed as a distinct soft tissue neoplasm and upon discovery of the <italic>NAB2-STAT6</italic> gene fusion, are now classified as SFTs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).Despite the introduction of molecular diagnostic tools, many SFTs are still misdiagnosed or misclassified, owing to our fundamental lack of understanding of their etiology.</p>
<p>The precise role of NAB2-STAT6 in SFTs pathogenesis remains unclear. Both NAB2 and STAT6 are physiologically active as transcriptional regulators. STAT6 is a DNA-binding transcription factor operating downstream to the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in leukocytes. STAT6 is commonly activated by cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 and mediates key immunological processes such as macrophage polarization and T-cell/B-cell activation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Activation of STAT6 occurs via JAK-mediated phosphorylation at Y641, triggering homodimerization via the SH2 domain and ultimately leading to nuclear translocation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Nuclear STAT6 stimulates transcription through its transactivation domain that recruits RNA Helicase A (RHA), SND1, and p300/CBP(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>).</p>
<p>Conversely, the NGFI-A binding protein 2 (NAB2) is expressed in most tissues and was originally characterized as co-repressor of the Early Growth Response transcription factors (EGR1/2)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). The EGR proteins are Immediate Early Genes (IERs), like other ubiquitously expressed transcription factors such as AP-1 (all FOS/JUN family members)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Immediate Early Genes are upregulated in most cell types in response to a variety of growth stimuli(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). In fact, EGR1/2 are considered, like AP-1, broad regulators of cell proliferation and peak during developmental processes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Their role has been best studied in the central nervous system (CNS), where they also regulate neuronal activity post mitosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). EGR1 can modulate the expression of growth factors, such as IGF2 and TGF-β1, as well as that of NAB2, and is believed to act either as oncogene or tumor suppressor depending on the cellular context(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). NAB2 forms homodimers and heterodimerizes with its family member NAB1, which was also described as co-repressor of EGR1-dependent transcription(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). We recently demonstrated that NAB2 may also function as co-activator of transcriptional enhancers during myeloid differentiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). The global role of NAB2 as a chromatin regulator in tumors, either in its wild-type form or as a fusion protein partner, remains poorly elucidated.</p>
<p>Several different NAB2-STAT6 isoforms have been identified. Most tumors (40-70%, especially those of pleural origin) carry a large fusion product of ∼140Kda resulting from exons 1-4 of NAB2 (retaining a truncated NCD2 domain and missing the c-terminal CID domain) and exons 2-22 of STAT6 (with the entire CDS). Another frequent isoform retains a larger NAB2 moiety (exon 1-5/6, to include a truncated CID domain) and a much smaller STAT6 moiety (exon 16/17-22, missing the SH2 and DNA binding domains but retaining the transactivation domain). This shorter isoform accounts for 10-20% of cases and is most common in SFTs originating in extra-pleural locations. Risk of malignant progression, recurrence and metastasis are not preferentially associated with either isoform of NAB2-STAT6(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). In fact, the current risk assessment model (Demicco score) does not incorporate any molecular or genetic features of the primary tumor(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>).</p>
<p>The determinants of NAB2-STAT6 occupancy genome-wide have not been previously investigated, nor have the epigenetic and transcriptional consequences of the fusion protein been identified(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Here, we employ functional genomics and proteomics strategies to demonstrate that NAB2-STAT6 drives a EGR1-dependent neuroendocrine transcriptional program via epigenetic activation of a network of distal enhancers and proximal promoters that is normally operating in neuronal cells. We further show that NAB2 is primarily contained in the cytoplasm and becomes nuclear-bound when fused to STAT6. The fusion protein utilizes the full EGR1 regulatory axis, including homo- and heterodimerization with NAB1/NAB2, to drive a highly distinctive transcriptional program that sets SFTs apart from most other tumors of mesenchymal origin.</p>

<title>Solitary Fibrous Tumors express a neuronal gene signature</title>
<p>Developing treatments for SFTs is particularly challenging since their molecular landscape is largely undefined. Whole-exome sequencing of primary tumors has led to the discovery of <italic>NAB2-STAT6</italic> gene fusions. Additional transcriptomic data have been previously obtained, but were difficult to interpret in the absence of matching normal tissues(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). We examined Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) sections of 8 tumors and their normal tissue counterpart. All tumors were removed from the pleura or pleural-adjacent locations such as lung, chest wall, and hilum. Three of these tumors were diagnosed as malignant, three as low risk or benign, and the other two had uncertain biological potential (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1a</xref>). We extracted RNA from all FFPE sections and subjected it to exon targeted sequencing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1b</xref>). To validate SFT diagnosis for each tumor we employed Arriba, a computational tool to identify gene fusions from RNA-seq data. All tumors shared one common NAB2-STAT6 isoform, spanning the first 4 exons of NAB2 and all but the first STAT6 exon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1c</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 1a</xref>). The transcriptomes of the primary SFTs well correlated with previously published SFT RNA-seq datasets (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.1b</xref>). We performed differential gene expression analysis between the tumors and the adjacent normal tissues (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.1c</xref>). We found 2,429 genes significantly upregulated across all SFTs. Notably, the most upregulated gene was <italic>IGF2</italic>, an EGR1 target that was recognized as major driver of a hypoglycemic condition occurring in &lt;5% of SFTs (Doege-Potter syndrome). We further identified key regulators of neuronal development as upregulated, including <italic>SHOX2, KCNA1, LHX2</italic>, and <italic>ROBO2</italic>. A set of upregulated genes encoded GABA receptor subunits (<italic>GABRD, GABRA2, GABRB2, GABRG1</italic>). We also identified 3,769 downregulated genes, including a set of immune processes regulators such as <italic>CCL18, IGHA1, SCGB3A1, IGHA2,</italic> and <italic>PIGR</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1d</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). Gene ontology and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that neuronal development programs are broadly upregulated in SFTs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). Conversely, immune and cell signaling pathways are significantly downregulated (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1d-e</xref>), suggesting that SFTs may be immunologically ‘cold’. We analyzed the enrichment of transcription factor motifs within the promoter regions of all upregulated genes identified by RNA-seq. We found that binding sites for DB1, MAZ, MOVO−B, and EGR1 were the top enriched motifs by adjusted p-value and that EGR1 motifs were over-represented in the whole enrichment matrix (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1f</xref>). Conversely, the top motifs enriched at the promoters of downregulated genes belonged to transcription factors active in mesoderm derived tissues, like HTF4 and MRF4 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.1f</xref>). These results suggest that an EGR1-bound neuronal transcriptional program is being activated in SFT cells.</p>

<title>Generation of an inducible NAB2-STAT6 cell model</title>
<p>SFTs are presumed to be mesenchymal in origin, therefore we used the osteosarcoma-derived U2OS cell line to generate an inducible model of NAB2-STAT6 expression and study the early transcriptional events driven by the fusion protein. Previous work on NAB2-STAT6 relied on overexpression in bulk cell populations that were primarily of non-mesenchymal origin, potentially limiting their utility(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). We generated a single cell derived clone expressing the most common isoform of NAB2-STAT6 (exons 1-4 of <italic>NAB2</italic> and exons 2-22 of <italic>STAT6</italic>) under the control of a doxycycline inducible promoter (tet-ON). We observed expression of NAB2-STAT6 starting at 24 hours of doxycycline treatment, peaking at 48 hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). To profile early gene expression changes induced by the expression of NAB2-STAT6 we performed 3’ mRNA QuantSeq. We observed widespread gene dysregulation that increased in magnitude over time, indicating that the fusion protein has direct and robust effects genome-wide (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). We observed a smaller cluster of 299 genes exhibiting the strongest upregulation after 1 day of NAB2-STAT6 expression (cluster 1) and tapering off at 48h and 72h of doxycycline (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref>), suggesting they could be indirect targets. This cluster was enriched for translation and protein biosynthesis genes that are regulated by E2F, ZF5 and HES-7 transcription factors (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2b-c</xref>), further pointing to an immediate cellular stress response to the ectopic expression of NAB2-STAT6. Larger scale gene expression changes were apparent after 48h of doxycycline with 562 upregulated genes (73%), including IGF2 and several neuronal regulators. About 27% of differentially expressed genes were downregulated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref> and Supplementary Table 2), indicating that the primary function of NAB2-STAT6 may be transcriptional activation. Upregulated pathways were primarily involved in neuronal differentiation and development (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2d</xref>). Promoters of upregulated genes were overwhelmingly enriched for EGR1 motifs, while STAT motifs were not significantly enriched (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). The expression of several neuronal markers such as <italic>LHX2, ROBO2, SHOX2</italic> increased over time of doxycycline treatment and peaked at 72h of NAB2-STAT6 expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of endogenous <italic>NAB2, NAB1</italic>, and <italic>EGR1</italic> followed a similar trend, suggesting that the fusion protein enables a feed forward mechanism of the EGR1 regulatory axis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2f</xref>). NAB2 has been proposed to repress its own expression and that of <italic>NAB1</italic> and <italic>EGR1</italic>. However, this trend suggests that NAB2-STAT6 does not possess any co-repressor activity and is instead functioning as a co-activator.</p>

<title>EGR1 targeted promoters and enhancers are activated by NAB2-STAT6</title>
<p>We established that EGR1 neuronal targets are upregulated in SFTs and after NAB2-STAT6 expression in U2OS cells. To investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of NAB2-STAT6 dysregulation we performed ChIP-seq of the fusion protein through its C-terminal FLAG epitope after 48h of doxycycline. We identified 1,394 peaks that gained significant NAB2-STAT6 signal compared to day 0 and were almost equally distributed between promoters (57%) and distal cis-regulatory regions (43%, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>, and Supplementary Table 3). Next, we analyzed endogenous EGR1 at NAB2-STAT6 sites and found seeding binding across the vast majority of fusion protein peaks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Upon NAB2-STAT6 expression, EGR1 binding increased at least two-fold at most sites. We performed ATAC-seq to investigate chromatin accessibility status. NAB2-STAT6 peaks were moderately accessible at day 0 and their accessibility increased two-fold (similar to EGR1 binding) at 48h of doxycycline (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). We next profiled endogenous NAB2 and STAT6 in control conditions and found that NAB2 localized at NAB2-STAT6 peaks but not STAT6 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Conversely, NAB2-STAT6 did not bind any STAT6 control sites (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). To further assess determinants of NAB2-STAT6 binding we performed motif analysis using HOMER and identified a strong EGR1/EGR2 signature but no STAT family motifs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that NAB2-STAT6 target genes, as determined by ChIP-seq, were highly enriched in NAB2-STAT6 upregulated genes found by RNA-seq analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c</xref>). NAB2-STAT6 and EGR1 co-localize at promoters and enhancers of neuronal markers such as KNDC and UNCX (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>). Additional enhancer sites targeted by NAB2-STAT6 were found near known EGR1 target genes such as IGF2, the most upregulated gene in SFTs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Interestingly, the fusion protein also targeted the proximal promoter of EGR1, thereby boosting its expression and providing a robust feed-forward mechanism to sustain its own epigenetic network (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that NAB2-STAT6 localizes to EGR1 targets increasing their accessibility and expression.</p>

<title>NAB2-STAT6 localizes to EGR1 targets in primary tumors</title>
<p>To validate our U2OS model of NAB2-STAT6 as a robust activator of certain EGR1 targets, we set out to determine genome-wide NAB2-STAT6 occupancy in a primary solitary fibrous tumor. We obtained a fresh primary pre-sacral SFT post-surgery (no radiation or chemotherapy had been administered to the patient). This tumor expressed the short isoform of NAB2-STAT6 containing exons 1-6 of NAB2 and exons 17-22 of STAT6 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). We isolated and fixed in single cell suspension ∼50 million cells and performed ChIP-seq for NAB2, STAT6, and RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII). Since we previously showed that endogenous NAB2 and STAT6 localization do not overlap in physiological conditions (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>), we reasoned that we could pinpoint NAB2 and STAT6 primary binding sites as well as specific binding sites of the fusion protein, based on the convergence of NAB2 and STAT6 signals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). We identified 6,284 NAB2 peaks, 1,640 STAT6 peaks, and 38,036 RNAPII peaks in primary tumor cells. Peak overlap analysis revealed 718 putative NAB2-STAT6 binding sites, 69% of which were distal to gene promoters and likely to represent transcriptional enhancers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref> and Supplementary Table 4). The NAB2-STAT6 peaks also showed robust RNAPII signal, further suggesting that the fusion protein elicits transcriptional activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). We also identified 5,912 unique NAB2 peaks and 1,285 unique STAT6 peaks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref>). Next, we performed motif analysis using HOMER. NAB2 only sites were enriched for EGR1/2 motifs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4c</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 4d</xref>) and the same motif profile was found at NAB2-STAT6 peaks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4c</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 4e</xref>). STAT6 only peaks, instead, were enriched for GRE and STAT motifs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4c</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 4f</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis of NAB2-STAT6 peaks (closet gene) showed significant correlation with upregulated genes in SFTs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4d</xref>). Collectively, these findings align with data obtained in U2OS cells and suggest that NAB2-STAT6 localization is exclusively driven by EGR1 binding. We found limited overlap between NAB2-STAT6 sites in the primary tumor and those retrieved in U2OS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e-f</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4g-h</xref>), consistent with the limited overlap between their transcriptomes. It is likely that the mechanism of transcription activation by NAB2-STAT6 is conserved, whereas the targets are cell type specific. Interestingly, NAB2 appeared upregulated in both systems as either the fusion protein or endogenous NAB2 bound the proximal promoter region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4f</xref>), furthermore nucleosome accessibility and EGR1 binding increased in U2OS cells upon doxycycline treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). The oncogenic NAB2-STAT6 fusion may thereby reinforce its own expression in SFTs.</p>

<title>The subcellular localization and interactome of NAB-STAT6</title>
<p>Previous work established that NAB2-STAT6 localizes to the nucleus. It has been proposed that NAB2 is primarily guiding the subcellular localization of the chimeric protein, barely contributing any further functional domain, whereas STAT6 endows the fusion product with activation domain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).Since the interactome of NAB2-STAT6 has not been previously investigated with unbiased proteomic approaches, we performed LC-MS/MS analysis on NAB2-STAT6 eluates using a MudPIT approach. First, we affinity purified NAB2-STAT6 from nuclear fractions of U2OS cells using antibodies directed against NAB2 or STAT6. Both antibodies efficiently immunoprecipitated the chimeric protein, as well as NAB1 and EGR1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a</xref>). To validate EGR1 as a NAB2-STAT6 interactor we performed the reciprocal IP. Upon doxycycline induction in U2OS, EGR1 antibodies co-precipitated NAB2-STAT6. In addition, EGR1 co-purified along with CBP/P300 and RNAPII subunits suggesting that NAB2-STAT6 co-opts EGR1 co-activator functions (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 5a</xref>). To further validate NAB2-STAT6’s interactome we performed FLAG affinity purification in U2OS as well as in a 293T stably expressing clone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 5b</xref>). This approach pulled down the fusion product as well as near-stoichiometric amounts of NAB1, additional interactors included the co-activators SND1 (normally recruited by STAT6) and RHA (recruited by either STAT6 or EGR1, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 5c-d</xref>). NAB1 is a NAB2 paralog that was loosely studied for its ability to repress EGR1-mediated activation. NAB1 is the strongest interactor of NAB2-STAT6 across multiple experiments (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>), suggesting that a heterodimeric form of the oncogenic protein may be its most common form. Endogenous NAB2 can also heterodimerize with NAB1 as we have shown (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>). Additionally, the chimeric protein can heterodimerize with endogenous, full length NAB2 (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 5e-f</xref>).</p>

<p>To further clarify the subcellular localization of NAB2-STAT6 we initially performed fractionation experiments in U2OS cells to find that NAB2 and EGR1 localization is primarily cytoplasmic prior to NAB2-STAT6 expression, whereas endogenous STAT6 is nuclear (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). The fusion protein is fully retained in the nucleus and drives endogenous NAB2 and EGR1 to the nucleus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). To corroborate these findings, we employed immunocytochemistry (ICC). We first examined the primary tumor cells that we profiled by ChIP-seq (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) and retrieved a robust nuclear signal for NAB2 and STAT6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Next, we performed ICC in the U2OS inducible clone and confirmed that in wild type conditions, NAB2 localization is largely cytoplasmic, while STAT6 signal is mostly nuclear (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5g</xref>). Upon NAB2-STAT6 expression, NAB2 and STAT6 signals co-localize in the nucleus, while a small amount of endogenous NAB2 remains cytoplasmic. Taken together, these data suggest that the STAT6 moiety drives nuclear localization of the fusion protein. The NAB2 paralog NAB1 heterodimerizes with the fusion protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>). Accordingly, NAB1 under physiological conditions is predominantly cytoplasmic (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5h</xref>) and is redirected to the nucleus by NAB2-STAT6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>), having a similar fate to that of endogenous NAB2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). Importantly, NAB1 antibodies do not cross-recognizen NAB2, and viceversa (see Author Response to Reviewers).</p>

<title>The SFT gene signature is expressed in neuroendocrine tumors</title>
<p>SFTs are traditionally assimilated to soft tissue sarcomas and are often positive to CD34 staining. They are broadly classified as mesenchymal tumors based on their histological patterns, albeit their cell of origin remains uncertain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). To unbiasedly determine which tumor transcriptomes are the closest to SFTs, we performed single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) probing the SFT gene signature across the entire Cancer Genome Atlas database (22,687 samples from 223 different tumors). About 30% of TCGA tumors, including most sarcoma subtypes, had a positive ssGSEA score indicating that a significant number of EGR1-driven genes are upregulated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Strikingly, a group of neuroendocrine tumors (Glioblastoma, Mixed Glioma, Neuroblastoma, and Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma) stood out as the most closely correlated to SFTs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Conversely, myeloid and lymphoid malignancies showed the poorest correlation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6a</xref>). Neuroendocrine tumors are broadly characterized by nerve cell traits as well as by their unique secretory features that may impact distal organs and tissues. In addition to IGF2 and IGF1 hormones, as we previously described, SFTs upregulate secreted metabolic regulators such CTRP11, neuropeptides and their activating enzymes (NPW, PCSK2), and chemokines/cytokines such as PDGFD, NTN3, DEFB136 (Supplementary Table 1). Neuroendocrine tumors are challenging to treat, presenting highly variable degrees of aggressiveness. We asked whether the SFT gene signature correlated with prognosis by performing a survival analysis across all TCGA samples. SFT-like tumors showed significantly worse outcomes, suggesting that expression of an EGR1 gene signature underlies tumor aggressiveness and/or therapy resistance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6b</xref>). We next wanted to validate the SFT signature for its ability to classify solitary fibrous tumors a priori, reasoning that ssGSEA scores should pinpoint misclassified SFTs within a pool of different tumors. Prior to NAB2-STAT6 discovery and its diagnostic use, some SFTs were misclassified as mesotheliomas due to their pleural localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). We therefore analyzed all transcriptomes from the TGCA collection of 87 mesotheliomas and identified one patient presenting an outlier ssGSEA positive score (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). We used Arriba to confirm that SH-A7BH was, in fact, the only tumor in the mesothelioma cohort containing a NAB2-STAT6 fusion (exons 1-6 of NAB2 and 16-22 of STAT6, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>).</p>

<p>The previously unrecognized neuroendocrine signature in SFTs and the startling number of neural genes activated via NAB2-STAT6/EGR1 elicits further questions about the identity of the tumor-initiating cells. To address this question, we first investigated the correlation of SFTs to normal tissue types by calculating the Spearman correlation with all samples from the Human Protein Atlas. SFTs correlated best with several neuronal tissue types and were the least correlated with lung and gut tissues (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). In addition to neuronal genes, we noticed that some of the top upregulated genes were implicated in embryogenesis and early development (i.e. shh regulators such as GLI2 or wnt pathway activators such as WNT2). We resolved to examine the protein domains that were enriched within the top 400 genes of the SFT signature using the functional annotation tool InterPro. The most significantly enriched domain was the Homeobox domain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>), which functions as a DNA binding domain for a large class of transcription factors that are expressed during embryonic and fetal development to drive pattern formation, axis specification, ultimately leading to proper tissue and organ morphogenesis. Notably, several homeodomain transcription factors were overexpressed in SFTs (ALX4, SHOX2, SIX1) and entire HOX clusters (HOXA, HOXC) were upregulated as further confirmed by RNAPII profiling of a primary tumor tissue (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref>). However, we did not identify a homeobox binding motif in our previous analysis of NAB2-STAT6 binding sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). We then searched for enriched TF binding sites using all RNAPII-bound enhancers (excluding NAB2-STAT6 targeted enhancers) and found an overwhelming enrichment for homeotic proteins as well as Nanog (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>). These results suggest that a homeobox TF network, elicited by NAB2-STAT6 upregulation of homeotic genes, drives a significant part of the SFT transcriptomes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fusion oncoproteins frequently occur in a broad range of tumors, such as AML, sarcomas, non-small cell lung cancer, and prostate cancer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). The loci encoding fusion protein products originate via chromosomal aberrations such as translocations or, as in the case of SFTs, inversions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). In most cases, the aberrant protein product retains select biological activities from both protein partners and drives neoplastic transformation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>).</p>
<p>In this work we characterize the mechanistic role of the NAB2-STAT6 fusion in Solitary Fibrous Tumors through a combination of genomics data generated from primary SFTs, a tet-inducible model system in human cell lines, and by comparing SFT gene signatures to the Cancer Genome Atlas collection. Detection of NAB2- STAT6 protein products has become the primary diagnostic tool for this rare tumor type, however the role of the fusion protein in the etiology of SFTs has remained elusive(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). A variety of mechanisms have been proposed for NAB2-STAT6’s function, including activation of STAT6 targets and conversion of NAB2 from a repressor to an activator(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Here we show that NAB2-STAT6 activates an EGR1-driven neuroendocrine gene expression signature by translocating EGR1, NAB1, and wild type NAB2 to the nucleus (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Our data suggest that the NAB2 moiety of the fusion protein targets a specific set of EGR1-dependent enhancers and proximal promoter sites and uses NAB1, or endogenous NAB2, as co-activators. In fact, our data suggest that NAB2/NAB1 are co-activators of EGR-1 targets under physiological conditions, however cytoplasmic localization restrains their activity. Unlike previously proposed(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), we find that the STAT6 moiety of the fusion is the major driver of its nuclear localization (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). STAT6, however, does not endow the fusion protein with the ability to recognize a subset of STAT motifs, but may recruit additional co-activators.</p>

Data from this work and our previous analysis of NAB2 activity during myeloid differentiation establish that these proteins operate as robust co-activators of EGR1 targets, at enhancers and proximal promoters(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). In myeloid cells, we found that full-length NAB2 recruits the Integrator protein complex. The NAB2 moiety of NAB2-STAT6 does not appear to recruit Integrator subunits, yet retains co-activator abilities by partnering with chromatin modifiers (CBP/P300) and helicases (RHA).</p>
<p>For the first time, we were able to establish transcriptional changes that occur in SFTs through comparison with the adjacent matching normal tissue. This led to identifying a robust EGR-1 driven neuronal gene signature, including GABA receptor subunits, synapses modulators, ion channels and modulators of axonal morphology. In the CNS, EGR1 is known to regulate a variety of neuronal-dependent processes such as memory and behavior. We also identified a distinct secretory gene signature associated with SFTs. In fact, IGF2 is the most upregulated gene, via activation of an intronic enhancer by EGR1. IGF2 was pinpointed as the cause of hypoglycemia occurring in a very small subset of SFTs (Doege–Potter syndrome)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Our data suggest that IGF2 (and IGF1) upregulation is a common feature of all SFTs. In addition to insulin-like growth factors, STFs may secrete a host of peptides with diverse functions in neuronal processes, chemotaxis, and growth stimulation. The previously unrecognized neuronal features and the putative secretory phenotype of STFs set them apart from mesenchymal malignancies and relate them to neuroendocrine malignancies such as pheochromocytoma, oligodendroglioma and neuroblastoma. Neuroendocrine tumors originate from neuron-like cells that are able to send and receive signals from the nervous system, but also function as endocrine organs by producing hormones such as IGF2, with a systemic effect across distal tissues and organs. Similar to many neuroendocrine neoplasms, SFTs are immunologically cold and downregulate a set of immune response genes, perhaps with further support from IGF2 itself(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>).</p>
<p>SFTs were classified as mesenchymal on the basis of their histological patterns and are believed to originate from soft tissue cell types, such as fibroblasts(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). When comparing SFT signatures to human tissue RNA-seq datasets, we identified greater similarities to CNS tissues but not mesenchymal tissues types.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we unveiled a set of embryonically and fetally expressed transcription factors that appear to coordinate part of SFT transcriptomes. Ectopic expression of few homeotic genes has been observed across many tumors and may contribute to their growth and plasticity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). SFTs appear to upregulate an overwhelming number of homeotic transcription factors as we showed, perhaps suggesting that the tumor mass may originate from a corrupted developmental process from embryogenesis or fetal development.</p>

<p>Solitary Fibrous Tumors (SFTs) are a rare malignancy defined by NAB2-STAT6 fusions. Because the molecular understanding of the disease is largely lacking, there are currently no targeted treatment approaches. Using primary tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples and cells inducibly expressing NAB2-STAT6, Hill et al. perform a detailed characterization of the transcriptomic and epigenomic NAB2-STAT6 SFT signatures. They identify enrichment or EGR1/NAB2 (but not STAT6) sites bound by the fusion protein and increased expression of EGR1 targets. Their studies indicate that NAB2-STAT6 fusion may direct the nuclear translocation of NAB2 and EGR1 proteins and potentially NAB1. Transcriptionally, NAB2-STAT6 SFTs most closely resemble neuroendocrine tumors.</p>
<p>This pioneering study provides critical insight into the molecular pathogenesis of SFTs, pivotal for the future development of mechanistically informed treatment approaches. The study is rigorously executed and well-written. This new knowledge is an important addition to the field.</p>

<p>(1) The authors state that &quot;NAB2-STAT6 localization is exclusively driven by EGR1 binding&quot; yet WT1 motives are also consistently enriched. Can you please touch upon the potential involvement of WT1 (or lack thereof, and why)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our data suggest that EGR1 is the primary driver of NAB2-STAT6 localization. In fact, EGR1 is the most significantly enriched motif (Fig. 4) at NAB2-STAT6 binding sites and we detect an interaction between the fusion protein and EGR1 (Fig. 5). Conversely, we did not identify an interaction between NAB2-STAT6 and WT1. However, WT1 also belongs to the C2H2 zinc finger subclass and recognizes a motif bearing striking similarities to the EGR1/2 consensus. EGR1 has been previously described to bind WT1 motifs and to function as an activator of WT1 targets (as opposed to WT1 repressive abilities).

<p>(2) In the description of Figure 5C the authors observe nuclear staining of both NAB2 and STAT6 following NAB2-STAT6 fusion induction. They interpret this as the fusion stimulates nuclear translocation of endogenous NAB2. This statement can only be rigorously made if the authors can unequivocally demonstrate that their antibody exclusively detects endogenous NAB2 and not the NAB2 portion of the fusion. As presented, a more likely interpretation is that the NAB2 staining detects NAB2-STAT6 fusion protein. Since there is some cytoplasmic NAB2 signal still present, the findings in Figure 5c do not support nor disprove nuclear translocation of endogenous NAB2. It may be prudent to remove this section. Figure 5B is currently the best direct evidence of nuclear translocation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that Fig. 5C does not rigorously show that NAB2-STAT6 fusion proteins drag endogenous NAB2 into the nucleus. The immunostaining reveals that wt NAB2 localization is overwhelmingly cytoplasmic at steady-state conditions (and prior to expression of the fusion protein). Instead, Figure 5B shows that endogenous NAB2 translocates to the nucleus upon NAB2-STAT6 expression. Additionally, figure 5A (along with Suppl. Fig. 5 E-F) demonstrates that endogenous NAB2 co-precipitates with NAB2-STAT6 fusions in nuclear extracts of U2OS and HEK293T cells. We have rephrased the paragraph accordingly.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 5D: for the interpretation of the presented data to hold up, namely, NAB1 nuclear translocation upon NAB2-STAT6 expression, it is important to demonstrate that NAB1 antibodies do not cross-react with NAB2 given the similarity between NAB1 and NAB2. Without such control, another likely interpretation of the results in Figure 5D is that NAB1 antibody detects the NAB2 portion of the overexpressed fusion protein. This needs to be acknowledged in the text.</p>
<p>We had similar concerns, therefore we confirmed that the NAB1 antibody does not cross react with NAB2 by immunoblot (see figure below). We overexpressed FLAG-NAB2, HA-NAB1 and GFP constructs in HEK293T cells, we performed immunoprecipitation with either HA or FLAG from whole cell extracts followed by western blot using anti-NAB2 and anti-NAB1 polyclonal antibodies. We did not observe cross-reactivity of these antibodies. We acknowledged antibody validation in the revised text.</p>

<p>(4) Also, to support the notion that NAB2-STAT6 fusion promotes nuclear translocation of the entire complex, an imaging approach detecting EGR1 similar to Figure 5C-D would be helpful. EGR1 staining also avoids the potential pitfall of NAB1/2 antibodies detecting NAB2-STAT6 overexpressed fusion instead of endogenous proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that this would be a helpful approach. Unfortunately, none of the commercially available EGR1 antibodies that we tested were suitable for immunocytochemistry, as they either failed to show a proper signal or were marred by high nonspecific background signal.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors found increased mRNA expression of certain cytokines and secreted neuropeptides in SFTs. While this may be consistent with a secretory phenotype, additional evidence such as detection of elevated levels of these proteins in tumor lysates or in culture media is necessary to formally make this claim. Please rephrase.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have rephrased our claims as suggested. The revised text is now as follows: “​​We also identified a distinct secretory gene signature associated with SFTs. In fact, IGF2 is the most upregulated gene, via activation of an intronic enhancer by EGR1. IGF2 was pinpointed as the cause of hypoglycemia occurring in a very small subset of SFTs (Doege–Potter syndrome)(52). Our data suggest that IGF2 (and IGF1) upregulation is a common feature of all SFTs. In addition to insulin-like growth factors, STFs may secrete a host of peptides with diverse functions in neuronal processes, chemotaxis, and growth stimulation. The previously unrecognized neuronal features and the putative secretory phenotype of STFs set them apart from mesenchymal malignancies and relate them to neuroendocrine malignancies such as pheochromocytoma, oligodendroglioma and neuroblastoma.”</p>

<p>(6) GSEA with 500 randomly selected genes from target datasets needs a more detailed description to clarify the method.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To improve clarity, we added the following description: “Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was done with 500 randomly selected genes from the given set of genes across the C2 collection of the human molecular signatures database or custom signatures using the GSEA function in clusterProfiler package in R (v4.6.2).</p>

<p>(7) In the IP-MS description, please double check the NaCl concentration in the second extraction step - 0.5mM seems low. Also, in the IP part, a buffer recipe appears to have been incorrectly pasted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for identifying this typo. Indeed, we used 0.5M NaCl instead of 0.5mM. We have corrected the co-IP buffer recipe accordingly.</p>
