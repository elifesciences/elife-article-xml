<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Vesicles within presynaptic terminals are thought to be segregated into a variety of readily releasable and reserve pools. The nature of the pools and tra<italic>ffi</italic>cking between them is not well understood, but pools that are slow to mobilize when synapses are active are often assumed to feed pools that are mobilized more quickly, in a series. However, electrophysiological studies of synaptic transmission have suggested instead a parallel organization where vesicles within slowly and quickly mobilized reserve pools would separately feed independent reluctant- and fast-releasing subdivisions of the readily releasable pool. Here we use FM-dyes to con<italic>fi</italic>rm the existence of multiple reserve pools at hippocampal synapses and a parallel organization that prevents intermixing between the pools, even when stimulation is intense enough to drive exocytosis at the maximum rate. The experiments additionally demonstrate extensive heterogeneity among synapses in the relative sizes of the slowly and quickly mobilized reserve pools, which suggests equivalent heterogeneity in the numbers of reluctant and fast-releasing readily releasable vesicles that may be relevant for understanding information processing and storage.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>The most significant addition is Figure 3, which is an analysis of FM4-64 destaining during 1 Hz stimulation at synapses that are clearly separated spatially from neighbors. We have additionally moved results at body temperature from supplementary information to Figure 12. We did this because Figure 12 shows that the relative sizes of quickly and slowly mobilized reserve pools are not altered by increasing the temperature. This is relevant because so called asynchronous release is eliminated in these cultures near body temperature, so the continued presence of a slowly mobilized reserve counters the concern raised in peer review that slowly releasable reserve vesicles might be primarily released asynchronously.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chemical synapses exhibit striking dynamic changes in connection strength during repetitive use. The changes are termed <italic>short-term plasticity</italic> or <italic>frequency dynamics</italic>, and are thought to play an important role in how information is processed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tsodyks and Markram, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbott and Regehr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buonomano and Maass, 2009</xref>). Multiple presynaptic vesicle tra<italic>ffi</italic>cking mechanisms are involved, but the identity of the mechanisms, how they interact, and the implications for biological computation are not understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Neher, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Most attempts at a detailed understanding begin with the premise that presynaptic vesicles are segregated into multiple <italic>pools</italic>, including at least one readily releasable pool and one reserve pool. Readily releasable vesicles are thought to be docked to <italic>release sites</italic> embedded within the active zone of the plasma membrane of synaptic terminals, whereas reserves reside in the interior. Nevertheless, pools are typically not de<italic>fi</italic>ned by morphological criteria but instead by the timing of <italic>mobilization</italic>, which is a general term for the full sequence of events that must occur before vesicles undergo exocytosis; for reserve vesicles, mobilization would include docking to release sites, biochemical priming, and catalysis of exocytosis.</p>
<p>Based on timing criteria, the readily releasable pool has been divided into <italic>fast-</italic> and <italic>slow-releasing</italic> subdivisions at a wide variety of synapse types; slow-releasing readily releasable vesicles are often termed <italic>reluctant</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wu and Borst, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sakaba and Neher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Moulder and Mennerick, 2005</xref>). Reserve pools are less studied, but have likewise been divided into quickly and slowly mobilized pools at some synapse types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Neves and Lagnado, 1999</xref>; Rizzoli and Betz, 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Denker et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A widespread premise has been that the pools are connected in a series where vesicles are transferred from slowly to quickly mobilized pools as diagrammed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pieribone et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hilfiker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Denker and Rizzoli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rothman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Doussau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Milovanovic et al., 2018</xref>). If so, reluctant vesicles might be docked to the same type of release site as fast-releasing vesicles, but in an immature priming state that could then transition to the mature, fast-releasing state. We refer to models with this premise as <italic>homogeneous release site</italic> models (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lin et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 1.</label>
<caption><p>Three possible organizations for synaptic vesicle pools; <italic>RRPs</italic> signi<italic>fi</italic>es readily releasable pools. (A) The predominant view currently seems to be that all pools are connected in series as depicted. (B &amp; C) However, recent evidence indicates that reluctant and fast-releasing subdivisions of the readily releasable pool can be released in parallel. (D) And, a separate line of evidence suggested that each readily releasable vesicle is associated with an autonomous reserve, implying that slowly and quickly mobilized reserves may also be processed in parallel, as depicted in Panel C.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="251975v4_fig1.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>However, a growing body of evidence suggests that reluctant vesicles are not immature, but are instead fully primed at release sites that are inherently ine<italic>ffi</italic>cient at catalyzing exocytosis. First, to our knowledge, none of the homogeneous release site models proposed so far can account for a series of electrophysiological experiments at calyx of Held synapses where: (1) the reluctant subdivision was only minimally depleted during moderate stimulation that exhausted the fast-releasing subdivision; and (2) abruptly increasing the stimulation intensity then drove exocytosis of the remaining reluctant vesicles directly, without <italic>fi</italic>rst transitioning to a fast-releasing state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mahfooz et al., 2016</xref> and Figure5-figure supplement 1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Raja et al., 2019</xref>). And second, recent optical imaging and molecular studies have con<italic>fi</italic>rmed substantial differences between release sites within the same active zone at a wide variety of synapse types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Böhme et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akbergenova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Maschi and Klyachko, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Karlocai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gou et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>To account for the observations, one of the starting premises of our working model is that fast-releasing and reluctant subdivisions of the readily releasable pool operate in parallel, which could be as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> if based solely on the studies referenced so far. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> depicts a different possibility, tested here, where quickly and slowly mobilized reserve pools are likewise arranged in parallel, and independently supply vesicles to corresponding fast-releasing and reluctant subdivisions of the readily releasable pool.</p>
<p>No such fully parallel arrangement has been proposed previously, at least not explicitly. However, an additional premise of our working model - based on separate studies, not related to distinctions between subdivisions of the readily releasable pool - is that each readily releasable vesicle is physically tethered to a short chain of reserve vesicles, which serve as replacements after the readily releasable vesicle undergoes exocytosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gabriel et al., 2011</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wesseling et al., 2019</xref> for supporting ultrastructural evidence).</p>
<p>If so, reserve vesicles chained to reluctant readily releasable vesicles would advance to the release site more slowly during continuous stimulation than reserve vesicles chained to fast-releasing vesicles because the reluctant vesicles would undergo exocytosis less frequently. As a direct consequence, reserves chained to reluctant vesicles would be mobilized more slowly and would behave as if constituting a slowly mobilized pool. Reserves chained to fast-releasing vesicles would be mobilized more quickly, and would be processed in parallel. In sum, the combination of two unrelated evidence-based premises of our working model predict the fully parallel arrangement outlined in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>.</p>
<p>Key for testing this idea: Distinctions between reserve pools would only emerge when the frequency of stimulation is low enough that individual reluctant vesicles remain within the readily releasable pool for extended periods of time before undergoing exocytosis. The reasoning is described in the Results section, where needed to explain the design of key experiments.</p>
<p>Here we begin by con<italic>fi</italic>rming that reserve vesicles at hippocampal synapses are segregated into multiple pools that can be distinguished by the timing of mobilization during low frequency stimulation. We then show that quickly and slowly mobilized reserves do not intermix, even when the frequency of stimulation is high, con<italic>fi</italic>rming that the two types are processed in parallel. The result provides a simplifying new constraint on the dynamics of vesicle recycling within presynaptic terminals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Results</title>
<p>We originally developed our working model to account for results from both primary cell culture and <italic>ex vivo</italic> slices (Stevens and Wesseling, 1999b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Garcia-Perez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gabriel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mahfooz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Raja et al., 2019</xref>). We chose to use cell cultures for testing the prediction that quickly and slowly mobilized reserve pools are processed in parallel because cultures are better suited for staining and destaining synaptic vesicles with FM-dyes, which can be used to distinguish between reserve pools as shown below.</p>
<p>In a <italic>fi</italic>rst set of experiments, diagrammed atop <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, we began by staining vesicles within presynaptic terminals with 60 s of 20 Hz electrical stimulation (1200 pulses) during extracellular bath application of FM4-64. We then removed the FM4-64 and washed with Advasep-7 or Captisol, which are closely related <italic>β</italic>-cyclodextrins that facilitate dye clearance from membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kay et al., 1999</xref>). The stain followed by wash procedure is thought to leave dye within nearly all of the vesicles that can recycle, and eliminate dye bound to non-vesicular membrane that would cause background <italic>fl</italic>uorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Betz et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ryan and Smith, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gaffield and Betz, 2006</xref>). The vesicles then retain the dye until undergoing exocytosis, after which they likely destain completely as the dye is washed away into the extracellular space (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–Figure Supplement 2</xref>). Because of this, the time course of bulk destaining during subsequent stimulation is likely a straightforward measure of mobilization of the vesicles that are stained and avoids complications caused by ongoing pool replenishment that are inherent to electrophysiology and synaptopHluorin imaging techniques.</p>

</fig>
<p>To asses the timing during low frequency stimulation, we monitored destaining while stimulating at 1 Hz for 25 min (1500 pulses; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>, blue). After a 4 min rest interval (black), we completed destaining to a low level with 100 s of 20 Hz stimulation (2000 pulses, red; see also <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>–Figure Supplement 2). The time courses were quanti<italic>fi</italic>ed as the median <italic>fl</italic>uorescence intensity of punctal regions of interest (ROIs; see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>–Figure Supplement 3) after subtracting the signal remaining after the <italic>fi</italic>nal 20 Hz train; the measurement is denoted <italic>F</italic> /<italic>F</italic> (0) in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>. Destaining time courses were only accepted for subsequent analysis when baseline <italic>fl</italic>uorescence loss was ≤ 1.5 %/min, but the time courses were not corrected for the small amount that occurred in some experiments; baseline loss could have been caused by multiple factors including spontaneous exocytosis, but likely not by photobleaching (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>–Figure Supplement 4).</p>
<p>The time courses that we measured while stimulating at 1 Hz were not compatible with single pool models or with models with multiple pools where vesicles intermix freely. That is, models where vesicles mix freely would predict that destaining at any point in time would be a constant fraction of the amount of stain still present at that time, meaning:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="251975v4_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>dF</italic> (<italic>t</italic>)/<italic>dt</italic> is the rate of change in <italic>fl</italic>uorescence intensity at time <italic>t</italic>, <italic>F</italic> (<italic>t</italic>) is the <italic>fl</italic>uorescence intensity at the same time, and <italic>k</italic> - the rate of <italic>fractional destaining</italic> - is constant over time.</p>
<p>The rate of fractional destaining was not constant, however, but decreased greatly over the 25 min. To quantify this, we estimated the rate at a variety of time points by dividing the rate of <italic>fl</italic>uorescent decay (<italic>dF</italic> (<italic>t</italic>)/<italic>dt</italic>) over short intervals (slopes of the magenta lines in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) by the corresponding <italic>fl</italic>uorescence intensities (<italic>F</italic> (<italic>t</italic>)) at the beginning of the intervals (green dots). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel, shows that fractional destaining decreased from 0.087 ± 0.004 min<sup>−1</sup> (mean ± s.e.m.) during the <italic>fi</italic>rst 1.5 min of 1 Hz stimulation to 0.032 ± 0.003 min<sup>−1</sup> during the interval between minutes 21 and 25, which is by a factor of 2.7 ± 0.1; i.e., fractional destaining was 2.7-<italic>fold</italic> greater at the beginning of the 1 Hz train than at the end.</p>
<p>Further analysis showed that the decrease in fractional destaining was not caused by technical errors related to baseline <italic>fl</italic>uorescence loss seen in some preparations, or by <italic>fl</italic>aws in the premise that the <italic>fi</italic>nal 20 Hz train fully destains all recycling vesicles. Speci<italic>fi</italic>cally, correcting for the baseline <italic>fl</italic>uorescence loss increased the estimate of the decrease in fractional destaining to a factor of 4.4 ± 0.4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel) because the correction decreased the estimate of fractional destaining for later intervals (e.g., minutes 21 - 25) by more than for earlier intervals (e.g., minutes 0 - 1.5). Likewise, correcting for any error in the premise that the <italic>fi</italic>nal 20 Hz train eliminated dye from all recycling vesicles could increase the factor even more, although any correction of this sort would be small.</p>
<p>A higher resolution analysis showed that deviations from Eqn 1 occurred at almost all individual ROIs, despite variation between individuals in the details (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>–Figure Supplement 6; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Waters and Smith, 2002</xref>). That is, measurement noise prevented applying the analysis in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-C</xref> to some of the individuals. However, Eqn 1 is mathematically equivalent to the single exponential decay:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">

</disp-formula>
where <italic>F</italic> (0) is the <italic>fl</italic>uorescence intensity at the start. And, the best <italic>fi</italic>tting version of Eqn 2 for each individual could be compared to the full time course of each, acquired during the full 25 min of 1 Hz stimulation; the best <italic>fi</italic>tting version was obtained by allowing <italic>k</italic> to vary freely between the individuals (see Methods and Materials). Systematic quanti<italic>fi</italic>cation of deviations from the best <italic>fi</italic>t - termed <italic>residuals</italic> - allowed a higher resolution analysis because the full time courses consisted of more data points than the short intervals used to calculate fractional destaining in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, making them less sensitive to measurement noise (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>–Figure Supplement 7 for methodology). Statistically signi<italic>fi</italic>cant deviations of <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05 were detected for <italic>&gt;</italic>90 % of individuals (5638 of 6252) in a non-parametric analysis of the residuals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>); see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> for the analogous analysis at the level of preparations.</p>
<p>Even so, the <italic>fl</italic>uorescence signal within some ROIs likely arose from multiple synapses. To con<italic>fi</italic>rm that the decrease in fractional destaining seen in populations was caused by decreases at individual synapses, we conducted additional experiments on lower density cultures where individual punctae that are clearly separated from neighbors are thought to correspond to single synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Darcy et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Deviations from models where vesicles mix freely were clearly apparent at many of the punctae. For example, each of the punctae indicated by magenta arrows in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> destained about 50 % during the <italic>fi</italic>rst 5 min of 1 Hz stimulation, but then only a small amount over the following 20 min, whereas Eqn 2 would predict nearly complete destaining. Overall, decreases in fractional destaining were measured for 83 % of 235 punctae from 8 preparations, which is similar to the <italic>&gt;</italic>90 % of individual ROIs that deviated from Eqn 2 in the denser standard cultures. The amount of decrease was equivalent as well (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>); median fractional destaining decreased from 0.095 min<sup>−1</sup> (95 % CI [0.081, 0.12]) during during the <italic>fi</italic>rst two minutes of 1 Hz stimulation to 0.032 min<sup>−1</sup> (95 % CI [0.028, 0.037]) in the interval between minutes 10 and 20 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-D</xref>), which is the same factor of 2.7 (95 % CI [2.1, 3.0]) seen for standard cultures. Measurement noise contributed to uncertainty in individual fractional destaining values but would not bias the median values in either direction and, if anything, would cause an underestimate of the number of punctae where the rate of fractional destaining decreased. ∼40 % of punctae were excluded from the analysis because the linear <italic>fi</italic>t of the baseline was &gt; ± 1.5 %/min. The criterion was included to match the analysis of standard cultures, but dispro-portionately excluded individuals with low signal/noise, which might correspond to synapses that were lightly stained because of small vesicle clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Schikorski and Stevens, 1997</xref>). However: (1) equivalent decreases in fractional destaining were clearly apparent at many lightly stained punctae (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>–Figure Supplement 1); (2) fractional destaining of the mean time course of the excluded punctae decreased by an equivalent amount during 1 Hz stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, yellow circles); and (3) an analysis of residuals after <italic>fi</italic>tting with Eqn 2 as in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-E</xref> continued to yield statistically signi<italic>fi</italic>cant deviations in 67 % of the most lightly stained quintile (i.e., 54 of the 81 least stained). Taken together, the results argue strongly against the speci<italic>fi</italic>c concern that decreases in fractional destaining seen in the population measurements in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> might have been caused by variation among individuals rather than decreases at individual synapses.</p>

<p>Most individual ROIs, isolated punctae, and the collective behavior of populations could be <italic>fi</italic>t with the weighted sum of two exponentials (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>–Figure Supplement 8), although weighted sums of three or more exponentials and a variety of other functions could not be excluded. The result is consistent with models containing two or more reserve pools where the decreases in fractional destaining during 1 Hz stimulation would be caused by selective decrease in the number of stained vesicles in reserve pools that are mobilized quickly, leaving the remaining dye predominantly trapped in vesicles that are mobilized slowly. Box 1 illustrates this point with a scheme where the reserve pools operate in parallel. Additional experiments described below were required to rule out a serial organization and other explanations that do not involve multiple reserve pools at all.</p>

<title>No recovery of fractional destaining during rest intervals</title>
<p>A key point is that mixing between the reserve pools would have to be slow during 1 Hz stimulation, if it occurs at all. Otherwise, mixing would have caused the stained vesicles in quickly and slowly mobilized reserve pools to equilibrate over the 25 min of 1 Hz stimulation, preventing the decreases in fractional destaining.</p>
<p>To test this, we loaded standard cultures with FM4-64 as above, then stimulated at 1 Hz for only 4 min, which was enough to decrease fractional destaining to an intermediate level (compare 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> bars of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). We then allowed the synapses to rest for 1, 3, or 8 min before resuming 1 Hz stimulation, followed by nearly complete destaining at 20 Hz, as diagrammed atop <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>. Fractional destaining during the second 1 Hz train continued to be decreased after the rest intervals, with no indication of recovery, con<italic>fi</italic>rming that the decreases in fractional destaining induced by 1 Hz stimulation are long-lasting, at least on the time scale of minutes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B,C</xref>).

<title>Evidence against selective depletion of dye from readily releasable pools</title>
<p>One alternative to multiple reserve pools was the possibility that the decrease in fractional destaining during 1 Hz stimulation was caused by selective dye loss from readily releasable pools. Selective dye loss from readily releasable pools without multiple reserve pools seemed unlikely because spontaneous mixing between readily releasable and reserve pools is thought to occur on the order of one minute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Murthy and Stevens, 1999</xref>), which is fast compared to the destaining time course during 1 Hz stimulation (i.e., <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, readily releasable pools consist of an average of only 5-7 vesicles per synapse whereas the reserve pool or pools is/are thought to consist of 35-50 vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Murthy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Harata et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, readily releasable pools would only make up 15-20 % of the total recycling pool, which is substantially less than the weighting value of 0.39 for the faster of the two component exponentials in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>–Figure Supplement 8.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to test the possibility that the faster component of destaining was caused by selective depletion of readily releasable pools, we stained synapses as above with FM4-64, but this time destained <italic>fi</italic>rst with a 20 Hz train of 80 pulses followed immediately by 25 min of 1 Hz stimulation (diagram atop <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).

<p>In principle, low frequency stimulation can induce long-term depression in presynaptic function that might cause fractional destaining to decrease even if there were only a single reserve pool.

<p>The absence of long-term depression in vGlut1-synaptopHluorin <italic>fl</italic>uorescence is compatible with the decrease in fractional destaining measured with FM4-64 because, unlike FM4-64, synap-topHluorin does not disassociate from vesicle membranes after exocytosis and therefore tracks presynaptic function through multiple rounds of exo/endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Miesenböck, 2012</xref>). Instead, the result argues against long-term presynaptic depression as a cause for the decrease in fractional destaining measured with FM4-64. We note, however, that the result does not contradict previous reports of presynaptic long-term depression where induction required postsynaptic depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Goda and Stevens, 1996</xref>) because postsynaptic depolarization was likely prevented in the present study by glutamate receptor antagonists.</p>

<title>Long-lasting switch to kiss and run</title>
<p>Alternatively, fractional destaining might decrease if endo-cytosis switched from the standard mode to a faster <italic>kiss-and-run</italic> mode, which sometimes is too fast to allow complete clearance of FM4-64 from the membrane of individual vesicles, at least in the absence of a <italic>β</italic>-cyclodextrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Klingauf et al., 1998</xref>). This explanation seemed unlikely because the switch in timing of endocytosis would have to persist for minutes during rest intervals to account for the results in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. Nevertheless, to test this, we conducted experiments similar to those documented in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, except using the FM2-10 dye, which dissociates from membranes more quickly following exocytosis than FM4-64, allowing faster clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Klingauf et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the faster clearance, the decrease in fractional destaining of the bulk signal during 1 Hz stimulation was not altered (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, compare blue circles to green rectangles).

<title>Faster destaining when staining is induced with low frequency stimulation</title>
<p>We began by reasoning that vesicles reconstituted from recycled membrane during 1 Hz stimulation would have to be predominantly targeted back to the quickly mobilized reserve pool. Otherwise, targeting to the slowly mobilized reserve pool would have displaced already stained vesicles from the slowly to the quickly mobilized reserve pool, which would have prevented the decreases in fractional destaining seen above. To test this, we stained vesicles during stimulation with 240 or 1200 pulses at 20 Hz or 240 pulses at 1 Hz in interleaved experiments. We then compared fractional destaining during subsequent 1 Hz stimulation, as diagrammed in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>.</p>

<p>Fractional destaining was greater when vesicle recycling had been driven by 1 Hz stimulation during the staining phase (compare bar c to a and b in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>), as expected if a larger fraction of the stained vesicles were targeted to a quickly mobilized reserve pool. Follow-on experiments then showed that 240 pulses at 20 Hz and at 1 Hz stained synapses to equivalent levels (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>– Figure Supplement 2), indicating that the greater fractional destaining seen after selectively staining vesicles that recycle during 1 Hz stimulation was not because fewer vesicles had been stained. These results suggest that vesicles reconstituted from membrane that is recycled during ongoing 1 Hz stimulation are targeted predominantly to a quickly mobilized reserve pool. In contrast, vesicles reconstituted during 20 Hz stimulation are targeted to both quickly and slowly mobilized reserve pools.</p>

<title>Two color staining of separate reserve pools distinguished by mobilization timing</title>
<p>The information allowed us to design a method to stain quickly and slowly mobilized reserve pools with distinct colors, and then track the mobilization separately (diagram atop <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). To achieve this, we <italic>fi</italic>rst stained all recycling vesicles with FM4-64 (red) using the standard 60 s of 20 Hz stimulation, then partly destained with 1 Hz stimulation for 10 min. We reasoned that 1 Hz for 10 min would nearly completely destain any quickly mobilized reserve pool because it was enough to drive fractional destaining to close to the minimum value (e.g., <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). We then partly re-stained the synapses with FM1-43 (green) by stimulating at 1 Hz, which would predominantly re-stain quickly mobilized reserves based on the results in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>. For the second staining phase, we chose a duration of 5 min, which was calculated from experiments in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> so that the number of vesicles stained with green dye would be similar to the number, stained in red, remaining from the <italic>fi</italic>rst staining phase.

<p>These results show that reserve synaptic vesicles are segregated into at least two pools that can be distinguished by the timing of mobilization during 1 Hz stimulation. The one remaining caveat is that the results so far do not rule out <italic>last-in/first-out</italic> models where reserve vesicles are stored in a single pool with constituents that inter-mix slowly, if at all, during 1 Hz stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rizzoli and Betz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kamin et al., 2010</xref>; see <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>–Figure Supplement 1).

<title>Parallel mobilization</title>
<p>The results above did not determine whether quickly and slowly mobilized reserves are processed in series or in parallel. To distinguish between serial and parallel, we begin by showing that decreases in fractional destaining seen when stimulation is 1 Hz are absent when stimulation is 20 Hz (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A</xref>; compare bars b-d in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10C</xref>).

<p>The result does not, by itself, rule out serial models where the absence of decreases in fractional destaining is explained by mixing mechanisms that are activated during 20 Hz stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hilfiker et al., 1999</xref>). However, 25 min of 1 Hz stimulation had no impact on the timing of destaining when subsequent stimulation was 20 Hz (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B</xref>; compare bars f, g to bars b, c in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10C</xref>). The absence of a large impact was striking because fractional destaining would have been decreased by a factor of ∼4 if measured instead during 1 Hz stimulation (e.g., <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). This result shows that the mixing mechanisms would have to be potent enough to fully mix quickly and slowly mobilized reserves within seconds of the onset of 20 Hz stimulation. Otherwise, the time course of destaining during 20 Hz stimulation would have been shifted rightwards when initiated after 1 Hz trains that had already selectively destained the quickly mobilized reserve vesicles, which was not observed (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10D</xref>). To our knowledge, no mixing mechanisms that operate quickly enough have been proposed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to test for a mixing mechanism in a way that avoids assumptions about timing, we <italic>fi</italic>rst: (1) con<italic>fi</italic>rmed that the large decrease in fractional destaining seen during 10 min of 1 Hz stimulation persists for at least 3 min during subsequent rest intervals (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A</xref>, compare inset a vs b); whereas (2) equivalent destaining with 20 Hz stimulation did not alter subsequent fractional destaining (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B</xref>, compare inset c to a vs b; quanti<italic>fi</italic>ed in <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11C</xref>).

<p>Fractional destaining caused by the 20 Hz stimulation was not altered by the preceding 1 Hz stimulation (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>–Figure Supplement 2), con<italic>fi</italic>rming that the 20 Hz stimulation would have had to have fully activated any mixing mechanism. Despite this, fractional destaining measured during the second 1 Hz train remained reduced, with no indication of any recovery (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11E</xref>). This combination of results rules out activity-dependent mixing between quickly and slowly mobilized reserves, and, as a consequence, rules out serial models not already eliminated by the results in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>-<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>.</p>
<p>In contrast, the parallel models described by <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and in Box 2 do predict the absence of recovery in fractional destaining because the mechanism that causes the decrease during 1 Hz stimulation - i.e., selective depletion of dye from the quickly mobilized reserve - would quickly become fully relevant again as soon as the readily releasable pool had been replenished (i.e., within tens of seconds; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Stevens and Wesseling, 1998</xref>).

<title>Mixing continues to be slow/absent near body temperature</title>
<p>The experiments above were conducted at room temperature and there is evidence that vesicles in the interiors of synaptic terminals are more motile at body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Westphal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kamin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Park et al., 2012</xref>). It is not known if the motility is related to ratelimiting steps in synaptic vesicle tra<italic>ffi</italic>cking that would in<italic>fl</italic>uence the timing of mobilization. However, the decrease in fractional destaining during 1 Hz stimulation (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12A</xref>), and the absence of mixing during rest intervals (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>–Figure Supplement 1), were both preserved at 35 C. Moreover, the time course of destaining during 25 min of 1 Hz stimulation was well <italic>fi</italic>t with the weighted sum of two exponentials (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12B</xref>), like at room temperature, and the quickly mobilized component contributed the same 39 % (compare to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>–Figure Supplement 8). This result suggests that the contents of quickly and slowly mobilized reserve pools are not altered by increasing the temperature. Unsurprisingly, the time constants of the two components were both less than at room temperature, consistent with faster vesicular recruitment from reserve to readily releasable pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Garcia-Perez et al., 2008</xref>). The temperature results are not directly relevant to whether quickly and slowly mobilized reserves are processed in series or parallel, but may be relevant to the ongoing debate about the relationship between reluctant readily releasable vesicles and asynchronous release because asynchronous release is eliminated at 35 C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Huson et al., 2019</xref>; see Discussion).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Synaptic vesicle tra<italic>ffi</italic>cking in presynaptic terminals is central to brain function and is an increasingly important target of anti-epilepsy medicines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lyseng-Williamson, 2011</xref>). A more detailed understanding might generate insight into the <italic>fi</italic>rst principles underlying biological computation, and might aid second generation drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">García-Pérez et al., 2015</xref>). Here we show that quickly and slowly mobilized reserve pools of vesicles are present in hippocampal synapses, and that the two types are processed in parallel, rather than in series as previously assumed.</p>
<p>The experiments were designed to test predictions that distinguish our working model from current concepts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The model emerged from two separate lines of evidence. The <italic>fi</italic>rst line argued against the concept that mass action of reserve vesicles in<italic>fl</italic>uences the timing of vesicle recruitment to the readily releasable pool (Stevens and Wesseling, 1999b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Garcia-Perez et al., 2008</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Miki et al., 2020</xref> for a recent complementary type of evidence), while simultaneously supporting the often-linked concept that depletion of reserve pools is one of the mechanisms that causes short-term synaptic depression during extensive stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gabriel et al., 2011</xref>). The second line supported the concept that fast- and reluctantly-releasing readily releasable vesicles differ because they are docked to distinct types of release sites rather than because they are at distinct stages of biochemical priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wesseling and Lo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Garcia-Perez and Wesseling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mahfooz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Raja et al., 2019</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Böhme et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akbergenova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Maschi and Klyachko, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Karlocai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gou et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of current study do provide new support for our working model because: (1) the opposite conclusion - that reserves are processed in series as widely assumed - would have caused us to discard the model; and (2) no competing parallel model has yet been proposed. We emphasize, however, that the main conclusion that quickly and slowly mobilized reserve vesicles are processed in parallel does not depend on either of the lines of evidence that motivated our working model, or on the model itself, and the evidence against serial models would continue to be equally strong even if doubts arose about the previous conclusions.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Absence of mixing</title>
<p>Notably, our working model contains a slow undocking mechanism operating continuously at ∼1 /min that would have been consistent with slow mixing between quickly and slowly mobilized reserves if the undocked chains of vesicles were to mix freely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gabriel et al., 2011</xref>). Because of this, the model did not anticipate the complete absence of recovery in fractional destaining over 8 min-long rest intervals in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. However, the absence of mixing does not argue against the model (see Appendix 1) because chains of vesicles might be attached to a stable cytoskeletal scaffold that would be preserved after undocking, or might reside within a liquid phase gel that prevents intermixing (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Siksou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fernández-Busnadiego et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cole et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Milovanovic et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<title>Relationship to a deep reserve</title>

And indeed, the present results only pertain to vesicles mobilized during 60 s of 20 Hz stimulation, whereas many vesicles within hippocampal presynaptic terminals are mobilized much more slowly, if at all during this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Harata et al., 2001</xref>).

<title>Relation to multiple classes of vesicles</title>
<p>The experiments in the present study were designed to measure vesicle exocytosis involved in action potential evoked release, whereas transmitter released spontaneously is thought to be stored in a different class of vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kavalali, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The present results are consistent with the possibility that the decision about whether a recycling vesicle will become reluctant or fast-releasing upon entering the readily releasable pool is made earlier, at the time of entry into the reserve pool. Alternatively, the parallel mobilization of slow and fast reserves might be analogous to current ideas about parallel cycling of vesicles involved in spontaneous release, which would then require multiple classes of vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Raingo et al., 2012</xref>). However, adding the concept of multiple classes of vesicles could not replace the requirement for multiple classes of release sites because, otherwise, the readily releasable pool would eventually <italic>fi</italic>ll with reluctantly releasable vesicles during low frequency stimulation, causing long-lasting depression, which was not seen (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>); long-lasting depression is ruled out in a second way in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> where destaining was faster - not slower - when the staining phase of the experiments included long trains of 1 Hz stimulation.</p>

<title>Multiplexed frequency filtering</title>
<p>Finally, our working model explains slowly mobilized reserves as a logical consequence of multiple classes of release sites, with no functional signi<italic>fi</italic>cance of their own. However, we anticipate that the variation among synapses in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>–Figure Supplement 6 and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>–Figure Supplement 2 will nevertheless be relevant for understanding biological computation.</p>
<p>That is, ine<italic>ffi</italic>cient release sites that engender reluctantly releasable components of the readily releasable pool would function as high-pass/low-cut frequency <italic>fi</italic>lters when transmitting information encoded within presynaptic spike trains, whereas e<italic>ffi</italic>cient release sites engendering fast-releasing components would function as low-pass/high-cut <italic>fi</italic>lters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mahfooz et al., 2016</xref>). The presence of multiple types of release sites might therefore endow individual synapses with a mechanism for selectively transmitting multiple types of frequency information, analogous to <italic>multiplexing</italic> in digital information technology. The variation among synapses in the time course of changes in fractional destaining observed here during low frequency stimulation suggests that individual synapses <italic>in vivo</italic> likely contain machinery for modulating multiplexing. If so, this machinery would have the capacity to store substantially more information than mechanisms that always affect synaptic connection strength evident during low frequency use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bartol et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, we previously observed extensive variation between calyx of Held synapses in the ratio of fast-releasing to reluctant readily releasable vesicles, which, when taken together with the present results, suggests that mechanisms for modulating multiplexing might be available at a wide range of synapse types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mahfooz et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<p>Time lapse images were aligned and Regions of Interest (ROIs) identi<italic>fi</italic>ed automatically as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Raja et al. (2019)</xref> (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>–Figure Supplement 3), except for <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> where they were detected manually. Between 175 and 1773 ROIs were detected for each <italic>fi</italic>eld of view (except for <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). For summary statistics, the median values from a single <italic>fi</italic>eld of view/experiment were counted as n = 1 unless otherwise indicated.</p>

<title>Normalization</title>
<p>For comparing images across preparations - or between individual punctae for <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> - median or individual ROI values were: divided by the mean value of the background region and then normalized by the baseline signal.</p>

<title>Destaining time courses 1t with working model in Figure 1D</title>
<p>Parameter values speci<italic>fi</italic>ed by the results from the original electrophysiological experiments - see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gabriel et al. (2011)</xref> - were the length of docked and undocked <italic>tethering units</italic> (4 vesicles, including the readily releasable vesicle when docked), the timing of recruitment of a vesicle from a docked tether unit to the release site when vacant (0.13 s<sup>-1</sup> at rest, accelerating to 0.22 s<sup>-1</sup> during 20 Hz stimulation - alpha in the Matlab code below), and the timing with which tethering units are replaced (0.017 s<sup>-1</sup> at rest, accelerating to 0.025 s<sup>-1</sup> during 20 Hz stimulation - gamma in Matlab code). However, the original results only speci<italic>fi</italic>ed parameters that are rate-limiting for neurotransmitter release during intense stimulation, and there were a variety of additional parameters - relevant to vesicle tra<italic>ffi</italic>cking, but not rate-limiting for release - that were relevant to FM-dye destaining, especially during low frequency stimulation.</p>

<p>The most relevant additional parameters pertained to the release sites and included: (1) the number of types of release sites; (2) the probability with which each type catalyzes exocytosis after single action potentials (i.e., <italic>prs</italic> for p<italic>robability of release</italic> for the r<italic>elease</italic> s<italic>ite</italic> when occupied by a readily releasable vesicle, which is equivalent to <italic>pu,hi</italic> and <italic>pu,lo</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mahfooz et al., 2016</xref>, except with the possibility for more than two types of release sites); and, (3) the relative amount of each type.</p>
<p>In addition, we <italic>fi</italic>xed the number of non-docked tethering units that can exchange with each docked unit at 1, meaning that each release site would process vesicles from two tethering units (8 vesicles). The value was chosen because depletion of the readily releasable pool destained synapses by slightly more than 1/8 (0.15 ± 0.01 in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This implies that a typical synapse with 7 release sites would contain 7 × 8 = 56 recycling vesicles, which is in-line with results in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ryan et al. (1997)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Harata et al. (2001)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Schikorski and Stevens (2001)</xref>. Next, for <italic>fi</italic>tting destaining during 20 Hz stimulation, it was necessary to allow <italic>&gt;</italic>5-fold facilitation, at least for the release sites with the lowest values for <italic>prs</italic>, because otherwise 20 Hz stimulation would not exhaust the readily releasable pool: exhaustion during 20 Hz stimulation is veri<italic>fi</italic>ed experimentally in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Garcia-Perez et al. (2008)</xref>; and <italic>&gt;</italic>5-fold facilitation is veri<italic>fi</italic>ed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> of Stevens and Wesseling (1999a). We had facilitation increase with a single exponential with rate parameter of 30 action potentials to maintain consistency with <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> of Stevens and Wesseling (1999a), but the precise timing was not a key factor because of the <italic>fl</italic>exibility provided by the three release site parameters.</p>
<p>Finally, we reasoned that previously docked tethering units would need to have the capacity to re-dock to the same release site. Otherwise: Either a large number of dye-stained vesicles would be trapped within synaptic terminals during long trains of low frequency stimulation; or quickly and slowly mobilized reserves would mix on the time course of minutes. A large number of trapped vesicles is ruled out in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and elsewhere, and mixing is ruled out in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>FM-dye destaining curves (Appendix 1 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) could be well <italic>fi</italic>t by including as few as two types of release sites, but at least three types were required to match additionally the short-term depression seen in synaptic strength during 20 Hz stimulation (Appendix 1 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>Electrophysiological recordings of synaptic responses between pairs of neurons in culture during 6 s of 20 Hz stimulation, and corresponding simulation using the model in Appendix 1 Figure 1 (magenta line) The electrophysiological trace is the average across 11 pairs, including the pairs that constituted the untreated wildtype control in Figure 5 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">García-Pérez et al.

Outer scale bars pertain to the entire trace and are 500 pA by 1 s; inner bars pertain to the inset and are 500 pA by 50 ms. Responses were quanti<italic>fi</italic>ed by integrating each 50 ms interval after subtracting the baseline before the <italic>fi</italic>rst response (dashed cyan line), so that later responses included a substantial component caused by asynchronous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hagler and Goda, 2001</xref>). Results for each cell pair were normalized by the sum of the <italic>fi</italic>rst 40 responses (2 s) before combining across cell pairs; we normalized this way because of extreme variation between cell pairs in the short-term plasticity seen during the <italic>fi</italic>rst few responses - the paired pulse ratio of the <italic>fi</italic>rst two responses varied from 1.27 to 0.64 - and because 40 responses has been used elsewhere to approximate readily-releasable pool size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Murthy and Stevens, 1999</xref>); the 80 responses to trains designed to ensure exhaustion above would be an overestimate because of ongoing recruitment to vacant release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wesseling and Lo, 2002</xref>).</p></caption>

<caption><p>Synapses were stained with 60 s of 20 Hz electrical stimulation in the presence of FM4-64 or FM2-10, washed, and then destained with 100 s of 20 Hz stimulation in the presence or absence of Captisol as diagrammed above plot to the left. The plot to the right is the semi-log plot of the same destaining time course. This experiment shows that Captisol accelerated destaining of FM4-64, but no additional acceleration was seen when the dye was FM2-10, which dissociates from membranes 30-fold faster. The result indicates that FM4-64 is cleared completely from vesicular membrane after a single round of exocytosis in the presence of Captisol.</p></caption>

<caption><p>Analysis of FM4-64 signal remaining after 20 Hz stimulation for 100 s. (A) Unlike elsewhere throughout this report, the remaining signal was not subtracted before normalizing; the value of zero indicates the background signal from non-neuronal areas of the cell culture that did not destain during electrical stimulation. The plots show that 100 s of 20 Hz stimulation likely does not completely destain all recycling vesicles because a small amount of additional destaining could be induced with additional 20 Hz stimulation (b and e). The amount was similar when the additional stimulation was initiated after 3.3 min or after 15.3 min of rest (b vs e in bar graph). And, destaining during a third train (c) was even less (*** is <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001, paired t-test). (B) Overlay of destaining time course of second 20 Hz trains begun either 3.3 min after the <italic>fi</italic>rst train (i.e., b), or 15.3 min after (e). Unlike for Panel A the remaining signal was subtracted, and both time courses were re-normalized so that the baseline was 1.0. The plot shows that the two time courses were similar, indicating that 12 min of additional rest did not alter the time course of destaining.

<caption><p>Graphical user interface for semi-automatic ROI detection. A value for contrast for each 2X2 pixel region of each image was calculated by subtracting the mean value of surrounding pixels from the mean value of the pixels within the region. Regions were then sorted by the change in contrast during the experiment, and regions overlapping with regions with greater change in contrast were eliminated. A threshold for the minimum change in contrast for consideration as a region of interest (ROI) was then set subjectively using the upper horizontal scroll bar beneath the image within the graphical user interface. The image is the difference calculated by subtracting the mean of destained images from the mean of images before destaining.

<p>This study addresses the long-standing question as to how different functional pools of synaptic vesicles are organized in presynaptic terminals to mediate different modes of neurotransmitter release. Based on imaging of active synapses with recycling synaptic vesicles labeled by FM-styryl dyes, the authors provide data that are compatible with the hypothesis that two separate reserve pools of vesicles – slowly vs. rapidly mobilizing – feed two distinct releasable pools – reluctantly vs. rapidly releasing. Overall, this study represents a <bold>valuable</bold> contribution to the field of synapse biology, specifically to presynaptic dynamics and plasticity. The authors' methodological approach of using bulk FM-styryl dye destaining as a readout of precise vesicle arrangements and pools in a population of functionally very diverse synapses has limitations. Consequently, the evidence that directly supports the authors' two-pool-interpretation of their data is <bold>incomplete</bold>, and alternative interpretations of the data remain possible.</p>

<p>This study is concerned with the general question as to how pools of synaptic vesicles are organized in presynaptic terminals to support different types of transmitter release, such as fast synchronous and asynchronous release. To address this issue, the authors employed the classical method of loading synaptic vesicle membranes with FM-styryl dyes and assessing dye destaining during repetitive synapse stimulation by live imaging as a readout of the mobilization of vesicles for fusion. Among other findings, the authors provide evidence indicating that there are multiple reserve vesicle pools, that quickly and slowly mobilized reserves do not mix, and that vesicle fusion does not follow a mono-exponential time course, leading to the notion that two separate reserve pools of vesicles - slowly vs. rapidly mobilizing - feed two distinct releasable pools - reluctantly vs. rapidly releasing. These findings are valuable to the field of synapse biology, where the organization of synaptic vesicle pools that support synaptic transmission in different temporal and stimulation regimes has been a focus of intense experimentation and discussion for more than two decades.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the present study has limitations, so that the authors' key conclusions remain incompletely supported by the data, and alternative interpretations of the data remain possible. The approach of using bulk FM-styryl dye destaining as a readout of precise vesicle arrangements and pools in a population of functionally very diverse synapses bears problems. In essence, the approach is 'blind' to many additional processes and confounding factors that operate in the background, from other forms of release to inter-synaptic vesicle exchange. Further, averaging signals over many - functionally very diverse - synapses makes it difficult to distinguish the dynamics of separate vesicle pools within single synapses from a scenario where different kinetics of release originate from different types of synapses with different release probabilities.</p>
<p>The reviewers commented on the revised version of your paper, in essence reiterating the limitations of the approach of bulk imaging of FM de-staining:</p>
<p>(1) The authors sincerely addressed many of the previous concerns, mainly by clarification. The data are consistent with the authors' hypothesis. The pool concept is somewhat similar to that of Richards et al (2000) and Rey et al (2015). The authors further propose that two reserve pools feed vesicles to two readily-releasable pools independently. Unfortunately, the heterogeneity among individual synapses remains a concern as shown in (some of) the raw data (Fig. 3 and supplements). Bulk imaging of FM de-staining does not really measure the fraction of non-stained vesicles, which changes dynamically during stimulation, so that the situation calls for an independent readout of stained and non-stained vesicles. Moreover, direct correspondence between two specific stimulation frequencies (with long stimulation) and vesicle pools is not straightforward. These issues make the experimentally measured pools not well-defined.</p>
<p>(2) The authors' latest round of responses did not alleviate most of my major previous concerns. The additional data now shown in Fig 3 rely on conceptually the same type of bulk measurements and thus suffer from the same limitations as outlined in the earlier review. Moreover, the image of neuronal cultures shown in Fig. 3 might be problematic. It shows very bright staining with large round lumps, which may be indicative of unhealthy cultures.</p>

<p>This study is concerned with the general question as to how pools of synaptic vesicles are organized in presynaptic terminals to support different types of transmitter release, such as fast synchronous and asynchronous release. To address this issue, the authors employed the classical method of load- ing synaptic vesicle membranes with FM-styryl dyes and assessing dye destaining during repetitive synapse stimulation by live imaging as a readout of the mobilization of vesicles for fusion. Among other 1ndings, the authors provide evidence indicating that there are multiple reserve vesicle pools, that quickly and slowly mobilized reserves do not mix, and that vesicle fusion does not follow a mono-exponential time course, leading to the notion that two separate reserve pools of vesicles - slowly vs. rapidly mobilizing - feed two distinct releasable pools - reluctantly vs. rapidly releasing. These 1ndings are valuable to the 1eld of synapse biology, where the organization of synaptic vesicle pools that support synaptic transmission in different temporal and stimulation regimes has been a focus of intense experimentation and discussion for more than two decades.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the present study has limitations, so that the authors’ key conclusions remain incompletely supported by the data, and alternative interpretations of the data remain possible. The approach of using bulk FM-styryl dye destaining as a readout of precise vesicle arrangements and pools in a population of functionally very diverse synapses bears problems. In essence, the approach is ’blind’ to many additional processes and confounding factors that operate in the back- ground, from other forms of release to inter-synaptic vesicle exchange. Further, averaging signals over many - functionally very diverse - synapses makes it diicult to distinguish the dynamics of separate vesicle pools within single synapses from a scenario where different kinetics of release originate from different types of synapses with different release probabilities.</p>

<p>We thank the editors and reviewers for their time and patience, and are happy that they found our results valuable.</p>
<p>We do not have a clear understanding of what the alternative interpretations might be - beyond those already addressed - but would like to. At present, we believe that the evidence for parallel processing of slowly and quickly mobilized reserve vesicles is solid and hope that people who are open to the possibility will evaluate the reasoning described within our report. The hypothesis that reserves are kept separate because they feed distinct subdivisions of the readily releasable pool remains to be tested.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we have used FM-dye de-staining as a bulk measurement of sub-synaptic events in the sense that we have made no attempt to measure mobilization of isolated individual vesicles. We do not see how this necessarily leaves viable alternative interpretations, but this is diZcult to evaluate without knowing what the alternatives might be. On the other hand, the FM-dye technique has had good resolution at the level of distinguishing between individual synapses since at least Murthy et al. (2001). For our part, we are con1dent that our analysis in Figure 3 combined with the results in Figures 4-11 shows that the multiple reserve pools co-occur in many individual presynaptic terminals. We did not use electron microscopy to con1rm that all of the punctae analyzed in Figure 3 were indeed single synapses, but the reviewers did not recommend this, and we believe there is already enough published about the spatial distribution of synapses in cell culture to be con1dent that many of the punctae that are smaller than 1.5 µm were individuals.</p>
<p>Overall, we have attempted to address all of the individual concerns raised by reviewers, and our understanding is that these concerns and our responses will be available on the eLife website. The reviewers were not convinced on every point, but these are cases where the nature of the concern was not clear to us. We hope that people who share these concerns will check out our responses and contact us with any further questions or alternative interpretations.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>To clarify further: The possibility that distinct reserve pools feed distinct readily releasable pools is predicted by our working model, and is something that we would like to test in the future, but is not a conclusion of the present study. Instead, in the present study, we tested the prediction that quickly and slowly mobilized reserve vesicles are processed in parallel without making assumptions about the the underlying mechanism.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

</disp-quote>
<p>We emphasize that we have not attempted to minimize the extensive heterogeneity among synapses, but actually highlight this. In fact, we chose the image in Figure 3 for an example in part because of the lower left region replicated in Figure 3 supplement 2 demonstrating extensive heterogeneity along what appears to be a single axon. We are not the 1rst to notice the heterogeneity (see Waters and Smith, 2002), but we do provide a new possible explanation which, if correct, might be impor- tant for understanding biological computation (see our Discussion). At the same time, we believe that our evidence for multiple reserve pools within individual synapses with heterogenous properties is compelling. We see no contradiction, and indeed, our conclusion that the ratio of slowly to quickly mobilized varies extensively between synapses can only be correct if individual synapses contain mul- tiple types. We hope that people who are interested in our conclusions will evaluate the evidence and reasoning presented in our report.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We think that the reviewer is suggesting an alternative scenario where decreases in the fractional rate of FM-dye de-staining seen during 1 Hz stimulation might be caused by a large (4-fold) increase in the total size of the reserve pool that dilutes the stained vesicles by mixing. This scenario is consis- tent with the results in Figures 2 and 4-7, and initially seems plausible because previous studies have shown that many vesicles are not mobilized, and therefore are not stained, during our standard load- ing protocol of 100 s at 20 Hz (Harata et al., 2001). However, liberation of this &quot;deep reserve&quot; as an explanation for the decrease in fractional destaining is not compatible with the results in Figures 10-11 that rule out mixing. For example, liberation of the deep reserve would cause fractional destaining to appear equally depressed during subsequent 20 Hz stimulation, and Figure 10 shows that this is not the case. The scenario cannot be rescued by postulating that the subsequent 20 Hz stimulation caused the deep reserve to quickly recapture the liberated vesicles because Figure 11D-E shows that fractional de-staining continues to be depressed at the very beginning of a second 1 Hz train that follows the 20 Hz stimulation.</p>

<p>We believe that the new evidence in Figure 3 for multiple reserve pools at individual synapses is strong when evaluated in combination with the results in Figures 4-11. We do not, at present, see how the fact that FM-dye destaining is used as a bulk measurement at the sub-synaptic level could undercut our logic.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Unhealthy cultures are not a concern because we used strict quantitative criteria to assess health that are better than we have seen elsewhere (details below). We think the reviewer might be reacting to the way we rendered the image; i.e., as “overexposed”. We did this to highlight the dimmest punctae, which is a key element of the analysis. The same image rendered with less contrast is now displayed in Author response image 1 (3rd panel from left).</p>

</fig>
<p>More details (relevance to in vivo is in point 4):</p>
<p>(1) Identifying unhealthy cultures is straightforward with our technique because synapses in un- healthy cultures destain spontaneously. Our criteria for accepting experiments for further analy- sis was less than 1.5 % spontaneous rundown/minute. This is a better way to judge health than we have seen elsewhere because it eliminates subjective decisions, and would be equally appli- cable for microscopes and imaging software of any quality. For our part, we used a 25X objective with a low numerical aperture and low intensity illumination that allowed us to completely avoid photobleaching. The images will look worse to some compared to when acquired with a higher quality microscope, but the absence of photobleaching is an important bene1t because it allowed us to avoid complicated corrections.</p>
<p>(2) Stained areas larger than 1.5 µm across - such as the ones noted by the reviewer - were expressly excluded from our study because they could have been clusters of multiple synapses. The size criteria are detailed in the Legend of Figure 3. Punctae and larger areas that were excluded are the ones that are not occluded by yellow squares in the 2nd image from the left, above; at least two of the largest were likely clusters of synapses that were out of focus. Nevertheless, despite being excluded, it is unlikely that the stained areas larger than 1.5 µm in the image in Figure 3 were characteristic of unhealthy cultures because these areas did not de-stain spontaneously, but instead de-stained in response to 1 and 20 Hz electrical stimulation much like the small punctae that were included in the analysis.</p>
<p>(3) Electron microscopy results have shown that individual synapses vary &gt;10-fold in size, so a large range of brightness is expected (Murthy et al., 2001). The large range would either make the brighter punctae and clusters appear to be overexposed in a printed image, or render the dimmer punctae invisible. We have opted to present an image with overall brightness adjusted so that the dimmest punctae are visible. This is appropriate because one of the concerns was that analyzing the dimmest punctae would reveal underlying populations where the rate of fractional destaining was constant. In the end, no evidence for underlying populations emerged, which supports the conclusion that the decreases in fractional destaining occur at individual synapses. Note that adjusting brightness for example images was unavoidable; we used the camera in a range that was far below saturation and, because of this, images presented without adjusting brightness would appear to be completely black.</p>
<p>(4) Primary cell cultures are non-physiological by de1nition, so the concept of health is intrinsically arbitrary, and relevance to synapses in brains is questioned routinely. However, the new 1ndings in the present report are that: (1) individual hippocampal synapses contain multiple reserve pools; (2) the reserves remain separate but are not distinguishable by the timing of mobilization when the frequency of stimulation is high; and (3) the reserves are nevertheless processed in parallel even when the frequency of stimulation is high. Of these, 1nding (1) has been reported previously for other synapse types, but 1ndings (2) and (3) were both unexpected, and 1nding (3) was not compatible with current concepts. Nevertheless, all three 1ndings were predicted by a model that was developed to explain orthogonal results from studies of intact synapses in ex vivo slices that did not 1t with current concepts either, as referenced in the Introduction. Because of this, we think that the parallel processing of quickly and slowly mobilized reserve vesicles likely occurs in individual Schaffer collateral synapses in vivo, and is not a cell culture artifact; the alternative would be too much of an unlikely coincidence.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 1</bold></p>
<p>Mahfooz et al. investigated the time course of synaptic vesicle fusion of cultured mouse hippocampal synapses using FM-styryl dyes. The major finding is that the FM destaining time course deviates from a mono-exponential function during 1 Hz, but not 20 Hz stimulation. The deviation from a mono-exponential function was also seen during a second stimulus train applied after recovery periods of several minutes, or after depletion of the readily-releasable vesicle pool. Furthermore, this &quot;decreased fractional destaining&quot; was unlikely due to long-term synaptic depression, or incomplete dye clearance. Fractional destaining was enhanced when the dye was loaded with 1 Hz compared with 20 Hz stimulation, suggesting that vesicles recycled during 1 Hz stimulation are predominantly sorted into a rapidly mobilized pool. Finally, they show that
20 Hz stimulation does not affect the decrease in fractional destaining induced and recorded during 1 Hz stimulation. Based on these observations, they put forward a model in which slowly and quickly resupplied synaptic vesicles are mobilized in parallel.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The demonstration that FM destaining time courses deviate from single exponentials during 1 Hz stimulation (Figs 2-3) is a starting point used to rule out simple models where vesicles intermix freely and to introduce a mathematical technique for quantifying the extent of the deviations that is essential for the analysis of later experiments, where curve fitting could not be used. We then:</p>
<p>1. Show that the deviation from simple models is not caused by depletion of the readily releasable pool, as noted by the reviewer;</p>
<p>2. rule out a number of explanations for the deviation that do not involve reserve pools at all, again as noted;</p>
<p>3. provide affirmative evidence for the presence of multiple reserve pools by labeling them with distinct colors;</p>
<p>4. show that the vesicles within the distinct reserve pools do not intermix even when activity is intense enough to drive destaining with single exponential kinetics.</p>
<p>We believe that the 4th point - documented in Figs 10-11 - is a key element.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we note that our working model arose from previous studies, as referenced in the Introduction, not from the present results. The model did predict the parallel processing of quickly and slowly mobilized reserves, and the present study was designed to test this prediction. In that sense, the evidence in the current study supports our working model, not the other way around.</p>
<p>In any case, most readers in the near term will be more interested in the serial versus parallel question, and less in precisely what the present results mean for evaluating our working model. Because of this, we emphasize that evidence for parallel processing of separate reserve pools depends solely on experimental results within the study, and not on modeling. As a consequence, the evidence will continue to be equally strong even if problems with our working model arise later on (lines 382-386).</p>
<p>We do have additional unpublished evidence for the working model that does not bear directly on the parallel versus serial question. Some of this was removed from an earlier version of the manuscript and some has been newly gathered since the original submission. We will publish the additional evidence at a later point. We decided not to include it in the present manuscript expressly to avoid confusion about the relationship between modeling and the evidence for parallel processing in general.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The paper addresses an interesting question - the relationship between the resupply and release of synaptic vesicles. The study is based on a lot of data of high quality. Most data are solid. However, some of the major conclusions are not well supported by the data. Moreover, it remains unclear how speci1c the findings are to the experimental design.</p>
<p>The following points should be addressed:</p>
<p>1. Most traces display a decrease in fluorescence intensity before stimulation. Data with a decrease in baseline fluorescence intensity of up to 1.5 % were considered for the analysis (Fig 2-supplement 2). I may have missed it, but were the data corrected for the observed decrease in baseline fluorescence intensity? (In the model shown in Appendix 1 Figure 1, they correct for &quot;rundown&quot;). For instance, are the residuals shown in Fig 2D, E based on corrected data? In case the data would not be corrected for a decrease in baseline fluorescence, would the decay kinetics also deviate from a single exponential after correction?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not correct for rundown - as now noted on lines 96-97 - except in the figure in the Appendix, noted by the reviewer, where the uncorrected and corrected time courses are plotted side by side for easy comparison. However, our study includes an analysis showing that correcting for rundown during 1 Hz stimulation would increase - not decrease - the deviation from a single exponential (2 bars in rightmost panel in Fig 2C, and lines 113-116 of Results), so the absence of a correction does not weaken our conclusions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The analysis of &quot;fractional destaining&quot; is not clear to me. How many intervals of which length were chosen and why? For instance, the intervals often differ in length, number and do not cover the complete decay (e.g., Fig 2B).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We calculated fractional destaining from longer intervals at later times because the overall amount of stain was less, meaning signal/noise was less, and scatter was more. We did this because increased scatter at later times could be counteracted by estimating the slope of destaining from longer intervals. An additional bene1t is that elongating the later intervals allowed us to plot only 6 bars for 25 min of 1 Hz destaining, which works better visually than 17.</p>
<p>Increasing the interval length for later times is mathematically sound because the key factor causing distortions related to deviations from linearity is not the length of the interval per se but, instead, the fractional destaining over the interval. The fractional destaining is greater at the start of 1Hz stimulation, thus requiring shorter intervals.</p>
<p>It would be possible to choose inappropriately long intervals that would distort estimates of the change in fractional destaining. However, we now include Fig 2-supplement 6 – which includes all 17 1.5 min intervals - to con1rm that any distortions after the first interval were minimal. The Appendix predicts a biologically important distortion for the first interval which we are following up, but this would underestimate the true deviation from quickly mixing pools, so would not be problematic for the present conclusions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Sometimes, only the interval right after stimulation onset was considered (e.g., Fig 7, 8).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figs 7, 8 in the previous version are now Figs 8, 9.</p>
<p>This is appropriate because the goal was to estimate the fractional destaining at the very start, before the quickly mobilized fraction has destained.</p>
<p>How quickly fractional destaining is expected to revert to the lowest value seen after 15 min of 1Hz stimulation in Fig 2 (and elsewhere) depends very much on assumptions - such as the number of reserve pools, etc. We sought to avoid this kind of additional analysis because we are keen to avoid the impression that our main conclusions depend on the speci1cs of modeling.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>How sensitive are the changes in fractional destaining to the choice of the intervals?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Minimally. This can be seen by eye because the magenta lines in Fig 2B 1t the data well, but see Fig 2-supplement 6 for a quantitative comparison.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For instance, would fractional destaining be increased if later intervals would have been chosen for the second 20 Hz stimulus in the experiment shown in Fig 9B?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Previous Fig 9B is now Fig 10B.</p>
<p>We cannot be certain, but think it probably would not be different. Neither an increase nor a decrease would be problematic for our conclusions.</p>
<p>More detail: There is not enough data to evaluate this specifically for Fig 10B because the total amount of stain remaining at later intervals is little, meaning signal/noise is low, which causes extensive experimental scatter. However, synapses were even more extensively destained prior to time course c of Figure2-supplement 2C, which nevertheless matches time courses a, b, and d.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I propose fitting all baseline-corrected data with a single and a double-exponential function (as well as single exponential plus line?) and reporting the corresponding time constants (slopes) and amplitudes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As noted above, we purposefully do not baseline correct data in a way that would make this possible. However, we do include exponential fits when appropriate, in Fig 2D-E, Fig 2- supplement 1, Fig 2-supplement-7, Fig 2-supplement-8, and Fig 12B.</p>
<p>Indeed, the absence of any change in the weighting parameter despite substantial changes for both time constants seen after raising the temperature to 35C (Fig 2-supplement-8 vs Fig12B) is notable because it suggests that the contents of the reserve pools are not altered by changing temperature, even though vesicle trafficking is accelerated. Fig 2-supplement-8 is a supplementary figure because the result is outside the scope of the main point, not because the quality is lower than for other figures.</p>
<p>Beyond that, exponential fits would not be adequate for most of the study because many experiments - including the core experiments in Figs 10-11 - require discontinuous stimulation, such as when we stop stimulating at 1 Hz, rest for minutes, and then start up again at 1 or 20 Hz. And, although widely used, exponentials are non-linear equations after all. Even when they can be used to quantify time courses, the fractional destaining measurement is almost always more informative, in the technical sense, because it avoids complications when estimating the importance of deviations occurring at the two extremes versus deviations in the middle of the time course.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Along the same lines, is the average slow time constant indeed around 40 min? (Are the data shown in Fig 2 S7 based on an average?) If this would be the case, I suggest conducting a control experiment with a recording time &gt; 40 min. Would fitting an exponential or a line to baseline data (without stimulation) also give a similar slow component?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Fig 2-supplement 7 in the previous version is now Fig 2-supplement 8.</p>
<p>First, yes, the time course shown in Fig 2-supplement 8 is the mean across preparations. The time courses of the individual preparations were quanti1ed as the median value of the individual ROIs before averaging.</p>
<p>Second, no, fitting baseline data would give an approximately 3-fold greater time constant (i.e., 120 min) because fractional destaining decreases by about 3-fold when we stop stimulating after 25 min of 1 Hz stimulation (i.e., Fig 2C, 3B, and many others).</p>
<p>The key point is that fractional destaining decreases greatly over long trains of 1 Hz stimulation.</p>
<p>For Fig 2, we saw a 2.7+/-0.1-fold decrease before accounting for baseline destaining (lines
106-110), which increased to a 4.4-fold decrease when we did account for baseline destaining (lines 113-116). Overall, the 2.7-fold value is simultaneously a safe minimum boundary, and much greater than the value of 1.0 expected from models where vesicles mix freely.</p>
<p>Note that future studies will show that even the 4.4-fold value is probably an underestimate because 1 Hz stimulation misses a fast component at the very beginning of the time courses, as predicted in the Appendix.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. How speci1c are the findings to 1 Hz (and 20 Hz) stimulation? From which frequency onward can a decrease in fractional destaining be no longer observed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our logic depends only on the premise that we are able to find some frequency where fractional destaining no longer decreases. We knew that 20 Hz was a good place to start because of previous electrophysiological experiments - frequency jumps (Fig 1 of Wesseling and Lo, 2002 and Fig 2C of Garcia-Perez and Wesseling, 2008), and trains of action potentials followed by osmotic shocks (Fig 2A of Garcia-Perez et al., 2008) - showing that 20 Hz stimulation is enough to nearly completely exhaust the readily releasable pool. This is noted in lines 202-203, and Box 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>would previous stimulation with frequencies &lt;20 Hz interfere with fractional destaining? These control experiments would help assessing how general/speci1c the findings are.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes (Figs 4 and 11A at 1 Hz). Also, we have done experiments at 0.1 Hz, which will be published later; some of these were actually removed from an earlier version of the manuscript because the results are primarily relevant to deciding between particular parallel models, and are not relevant to the conclusion of the present study that quickly and slowly mobilized reserves are processed in parallel.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Similarly, a major conclusion of the paper - the parallel mobilization of two vesicle pools - is largely based on these two stimulation frequencies. Can they exclude that mixing between the two pools occurs at other frequencies?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We cannot exclude the possibility of breakdown at a higher frequency, but this would not undercut our conclusions. We do not have plans to try this experiment because: (1) a positive result would be open to concerns about non-physiologically heavy stimulation; and (2) a negative result would be difficult to interpret because of the possibility that the axons cannot follow at higher frequencies.</p>

<p>By using optical monitoring of synaptic vesicles with FM1-43 at hippocampal synapses, the authors try to show the evidence for two parallel reserve pools of synaptic vesicles, which feed the vesicles to the readily releasable pool. The major strength of the study is the use of a quantitative model, which can be readily testable by experiments: in the course of the study, the authors propose the best vesicle pool model, which fits the experimental data &quot;averaged over synapses&quot; nicely. On the other hand, the weak point of the study comes from the optical method and the data: bulk imaging of vesicle dynamics monitored at each synapse is noisy and the signals vary considerably among synapses. Therefore, the average signals over many synapses may not reflect the vesicle dynamics of two reserve pools within a synapse, but something else, such as the different kinetics of release from multiple synapses with different release probability. Nevertheless, a new framework of two reserve pools offers a testable hypothesis of vesicle dynamics, and the use of single vesicle tracking and EM may allow one to give a de1nitive answer in the future studies Therefore, the study may be of interest to the community of synaptic neurobiology.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>1. The current version includes a new figure (Fig 3) showing that the deviations from single pool models seen in populations are caused by deviations occurring at the level of single synapses. The heterogeneity between synapses actually causes population statistics to underestimate - not overestimate - the mean and median size of the deviations at individuals.</p>
<p>We think the new evidence in Fig 3 and supplements is conclusive without follow-on EM of the same punctae given the substantial body of already published EM on similar cultures. Essentially, the only way to explain the results without invoking multiple reserve pools in individual synapses would be to say that individual synapses ALWAYS come in clumps containing multiple types and are NEVER separated from neighbors by more than 1.5 microns - even when the clumps are separated from each other by 5 microns. There is already clear evidence against this.</p>
<p>1. No new model is proposed here, see the first response to the first reviewer.</p>
<p>2. We are not aware of alternative hypotheses that could account for our results, so cannot evaluate if single vesicle tracking and EM could add meaningful additional support.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The existence of non-stained vesicles complicates the interpretation of the data. Because the release by 20 Hz and 1 Hz stimulation do not entirely reflect the release from fast and slow vesicle pools. the estimation of non-stained vesicles using synaptopHluorin (+ba1lomycin) and EPSCs would be helpful to examine fraction of non-stained / stained vesicles over time (with stimulation, the ratio may change dynamically, which may bring complications).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Non-stained vesicles are not a complication, but instead a key element of our logic which is included in the diagrams in Boxes 1 and 2 and Figure 9. That is, quickly and slowly mobilized reserves can be distinguished at 1 Hz precisely because 1 Hz is not intense enough to exhaust the readily releasable pool (Box 2). The corollary is that stained vesicles must be replaced by non-stained vesicles, because otherwise 1 Hz stimulation would exhaust the readily releasable pool. And this is why FM-dyes (plus a beta-cyclodextrin during washing) are ideal for the current questions whereas other techniques, such as electrophysiology or synaptopHluorin imaging are obviously indispensable for other questions, but could not replace the FM-dyes in the current study. This is now noted on lines 86-89.</p>
<p>We are aware that synaptopHluorin + ba1lomycin could, in principle, accomplish some of the same goals. However, ba1lomycin ended up being toxic when applied for tens of minutes, as it would have to be in our experiments. And, we do not see what critical question is not already answered with strong evidence using FM dyes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Individual synapses show marked differences in the time course of de-staining, suggesting differences in release probability. The averaging of the whole data may reflect &quot;average&quot; behavior of synapses, but for example, bi-exponential time course may reflect high Pr and low Pr synapses, rather than vesicle recruitment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The authors may comment on this issue.</p>
<p>See newly added Fig 3, and responses above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Some differences are very small (Fig 10, the same amplitude as bleaching time course), and I am not certain if the observed differences are meaningful, given low signal to noise ratio in each synapse.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Fig 10 in the previous version is Fig 11 in the current version.</p>
<p>Even if correct, this would not be problematic because 20 Hz stimulation clearly did not cause fractional destaining to return to the initial value when stimulation was resumed at 1 Hz (compare d and f in Fig 11E). In any case, Figs 2C, 3B, 5B, 7B, and Fig 10-supplement 2A all show that the minimum fractional destaining value during 1 Hz stimulation is about 3-fold greater than during subsequent rest intervals, which is not a small difference. Also, note that Fig 2-supplement 3 shows that photobleaching likely did not play a role.</p>

<p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</p>
<p>This study attempts to conceptualize the long-standing question of vesicle pool organization in presynaptic terminals. Authors used classical FM dye release experiments to support a hypothesis that rapidly and slowly releasing vesicles are mobilized in parallel without intermixing. This modular model is also supported indirectly by the authors’ recent findings of molecular links that connect a subset of vesicles in linear chains (published elsewhere).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our study should be seen as a test of the hypothesis that quickly and slowly mobilized reserves are processed in parallel. The evidence is independent of any modeling, and would continue to be equally strong if our working model turns out to be incorrect (lines 382-386).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The scope of the original model was limited by a number of caveats. The main concerns included a limited data set measured in bulk from a highly heterogeneous synapse population, and a complex interrelationship between vesicle mobilization and the bulk FM dye de-staining kinetics. The second major limitation was measurements being performed at room temperature, which inhibits or alters a number of critical synaptic processes that are being modeled. This includes the efficiency of exo/endocytosis coupling, vesicle mobility and release site refractory period, which are stimulus- and temperature-dependent, but were not accounted for in the original model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The present study contains experiments at body temperature (Fig 12 and Fig 12-supplement 1 in the current version) and analyses of individual synapses (especially Fig 3 in the current version). To our knowledge all results are consistent with everything that is known about the efficiency of exo/endocytosis coupling, vesicle mobility and release site refractory periods.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors made strong efforts to address previous concerns. However, the main conceptual point, i.e. linking the bulk FM dye de-staining kinetics with precise arrangement of vesicle pools, is not well supported and is generally highly problematic because it ignores many additional processes and confounding factors.</p>
<p>For example, vesicle exchange between neighboring synapses constitutes from 15% to over 50% of total recycling vesicle population, and therefore is a major contributing factor to FM dye loss/redistribution, but is not considered in this study. Additionally, this vesicle exchange process undergoes calcium/activity-dependent changes, contributing to difficulty in interpreting the current experiments comparing FM de-staining at different stimulation frequencies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not see how exchange of vesicles between synapses could be a problem for our logic, so cannot evaluate this without a more detailed description of the concern. Instead, our results rule out random inter-synaptic exchange between quickly and slowly mobilized reserve pools because this would show up in our assays as mixing, which does not occur. We think there are three remaining possibilities:</p>
<p>1. vesicles are exchanged primarily between quickly mobilized reserve pools</p>
<p>2. vesicles are exchanged primarily between slowly mobilized reserve pools</p>
<p>3. vesicles in quickly mobilized reserve pools are targeted to quickly mobilized reserve pools
in other synapses and vesicles in slowly mobilized reserve pools are targeted to slowly
mobilized reserve pools in other synapses.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know which of these is correct, but this is outside the scope of the
current study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Moreover, other forms of release, such as asynchronous release, contribute a large fraction of released vesicles, but are not factored in. Asynchronous release varies widely in synapse population from 0.1 to &gt;0.4 of synchronous release, but is entirely ignored. Spontaneous release may also contribute to FM dye loss over extended 25min recordings used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Spontaneous release and asynchronous release are not caveats.</p>
<p>First, spontaneous: We suspect that spontaneous release contributes to the background destaining rate, but this is 3-fold slower than the minimum during 1 Hz stimulation on average (Figs 2C, 3C, 5B etc), so we know that the slowly mobilized reserve is mobilized by low frequency trains of action potentials (lines 410-412). Note that a different outcome - where the rate of destaining decreased to a very low level during long trains of 1 Hz stimulation - would not have been consistent with the idea that slowly mobilized vesicles are only released spontaneously because the remaining fluorescence can always be destained rapidly by increasing the stimulation intensity to 20 Hz (e.g., see examples in Fig 3).</p>
<p>Second, asynchronous: We know that slowly mobilized reserves must be released synchronously at 35C because the asynchronous component is eliminated at this temperature (Huson et al., 2019), without altering the quantity of slowly mobilized reserves that are mobilized by 1 Hz stimulation (lines 350-360 of Results, and 445-452 of Discussion; we can con1rm from our own unpublished experiments that the disappearance of asynchronous release at 35C is a robust phenomenon in these cell cultures). Asynchronous release of slowly mobilized vesicles might occur at room temperature, but this would not argue against the conclusion that slowly mobilized vesicles are processed in parallel with quickly mobilized.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Speci1c comments:</p>
<p>Points 1-4 are already addressed above.</p>
<p>1. The notion of the chained vesicles is somewhat confusing: how does the &quot;first&quot; vesicle located at the plasma membrane/release site get released if it is attached to the chain? Wouldn’t this &quot;first&quot; vesicle be non-immediately releasable since it must first be liberated? Since all vesicles shown in the Figure 1 have chains attached to them, what vesicle population then give rise to sub-millisecond release?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is not a concern relevant to the present study because none of the conclusions rely on the model in any way (see Introduction, and lines 382-386 of the Discussion). Beyond that: We previously published clear evidence that docked vesicles are tethered to non-docked vesicles (Figure 8 of Wesseling et al., 2019). We see no reason to suspect that a tether to an internal vesicle would prevent the docked vesicle from priming for release.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Model: For fitting de-staining during 20 Hz stimulation, authors state that it was necessary to allow &gt;5-fold Facilitation. This seems to be non-physiologically relevant, since previous studies found only very mild facilitation at room temperature (typically below a factor of 1.5-2.0) and the authors themselves state that, at most, a 1.3 fold facilitation was found.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>If the 1.3-fold facilitation estimate comes from us, it must have been in a different context.</p>
<p>Most estimates of facilitation that are published are heavily convolved with simultaneous depression, and there is additionally a saturation mechanism for readily releasable vesicles with high release probability that is not widely known (Garcia-Perez and Wesseling, 2008). The standard method for eliminating the depression is to lower the probability of release by lowering extracellular [Ca2+], which additionally relieves occlusion by the saturation mechanism. And, lowering [Ca2+] uncovers an enormous amount facilitation at synapses in hippocampal cell culture. For example, see Figure 2B of Stevens and Wesseling (1999), which shows a 7-fold enhancement during 9 Hz stimulation, and Figure 3 of the same study, which shows a linear relationship with frequency. Taken together these two results suggest 15-fold enhancement during 20 Hz stimulation, which far exceeds the 5-fold value needed at inefficient release sites to make our working model 1t the FM-dye destaining results.</p>
