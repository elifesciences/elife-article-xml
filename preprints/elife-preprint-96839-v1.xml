<abstract>
<p>By exposing genes associated with disease, genomic studies provide hundreds of starting points that should lead to druggable processes. However, our ability to systematically translate these genomic findings into biological pathways remains limited. Here, we combine rapid loss-of-function mutagenesis of Alzheimer’s risk genes and behavioural pharmacology in zebrafish to predict disrupted processes and candidate therapeutics. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/francoiskroll/FramebyFrame">FramebyFrame</ext-link>, our expanded package for the analysis of larval behaviours, revealed that decreased night-time sleep was common to F0 knockouts of all four late-onset Alzheimer’s risk genes tested. We developed an online tool, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://francoiskroll.shinyapps.io/zoltar">ZOLTAR</ext-link>, which compares any behavioural fingerprint to a library of fingerprints from larvae treated with 3,674 compounds. ZOLTAR successfully predicted that <italic>sorl1</italic> mutants have disrupted serotonin signalling and identified betamethasone as a drug which normalises the excessive day-time sleep of <italic>presenilin-2</italic> knockout larvae with minimal side effects. Predictive behavioural pharmacology offers a general framework to rapidly link disease-associated genes to druggable pathways.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>To prevent or slow down disease, therapies must target the biological processes that cause the disease. Genomic approaches like family studies or genome-wide association studies (GWASs) can help in this quest for causal processes by exposing genes that are mutated before disease onset. For finding causal processes, studying the genome, rather than the transcriptome or epigenome, is advantageous because the chronology from genomic variant to disease is unambiguous, providing a strong argument for causality. In theory, all we need to do after a genomic study is follow the thread from each gene to the biological process in which it is involved. We know from the genomic study that this process increased or reduced risk when it was altered by mutations in the gene, so modulating more forcefully the process with a drug may unlock a larger therapeutic benefit. In practice, the path from genomic variant to druggable process is far from straightforward.</p>
<p>Research on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) exemplifies well both the benefit and challenge of translating genomic studies into druggable biological processes. Family studies of early-onset AD in the 1990’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> identified causal mutations in amyloid precursor protein (<italic>APP</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, presenilin 1 (<italic>PSEN1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, and presenilin 2 (<italic>PSEN2</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Subsequent work demonstrated that amyloid beta (Aβ), a small peptide which forms aggregates in AD patients’ brains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, was generated by cleavage of APP by γ-secretase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, of which the catalytic subunit is PSEN1 or PSEN2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Consequently, the field naturally converged on the amyloid hypothesis of AD, which posits that the disease is caused by toxic aggregates of Aβ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Today, antibodies against Aβ such as lecanemab show promise in slowing down disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. This story shows that, although a great challenge, genomic studies (family studies of early-onset AD) can be successfully translated into a causal process (Aβ aggregation) that is now targeted by disease-modifying drugs (lecanemab).</p>
<p>However, the beneficial effects from targeting Aβ aggregation currently remain modest despite substantial reductions in brain amyloid burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. To completely stop disease progression, anti-amyloid therapy will likely need to be combined with drugs modulating other processes that contribute to the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. GWASs have identified tens of genomic loci where sequence variation is associated with late-onset AD, offering an opportunity to discover new causal processes of AD that potentially go beyond the amyloid hypothesis. For example, analysis of cell types enriched for open chromatin at AD-associated loci pointed to a possible critical role of monocytes, macrophages, and microglia in AD progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Although GWASs are designed to generate new hypotheses, AD-associated loci have rarely been exploited to find new causal processes in an unbiased, systematic manner. Given the challenges inherent to linking genomic variants to causal biological events, new genomic associations are often first more narrowly interpreted in the context of the amyloid hypothesis. While this interpretation may be correct, it tends to create a self-fulfilling prophecy which leaves little room for the discovery of new causal processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As AD is primarily a disease of the old age, research often focuses on patients or animal models after disease onset. However, this approach also hinders the discovery of new <italic>causal</italic> processes from genomic studies because it largely annuls the advantage of unambiguous chronology—since genomic variants were unambiguously present before disease onset, they must have modulated a process which contributed causally to disease initiation. In patients or animals after disease onset, many biological processes are disrupted, but only a small proportion may be genuinely causal for disease progression and therefore make suitable targets for disease-modifying therapies. For example, one may find that dopamine is lacking in the basal ganglia of patients and animal models of Parkinson’s disease. Treatment with levodopa, a dopamine precursor, temporarily relieves motor symptoms, but does not slow down disease progression, so dopamine deficiency was not in fact a causal process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Therefore, perhaps counterintuitively, studying the consequences of AD-associated mutations <italic>early</italic> in life seems more likely to identify processes that are genuinely causal to disease, as any disrupted process that is identified is less likely to be a secondary disease consequence.</p>
<p>In practice, how can we quickly follow the thread from a disease-associated gene to a (druggable) biological process in which it is involved? In this work, we describe a behavioural pharmacology approach to link genes associated with a disease to likely causal biological processes using zebrafish larvae. Our strategy predicts from the behavioural profile of knockout zebrafish the likely causal processes and potential compounds that rescue the phenotype. In previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, we introduced the use of zebrafish F0 knockouts to study complex traits such as behaviour. In this study, we demonstrate how the F0 knockout method renders this behavioural pharmacology approach fast and scalable to the parallel study of tens of disease-associated genes, rather than one at a time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. As genomic studies of AD can likely be further exploited to find causal processes, we used Alzheimer’s risk genes as a case study for our strategy. The strategy is not specific to any one disease or set of genes. In theory, any measurable change in behaviour could be used to predict the underlying causal pathways and small molecules that normalise this change.</p>

<title>Most Alzheimer’s risk genes are present in zebrafish and expressed early in development</title>
<p>GWASs point to small portions of the genome where variation in sequence is associated with variation in disease risk, but do not readily specify the genes whose altered function are responsible for this association. Therefore, as a starting point, we used a meta-analysis of GWASs on AD that found 37 significant loci and annotated each with the most likely causal gene using mainly statistical colocalisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. To add confidence to these calls, we cross-referenced these causal gene predictions with a transcription-wide association study and risk gene pre-mRNAs that undergo differential splicing in AD brains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Finally, we added to our list the three genes which can cause early-onset AD when mutated: <italic>PSEN1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, <italic>PSEN2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, and <italic>APP</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, yielding a list of 40 genes associated with AD risk (Supplementary file 1).</p>
<p>Of these 40 Alzheimer’s risk genes, 30 (75%) had at least one annotated orthologue in the zebrafish genome (source: Ensembl). Of those, 17 had one orthologue (e.g. the only zebrafish orthologue of human <italic>SORL1</italic> was <italic>sorl1</italic>); 11 had two orthologues (e.g. the zebrafish orthologues of human <italic>APP</italic> were <italic>appa</italic> and <italic>appb</italic>); and 2 had more than two orthologues (e.g. the zebrafish orthologues of human <italic>MS4A6E</italic> included <italic>ms4a17a</italic>, <italic>ms4a17c.2</italic>, <italic>tmem176l</italic>, and more) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). A human gene often has two or more zebrafish orthologues because of a teleost-specific whole-genome duplication event around 340 million years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. There were no annotated orthologues for 10 Alzheimer’s risk genes, including <italic>TREM2</italic>.</p>
<p>Next, we used a published single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset of the developing zebrafish brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> to ask whether the orthologues of the Alzheimer’s risk genes were expressed in zebrafish embryos and larvae. Most of the genes (33/42) were detectable as early as 12 hours post-fertilisation (hpf) and remained expressed throughout development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). At 5 days post-fertilisation (dpf), 38 of the 42 orthologues (90%) were expressed.</p>
<p>From these observations, we selected seven high-confidence Alzheimer’s risk genes for further study in zebrafish; the orthologues of the three early-onset Alzheimer’s genes: <italic>psen1</italic>, <italic>psen2</italic>, <italic>appa</italic>/<italic>appb</italic>; and four genes associated with late-onset AD: <italic>apoea</italic>/<italic>apoeb</italic>, <italic>cd2ap</italic>, <italic>clu</italic>, <italic>sorl1</italic>. We chose <italic>APOE</italic> as it is the most well-known genetic risk factor for late-onset AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. <italic>CD2AP</italic>, <italic>CLU</italic>, and <italic>SORL1</italic> were chosen because non-coding variants within or near those genes are repeatedly found by GWASs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. At the <italic>CD2AP</italic> locus, <italic>CD2AP</italic> was highly likely to be the causal gene by colocalisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. At the <italic>CLU</italic> locus, both <italic>PTK2B</italic> and <italic>CLU</italic> were likely causal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, but differential splicing of <italic>CLU</italic> correlated with risk of AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The top variant at the <italic>SORL1</italic> locus was within an intron of <italic>SORL1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, but rare protein-coding variants in <italic>SORL1</italic> were likely causal for some early-onset AD patients through haploinsufficiency or deleterious effects on protein function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For these selected Alzheimer’s risk genes, we more carefully examined their expression patterns in larval zebrafish. From the scRNA-seq dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, most of these genes were broadly expressed in the 5-dpf larva in different neuronal populations and other cell types (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1–supplement 1</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). <italic>apoeb</italic> was highly expressed specifically in epidermis progenitors, Müller glia in the retina, and microglia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), as observed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Across clusters, the highest expression of <italic>clu</italic> was in radial glia (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1–supplement 2c</xref>, cluster 30). To confirm and extend these observations, we used in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to label mRNA in 6-dpf larvae. As we observed in the scRNA-seq data, most genes tested (<italic>appa</italic>, <italic>appb</italic>, <italic>psen1</italic>, <italic>psen2</italic>, <italic>apoea</italic>, <italic>cd2ap</italic>, <italic>sorl1</italic>) were broadly expressed throughout the 6-dpf brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1–supplement 3</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). <italic>apoeb</italic> expression was restricted to cells in the forebrain and optic tectum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1–supplement 4b</xref>). Based on the scRNA-seq dataset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) and literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, these cells are likely <italic>ccl34b.1</italic><sup>+</sup> amoeboid microglia derived from primitive myeloid precursors from the rostral blood island. Additionally, <italic>apoeb</italic> was detected in cells bordering the hindbrain ventricle, which are likely radial glia/astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Contrary to the widespread expression found in the scRNA-seq dataset, <italic>clu</italic> expression was largely restricted to the diencephalic and myelencephalic choroid plexuses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1–supplement 4d</xref>), confirming a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In summary, around 75% of Alzheimer’s risk genes had at least one clear orthologue in zebrafish and most of these were expressed in the brain of 5–6-dpf zebrafish larvae, suggesting they play a role in early brain development or function.</p>

<title>The FramebyFrame R package for analysis of sleep/wake behaviour from high-throughput video-tracking data</title>
<p>The next stage in our behavioural pharmacology strategy is to measure sleep/wake behaviour of F0 knockout larvae for the genes under study. To uncover even subtle behavioural phenotypes caused by the loss of Alzheimer’s risk genes, we developed a high-throughput sleep/wake tracking assay for zebrafish larvae capable of analysing behaviour at the sub-second resolution over multiple days and nights. To achieve this, we combined previous sleep/wake analysis methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> with some aspects of the frame-by-frame analysis developed by Ghosh and Rihel (2020)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> into a single software tool, the FramebyFrame R package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/francoiskroll/FramebyFrame">github.com/francoiskroll/FramebyFrame</ext-link>). We also designed a 3D-printed mesh-bottom plate that supports long-term (up to 8.5 days tested) tracking of larvae with minimal intervention by regulating the water level with a small pump and delivering paramecia for feeding through the mesh from the water bath below (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>).</p>
<p>The FramebyFrame package extracts and analyses 17 behavioural parameters from frame-by-frame Δ pixel data, which represent the number of pixels that changed intensity at each frame-to-frame transition. These parameters capture both behaviours that unfold over multiple minutes or hours, such as sleep (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), and actions at smaller time scales (&lt; 1 sec), such as individual swimming bouts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). The parameters are grouped into three categories: activity parameters (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2–supplement 1a</xref>), which describe the overall activity of each larva during a complete day or night; active bout parameters (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2–supplement 1b</xref>), which describe the structure of individual swimming bouts; and sleep parameters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) such as sleep latency (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2–supplement 2d</xref>). In zebrafish larvae, sleep is defined as any period of inactivity (Δ pixel = 0) lasting longer than one minute, a definition based on increases in arousal threshold and homeostatic rebound following deprivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. This frame-by-frame analysis has several advantages over previous methods that analysed activity data at the one-minute resolution. First, individual swimming bouts could not be resolved by these methods as single bouts last ∼0.2 sec on average. Second, the one-minute methods missed around one third of all sleep bouts because of how the Δ pixel data is binned in one-minute epochs (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2–supplement 2a</xref>). At the frame-by-frame resolution, the start and end frame of each sleep bout can be precisely determined, which also improves the measurement accuracy of sleep bout duration and sleep latency, the delay from lights-off to first sleep bout. For example, during a sample 10-hr night (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2–supplement 2b</xref>), the frame-by-frame analysis detected 35 ± 14 more sleep bouts, longer average sleep bout lengths (+0.2 ± 0.2 min), and shorter sleep latencies (1.6 ± 2.3 min earlier), resulting in a 42% increase in total sleep time (+2.3 ± 0.4 hr). During the day, the FramebyFrame analysis also detected more sleep and more sleep bouts (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2–supplement 2c</xref>). Most behaviour plots included in this study were created using the FramebyFrame package in just a few commands from the raw frame-by-frame data.</p>

<title><italic>psen2</italic> knockouts sleep more during the day</title>
<p>Next, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate F0 knockouts for the zebrafish orthologues of the three genes that can cause early-onset AD when mutated in humans—<italic>psen1</italic>, <italic>psen2</italic>, <italic>appa</italic>/<italic>appb</italic>—and tested these mutants for behavioural and other phenotypes. We focused first on <italic>psen1</italic> and <italic>psen2</italic>.</p>
<p>Zebrafish Psen1 and Psen2 are highly similar to their human counterparts (∼70% identical amino acid sequence, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>), with the same critical amino acid at the four annotated active sites (two per presenilin). Mismatches between the human and zebrafish proteins were largely clustered into disordered domains, suggesting that the zebrafish presenilins have the same catalytic activity as in humans. The Cas9/guide RNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) used to generate F0 knockouts mutated virtually every copy of the genome at each of the three targeted sites. At each targeted locus of <italic>psen1</italic>, 99.0 ± 2.7% of reads were mutated and 78.6 ± 29.7% of all reads had a frameshift mutation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). At each targeted locus of <italic>psen2</italic>, 99.9 ± 0.1% reads were mutated and 82.0 ± 33.6% of all reads had a frameshift mutation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). As each gene is mutated at three loci, the biallelic knockout probability, that is, the probability of having at least one frameshift mutation on both alleles, cumulatively reached &gt; 98% (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://francoiskroll.shinyapps.io/frameshiftmodel/">francoiskroll.shinyapps.io/frameshiftmodel/</ext-link>), indicating that most <italic>psen1</italic> and <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout larvae were complete loss-of-function mutants.</p>
<p>In humans, PSEN1 or PSEN2 acts as the catalytic subunit of the γ-secretase protein complex, which is responsible for the cleavage of more than 90 substrates, such as Notch. It also performs the last cleavage of APP to release Aβ, which aggregates in the brains of patients with AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Do presenilins also cleave zebrafish Appa/Appb into Aβ? Using a sensitive ELISA-based assay, Aβ40 and Aβ42 were detectable in control (uninjected and scrambled-injected) larvae but not in two clutches of <italic>psen1</italic> F0 knockouts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>), confirming that zebrafish Psen1 is required for the cleavage of Appa/Appb into Aβ. In contrast, Aβ40 and Aβ42 were detectable in <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockouts, suggesting that most Aβ is generated by Psen1 in zebrafish and that Psen2 alone cannot compensate. This result extends previous findings that Aβ production in zebrafish is blocked by the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> and matches closely observations in mice, in which loss of PSEN2 had no measurable effect on Aβ40/42 production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In mice, knockout of <italic>Psen1</italic>, but not of <italic>Psen2</italic>, causes severe skeletal malformations and brain haemorrhages, likely because of impaired Notch signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Homozygous animals die within minutes after birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Morphologically, our <italic>psen1</italic> F0 knockout larvae developed normally (tested up to 16 dpf) and were indistinguishable from their wild-type siblings, as observed in a <italic>psen1</italic> stable knockout line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout larvae had a mild pigmentation defect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3–supplement 2a</xref>), which has been previously reported in a <italic>psen2</italic> stable knockout line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. This difference suggests a specific function of Psen2 in melanophores which cannot be fulfilled by Psen1. We also generated <italic>psen1</italic>/<italic>psen2</italic> double F0 knockouts but most were lethal early in development (∼5 dpf) with severe defects in eye development (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3–supplement 1a</xref>), in which the retinal pigment epithelium appeared patchy and some larvae developed oedema around the eye. The tail was severely curved outwards, in exactly the same way as larvae treated with a high dose of the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Incidentally, <italic>Psen1</italic> knockout mice also display defects in the axial skeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Overall, these results suggest that zebrafish presenilins are more readily capable of compensating each other during development than in mice, as only double <italic>psen1</italic>/<italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae showed a severe morphological phenotype.</p>
<p>We next video-tracked two clutches of <italic>psen1</italic> and <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout larvae over multiple day-night cycles and applied our frame-by-frame analysis to detect behavioural phenotypes over long and short time scales. The loss of <italic>psen1</italic> only had mild effects on behaviour. At night, <italic>psen1</italic> F0 knockout larvae slept slightly less (−8% vs. scrambled, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3–supplement 1b</xref>) and instead spent more time active than control injected siblings (+22%), mainly because they performed more swimming bouts (+20%). The <italic>psen1</italic> knockouts also showed a slightly reduced startle response at lights-off (−4%), in line with some data obtained from stable <italic>psen1</italic> knockout larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Behaviour during the day was not affected (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3–supplement 1c</xref>). In contrast, <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockouts of both cutches were substantially less active than controls during the day (total activity: −26% vs. scrambled, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g,h</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3– supplement 1d</xref>), performing both fewer (−17%) and more subdued swimming bouts (active bout mean: −12%). <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockouts also slept more during the day than controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g,h</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3–supplement 1d</xref>), both spending more time asleep (+178%) and initiating more frequent sleep bouts (+150%). Loss of Psen2 did not strongly affect night-time behaviour. In summary, <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout larvae were substantially less active and sleeping more than controls during the day.</p>
<p>Since <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae were less pigmented (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3–supplement 2a</xref>), we tested whether the reduction in activity could be an artefact due to fainter detection by the camera. We extracted the maximum Δ pixel value each larva reached during the startle response at lights off (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3–supplement 2b</xref>). These vigorous swimming bouts can displace the whole larva in a tenth of a second, providing a measure of how many dark pixels are detectable for each larva. <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout larvae indeed displaced fewer pixels during the startle response than scrambled-injected controls (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3–supplement 2c</xref>, clutch 1: <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts displaced 78 ± 10 pixels vs 82 ± 8 pixels for scrambled-injected controls, clutch 2: 71 ± 8 pixels vs 80 ± 8 pixels). We then downscaled the Δ pixel values of the scrambled-injected larvae proportionally to the ratio of the startle response means (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3–supplement 2c,d</xref>), akin to artificially making the scrambled-injected larvae appear less dark. Even after this adjustment, <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockouts were measurably less active and sleeping more during the day, although the parameter effect sizes were somewhat reduced (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3–supplement 2e</xref>). In summary, the <italic>psen2</italic> behavioural phenotype reflects a genuine difference in behaviour.</p>
<p>Finally, we examined the impact of loss of both Appa and Appb. As described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, zebrafish Appa and Appb are highly similar to human APP (64–68% identical amino acid sequence, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3–supplement 3a,b</xref>). We generated <italic>appa</italic>/<italic>appb</italic> double F0 knockout larvae by mutating each gene at two loci, rather than three, to limit unviability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. The CRISPR-Cas9 RNPs were highly mutagenic (across all four loci: 95.8 ± 7.0% mutated reads, 76.5 ± 21.7 of all reads had a frameshift mutation, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3–supplement 3c,d</xref>). The <italic>appa</italic>/<italic>appb</italic> double F0 knockout larvae looked morphologically normal. Behaviourally, <italic>appa</italic>/<italic>appb</italic> double knockouts were less active during the day than control siblings (–14% vs. scrambled, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3–supplement 3e</xref>) and showed shorter swimming bouts across the day/night cycle (active bout duration during the day: –4%; at night: –3%). Sleep was not consistently affected by the loss of <italic>appa</italic>/<italic>appb</italic> (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3–supplement 3f</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, knockout larvae for the three genes associated with early-onset AD had distinct morphological and behavioural phenotypes, with the strongest behavioural changes observed for <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts. Since both presenilins are broadly expressed in the larval brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1–supplement 3c,d</xref>), these results indicate that zebrafish Psen1- and Psen2-γ-secretases likely cleave different substrates, such as Appa/Appb which is primarily cleaved into Aβ by Psen1-γ-secretase. Moreover, the behavioural phenotypes of <italic>appa</italic>/<italic>appb</italic> and <italic>psen1</italic> knockout larvae had little overlap while they presumably both resulted in the loss of Aβ. The <italic>appa</italic>/<italic>appb</italic> day phenotype could be primarily caused by loss of some Appa/Appb cleavage product not relying on γ-secretase. Alternatively, the net effect of loss of all other Psen1-γ-secretase products could have masked the effect of loss of Aβ.</p>

(left) Unpro-cessed data. scrambled-injected larvae displaced more pixels during the startle response at lights-off compared to <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout larvae, presumably because they appeared darker to the camera (clutch 1: * p = 0.042; clutch 2: *** p &lt; 0.001, by Welch’s t-test). The ratio of the means estimated how much darker <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae were compared to scrambled-injected larvae; that is, <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae were 0.95 and 0.89× as dark as scrambled-injected larvae. (right) The ratios were then used to downscale the frame-by-frame Δ pixel data of the scrambled-injected larvae, in a sense artificially making them as faint as <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae.

<title><italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts are less active during the day and sleep less at night</title>
<p>To test whether knockout of genes associated with late-onset AD also impacted behaviour in larvae, we then generated F0 knockouts for the zebrafish orthologues of <italic>APOE</italic> (<italic>apoea</italic>/<italic>apoeb</italic>), <italic>CD2AP</italic> (<italic>cd2ap</italic>), <italic>CLU</italic> (<italic>clu</italic>), and <italic>SORL1</italic> (<italic>sorl1</italic>).</p>
<p><italic>APOE</italic> shares 22–25% amino acid identity with its two zebrafish orthologues, <italic>apoea</italic> and <italic>apoeb</italic> (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4–supplement 2a,b</xref>). To make <italic>apoea</italic>/<italic>apoeb</italic> double F0 knockouts, we targeted each gene at two loci in separate exons with highly mutagenic CRISPR-Cas9 RNPs (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4–supplement 2c,d</xref>). Consistently across three clutches, double <italic>apoea</italic>/<italic>apoeb</italic> F0 knockout larvae performed slightly more subdued swimming bouts during the day than scrambled-injected siblings (active bout mean: −4%; active bout maximum: −5% vs. scrambled; <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4–supplement 2e</xref>). This slight hypoactivity is unlikely to reflect a motor defect because at night, <italic>apoea</italic>/<italic>apoeb</italic> knockouts performed more swimming bouts (+31%) and had less sleep (−7%, <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4–supplement 2e</xref>) than controls.</p>
<p>Knockout of other early-onset AD risk genes also impacted behaviour, especially at night. We mutated zebrafish <italic>cd2ap</italic> (44% identical amino acid sequence vs. human CD2AP; <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4–supplement 3a</xref>), at three loci on distinct exons (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4–supplement 3b</xref>). While the two clutches of <italic>cd2ap</italic> F0 knockouts gave generally inconsistent results, knockout larvae of both clutches were more active (time active: +38%; total activity: +44% vs. scrambled) and slept less at night than control siblings (−13%), mainly because they performed more swimming bouts (+34%, <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4–supplement 3c</xref>). Similarly, knockout of <italic>clu</italic> (39% identical amino acid sequence vs. human CLU, <xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4–supplement 4a</xref>) did not strongly affect behaviour during the day (<xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4–supplement 4c</xref>), despite a particularly high rate of frameshift mutations at all three targeted loci (<xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4–supplement 4b</xref>). At night, <italic>clu</italic> F0 knockouts were slightly more active (time active: +12% vs. scrambled) and slept less than control siblings (−7%, <xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4–supplement 4c</xref>). Finally, we generated F0 knockouts for <italic>sorl1</italic> (63% identical amino acid sequence vs. human SORL1, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>) by mutating three exons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockout larvae were less active during the day but slept less at night (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4–supplement 1</xref>). Specifically, during the day (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>), <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts spent less time active than scrambled-injected larvae (−15% vs. scrambled), performing fewer swimming bouts (−15%) of approximately the same duration and intensity as controls. Sleep during the day was unaffected. At night (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>), <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts spent more time active than control siblings (+20%), largely because their swimming bouts tended to last longer (+6%). They also slept less (−5%), initiating fewer sleep bouts (−9%) of roughly the same duration.</p>
<p>In summary, we video-tracked the sleep/wake behaviours of F0 knockout larvae in four genes associated with late-onset AD: <italic>apoea</italic>/<italic>apoeb</italic>, <italic>cd2ap</italic>, <italic>clu</italic>, and <italic>sorl1</italic>. Remarkably, loss of all four genes produced a fairly consistent phenotype at night (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4–supplement 5</xref>), with all knockout larvae spending 5–13% less time asleep and instead spending 12–38% more time active because they were moving 13–34% more often. In contrast, each mutant had distinct day-time behavioural alterations. Comparing with early-onset genes, <italic>psen1</italic> knockouts had similar night-time phenotypes, but loss of <italic>psen2</italic> or <italic>appa</italic>/<italic>appb</italic> had no effect on night-time sleep. Therefore, at least some late-onset (and one early-onset) Alzheimer’s risk genes have common effects on sleep from an early age, despite being expressed in different tissues and having distinct biochemical properties.</p>

<title>From behavioural fingerprint to causal process: serotonin signalling disruption by the loss of Sorl1</title>
<p>From genomic studies of AD, we know that mutations in genes such as <italic>SORL1</italic> modify risk by disrupting some biological processes. Presumably, the same processes are disrupted in zebrafish <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts, and some caused the behavioural alterations we observed. Can we now follow the thread backwards and predict some of the biological processes in which Sorl1 is involved based on the behavioural profile of <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts?</p>
<p>To predict disrupted biological processes from the <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout behavioural profile, we developed a behavioural pharmacology approach based on a database of 5,756 small molecule behavioural fingerprints (3,674 unique compounds) obtained in wild-type larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. First, we used information from the Therapeutic Target Database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> to annotate each compound with its indications (e.g. triprolidine is used to treat hay fever), targets (e.g. triprolidine targets the histamine H1 receptor), and the pathways it affects through its targets (e.g. triprolidine affects the “inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels”). Second, we converted the frame-by-frame behavioural fingerprint of <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts to the one-minute format used by the database. We then compared the mean <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout fingerprint with each small molecule behavioural fingerprint, creating a ranked list from the small molecule fingerprint most similar to the <italic>sorl1</italic> fingerprint (SU6656: cosine similarity = 0.83) to the small molecule fingerprint most opposite to the <italic>sorl1</italic> fingerprint (flumazenil: cos = −0.80). Third, we tested using a custom permutation test whether specific indication, target, or pathway annotations were significantly enriched at the top and/or the bottom of the ranked list. More present among the small molecules most (anti-)correlating with the <italic>sorl1</italic> fingerprint were drugs used to treat depression (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5–supplement 1a</xref>, simulated p-value = 0.0129), targeting the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,b</xref>, simulated p-value = 0.0112), and affecting the “serotonergic synapse” pathway (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5– supplement 1b</xref>, simulated p-value = 0.0003). Thus, <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout larvae behaved similarly to larvae treated with small molecules targeting serotonin signalling, suggesting that the loss of Sorl1 disrupted serotonin signalling.</p>
<p>If serotonin signalling is disrupted in <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts, they should react differently to serotonergic drugs than wild-type animals. To test this hypothesis, we treated <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts and controls with citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used to treat depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Citalopram binds the serotonin transporter SLC6A4, preventing the reuptake of serotonin from the synaptic cleft. At a low dose of citalopram (1 µM, added directly to the fish water), <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts and scrambled-injected controls reacted similarly, sleeping about 1.1 hr more during both day and night (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). In contrast, at a higher dose of citalopram (10 µM) <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts had a stronger reaction than their control siblings. For example, sleep during the day increased 2.5× in <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts, while it only increased 2.2× in controls. The heightened sensitivity of <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts to citalopram was also apparent when taking all parameters into account by measuring each larva’s Euclidean distance from the average H2O-treated sibling of same genotype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). Indeed, 10 µM citalopram displaced the <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout larvae further from their behavioural baseline than it pushed controls from theirs. Thus, our behavioural pharmacology approach correctly predicted from behaviour alone that serotonin signalling was disrupted in <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts.</p>
<p>There are at least two ways <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts could be more sensitive to citalopram. First, compared to wild types, <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts could undergo a larger spike of serotonin in the synaptic cleft when reuptake is blocked. This may be because <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts synthesise more serotonin, either because they have more serotonergic neurons or a higher expression of the enzymes required to make serotonin, or because they produce less of the serotonin transporter, making them more sensitive to citalopram as a given dose would inhibit a larger proportion of the transporter than in wild-type animals. Second, <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts may be overly sensitive to serotonin itself because post-synaptic neurons have higher levels of serotonin receptors.</p>
<p>To distinguish between these two hypotheses, we used HCR to label serotonergic neurons by tagging mRNA coding for tryptophan hydroxylases (in zebrafish: <italic>tph1a</italic>, <italic>tph1b</italic>, <italic>tph2</italic>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>), an enzyme required for the synthesis of serotonin, and serotonin transporters by tagging <italic>slc6a4a</italic> and <italic>slc6a4b</italic> mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5–supplement 1c</xref>). We registered the brain stacks to a common atlas (Zebrafish Brain Browser) and segmented them into 168 anatomical regions. In each region with expression, we counted the number of positive voxels and measured the total signal intensity in each channel (channel 1: <italic>tph1a</italic> + <italic>tph1b</italic> + <italic>tph2</italic>; channel 2: <italic>slc6a4a</italic> + <italic>slc6a4b</italic>). <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts had slightly more (+2%) <italic>slc6a4a</italic>/<italic>b</italic> positive voxels than controls across regions, but this difference was not definite for any one region and not replicated when looking at total signal intensity (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5–supplement 1d</xref>). <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts had on average 18% lower <italic>tph1a</italic>/<italic>1b</italic>/<italic>2</italic> signal intensities across regions, particularly in the hypothalamus (hypothalamus – caudal zone 1: –24%, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e,f</xref>). Therefore, although we see small differences in the levels of serotonin transporters or synthesis enzymes, these were opposite to our hypotheses so do not readily explain the heightened sensitivity of <italic>sorl1</italic> to citalopram. Additionally, at least one study did not find changes in serotonin levels in the striatum of <italic>SORL1</italic> knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, and we did not find genes related to serotonin signalling to be differentially expressed in a bulk RNA-seq dataset of <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout zebrafish brains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Ruling out the first hypothesis, <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts may react excessively to a given spike in serotonin.</p>

<title>From behavioural fingerprint to candidate therapeutic: betamethasone rescues the <italic>psen2</italic> behavioural phenotype</title>
<p>In addition to pointing to the disrupted pathways, behavioural pharmacology can also predict small molecules that may normalise mutant behavioural phenotypes by pointing to compounds that generate the opposite behavioural fingerprint in wild-type larvae.</p>
<p>Using this approach, we sought to identify compounds capable of normalising the behavioural alterations of <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts, such as the increased day-time sleep. We ranked the 5,756 small molecule behavioural fingerprints in comparison with the mean <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout fingerprint and focused on compounds that generated the most opposite (anti-correlating) fingerprint when applied on wild-type larvae. This identified three compounds with a high negative cosine compared to <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref rid="figs16" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6– supplement 1a</xref>): tinidazole (minimum cos = −0.85), fenoprofen (minimum cos = −0.74), and betamethasone (minimum cos = −0.74). These compounds were also selected because they were each replicated at least once in the database, lending confidence to the prediction. We then applied the three compounds on <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockouts and measured their effects on sleep/wake parameters. For each treatment, we grouped the behavioural parameters into four categories: “rescue” if the parameter was significantly altered in DMSO-treated <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae but got normalised by the drug; “missed rescue” if the <italic>psen2</italic> knockout parameter remained altered after drug treatment; “side effect” if a parameter was unaffected in <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts but got altered by the drug; and “no effect” if the parameter was unaffected in <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts and remained unchanged by the drug.</p>
<p>All three compounds normalised at least some aspects of the <italic>psen2</italic> knockout behavioural phenotype. Tinidazole did not reduce the abnormally high day-time sleep characteristic of <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref> left). It rescued the swimming bout alterations (active bout parameters) during the day but not at night. Overall, the compound barely caused any side effect but only rescued a small aspect of the <italic>psen2</italic> knockout phenotype (9/18 altered parameters rescued). Fenoprofen performed worse (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref> middle, 8/18 altered parameters rescued), rescuing some of the swimming bout alterations during the day but aggravating them at night. Furthermore, fenoprofen made <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae drowsier than they were during the day, causing sleep to increase further and activity to decrease. Strikingly, betamethasone completely resolved the excess day-time sleep without causing hyperactivity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref> and <xref rid="figs16" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6–supplement 1b</xref>). Betamethasone rescued most, but not all, of the swimming bout alterations during both the day and night (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref> right, 14/18 altered parameters rescued). Betamethasone did cause a few side effects, likely by making <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae overly aroused at the start of the night, extending sleep latency and decreasing the slope in activity and the startle response. Therefore, of the three drugs we selected using behavioural pharmacology, one almost completely normalised the <italic>psen2</italic> knockout phenotype, albeit with a few side effects.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The F0 knockout and behavioural pharmacology approach was able to successfully predict a signalling pathway that was disrupted by knockout of the Alzheimer’s risk gene <italic>sorl1</italic> and identify a drug capable of normalising the <italic>psen2</italic> knockout behavioural phenotype. To allow researchers to generate pharmacological predictions from their own sleep/wake datasets, we built an online app (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://francoiskroll.shinyapps.io/zoltar/">francoiskroll.shinyapps.io/zoltar/</ext-link>) that can plot behavioural fingerprints, rank all 5,756 small molecule fingerprints in the database in comparison to the query fingerprint, and perform permutation tests for enrichment of indications, drug targets, and KEGG pathways (<xref rid="figs17" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7–supplement 1a,b</xref>). While we used genes associated with AD as a case study, predictive behavioural pharmacology provides a generalisable framework that can be applied to any set of disease risk genes.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Disrupted sleep and serotonin signalling—causal processes of Alzheimer’s disease?</title>
<p>Of the seven genes tested, <italic>psen1</italic> and all four late-onset Alzheimer’s risk genes tested decreased sleep duration at night when mutated in zebrafish larvae. Could disrupted sleep itself be a causal process in AD? AD patients often take longer to fall asleep, have higher sleep fragmentation, and spend sharply less time in NREM sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Sleep disruption can be present before the onset of cognitive deficits. For example, very high sleep fragmentation in elderly people is associated with subsequent diagnosis of AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Experiments on humans and animal models also point to disrupted sleep being a causal process in some cases. In healthy adults, one night of sleep deprivation was sufficient to cause a 25–30% increase in Aβ signal on PET scans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, a ∼30% increase in CSF concentrations of Aβ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>, and a ∼50% increase in CSF concentrations of tau<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. In wild-type rats and mice overexpressing mutated human <italic>APP</italic> and <italic>PSEN1</italic>, restricting sleep for 21 days increased Aβ deposits in the cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Conversely, pharmaceutically or chemogenetically consolidating sleep in AD mouse models for 1–2 months delayed Aβ plaque formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Disrupted sleep is therefore likely to be a causal process in AD. Can it become a therapeutic target? An ongoing clinical trial (NCT04629547) is underway to test whether suvorexant, an orexin receptor antagonist that increases sleep, can reduce Aβ accumulation by consolidating sleep in older adults without dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Our observation that disruption of genes associated with AD diagnosis after 65 years reduces sleep in 7-day zebrafish larvae suggest that disrupted sleep may be a common mechanism through which these genes exert an effect on risk. Impaired sleep early in life may be especially deleterious as it is likely essential for brain development: infants spend most of their time asleep during the first year of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Incidentally, infants who are <italic>APOE ε4</italic> carriers show differences in grey matter volume and myelin content in multiple brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. Differences are also present in children 9–17 years old who carry the disease-causing <italic>PSEN1</italic> E280A mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Future work should assess whether sleep is impaired in infants at higher genetic risk of AD and whether it is related to these structural differences.</p>

</fig>
<p>Our behavioural pharmacology approach also predicted that loss of Sorl1 impaired serotonin signalling, which was confirmed by increased sensitivity of <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts to citalopram. SORL1 acts as an adaptor protein between retromer and several cargo proteins, such as APP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, GDNF receptor α1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, and glutamate receptor 1 (GLUA1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Retromer is a large protein complex which ‘rescues’ proteins from endosomes, targeting them to recycling instead of lysosomal digestion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. By disrupting retromer function, mutations in SORL1 disrupt endosomal recycling, which appears as swelling of early endosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. As a result, APP remains in endosomes for longer, where it is more likely to be cleaved by β-secretase, the first step towards production of Aβ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. Similarly, retromer dysfunction also lowers the level of GLUA1 receptors on the neuron membrane, likely because endocytosed receptors are not recycled back to the membrane, which can result in both increased or decreased firing rates <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. We speculate that some serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptors are also recycled via retromer and SORL1. Consequently, <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts would react differently to a large spike in serotonin (citalopram treatment) as they have different levels of 5-HT receptors on the synaptic membrane. In support for this idea, both 5-HT type 4 receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> and SORL1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup> interact with sorting nexin 27, a subunit of retromer. Furthermore, the 5-HT receptor type 2 was also an enriched target for <italic>sorl1</italic> (simulated p-value = 0.046). Other observations are consistent with serotonin signalling being a causal process of AD. For example, treatment of an AD mouse model with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram caused a rapid decrease in Aβ concentrations in the ISF and eventually reduced amyloid plaque load. Additionally, humans treated with SSRIs within the past 5 years had significantly lower cortical amyloid plaque load on PET scans, suggesting a causal relationship<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. While much work remains to be done, SSRIs can generally be used continuously with no adverse effects, so modulating serotonin signalling may be an attractive approach to reduce Aβ levels for years before the onset of cognitive symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Limitations and future directions for predictive behavioural pharmacology</title>
<p>Currently, the hypotheses that our behavioural pharmacology approach can test are limited by the small molecule screen dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, which was biased towards specific themes and targets. For example, of 1,551 compounds with an annotated target, 60 (3.8%) target the dopamine D2 receptor but only 1 (0.06%) targets mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP1, 2, 3). Consequently, the approach presumably has high sensitivity for disruptions in dopamine signalling, while some hypotheses, such as impairment in mitochondrial coupling, are never formally tested. Broadly, this means that a negative (non-significant) result may not be meaningful if the biological process in question is underrepresented. Additionally, about 30% of the annotated compounds in the database have more than one target. While this is not necessarily an issue when the goal is to find any small molecule which rescues the phenotype, this lack of specificity likely blurs the signal from modulation of a specific target to effect on behaviour. For example, all five compounds which target the histamine H4 receptor also target the histamine H3 receptor, so if the H3 receptor is detected as significantly enriched, the H4 receptor is certain to be significant too, regardless of whether the H4 receptor is indeed specifically disrupted. To develop the biological process prediction, future work should focus on selecting specific agonists and antagonists for a set list of targets, such as the compound VUF-6002 to selectively target the histamine H4 receptor without also activating H3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A way to improve the specificity of the approach is to enhance the resolution of the behaviour tracking so that targets which give similar but unique effects on behaviour can be distinguished. We introduced the FramebyFrame R package to enable analysis at sub-second resolution, but the original small molecule screen dataset was collected at the one-minute resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, so comparing a new behavioural profile to the small molecule database first involves losing resolution to make the fingerprints comparable. During a new small molecule screen, one could use SLEAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> or DeepLabCut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup> to extract additional behavioural parameters from video recordings such as speed or position in the well. A faster and higher definition camera could be introduced to allow fine tracking of tail and eye movements. Exposing the larvae to various stimuli is also a way to increase the number of parameters while avoiding redundancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. With more behavioural parameters, the prediction of therapeutics using behavioural pharmacology would also be more precise and the detection of possible behavioural side effects more thorough. Analytically, an improvement could be to represent larval behaviour as a sequence of movements, rather than parameter averages. For example, the Δ pixel time course from our experiments can be encoded as a sequence of bout types termed modules, themselves organised in motifs which are 2–20-module long<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Alternatively, behaviour could be represented as sequences of known types of swimming bouts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup> or automatically discovered ‘syllables’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>. In mouse, this sequence representation was better than a fingerprint one at differentiating similar compounds or even doses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>, so should also improve the predictive power of the behavioural pharmacology approach.</p>
<p>This leads to a thought experiment: assuming absolute resolution in behaviour tracking, does every knockout give a unique effect on behaviour? In other words, are there ∼26,000 distinct knockout fingerprints or do multiple genes converge on a smaller set of possible fingerprints? How much resolution is required to distinguish every possible fingerprint?</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, we present a behavioural pharmacology approach which uses the sleep/wake behaviour of zebrafish larvae as a tool to translate genomic findings into druggable biological processes and candidate therapeutics. We used Alzheimer’s risk genes, especially <italic>SORL1</italic> and <italic>PSEN2</italic>, as case studies and correctly predicted mutant-drug interactions from behaviour alone. Our strategy is both scalable thanks to the F0 knockout method and the FramebyFrame analysis package and generalisable beyond AD through the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ZOLTARapp">ZOLTAR app</ext-link>. Other neurological conditions for which many risk genes are known, such as autism, epilepsy, or schizophrenia, are prime candidates for the application of the strategy.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Adult zebrafish were reared by University College London’s Fish Facility on a 14 hr:10 hr light:dark cycle. To obtain eggs, pairs of one female and one male were isolated in breeding boxes overnight, separated by a divider. Around 9 AM (lights on) the next day, the dividers were removed and eggs were collected 7–10 min later. The embryos were then raised in 10-cm Petri dishes filled with fish water (0.3 g/L Instant Ocean) in a 28.5°C incubator on a 14 hr:10 hr light:dark cycle. Debris and dead or dysmorphic embryos were removed every other day with a Pasteur pipette under a bright-field microscope and the fish water replaced. At the end of the experiments, larvae were euthanised with an overdose of 2-phenoxyethanol (ACROS Organics). Experimental procedures were in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 under Home Office project licences PA8D4D0E5 and PP6325955 awarded to Jason Rihel. Adult zebrafish were kept according to FELASA guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>crRNA selection</title>
<p>The crRNA was the only component of the Cas9/gRNA RNP specific to the target locus.</p>
<p>In previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, we selected predesigned crRNAs from the Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eu.idtdna.com">eu.idtdna.com</ext-link>) based on predicted on-target and off-target scores calculated by a proprietary IDT algorithm. Subsequent benchmarking in zebrafish of various crRNA design algorithms revealed that the IDT on-target scores did not predict mutagenesis rates <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. All crRNAs used in F0 knockout experiments were therefore designed using CHOPCHOP (chopchop.cbu.uib.no)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup> implementing both the on-target score calculation by CRISPRScan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>, which benchmarking determined was the best predictor of mutagenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>, and inDelphi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>, which predicts to some extent the generated mutations in zebrafish embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We prioritised targeting asymmetrical exons and only selected crRNAs without any off-targets with 0, 1, 2, or 3 mismatches, as off-targets with up to 3 mismatches may undergo mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>. We then selected the crRNAs based on their on-target score and the prediction of frameshift mutations by inDelphi (crRNAs used had 82.8 ± 5.7% predicted frameshift mutation rate). We also used SNPfisher, an online database of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in zebrafish wild-type strains, to check that putative target sites did not contain any SNP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A protocol describing how to select crRNAs based on these developments is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.81wgb6r5qlpk/v1">dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.81wgb6r5qlpk/v1</ext-link>.

<title>Cas9/gRNA preparation</title>
<p>A protocol describing how to generate F0 knockout larvae is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.5qpvo52wdl4o/v3">dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.5qpvo52wdl4o/v3</ext-link>.</p>
<p>The CRISPR-Cas9 RNP was made of three components bought from IDT: the crRNA (Alt-R® CRISPR-Cas9 crRNA) and tracrRNA (Alt-R® CRISPR-Cas9 tracrRNA), together forming the gRNA, and the Cas9 (Alt-R® S.p. Cas9 Nuclease V3). The crRNA and tracrRNA were received as pellets, which were individually resuspended in Duplex buffer (IDT, received with the tracrRNA) to form 200 μM stocks. Stocks of crRNA and tracrRNA were stored at −70°C before use. Cas9 was stored at –20°C before use. Each crRNA was annealed separately with the tracrRNA by mixing 1 μL crRNA 200 μM; 1 μL tracrRNA 200 μM; 1.28 μL Duplex buffer. The mix was heated to 95°C for 5 min, then cooled on ice, to obtain a 61 μM gRNA solution. The gRNA solutions were then mixed in equal volumes with Cas9 (1 μL gRNA 61 μM; 1 μL Cas9 61 μM directly from the IDT vial), incubated at 37°C for 5 min then cooled on ice, generating three 30.5 μM RNP solutions. The three RNP solutions were pooled; the final concentration of each RNP in the pool was thus 10.2 μM and the total RNP concentration 30.5 μM.</p>
<p>The RNPs were usually kept overnight in a 4°C fridge on ice before injections the following day. Some experiments used RNPs stored at –70°C for a few weeks.</p>
<p>For experiments targeting two genes simultaneously (<italic>appa</italic>/<italic>appb</italic>, <italic>psen1</italic>/<italic>psen2</italic>, <italic>apoea</italic>/<italic>apoeb</italic>), we targeted each gene at two loci to potentially reduce unviability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. While mutating two loci instead of three is predicted to reduce rates of complete biallelic knockout animals, given the high rate of frameshift mutations achieved with the RNPs that were used, ∼90% of injected animals were still expected to be complete biallelic knockouts. Across loci that were mutated during double F0 knockout experiments, 97.5 ± 7.0% of the reads were mutated, and 78.9 ± 24.0% of all reads had a frameshift mutation; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://francoiskroll.shinyapps.io/frameshiftmodel/">francoiskroll.shinyapps.io/frameshiftmodel/</ext-link> for the theoretical knockout rate prediction. The preparation followed the same steps as above. The four RNP solutions were pooled, so the final concentration of each RNP in the pool was 7.6 µM and the total RNP concentration was 30.5 µM.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b3">
<title>Injections</title>
<p>Approximately 1 nL of the three-RNP pool was injected into the yolk at the single-cell stage before cell inflation. This amounts to ∼30.5 fmol of RNP (30.5 fmol [5029 pg] of Cas9 and 30.5 fmol [1070 pg] of total gRNA). Each unique RNP was present in equal amounts in the pool. Therefore, in the case of three RNPs, ∼10.2 fmol of each RNP were co-injected.</p>
<p>When targeting two genes simultaneously, approximately 1.3 nL of the four-RNP mix were injected so the amount of RNP per gene would remain equal to when a single gene is targeted at three loci.</p>
<p>The injected eggs were kept at ∼20°C for ∼50 min after injection before transfer to a 28.5°C incubator, as delaying the first cell division by lowering the temperature was tentatively shown to increase mutagenesis and reduce the diversity of alleles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b4">
<title>Scrambled RNPs</title>
<p>In all F0 knockout experiments, three or four non-targeting, ‘scrambled’, crRNAs were prepared into RNPs and injected following the same steps as above. These were created by shuffling the spacer sequence of existing crRNAs until the only predicted targets had 4 or more mismatches in protein-coding sequences, or 3 or more in non-coding sequences. Sequences of the scrambled crRNAs are available in Supplementary file 1.</p>

<title>Preparation of samples for Illumina MiSeq</title>
<p>We sequenced every targeted locus in samples of F0 knockout larvae using Illumina MiSeq. For <italic>psen1</italic>, <italic>psen2</italic>, <italic>apoea</italic>, and <italic>apoeb</italic>, the samples were from video-tracked larvae. For <italic>appa</italic>, <italic>appb</italic>, <italic>cd2ap</italic>, <italic>clu</italic>, and <italic>sorl1</italic>, we generated F0 knockout larvae expressly to be sequenced. For each locus, we prepared 5–6 F0 knockout samples and 2–3 scrambled-injected samples. Individual larvae were sequenced at the three or four mutated loci.</p>
<p>The larvae were anaesthetised and their genomic DNA extracted by HotSHOT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup> as follows. Individual larvae were transferred to a 96-well PCR plate or strips of 12 tubes. Excess liquid was removed from each well before adding 50 μl of 1× base solution (25 mM KOH, 0.2 mM EDTA in water). Plates were sealed and incubated at 95°C for 30 min then cooled to room temperature before the addition of 50 μL of 1× neutralisation solution (40 mM Tris-HCl in water). Genomic DNA was then stored at –20°C.</p>
<p>PCR primers were designed for each target locus using Primer-BLAST (NCBI) to amplify a window of 150–200 bp with at least 30 bp between each primer binding site and the predicted double-strand break site, as this is where most deletions are found<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. PCR primers were ordered with a Nextera overhang at the 5′-end of each primer to allow indexing (see Supplementary file 1).</p>
<p>Each PCR well contained: 7.98 μL PCR mix (2 mM MgCl2, 14 mM pH 8.4 Tris-HCl, 68 mM KCl, 0.14% gelatine in water, autoclaved for 20 min, cooled to room temperature, chilled on ice, then added 1.8% 100 mg/mL BSA and 0.14% 100 mM d[A, C, G, T]TP), 3 μL 5× Phusion HF buffer (New England Biolabs), 2.7 μL dH2O, 0.3 μL forward primer (100 μM), 0.3 μL reverse primer (100 μM), 0.12 μL Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs), 1.0 μL genomic DNA; for a total of 15.4 μL. The PCR plate was sealed and placed into a thermocycler. The PCR program was: 95°C – 5 min, then 40 cycles of: 95°C – 30 sec, 60°C – 30 sec, 72°C – 30 sec, then 72°C – 10 min, then cooled to 10°C until collection. The PCR product’s concentration was quantified with Qubit (dsDNA High Sensitivity or Broad Range Assay) and its length was verified on a 2.5% agarose gel with GelRed (Biotium). Excess primers and dNTPs were removed by ExoSAP-IT (ThermoFisher) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were then sent for Illumina MiSeq, which used MiSeq Reagent Nano Kit v2 (300 Cycles).</p>

<title>Illumina MiSeq data analysis</title>
<p>Illumina MiSeq data was received as two fastq files for each well, one forward and one reverse. The paired-end reads were aligned to the reference amplicon with bwa v0.7.17 and the resulting bam alignment file was sorted and indexed with samtools v1.11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup>. Alignments were then filtered to keep only reads with less than 20% of its length soft-clipped and spanning at least 20 bp on each side of the predicted Cas9 double-strand break site, 4 bp upstream of the ‘N’ of the NGG protospacer adjacent motif. Whenever necessary, bam alignment files were visualised with IGV v2.16.0. The resulting filtered bam file was converted back to a forward and a reverse fastq file using bedtools v2.30.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup>. The filtered fastq files were used as input to the R package ampliCan v1.20.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref></sup>, together with a csv configuration file containing metadata information about the samples. AmpliCan was run with settings min_freq = 0.005 (any mutation at a frequency below this threshold was considered as a sequencing error), cut_buffer = 12 (any insertion/deletion starting within ±12 bp of the PAM may be Cas9-generated), and event_filter = FALSE (no filtering of reads), as the reads were already filtered. AmpliCan can normalise mutation counts by ignoring any insertion/deletion found in control samples. On rare occasions, this could artefactually decrease mutation counts in F0 knockout samples because of low-level contamination in control samples (e.g. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, locus 1, sample scr1) so we turned this feature off. Instead, we manually checked the scrambled-injected samples in IGV to confirm that there were no insertions or deletions already present in the wild-type background. AmpliCan detected and counted mutations in the reads and wrote results files that were used for subsequent analysis. Any sample with less than 20× paired-end (40× single-read) coverage were excluded from plots and subsequent analysis. Figures like <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c,d</xref> plot the proportion of mutated reads and the proportion of reads with a frameshift mutation at each locus, as computed by ampliCan. If a read contained multiple indels, ampliCan summed them to conclude whether the read had a frameshift mutation or not.</p>

<title>Behavioural video-tracking</title>
<p>In F0 knockout experiments, wild-type embryos from separate clutches were injected at the single-cell stage with CRISPR-Cas9 RNPs. Each clutch was from a unique pair of parents allowed to mate for 7–10 min. For each clutch, about half of the embryos were injected with non-targeting ‘scrambled’ RNPs to generate control siblings. Clutch-to-clutch variability in locomotor activity is substantial in zebrafish larvae, even between wild-type clutches of the same strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref></sup>. Therefore, keeping clutches from different parents/mating events separate is predicted to increase sensitivity of the assay by reducing variability. More generally, it is crucial never to perform comparisons where treatment larvae (e.g. mutant, transgenic, drug-treated) are from one clutch and the control larvae are from another (i.e. controls are not siblings), as any difference discovered with such an experimental design could be caused by clutch-to-clutch variability.</p>
<p>At 5 dpf, individual larvae were transferred to the wells of 3D-printed mesh-bottom plates (see <italic>3D-printed 96-well mesh-bottom plate</italic>), each sitting in the water bath of a ZebraBox (ViewPoint Behavior Technology). To avoid any potential localisation bias during the tracking, F0 knockout and scrambled-injected larvae were plated in alternating columns of the 96-well plate. From each well, the video-tracking software (ZebraLab, ViewPoint Behavior Technology) recorded the number of pixels that changed intensity between successive frames. To be counted, a pixel must have changed grey value above a sensitivity threshold, which was set at 20. The metric, termed Δ pixel, describes each animal’s behaviour over time as a sequence of zeros and positive values, denoting if the larva was still or moving. In ZebraLab, the <italic>freeze</italic> setting was set to 3 and the <italic>burst</italic> setting was set to 200. However, note that these settings determine how the Δ pixel data is summarised into number of seconds active per minute by the software (<italic>middur</italic> parameter, see <italic>One-minute vs. frame-by-frame</italic>); therefore, their values are irrelevant when analysing the data using the FramebyFrame package. Tracking was performed at 25 frames per second on a 14 hr:10 hr light:dark cycle for ∼65 hours, generating sequences of roughly 5,850,000 Δ pixel values per animal. During the experiment, a pump on a timer (Kollea Automatic Watering System, Amazon UK) injected fish water from a reservoir to the bath every morning around 9 AM (lights on) to counteract water evaporation. Water could overflow through an exit pipe, whose height was adjusted to set the water level in the bath. The day light level was calibrated at 555 lux with a RS PRO RS-92 light meter (RS Components). Night was in complete darkness with infrared lighting for video recording. Temperature and light transitions were recorded with a HOBO Pendant (Onset Data Loggers) immersed in the water bath. Temperature throughout the experiment was 23–26°C.</p>
<p>At the end of the tracking, we inspected the larvae under a bright-field microscope and excluded from analysis any larva that did not appear healthy or was not responsive to a light touch with a P10 tip. We then randomly selected 2–3 scrambled-injected and 5–6 F0 knockout larvae for sequencing of the targeted loci (see <italic>Preparation of samples for Illumina MiSeq</italic>).</p>

<title>Behavioural video-tracking with drug treatment</title>
<p>This refers to the experiment treating <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts with citalopram (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c,d</xref>) and the experiment treating <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockouts with tinidazole, fenoprofen, and betamethasone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref rid="figs16" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6–supplement 1b</xref>). Broadly, video-tracking was performed as above (see <italic>Behavioural video-tracking</italic>) but larvae were housed in standard 96-square well plates (Whatman) in fish water with drug. Water was topped up every morning shortly after 9 AM (lights on).</p>
<p>Citalopram hydrobromide (Fisher Scientific, #15732987) was stored at room temperature before use. We chose the treatment concentrations (1 µM and 10 µM) based on previous work in zebrafish larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref></sup> that found that the minimum dose which had a discernible effect on locomotor activity was 373 µg/L (0.92 µM). A 500× stock (5 mM) for the 10 µM treatment was prepared by diluting 0.0203 g in 10 mL dH2O (molecular weight = 405.3 g/mol). The 5 mM solution was then diluted 1:10 (100 µL citalopram 5 mM + 900 µL dH2O) to obtain a 500× stock (500 µM) for the 1 µM treatment. Using a P1000 pipet with a tip whose end was cut-off, individual 5-dpf larvae were transferred in 650 µL fish water to the wells of clear 96-square well plates (Whatman). 1.3 µL of each 500× stock was added on top of each well, effectively diluting each stock 1:500 (5 mM stock diluted to 1 µM and 500 µM stock diluted to 10 µM). Control wells were topped-up with 1.3 µL dH2O.</p>
<p>Tinidazole (Fisher Scientific, #16594384) was stored at room temperature before use. We chose the treatment concentration (30 µM) based on a preliminary experiment where we video-tracked wild-type larvae treated with 10 µM, 30 µM, 100 µM tinidazole (data not shown). A 50 mM solution was prepared by diluting 0.0247 g in 2 mL DMSO (molecular weight = 247.27 g/mol), then diluted this solution to 15 mM in DMSO as 500× stock.</p>
<p>Fenoprofen calcium salt hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, #F1517) was stored at room temperature before use. We chose 15 µM as the treatment concentration based on the results from the Rihel et al., 2010 small molecule behavioural screen database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. A 200 mM solution was prepared by diluting 0.1114 g in 1065 µL DMSO (molecular weight = 522.6 g/mol), then diluting this solution to 7.5 mM in DMSO as 500× stock.</p>
<p>Betamethasone (Cayman Chemical, #20363) was stored at –20°C before use. We chose 15 µM as the treatment concentration based on the results from the Rihel et al., 2010 small molecule behavioural screen database. A 33 mM solution was prepared by diluting 0.0204 g in 1,575 µL DMSO (molecular weight = 393.5 g/mol), then diluting this solution to 7.5 mM in DMSO as 500× stock.</p>
<p>For tinidazole, fenoprofen, and betamethasone, 100 µL of each 500× stock was then mixed in 20 mL fish water in a Falcon, and the solution transferred to one Petri dish per drug. A Petri dish for control larvae was prepared by mixing 100 µL of DMSO in 20 mL fish water. Using a P1000 pipet with a tip whose end was cut-off, individual 5-dpf larvae were transferred in 500 µL fish water to the Petri dishes. Each Petri dish was then topped-up with fish water to 50 mL final volume, which effectively diluted each drug to the final treatment concentration (100 µL 500× stock in 50 mL fish water). The final DMSO concentration was 0.002% (100 µL 100% DMSO in 50 mL fish water). Using a P1000 pipet with a tip whose end was cut-off, individual larvae were then transferred in 650 µL to the 96-square well plates. This process was to avoid adding drug in DMSO directly to the well as the solution sinks in water and may not mix properly.</p>
<p>Video-tracking was then performed with the same settings as above (see <italic>Behavioural video-tracking</italic>). Both mornings shortly after 9 AM (lights on), the wells were manually topped-up with fish water (no drug), which assumes that the drug does not evaporate and was stable in fish water at 23–26°C for a few days.</p>

<title>Behavioural data analysis</title>
<p>Behavioural data analysis was performed using the FramebyFrame R package v0.11.0. A tutorial and documentation are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/francoiskroll/FramebyFrame">github.com/francoiskroll/FramebyFrame</ext-link>. The important steps of the analysis are summarised below.</p>
<p>The raw file generated by the ZebraLab software was exported into thousands of xls files each containing 1 million rows of data. Each row of data represented the Δ pixel of one larva at one frame transition. Using the vpSorter(…) function, these data were re-organised in a large csv file where each column was a well, each row was a frame transition, and each cell a Δ pixel value. To visualise activity over time, we smoothed the Δ pixel time course for each larva with a 60-min (∼45,000 rows) rolling average and binned the data by summing Δ pixels in 10-min epochs. We generated the activity trace of individual larvae using ggActivityTraceGrid(…) and excluded from subsequent analysis any larva that had an obviously aberrant behaviour, defined as having missed entirely a day-night transition (no jump/drop in the activity trace) or having shown activity during a day lower than the previous night. Each well was assigned to a group using a metadata file generated by genotypeGenerator(…). For each 10-min epoch, we calculated the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) across larvae in each group to build the activity traces (e.g. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref> left).</p>
<p>Sleep was measured on the large csv file containing all the frame-by-frame Δ pixel data. A 60-second (∼1,500 rows) rolling sum was applied on the Δ pixel time course of each larva, so that any data point that became zero indicated that the previous 60 seconds of Δ pixels were all zeros, that is, a sleep bout started exactly 60 seconds ago. The data after the rolling sum was converted into a series of Booleans: <italic>true</italic> if the data point was 0 (i.e. that frame was part of a sleep bout); <italic>false</italic> if the data point was positive (i.e. that frame was not part of a sleep bout, as the larva moved at some point in the preceding 60 seconds). At this stage, the first 0 of each sleep bout marked the frame at the 60<sup>th</sup> second of each sleep bout. Therefore, a correction was then applied to extend each sleep bout 60 seconds in the past by switching the ∼1,500 frames of <italic>false</italic> before each sleep bout start to <italic>true</italic>. The time spent asleep in 10-min epochs (∼45,000 rows) was calculated by counting the number of <italic>true</italic> frames in each epoch and multiplying the counts by 1/frame rate (typically 1/25 frames per second), which was converted into minutes for the sleep trace. For example, if larva #3 had 10,000 out of 45,000 frames marked <italic>true</italic> (i.e. these frames are part of a sleep bout) from minute 20 to 30 of tracking, that represented 10,000 × <sup>1</sup>/25 ×<sup>1</sup>/60 = 6.67 <italic>minutes asleep</italic> for that epoch. As for the activity trace, the mean and SEM across larvae in each group were calculated for each 10-min epoch to build the sleep traces (e.g. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref> right).</p>
<p>15 behavioural parameters were then calculated for each larva and day/night. Two additional parameters, startle response at sunset and sleep latency, were only defined for nights, for a total of 32 unique parameters (15 day parameters and 17 night parameters). Full days/nights during the experiment were: night0, day1, night1, day2, night2. Larvae were 5 dpf during night0, 6 dpf during day1/night1, 7 dpf during day2/night2, and the experiment was stopped in the morning of 8 dpf. Night0 (5 dpf) was excluded from the analysis as a habituation period; therefore, two day data points and two night data points were calculated for each larva and behavioural parameter. Definitions of the behavioural parameters can be found in the documentation of the FramebyFrame package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/francoiskroll/FramebyFrame">github.com/francoiskroll/FramebyFrame</ext-link>).</p>
<p>To build the behavioural fingerprints, a z-score was calculated for each day/night, each larva, and each unique parameter. For example, to calculate the z-score for parameter active bout length of larva #5 for day1, we first calculated the mean and standard deviation of all active bout length data points for control larvae during day1. These were then used to calculate larva #5’s z-score as:

<p>Where <italic>x</italic> was larva #5’s day1 data point, µ%&amp;’ was the mean of control day1 data points, <italic>σ</italic>%&amp;’was the standard deviation of control day1 data points. The calculation was repeated for day2. The day1 and day2 z-scores were then averaged to produce a common day z-score for active bout length of larva #5. The process was repeated for each unique parameter, producing 32 z-scores for each larva, which we term each larva’s behavioural fingerprint. To draw the fingerprint plots (e.g. <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3–supplement 1c</xref>), the mean and SEM of all z-scores were calculated for each unique parameter and group of larvae. By definition of the z-score, the mean z-score for the control larvae was always 0 and the SEM constant for each experiment (dependent on the number of control larvae), so the controls’ fingerprint was omitted from the plot.</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>, for each parameter, the mean and SEM of all z-scores from each clutch were calculated separately. The two z-score means and SEMs were then averaged to draw each bar. See <italic>Statistics on behavioural parameters</italic> for the definition of each category.</p>
<p>Each larva’s fingerprint can be conceptualised as the coordinates of one data point in a 32-dimension space where each dimension represents one behavioural parameter. In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, the centre of the H2O-treated scrambled-injected larvae or the centre of the H2O-treated <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockout larvae was set as the origin of this 32-dimension space (point at coordinates 0, 0, 0, …) by the z-scoring procedure. We then measured the Euclidean distance between each larva’s fingerprint and the origin.</p>

<title>Statistics on behavioural parameters</title>
<p>Each behavioural parameter was statistically compared between F0 knockout and scrambled-injected larvae using linear mixed effects (LME) modelling implemented in the lmer function of the R package lme4 v1.1.31<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>. The data were parameter values per larva per time window, for example larva #3 slept 4 hr during night2. We always tracked one unique clutch in each ZebraBox run; therefore, the replicate experiment(s) provided both technical and biological replication. The data collected during nights or during days were analysed separately. The fixed effect was the group assignment (genotype or treatment). Random effects were intercepts for clutch assignment (experiment), larva number, and the larva’s age (dpf). Random effects of clutch assignment and larva number were modelled as nested, as data points between larvae of the same clutch were expected to be more similar than between larvae of different clutches; and within each clutch, the day 1 (or night 1) data point of one larva was expected to be similar to its day 2 (or night 2) data point. The command to create the day or night model was:
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="568940v1_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>The model provided the slope and its standard error reported on top of the parameter plots (e.g. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>). A model without the fixed effect group was then created, as:
<disp-formula id="ueqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="568940v1_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>This null model was compared with the full model created above with a likelihood-ratio test, which provided the p-value reported in the figures and legends.</p>
<p>The LME analysis was informed by a published tutorial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup>. The FramebyFrame R package performs the above LME analysis when generating parameter plots with <monospace>ggParameterGrid(…)</monospace> or writing a report of LME statistics using <monospace>LMEreport(…)</monospace>.</p>
<p>The main likelihood-ratio test (see above) tested the null hypothesis that group assignment had no effect on parameter values. In experiments with more than two groups, each group was also compared to the reference group using estimated marginal means implemented in the R package emmeans, which provided the p-value.</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>, the LME analysis was performed on data from both clutches, as described above. The colour for each parameter was based on two p-values obtained using estimated marginal means: the p-value when comparing DMSO-treated scrambled-injected controls with DMSO-treated <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockouts (“knockout p-value”), and the p-value when comparing DMSO-treated scrambled-injected controls with drug-treated <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockouts (“drug p-value”), such that:

Larvae were video-tracked for a total of 208 hr, first on a 14 hr:10 hr light:dark cycle for 63 hr then in constant dim light at 30 lux for 145 hr for the free-running segment. In the afternoon of the first day in constant dim conditions, we removed most of the water from the bath using a 10 mL Pasteur pipette, replaced with fresh fish water, and added another 50 mL of filtered paramecia.

<title>In situ hybridization chain reaction</title>
<p><italic>In situ</italic> hybridization chain reaction (HCR) probes were designed as described by Choi et al. (2018)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref></sup> using a custom Python script. HCR split initiator sequences B1, B3, and B5 were obtained from Choi et al. (2018). To generate probe sets, probe pairs were excluded if they fell below melting temperature and %GC thresholds. Probe pairs with strong sequence similarity to off-target transcripts were also excluded. For each target transcript, we generated sets of 15–25 probe pairs. Multiple transcripts were often stained in individual larvae. HCR probes were purchased as custom DNA oligos from Thermo Fisher Scientific. HCR amplifiers (B1-Alexa Fluor 488, B3-Alexa Fluor 546, and B5-Alexa Fluor 647) and buffers were purchased from Molecular Instruments. More details about HCR probes can be found in Supplementary file 1.</p>
<p>The HCR protocol we used was adapted from MI-Protocol-RNAFISH-Zebrafish (Rev10) (Molecular Instruments). Proteinase K and methanol permeabilisation steps from the protocol were skipped.

Following fixation, larvae were washed three times 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Larvae were then transferred to a SYLGARD-coated Petri dish and the eyes were removed using forceps. Sample preparation was completed by two brief PBST (1× DPBS + 0.1% Tween 20) washes. For the probe hybridization stage, larvae were first incubated in hybridization buffer at 37°C for 30 min. Meanwhile, a probe solution was prepared by adding 4 µL of each 1 µM probe set (4 pmol) to 500 µL hybridization buffer. Hybridization buffer was replaced by the probe solution, and larvae were incubated at 37°C overnight (12–16 hr).</p>
<p>The next day, excess probe solution was removed by washing larvae four times 15 min with 500 µL of probe wash buffer preheated to 37°C. Larvae were then washed twice 5 min with 5× SSCT at room temperature. Samples were kept at room temperature for subsequent amplification steps. First, larvae were transferred to amplification buffer at room temperature for 30 min. 3 µM stocks of hairpin H1 and hairpin H2 were individually heated to 95°C for 90 sec then left to cool at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. For HCR on up to 8 larvae together, a hairpin solution was prepared by adding 4 µL (12 pmol) of hairpin H1 and 4 µL of hairpin H2 (12 pmol) to 200 µL amplification buffer. Finally, amplification buffer was removed and the hairpin solution was added to the larvae which were incubated overnight (12–16 hr) in the dark at room temperature. After overnight incubation, excess hairpins were removed by washing in 5× SSCT for twice 5 min, then twice 30 min and finally once 5 min at room temperature. Larvae were transferred to PBS and kept at 4°C protected from light for up to 3 days.</p>

Larvae were fixed in 4% PFA with 4% (w/v%) sucrose overnight at 4°C. Brains were dissected with forceps, removing the eyes and the skin that covers the brain. After dissection, there was a 20-min postfix in 4% PFA with 4% (w/v%) sucrose followed by three washes in PBST to remove the fixative.

The other larvae were raised until 16 dpf to increase the amount of tissue available for the assay. Larvae were euthanised by an overdose of tricaine then decapitated with a scalpel. Heads were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen then homogenized using a mechanical homogenizer in 100 μL TBS (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 1:200 protease inhibitor cocktail set III (Calbiochem). Homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 g at 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant was then collected and stored at –70°C. We measured total protein concentration of each sample using the Pierce Detergent Compatible Bradford Assay Kit (ThermoFisher). Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42 concentrations were measured on the Meso Scale Discovery platform (Meso Scale Diagnostics) using the V-PLEX Plus Aβ Peptide Panel 1 (4G8) kit.</p>
<p>Each pool of larvae was measured in four technical replicates: two at the original concentration and two diluted 1:1 in TBS. Meso Scale returned concentrations of Aβ38, Aβ40, Aβ42 in pg/mL. All Aβ38 measurements were below the detection limit. We converted the Aβ concentrations to pg Aβ/µg total protein using the total protein content measured with the Bradford assay. The limit of detection (LOD) for each Aβ species was the concentration of the most diluted standard in pg/mL. We calculated a sample-specific LOD by calculating the Aβ concentration (pg Aβ/µg total protein) that would have given exactly the LOD in pg/mL. For example, the LOD for Aβ40 was 39.79 pg/mL. Therefore, for a sample whose total protein content was 3788 µg/mL, Aβ40 concentration should have been 0.0105 pg Aβ40/g total protein to give exactly the LOD (39.79 pg/mL). Each data point represents the mean of the four technical replicates, except if both diluted replicates were below the sample-specific LOD, in which case the data point represents the mean of the two undiluted technical replicates. If one undiluted sample was below the LOD but not the other, we replaced the below-LOD measurement by the sample-specific LOD itself. If all four technical replicates (undiluted and diluted) were below the sample-specific LOD, the sample was marked with a cross in the plot.</p>

<title>Annotation of the Rihel et al., 2010 small molecule behavioural database</title>
<p>From the Rihel et al., 2010 small molecule zebrafish behavioural database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, we extracted the name of each compound tested and the 5,756 behavioural fingerprints, which are the mean z-score for each sleep/wake parameter (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref> for the one-minute parameters). The same compound could have alternate database names (e.g. “Dopamine hydrochloride” and “Dopamine HCl”), and could vary by its stereochemistry or salts (e.g. atropine sulfate vs. atropine methyl nitrate). Therefore, we first simplified as much as possible each compound name by removing various stereochemistry and salt information. This reduced the number of unique compound names from 5,149 to 4,731. We then used the webchem R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref></sup> to automatically search each name in the PubChem database and return the PubChem CID. CID could be retrieved automatically for 4,365 (92%) of the names. We manually searched the remaining 366 compound names, eventually leaving only 12 of 4,731 compound names without a CID. The final number of unique CIDs was 3,674. The Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) uses a custom TTD Drug ID but provided a file for cross-matching PubChem CIDs to TTD Drug IDs (<italic>P1-03-TTD_crossmatching.txt</italic>). We found a TTD Drug ID for 1,738 of the 3,674 CIDs (47%). Using each TTD Drug ID as query, we then extracted indications and target proteins from databases provided by the TTD using TTD Drug IDs as queries (<italic>P1-05-Drug_disease.txt</italic> and <italic>P1-01-TTD_target_download.txt</italic>). Proteins are given a target ID by the TTD, which we then used as query to extract the KEGG pathways each protein was associated with (<italic>P4-01-Target-KEGGpathway_all.txt</italic>).</p>
<p>As TTD Drug IDs were used to extract annotations but that only 47% of compounds were assigned one, the ZOLTAR app currently uses less than half of the dataset by Rihel et al., 2010 for prediction of disrupted pathways.

<title>Behavioural pharmacology from sorl1 F0 knockout’s fingerprint</title>
<p>We measured the cosine similarity (range −1.0–1.0) between the mean fingerprint of the two <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockout clutches and each of the 5,756 small molecule fingerprints from the Rihel et al., 2010 database. We then ranked the 5,756 small molecule fingerprints from the most positive cosine (SU6656: cos = 0.83) to the most negative cosine (flumazenil: cos = −0.80).</p>
<p>At this stage, the general goal of the analysis is to detect whether compounds with a given annotation (indication, target, or KEGG pathway) are found more towards the top and/or bottom of the ranked list than expected by chance. For example, two cases suggest that inhibition of a pathway is what causes the knockout behavioural phenotype: all compounds <italic>inhibiting</italic> this pathway are found towards the top of the list (positive cosines); or all compounds <italic>activating</italic> this pathway are found towards the bottom of the list (negative cosines). The database may include both agonists and antagonists for a given pathway, so we also want to detect cases where compounds interacting with the pathway are found both towards the top <italic>and</italic> towards the bottom of the ranked list. Therefore, the null hypothesis for a given annotation is specifically that fingerprints with this annotation are found across the ranked list in a pattern that can be explained by chance, or that they are mostly found around the centre of the list (cos ∼ 0 position).</p>
<p>In practice, we counted fingerprint positions starting at the centre (cos ∼ 0 position) and counting in both directions. Namely, the fingerprint with the smallest positive cosine (6,7-dichloroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, cos = 0.0003) was position #1, then position #2 for the next smallest positive cosine, etc. We did not set negative positions, so the fingerprint with the smallest negative cosine (L-Histidine hydrochloride, cos = −0.0003) was also position #1, then position #2, etc. The fingerprint with the smallest positive cosine was not always at the centre of the list, as there could be more fingerprints with positive cosines than fingerprints with negative cosines, or vice-versa. In a case where there were more fingerprints with positive cosines, using these positions directly as ranks would have biased the analysis against detecting negative enrichment (i.e. more fingerprints towards the bottom of the list than expected by chance) as the random draws (see below) would have mostly picked fingerprints with large ranks on the positive-cosine side simply because there were more of them. We controlled for this by forcing ranks to be on the same range (same maximum rank) on either side of the list. Namely, we set the ranks of the fingerprints with positive cosines as:
<disp-formula id="ueqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="568940v1_ueqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>The same was done for the ranks of the fingerprints with negative cosines (i.e. no negative ranks). Using 1000 as the maximum rank was arbitrary; any number could have been used.</p>
<p>For example, there were 3,201 positive-cosine fingerprints for <italic>sorl1</italic>. Therefore, the rank of the fingerprint with the smallest positive cosine was 1 × 1000/3201 = #0.31; the next fingerprint was rank 2 × 1000/3201 = #0.62, etc., until the fingerprint with the largest positive cosine which had rank 3201 × 1000/3201 = #1000.00. On the opposite side, there were 2,555 negative-cosine fingerprints. Therefore, the rank of the fingerprint with the smallest negative cosine was 1 × 1000/2555 = #0.39; the next fingerprint was rank 2 × 1000/2555 = #0.78, etc., until the fingerprint with the largest negative cosine which had rank 2555 × 1000/2555 = #1000.00.</p>
<p>At this stage, we had a list of fingerprints from largest positive cosine to largest negative cosine, each with a rank representing its distance from the cosine ∼ 0 position. We swapped each compound for its annotations, for example its target(s). If a compound had no annotated target (or indication or KEGG pathway), it was simply deleted without editing any of the ranks. If a compound had multiple annotated targets (or indications or KEGG pathways), all targets received the same rank. For example, aspirin had rank #874.36 (cos = −0.50) and two annotated targets: HMG-CoA reductase and Prostaglandin G/H synthase. Therefore, swapping aspirin for its targets generated two rows with the same rank #874.36. The same compound could appear multiple times in the list, in which case its targets (or indications or KEGG pathways) were simply repeated.</p>
<p>To measure enrichment of a given annotation towards the top and/or bottom of the list, we summed the ranks of all its instances. For example, the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) appeared 59 times in the list for <italic>sorl1</italic>. The sum of those 59 ranks was 34,958. Was this sum of ranks surprising or could it be explained by chance? To test this, we randomly drew 59 positions and measured the sum of ranks 100,000 times to generate a null distribution of sum of ranks (e.g. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). We counted how many random draws gave a larger sum of ranks than the observed sum of ranks (34,958) to calculate a simulated p-value. In the case of SLC6A4, 1,127 random draws gave a larger sum of ranks; therefore, the probability that a sum of ranks as high as 34,958 was obtained by chance was estimated at 1,127/100,000 = 0.01127, which we reported as the simulated p-value.</p>
<p>A simpler alternative for this analysis may be to sum absolute cosines directly, instead of ranks, as a measure of enrichment. In theory, this option would consider more directly how well the knockout fingerprint and the small molecule fingerprints match.</p>

<title>Behavioural pharmacology from psen2 F0 knockout’s fingerprint</title>
<p>We measured the cosine similarity between the mean fingerprint of the two <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout clutches and each of the 5,756 small molecule fingerprints from the Rihel et al., 2010 database. We then ranked the 5,756 small molecule fingerprints from the most positive cosine (3-3-Acetoxypregn-16-en-12,20-dione: cos = 0.82) to the most negative cosine (isogedunin: cos = −0.87). We searched within the ∼100 fingerprints with the most negative cosines (range of cosines: −0.72–0.87) for compounds which Rihel et al., 2010 labelled as shortlisted because it affected one behavioural parameter with a large effect size and/or affected the same parameter in the same direction across the two days/nights. From these compounds, we selected fenoprofen and betamethasone because they both had a replicate fingerprint with cosine &lt;−0.60. Tinidazole was selected based on a preliminary experiment in wild-type larvae (data not shown), although it was not shortlisted by Rihel et al., 2010.</p>
<p>To simplify this selection process in the ZOLTAR app (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://francoiskroll.shinyapps.io/zoltar/">francoiskroll.shinyapps.io/zoltar/</ext-link>), the shortlisted compounds are labelled, and clicking on a candidate compound automatically plots all the fingerprints from this compound (same PubChem CID).</p>

Amino acid sequences were obtained from UniProt. The ClustalOmega algorithm, implemented in R by the msa package, was used to align the sequences. Definitions of “highly similar” and “weakly similar” groups of amino acids were taken from the ClustalOmega online documentation. The following groups of amino acids were considered highly similar: STA, NEQK, NHQK, NDEQ, QHRK, MILV, MILF, HY, FYW. The following groups of amino acids were considered weakly similar: CSA, ATV, SAG, STNK, STPA, SGND, SNDEQK, NDEQHK, NEQHRK, FVLIM, HFY. Identity was the number of positions where the zebrafish amino acid matched the human amino acid divided by the total length of the alignment. Similarity was the number of positions where the zebrafish amino acid matched or was highly similar to the human amino acid divided by the total length of the alignment.

<p>For statistics on behavioural parameters, see <italic>Statistics on behavioural parameters</italic>.

<p>Threshold for statistical significance was α = 0.05. In figures, ns refers to p &gt; 0.05, * to p ≤ 0.05, ** to p ≤ 0.01, and *** to p ≤ 0.001. In text, data distributions are reported as mean ± standard deviation, unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p>In text, estimates of behavioural parameter effect sizes are often reported in % vs. scrambled-injected controls. To calculate those, we first calculated, for each clutch and day or night, the mean of all control data points for this parameter, typically returning four averages (e.g. clutch1 controls, night1 and night2; clutch2 controls, night1 and night2). To each average, the slope from the LME model (see <italic>Statistics on behavioural parameters</italic>) was added/subtracted to estimate the knockout averages. An effect size in % vs. controls (<italic>ef</italic>%) was then calculated for each clutch and day or night as:
<disp-formula id="ueqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="568940v1_ueqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>If the slope was positive; or
<disp-formula id="ueqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="568940v1_ueqn6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>If the slope was negative; where <italic>ko</italic> and <italic>con</italic> is the knockout or control average for one clutch and one day or night. The effect sizes were then averaged to return one effect size representing the estimated % increase or decrease vs. scrambled controls.</p>
<p>In <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2–supplement 2d</xref>, the data were 47 observations, one per larva. Each observation was the time in hours when the larva had its first sleep bout (status 2). Every larva slept at least once during the experiment, so there were no censored (status 1) observations. We calculated the hazard ratio with a Cox proportional-hazards model and the p-value with a likelihood-ratio test. The functions we used were implemented in the R package survival v3.4.0. The FramebyFrame R package automatically performs this survival analysis when generating sleep latency survival plots with the function <monospace>ggSleepLatencyGrid(…)</monospace>.</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref> and <xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5–supplement 1d</xref>, we compared values between groups (<italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts vs. scrambled-injected) in each anatomical region using Welch’s t-test. To test the null hypothesis that group assignment had no effect on values across regions, we used LME modelling implemented in the lmer function of the R package lme4 v1.1.31<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>. Taking total signal intensity as an example, the command to create the LME model was:
<disp-formula id="ueqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="568940v1_ueqn7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>The model provided the slope and its standard error reported in the figures. We then created a model without the fixed effect group, as:
<disp-formula id="ueqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="568940v1_ueqn8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>We compared this null model with the full model created above with a likelihood-ratio test, which provided the p-value reported in the figures.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> manuscript sets out to identify sleep/arousal phenotypes in larval zebrafish carrying mutations in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated genes. The authors provide detailed phenotypic data for F0 knockouts of each of 7 AD-associated genes and then compare the resulting behavioral fingerprints to those obtained from a large-scale chemical screen to generate new hypotheses about underlying molecular mechanisms. The data presented are <bold>solid</bold>, although extensive interpretation of pharmacological screen data does not necessarily reflect the limited mechanistic data. Nonetheless, the phenotypic characterization presented is comprehensive, and the authors develop a well-designed behavioral analysis pipeline that will provide considerable value for zebrafish neuroscientists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Kroll et al. conduct an in-depth behavioral analysis of F0 knockouts of 4 genes associated with late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD), together with 3 genes associated with early-onset AD. Kroll and colleagues developed a web application (ZOLTAR) to compare sleep-associated traits between genetic mutants with those obtained from a panel of small molecules to promote the identification of affected pathways and potential therapeutic interventions. The authors make a set of potentially important findings vis-à-vis the relationship between AD-associated genes and sleep. First, they find that loss-of-function in late-onset AD genes universally results in nighttime sleep loss, consistent with the well-supported hypothesis that sleep disruption contributes to Alzheimer's-related pathologies. psen-1, an early-onset associated AD gene, which the authors find is principally responsible for the generation of AB40 and AB42 in zebrafish, also shows a slight increase in activity at night and slight decreases in nighttime sleep. Conversely, psen-2 mutations increase daytime sleep, while appa/appb mutations have no impact on sleep. Finally, using ZOLTAR, the authors identify serotonin receptor activity as potentially disrupted in sorl1 mutants, while betamethasone is identified as a potential therapeutic to promote reversal of psen2 knockout-associated phenotypes.</p>
<p>This is a highly innovative and thorough study, yet a handful of key questions remain. First, are nighttime sleep loss phenotypes observed in all knockouts for late-onset AD genes in the larval zebrafish a valid proxy for AD risk? For those mutants that cause nighttime sleep disturbances, do these phenotypes share a common underlying pathway? e.g. Do 5-HT reuptake inhibitors promote sleep across all 4 late-onset genes in addition to psen1? Can 5-HT reuptake inhibitors reverse other AD-related pathologies in zebrafish? Can compounds be identified that have a common behavioral fingerprint across all or multiple AD risk genes? Do these modify sleep phenotypes? Finally, the web-based platform presented could be expanded to facilitate comparison of other behavioral phenotypes, including stimulus-evoked behaviors. Finally, the authors propose but do not test the hypothesis that sorl1 might regulate localization/surface expression of 5-HT2 receptors. This could provide exciting / more convincing mechanistic support for the assertion that serotonin signaling is disrupted upon loss of AD-associated genes. Despite these important considerations, this study provides a valuable platform for high-throughput analysis of sleep phenotypes and correlation with small-molecule-induced sleep phenotypes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Provides a useful platform for comparison of sleep phenotypes across genotypes/drug manipulations.</p>
<p>- Presents convincing evidence that nighttime sleep is disrupted in mutants for multiple late-onset AD-related genes.</p>
<p>- Provides potential mechanistic insights for how AD-related genes might impact sleep and identifies a few drugs that modify their identified phenotypes</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Exploration of potential mechanisms for serotonin disruption in sorl1 mutants is limited.</p>
<p>- The pipeline developed can only be used to examine sleep-related / spontaneous movement phenotypes and stimulus-evoked behaviors are not examined.</p>
<p>- Comparisons between mutants/exploration of commonly affected pathways are limited.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work delineates the larval zebrafish behavioral phenotypes caused by the F0 knockout of several important genes that increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease. Using behavioral pharmacology, comparing the behavioral fingerprint of previously assayed molecules to the newly generated knockout data, compounds were discovered that impacted larval movement in ways that suggest interaction with or recovery of disrupted mechanisms.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a well-written manuscript that uses newly developed analysis methods to present the findings in a clear, high-quality way. The addition of an extensive behavioral analysis pipeline is of value to the field of zebrafish neuroscience and will be particularly helpful for researchers who prefer the R programming language. Even the behavioral profiling of these AD risk genes, regardless of the pharmacology aspect, is an important contribution. The recovery of most behavioral parameters in the psen2 knockout with betamethasone, predicted by comparing fingerprints, is an exciting demonstration of the approach. The hypotheses generated by this work are important stepping stones to future studies uncovering the molecular basis of the proposed gene-drug interactions and discovering novel therapeutics to treat AD or co-occurring conditions such as sleep disturbance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The overarching concept of the work is that comparing behavioral fingerprints can align genes and molecules with similarly disrupted molecular pathways. While the recovery of the psen2 phenotypes by one molecule with the opposite phenotype is interesting, as are previous studies that show similar behaviorally-based recoveries, the underlying assumption that normalizing the larval movement normalizes the mechanism still lacks substantial support. There are many ways that a reduction in movement bouts could be returned to baseline that are unrelated to the root cause of the genetically driven phenotype. An ideal experiment would be to thoroughly characterize a mutant, such as by identifying a missing population of neurons, and use this approach to find a small molecule that rescues both behavior and the cellular phenotype. If the connection to serotonin in the sorl1 was more complete, for example, the overarching idea would be more compelling.</p>
<p>- The behavioral difference between the sorl1 KO and scrambled at the higher dose of the citalopram is based on a small number of animals. The KO Euclidean distance measure is also more spread out than for the other datasets, and it looks like only five or so fish are driving the group difference. It also appears as though the numbers were also from two injection series. While there is nothing obviously wrong with the data, I would feel more comfortable if such a strong statement of a result from a relatively subtle phenotype were backed up by a higher N or a stable line. It is not impossible that the observed difference is an experimental fluke. If something obvious had emerged through the HCR, that would have also supported the conclusions. As it stands, if no more experiments are done to bolster the claim, the confidence in the strength of the link to serotonin should be reduced (possibly putting the entire section in the supplement and modifying the discussion). The discussion section about serotonin and AD is interesting, but I think that it is excessive without additional evidence.</p>
<p>- The authors suggest two hypotheses for the behavioral difference between the sorl1 KO and scrambled at the higher dose of the citalopram. While the first is tested, and found to not be supported, the second is not tested at all (&quot;Ruling out the first hypothesis, sorl1 knockouts may react excessively to a given spike in serotonin.&quot; and &quot;Second, sorl1 knockouts may be overly sensitive to serotonin itself because post-synaptic neurons have higher levels of serotonin receptors.&quot;). Assuming that the finding is robust, there are probably other reasons why the mutants could have a different sensitivity to this molecule. However, if this particular one is going to be mentioned, it is surprising that it was not tested alongside the first hypothesis. This work could proceed without a complete explanation, but additional discussion of the possibilities would be helpful or why the second hypothesis was not tested.</p>
<p>- The authors claim that &quot;all four genes produced a fairly consistent phenotype at night&quot;. While it is interesting that this result arose in the different lines, the second clutch for some genes did not replicate as well as others. I think the findings are compelling, regardless, but the sometimes missing replicability should be discussed. I wonder if the F0 strategy adds noise to the results and if clean null lines would yield stronger phenotypes. Please discuss this possibility, or others, in regard to the variability in some phenotypes.</p>
<p>- In this work, the knockout of appa/appb is included. While APP is a well-known risk gene, there is no clear justification for making a knockout model. It is well known that the upregulation of app is the driver of Alzheimer's, not downregulation. The authors even indicate an expectation that it could be similar to the other knockouts (&quot;Moreover, the behavioural phenotypes of appa/appb and psen1 knockout larvae had little overlap while they presumably both resulted in the loss of Aβ.&quot; and &quot;Comparing with early-onset genes, psen1 knockouts had similar night-time phenotypes, but loss of psen2 or appa/appb had no effect on night-time sleep.&quot;). There is no reason to expect similarity between appa/appb and psen1/2. I understand that the app knockouts could unveil interesting early neurodevelopmental roles, but the manuscript needs to be clarified that any findings could be the opposite of expectation in AD.</p>

<p>In this manuscript by Kroll and colleagues, the authors describe combining behavioral pharmacology with sleep profiling to predict disease and potential treatment pathways at play in AD. AD is used here as a case study, but the approaches detailed can be used for other genetic screens related to normal or pathological states for which sleep/arousal is relevant. The data are for the most part convincing, although generally the phenotypes are relatively small and there are no major new mechanistic insights. Nonetheless, the approaches are certainly of broad interest and the data are comprehensive and detailed.</p>
<p>A notable weakness is the introduction, which overly generalizes numerous concepts and fails to provide the necessary background to set the stage for the data.</p>
<p>Major points</p>
<p>(1) The authors should spend more time explaining what they see as the meaning of the large number of behavioral parameters assayed and specifically what they tell readers about the biology of the animal. Many are hard to understand--e.g. a &quot;slope&quot; parameter.</p>
<p>(2) Because in the end the authors did not screen that many lines, it would increase confidence in the phenotypes to provide more validation of KO specificity. Some suggestions include:</p>
<p>
a. The authors cite a psen1 and psen2 germline mutant lines. Can these be tested in the FramebyFrame R analysis? Do they phenocopy F0 KO larvae?</p>
<p>
b. psen2KO is one of the larger centerpieces of the paper. The authors should present more compelling evidence that animals are truly functionally null. Without this, how do we interpret their phenotypes?</p>
<p>
c. Related to the above, for cd2AP and sorl1 KO, some of the effect sizes seem to be driven by one clutch and not the other. In other words, great clutch-to-clutch variability. Should the authors increase the number of clutches assayed?</p>
<p>(3) The authors make the point that most of the AD risk genes are expressed in fish during development. Is there public data to comment on whether the genes of interest are expressed in mature/old fish as well? Just because the genes are expressed early does not at all mean that early-life dysfunction is related to future AD (though this could be the case, of course). Genes with exclusive developmental expression would be strong candidates for such an early-life role, however. I presume the case is made because sleep studies are mainly done in juvenile fish, but I think it is really a pretty minor point and such a strong claim does not even need to be made.</p>
<p>(4) A common quandary with defining sleep behaviorally is how to rectify sleep and activity changes that influence one another. With psen2 KOs, the authors describe reduced activity and increased sleep during the day. But how do we know if the reduced activity drives increased behavioral quiescence that is incorrectly defined as sleep? In instances where sleep is increased but activity during periods during wake are normal or elevated, this is not an issue. But here, the animals might very well be unhealthy, and less active, so naturally they stop moving more for prolonged periods, but the main conclusion is not sleep per se. This is an area where more experiments should be added if the authors do not wish to change/temper the conclusions they draw. Are psen2 KOs responsive to startling stimuli like controls when awake? Do they respond normally when quiescent? Great care must be taken in all models using inactivity as a proxy for sleep, and it can harm the field when there is no acknowledgment that overall health/activity changes could be a confound. Particularly worrisome is the betamethasone data in Figure 6, where activity and sleep are once again coordinately modified by the drug.</p>
<p>(5) The conclusions for the serotonin section are overstated. Behavioural pharmacology purports to predict a signaling pathway disrupted with sorl1 KO. But is it not just possible that the drug acts in parallel to the true disrupted pathway in these fish? There is no direct evidence for serotonin dysfunction - that conclusion is based on response to the drug. Moreover, it is just 1 drug - is the same phenotype present with another SSRI? Likewise, language should be toned down in the discussion, as this hypothesis is not &quot;confirmed&quot; by the results (consider &quot;supported&quot;). The lack of measured serotonin differences further raises concern that this is not the true pathway. This is another major point that deserves further experimental evidence, because without it, the entire approach (behavioral pharm screen) seems more shaky as a way to identify mechanisms. There are any number of testable hypotheses to pursue such as a) Using transient transgenesis to visualize 5HT neuron morphology (is development perturbed: cell number, neurite morphology, synapse formation); b) Using transgenic Ca reporters to assay 5HT neuron activity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Kroll et al. conduct an in-depth behavioral analysis of F0 knockouts of 4 genes associated with late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD), together with 3 genes associated with early- onset AD. Kroll and colleagues developed a web application (ZOLTAR) to compare sleep-associated traits between genetic mutants with those obtained from a panel of small molecules to promote the identification of affected pathways and potential therapeutic interventions. The authors make a set of potentially important findings vis-à-vis the relationship between AD-associated genes and sleep. First, they find that loss-of-function in late-onset AD genes universally results in nighttime sleep loss, consistent with the well-supported hypothesis that sleep disruption contributes to Alzheimer's-related pathologies. psen-1, an early-onset associated AD gene, which the authors find is principally responsible for the generation of AB40 and AB42 in zebrafish, also shows a slight increase in activity at night and slight decreases in nighttime sleep. Conversely, psen-2 mutations increase daytime sleep, while appa/appb mutations have no impact on sleep. Finally, using ZOLTAR, the authors identify serotonin receptor activity as potentially disrupted in sorl1 mutants, while betamethasone is identified as a potential therapeutic to promote reversal of psen2 knockout-associated phenotypes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a highly innovative and thorough study, yet a handful of key questions remain. First, are nighttime sleep loss phenotypes observed in all knockouts for late-onset AD genes in the larval zebrafish a valid proxy for AD risk?</p>
<p>We cannot say, but it is an interesting question. We selected the four late-onset Alzheimer’s risk genes (APOE, CD2AP, CLU, SORL1) based on human genetics data and brain expression in zebrafish larvae, not based on their likelihood to modify sleep behaviour, which we could have tried by searching for overlaps with GWAS of sleep phenotypes, for example. Consequently, we find it remarkable that all four of these genes caused a night-time sleep phenotype when mutated. We also find it reassuring that knockout of <italic>appa/appb</italic> and <italic>psen2</italic> did not cause a night-time sleep phenotype, which largely excludes the possibility that the phenotype is a technical artefact (e.g. caused by the F0 knockout method) or a property of every gene expressed in the larval brain.</p>
<p>Having said that, it could still be a coincidence, rather than a special property of genes associated with late-onset AD. In addition to testing additional late-onset Alzheimer’s risk genes, the ideal way to answer this question would be to test in parallel a random set of genes expressed in the brain at this stage of development. From this random set, one could estimate the proportion of genes that cause a night-time sleep phenotype when mutated. One could then use that information to test whether late-onset Alzheimer’s risk genes are indeed enriched for genes that cause a night-time sleep phenotype when mutated.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For those mutants that cause nighttime sleep disturbances, do these phenotypes share a common underlying pathway? e.g. Do 5-HT reuptake inhibitors promote sleep across all 4 late-onset genes in addition to psen1? Can 5-HT reuptake inhibitors reverse other AD-related pathologies in zebrafish? Can compounds be identified that have a common behavioral fingerprint across all or multiple AD risk genes? Do these modify sleep phenotypes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To attempt to answer these questions, we used ZOLTAR to generate predictions for all the knockout behavioural fingerprints presented in the study, in the same way as for <italic>sorl1</italic> in Fig. 5 and Fig. 5–suppl. 1. Here are the indications, targets, and KEGG pathways which are shared by the largest number of knockouts:</p>
<p>– Four indications are shared by 4/7 knockouts: “mydriasis” (dilated pupils, significant for <italic>psen1</italic>, <italic>apoea/apoeb</italic>, <italic>cd2ap</italic>, <italic>clu</italic>); “fragile X syndrome” (<italic>psen1</italic>, <italic>apoea/apoeb</italic>, <italic>cd2ap</italic>, <italic>sorl1</italic>), “insomnia” (<italic>psen2</italic>, <italic>apoea/apoeb</italic>, <italic>cd2ap</italic>, <italic>sorl1</italic>); “malignant essential hypertension” (<italic>appa/appb</italic>, <italic>psen1</italic>, <italic>apoea/apoeb</italic>, <italic>cd2ap</italic>).</p>
<p>– Two targets are shared by 5/7 knockouts: “glycogen synthase kinase−3 alpha” (<italic>psen1</italic>, <italic>apoeab</italic>, <italic>cd2ap</italic>, <italic>clu</italic>, <italic>sorl1</italic>) and “neuronal acetylcholine receptor beta−2” (<italic>appa/appb</italic>, <italic>psen1</italic>, <italic>apoeab</italic>, <italic>cd2ap</italic>, <italic>clu</italic>).</p>
<p>– Two KEGG pathways are shared by 5/7 knockouts: “cholinergic synapse” (<italic>psen1</italic>, <italic>apoea/apoeb</italic>, <italic>cd2ap</italic>, <italic>clu</italic>, <italic>sorl1</italic>) and “nitrogen metabolism” (<italic>appa/appb</italic>, <italic>psen1</italic>, <italic>psen2</italic>, <italic>cd2ap</italic>, <italic>clu</italic>).</p>
<p>As reminder, we hypothesised that loss of Sorl1 affected serotonin signalling based on the following annotations being significant: indication “depression”, target “serotonin transporter”, and KEGG pathway “serotonergic synapse”. All three are also significant for <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts, but none others. ZOLTAR therefore does not predict serotonin signalling to be a major theme common to all mutants with a night-time sleep loss phenotype.</p>
<p>While perhaps not surprising, we find reassuring that insomnia appears in the indications shared by the largest number of knockouts. <italic>apoea/apoeb</italic>, <italic>cd2ap</italic>, <italic>sorl1</italic> also happen to be the knockouts with the largest loss in night-time sleep.</p>
<p>Particularly interesting is cholinergic signalling appearing in the most common targets and KEGG pathways. Acetylcholine signalling is a major theme in research on Alzheimer’s disease. For example, the first four drugs ever approved by the FDA to treat Alzheimer’s disease were acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which increase acetylcholine signalling by preventing its breakdown by acetylcholinesterase. These drugs are generally considered only to treat symptoms and not modify disease course, but this view has been called into question (Munoz-Torrero, 2008; Relkin, 2007). If, as ZOLTAR suggests, mutations in several Alzheimer’s risk genes affect cholinergic signalling early in development, this would point to a potential causal role of cholinergic disruption in Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>We see that literature also exists on the involvement of glycogen synthase kinase-3 in AD (Lauretti et al., 2020). We plan to explore further these predictions in a future study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, the web- based platform presented could be expanded to facilitate comparison of other behavioral phenotypes, including stimulus-evoked behaviors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, absolutely. The behavioural dataset we used (Rihel et al., 2010) did not measure other stimuli than day/night light transitions, but the “SauronX” platform and dataset (Myers-Turnbull et al., 2022) seems particularly well suited for this. To provide some context, we and collaborators have occasionally used the dataset by Rihel et al. (2010) to generate hypotheses or find candidate drugs that reverse a behavioural phenotype measured in the sleep/wake assay (Ashlin et al., 2018; Hoffman et al., 2016). The present work was the occasion to enable a wider and more intuitive use of this dataset through the ZOLTAR app, which has already proven successful. Future versions of ZOLTAR will seek to incorporate larger drug datasets using more types of measurements.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, the authors propose but do not test the hypothesis that sorl1 might regulate localization/surface expression of 5-HT2 receptors. This could provide exciting / more convincing mechanistic support for the assertion that serotonin signaling is disrupted upon loss of AD-associated genes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>5-HT receptor type 4a is another candidate as it was shown to interact with sorting nexin 27, a subunit of retromer (Joubert et al., 2004). We see that antibodies against human 5-HT receptor type 2 and 4a exist; whether they would work in zebrafish remains to be tested, and in our experience, the availability of antibodies suitable for immunohistochemistry in the zebrafish is a serious experimental roadblock.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>Strengths:</p>

<p>On the first point, we were careful not to claim that betamethasone normalises the molecular/cellular mechanism that causes the <italic>psen2</italic> behavioural phenotype. Having said that, yes, to a certain extent that would be the hope of the approach. As you say, every compound which normalises the behavioural fingerprint will not normalise the underlying mechanism, but the opposite seems true: every compound that normalises the underlying mechanism should also normalise the behavioural fingerprint. We think this logic makes the “behaviour-first” approach innovative and interesting. The logic is to discover compounds that normalise the behavioural phenotype first, only subsequently test whether they also normalise the molecular mechanism, akin to testing first whether a drug resolves the symptoms before testing whether it actually modifies disease course. While in practice testing thousands of drugs in sufficient sample sizes and replicates on a mutant line is challenging, the dataset queried through ZOLTAR provides a potential shortcut by shortlisting <italic>in silico</italic> compounds that have the opposite effect on behaviour.</p>
<p>You mention a “reduction in movement bouts” but note here that the number of behavioural parameters tested is key to our argument. To take the two extremes, say the only behavioural parameter we measured in <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae was time active during the day, then, yes, any stimulant used at the right concentration could probably normalise the phenotype. In this situation, claiming that the stimulant is likely to also normalise the underlying mechanism, or even that it is a genuine “phenotypic rescue”, would not be convincing. Conversely, say we were measuring thousands of behavioural parameters under various stimuli, such as swimming speed, position in the well, bout usage, tail movements, and eye angles, it seems almost impossible for a compound to rescue most parameters without also normalising the underlying mechanism. The present approach is somewhere in-between: ZOLTAR uses six behavioural parameters for prediction (e.g. Fig 6a), but all 17 parameters calculated by FramebyFrame can be used to assess rescue during a subsequent experiment (Fig. 6c). For both, splitting each parameter in day and night increases the resolution of the approach, which partly answers your criticism. For example, betamethasone rescued the day-time hypoactivity without causing night-time hyperactivity, so we are not making the “straw man argument” explained above of using any broad stimulant to rescue the hypoactivity phenotype.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for diseases where the behavioural defect is the primary concern, such as autism or bipolar disorder, perhaps this behaviour-first approach is all that is needed, and whether or not the compound precisely rescues the underlying mechanism is somewhat secondary. The use of lithium to prevent manic episodes in bipolar disorder is a good example. It was initially tested because mania was thought to be caused by excess uric acid and lithium can dissolve uric acid (Mitchell and Hadzi-Pavlovic, 2000). The theory is now discredited, but lithium continues to be used without a precise understanding of its mode of action. In this example, behavioural rescue alone, with tolerable secondary effects, is sufficient to be beneficial to patients, and whether it modulates the correct causal pathway is secondary.</p>
<p>On the second point, we agree that testing first ZOLTAR on a mutant for which we have a fairly good understanding of the mechanism causing the behavioural phenotype could have been a productive approach. Note, however, that examples already exist in the literature. First, Hoffman et al. (2016) found that drugs generating behavioural fingerprints that positively correlate with the <italic>cntnap2a/cntnap2b</italic> double knockout fingerprint are enriched with NMDA and GABA receptor antagonists. In experiments analogous to our citalopram treatment (Fig. 5c,d), <italic>cntnap2a/cntnap2b</italic> knockout larvae were found to be overly sensitive to the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 and the GABAA receptor antagonist pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). Among other drugs tested, zolpidem, a GABAA receptor agonist, caused opposite effects on wild-type and <italic>cntnap2a/cntnap2b</italic> knockout larvae. Knockout larvae also had fewer GABAergic neurons in the forebrain. Second, Ashlin et al. (2018) found that the fingerprint of <italic>pitpnc1a</italic> knockout larvae clustered with anti-inflammatory compounds. Flumethasone, an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid, caused a lower increase in activity when added to knockout larvae compared to wild-type larvae. While these studies did not use precisely the same analysis that ZOLTAR runs, they used the same rationale and behavioural dataset to make these predictions (Rihel et al., 2010), which shows that approaches like ZOLTAR can point to causal processes.</p>
<p>Related to your next point, we may reduce the discussion on <italic>sorl1</italic> and serotonin and add some of the present arguments instead, depending on the results from  testing a second SSRI (see next point).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The behavioral difference between the sorl1 KO and scrambled at the higher dose of the citalopram is based on a small number of animals. The KO Euclidean distance measure is also more spread out than for the other datasets, and it looks like only five or so fish are driving the group difference. It also appears as though the numbers were also from two injection series. While there is nothing obviously wrong with the data, I would feel more comfortable if such a strong statement of a result from a relatively subtle phenotype were backed up by a higher N or a stable line. It is not impossible that the observed difference is an experimental fluke. If something obvious had emerged through the HCR, that would have also supported the conclusions. As it stands, if no more experiments are done to bolster the claim, the confidence in the strength of the link to serotonin should be reduced (possibly putting the entire section in the supplement and modifying the discussion). The discussion section about serotonin and AD is interesting, but I think that it is excessive without additional evidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We mostly agree with this criticism. One could interpret the larger spread of the data for <italic>sorl1</italic> larvae treated with 10 µM citalopram as evidence that the knockout larvae do indeed react differently to the drug at this dose. However, the result indeed does not survive removing the top 5 (p = 0.87) or top 3 (p = 0.18) <italic>sorl1</italic> larvae.</p>
<p>Given that the HCR did not reveal anything striking, we agree with you that too much of our argument relies on this result being robust. As you and reviewer #3 suggest, we plan on repeating this experiment with a different serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). If the other SSRI also shows a differential effect, this should strengthen the claim that ZOLTAR correctly predicted serotonin signalling as being affected by the loss of Sorl1, even if we did not discover the molecular mechanism.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The authors suggest two hypotheses for the behavioral difference between the sorl1 KO and scrambled at the higher dose of the citalopram. While the first is tested, and found to not be supported, the second is not tested at all (&quot;Ruling out the first hypothesis, sorl1 knockouts may react excessively to a given spike in serotonin.&quot; and &quot;Second, sorl1 knockouts may be overly sensitive to serotonin itself because post-synaptic neurons have higher levels of serotonin receptors.&quot;). Assuming that the finding is robust, there are probably other reasons why the mutants could have a different sensitivity to this molecule. However, if this particular one is going to be mentioned, it is surprising that it was not tested alongside the first hypothesis. This work could proceed without a complete explanation, but additional discussion of the possibilities would be helpful or why the second hypothesis was not tested.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are no strong scientific reasons why this hypothesis was not tested. The lead author (F Kroll) moved to a different lab and country so the project was finalised at that time. We do not plan on testing this hypothesis at this stage. However, we will adapt the wording to make it clear this is one possible alternative hypothesis which could be tested in the future, rather than the only alternative.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The authors claim that &quot;all four genes produced a fairly consistent phenotype at night&quot;. While it is interesting that this result arose in the different lines, the second clutch for some genes did not replicate as well as others. I think the findings are compelling, regardless, but the sometimes missing replicability should be discussed. I wonder if the F0 strategy adds noise to the results and if clean null lines would yield stronger phenotypes. Please discuss this possibility, or others, in regard to the variability in some phenotypes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For the first part of this point, please see below our answer to Reviewer #3, point (2) c.</p>
<p>Regarding the F0 strategy potentially adding variability, it is an interesting question which we tested in a larger dataset of behavioural recordings from F0 and stable knockouts for the same genes (unpublished). In summary, the F0 knockout method does not increase clutch-to-clutch or larva-to-larva variability in the assay. F0 knockout experiments found many more significant parameters and larger effect sizes than stable knockout experiments, but this difference could largely be explained by the larger sample sizes of F0 knockout experiments. In fact, larger sample sizes within individual clutches appears to be a major advantage of the F0 knockout approach over in-cross of heterozygous knockout animals as it increases sensitivity of the assay without causing substantial variability. We plan to report in more details on this analysis in a separate paper as we think it would dilute the focus of the present work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- In this work, the knockout of appa/appb is included. While APP is a well-known risk gene, there is no clear justification for making a knockout model. It is well known that the upregulation of app is the driver of Alzheimer's, not downregulation. The authors even indicate an expectation that it could be similar to the other knockouts (&quot;Moreover, the behavioural phenotypes of appa/appb and psen1 knockout larvae had little overlap while they presumably both resulted in the loss of Aβ.&quot; and &quot;Comparing with early-onset genes, psen1 knockouts had similar night-time phenotypes, but loss of psen2 or appa/appb had no effect on night-time sleep.&quot;). There is no reason to expect similarity between appa/appb and psen1/2. I understand that the app knockouts could unveil interesting early neurodevelopmental roles, but the manuscript needs to be clarified that any findings could be the opposite of expectation in AD.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>On “there is no reason to expect similarity […]”, we disagree. Knockout of <italic>appa/appb</italic> and knockout <italic>psen1</italic> will both result in loss of Aβ (<italic>appa/appb</italic> encode Aβ and <italic>psen1</italic> cleaves Appa/Appb to release Aβ, cf. Fig. 3e). Consequently, a phenotype caused by the loss of Aβ, or possibly other Appa/Appb cleavage products, should logically be found in both <italic>appa/appb</italic> and <italic>psen1</italic> knockouts.</p>
<p>On “it is well known that the upregulation of <italic>APP</italic> is the driver of Alzheimer’s, not downregulation”; we of course agree. Among others, the examples of Down syndrome, APP duplication (Sleegers et al., 2006), or mouse models overexpressing human <italic>APP</italic> show definitely that overexpression of <italic>APP</italic> is sufficient to cause AD. Having said that, we would not be so quick in dismissing <italic>APP</italic> knockout as potentially relevant to understanding of Alzheimer’s disease. Loss of soluble Aβ due to aggregation could contribute to pathology (Espay et al., 2023). Without getting too much into this intricate debate, links between levels of Aβ and risk of disease are often counter-intuitive too. For example, out of 138 PSEN1 mutations screened <italic>in vitro</italic>, 104 reduced total Aβ production and 11 even seemingly abolished the production of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Sun et al., 2017). In short, loss of soluble Aβ occurs in both AD and in our <italic>appa/appb</italic> knockout larvae, but the ideal approach would be to study zebrafish larvae with an in-frame deletion in the Aβ sequence within <italic>appa/appb</italic>.</p>
<p>We will adapt the language to address your point. We would not want to imply, for example, that the absence of a night-time sleep phenotype for <italic>appa/appb</italic> is contradictory to the body of literature showing links between Aβ and sleep, including in zebrafish (Özcan et al., 2020). As you say, our experiment tested loss of App, including Aβ, while the literature typically reports on overexpression of APP, as in <italic>APP/PSEN1</italic>-overexpressing mice (Jagirdar et al., 2021).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this manuscript by Kroll and colleagues, the authors describe combining behavioral pharmacology with sleep profiling to predict disease and potential treatment pathways at play in AD. AD is used here as a case study, but the approaches detailed can be used for other genetic screens related to normal or pathological states for which sleep/arousal is relevant. The data are for the most part convincing, although generally the phenotypes are relatively small and there are no major new mechanistic insights. Nonetheless, the approaches are certainly of broad interest and the data are comprehensive and detailed.</p>
<p>A notable weakness is the introduction, which overly generalizes numerous concepts and fails to provide the necessary background to set the stage for the data.</p>
<p>Major points</p>
<p>(1) The authors should spend more time explaining what they see as the meaning of the large number of behavioral parameters assayed and specifically what they tell readers about the biology of the animal. Many are hard to understand--e.g. a &quot;slope&quot; parameter.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that some parameters do not tell something intuitive about the biology of the animal. It would be easy to speculate. For example, the “activity slope” parameter may indicate how quickly the animal becomes tired over the course of the day. On the other hand, fractal dimension describes the “roughness/smoothness” of the larva’s activity trace (Fig. 2–suppl. 1a); but it is not obvious how to translate this into information about the physiology of the animal. We do not see this as an issue though. While some parameters do provide intuitive information about the animal’s behaviour (e.g. sleep duration or sunset startle as a measure of startle response), the benefit of having a large number of behavioural parameters is to compare behavioural fingerprints and assess rescue of the behavioural phenotype by small molecules (Fig. 6c). For this purpose, the more parameters the better. The “MoSeq” approach from Wiltschko et al., 2020 is a good example from literature that inspired our own Fig. 6c. While some of the “behavioural syllables” may be intuitive (e.g. running or grooming), it is probably pointless to try to explain the ‘meaning’ of the “small left turn in place with head motion” syllable (Wiltschko et al., 2020). Nonetheless, this syllable was useful to assess whether a drug specifically treats the behavioural phenotype under study without causing too many side effects. Unfortunately, ZOLTAR has to reduce the FramebyFrame fingerprint (17 parameters) to just six parameters to compare it to the behavioural dataset from Rihel et al., 2010, but here, more parameters would almost certainly translate into better predictions too, regardless of their intuitiveness.</p>
<p>It is true however that we do not give much information on how some of the less intuitive parameters, such as activity slope or fractal dimension, are calculated or what they describe about the dataset (e.g. roughness/smoothness for fractal dimension). We will improve this in our revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Because in the end the authors did not screen that many lines, it would increase confidence in the phenotypes to provide more validation of KO specificity. Some suggestions include:</p>
<p>a. The authors cite a psen1 and psen2 germline mutant lines. Can these be tested in the FramebyFrame R analysis? Do they phenocopy F0 KO larvae?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We unfortunately do not have those lines. We investigated the availability of importing a <italic>psen2</italic> knockout line from abroad, but the process of shipping live animals is becoming more and more cost and time prohibitive. However, we observed the same pigmentation phenotype for <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts as reported by Jiang et al., 2018, which is at least a partial confirmation of phenocopying a loss of function stable mutant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b. psen2KO is one of the larger centerpieces of the paper. The authors should present more compelling evidence that animals are truly functionally null. Without this, how do we interpret their phenotypes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We disagree that there should be significant doubt about these mutants being truly functionally null,  given the high mutation rate and presence of the expected pigmentation phenotype (Jiang et al., 2018, Fig. 3f and Fig. 3–suppl. 2). The <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockouts were virtually 100% mutated at three exons across the gene (mutation rates were locus 1: 100 ± 0%; locus 2: 99.99 ± 0.06%; locus 3: 99.85 ± 0.24%). Additionally, two of the three mutated exons had particularly high rates of frameshift mutations (locus 1: 97 ± 5%; locus 2: 88 ± 17% frameshift mutation rate). It is virtually impossible that a functional protein is translated given this burden of frameshift mutations. Phenotypically, in addition to the pigmentation defect, double <italic>psen1/psen2</italic> F0 knockout larvae had curved tails, the same phenotype as caused by a high dose of the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (Yang et al., 2008). These double F0 knockouts were lethal, while knockout of <italic>psen1</italic> or <italic>psen2</italic> alone did not cause obvious morphological defects. Evidently, most larvae must have been <italic>psen2</italic> null mutants in this experiment, otherwise functional Psen2 would have prevented early lethality.</p>
<p>Translation of zebrafish <italic>psen2</italic> can start at downstream start codons if the first exon has a frameshift mutation, generating a seemingly functional Psen2 missing the N-terminus (Jiang et al., 2020). Zebrafish homozygous for this early frameshift mutation had normal pigmentation, showing it is a reliable marker of Psen2 function even when it is mutated. This mechanism is not a concern here as the alternative start codons are still upstream of two of the three mutated exons (the alternative start codons discovered by Jiang et al., 2020 are in exon 2 and 3, but we targeted exon 3, exon 4, and exon 6).</p>
<p>We understand that the zebrafish community may be cautious about F0 phenotyping compared to stably generated mutants. As mentioned to Reviewer 2, we are planning to assemble a paper that expressly examines F0s vs. stable mutants to allay some of these concerns. We would also suggest that our current manuscript, which combines CRISPR-F0 rapid screening with in silico pharmacological predictions, ultimately represents a first step in characterizing the functions of genes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>c. Related to the above, for cd2AP and sorl1 KO, some of the effect sizes seem to be driven by one clutch and not the other. In other words, great clutch-to-clutch variability. Should the authors increase the number of clutches assayed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Correct, there is great clutch-to-clutch variability in this behavioural assay. This is not specific to our experiments. Even within the same strain, wild-type larvae from different clutches (i.e. non-siblings) behave differently (Joo et al., 2021). This is why it is essential to compare behavioural phenotypes within individual clutches (i.e., from a single pair of parents, one male and one female), as we explain in Methods (section <italic>Behavioural video-tracking</italic>) and in the documentation of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/francoiskroll/FramebyFrame">FramebyFrame package</ext-link>. We often see two different experimental designs in literature: comparing non-sibling wild-type and mutant larvae, or pooling different clutches which include all genotypes (e.g., pooling multiple clutches from heterozygous in-crosses or pooling wild-type clutches before injecting them). The first experimental design causes false positive findings, as the clutch-to-clutch variability we and others (Joo et al., 2021) observe gets interpreted as a behavioural phenotype. The second experimental design should not cause false positives but will decrease the sensitivity of the assay by increasing the spread within genotypes. In both cases, the clutch-to-clutch variability is hidden, either by interpreting it as a phenotype (first case) or by adding it to animal-to-animal variability (second case). Our experimental design is technically more challenging as it requires obtaining large clutches from unique pairs of parents. However, this approach is better as it clearly separates the different sources of variability (clutch-to-clutch or animal-to-animal). As for every experiment, yes, a larger number of replicates would be better, but we do not plan to assay additional clutches at this time. Our work heavily focuses on the <italic>sorl1</italic> and <italic>psen2</italic> knockout behavioural phenotypes. The key aspects of these phenotypes were effectively tested in four clutches as <italic>sorl1</italic> were also tested in the citalopram experiment (Fig. 5), and <italic>psen2</italic> was also tested in the small molecule rescue experiment (Fig. 6 and Fig. 6–suppl. 1). In the citalopram experiment, one H2O-treated <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout clutch (n = 10) replicates fairly well the baseline recordings in Fig. 4–suppl. 5, the other does not but had especially low sample size (n = 6).</p>
<p>We also plan to test another SSRI on <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts, so this point will be addressed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors make the point that most of the AD risk genes are expressed in fish during development. Is there public data to comment on whether the genes of interest are expressed in mature/old fish as well? Just because the genes are expressed early does not at all mean that early- life dysfunction is related to future AD (though this could be the case, of course). Genes with exclusive developmental expression would be strong candidates for such an early-life role, however. I presume the case is made because sleep studies are mainly done in juvenile fish, but I think it is really a pretty minor point and such a strong claim does not even need to be made.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a fair criticism but we do not make this claim, at least not from expression. The reviewer is probably referring to the following quote:</p>
<p>“[…] most of these were expressed in the brain of 5–6-dpf zebrafish larvae, suggesting they play a role in early brain development or function,”</p>
<p>which does not mention future risk of Alzheimer’s disease. We do <italic>suggest</italic> that these genes have a function in development. After all, every gene that plays a role in brain development must be expressed during development, so this wording seems reasonable. As noted, the primary goal was to check that the genes we selected were indeed expressed in zebrafish larvae before performing knockout experiments. Our discussion does raise the hypothesis that mutations in Alzheimer’s risk genes impact brain development and sleep early in life, but this argument primarily relies on our observation that knockout of late-onset Alzheimer’s risk genes causes sleep phenotypes in 7-day old zebrafish larvae and from previous work showing brain structural differences in infants and children at high genetic risk of Alzheimer’s disease (Dean et al., 2014; Quiroz et al., 2015), not solely on gene expression early in life.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) A common quandary with defining sleep behaviorally is how to rectify sleep and activity changes that influence one another. With psen2 KOs, the authors describe reduced activity and increased sleep during the day. But how do we know if the reduced activity drives increased behavioral quiescence that is incorrectly defined as sleep? In instances where sleep is increased but activity during periods during wake are normal or elevated, this is not an issue. But here, the animals might very well be unhealthy, and less active, so naturally they stop moving more for prolonged periods, but the main conclusion is not sleep per se. This is an area where more experiments should be added if the authors do not wish to change/temper the conclusions they draw. Are psen2 KOs responsive to startling stimuli like controls when awake? Do they respond normally when quiescent? Great care must be taken in all models using inactivity as a proxy for sleep, and it can harm the field when there is no acknowledgment that overall health/activity changes could be a confound. Particularly worrisome is the betamethasone data in Figure 6, where activity and sleep are once again coordinately modified by the drug.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a fair criticism. We agree it is a concern, especially in the case of <italic>psen2</italic> as we claim that <italic>day-time</italic> sleep is increased while zebrafish are diurnal. We do not rely heavily on the day-time inactivity being sleep (the ZOLTAR predictions or the small molecule rescue do not change whether the parameter is called sleep or inactivity), but  our choice of labelling may be misleading. We will try to test this claim by plotting the distribution of the inactive period durations. If <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae indeed sleep more during the day compared to controls, we might predict that inactive periods longer than 1 minute to increase disproportionately compared to the increase in shorter inactive periods.</p>
<p>To address, “are <italic>psen2</italic> KO responsive to startling stimuli like controls when awake/when quiescent”, we can try to look at the behaviour of <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae that were awake (i.e., moved in the preceding one minute) or ‘asleep’ (i.e., did not move in the preceding one minute) at the light transitions and count the proportion of <italic>psen2</italic> knockout or control larvae which displayed a startle response. If most <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts react to the light transition, it should at least exclude the concern that they are very unhealthy, as the reviewer suggests. This criticism seems challenging to definitely address experimentally though. A possible approach could be to use a closed-loop system which, after one minute of inactivity, triggers a stimulus which is sufficient to startle an awake larva but not an asleep larva. If <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae indeed sleep more during the day, the stimulus should usually not be sufficient to startle them. Note, how to calibrate this stimulus is also not straightforward. We do not plan to test this, but our analysis of the light transitions may provide a decent proxy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The conclusions for the serotonin section are overstated. Behavioural pharmacology purports to predict a signaling pathway disrupted with sorl1 KO. But is it not just possible that the drug acts in parallel to the true disrupted pathway in these fish? There is no direct evidence for serotonin dysfunction - that conclusion is based on response to the drug. Moreover, it is just 1 drug - is the same phenotype present with another SSRI? Likewise, language should be toned down in the discussion, as this hypothesis is not &quot;confirmed&quot; by the results (consider &quot;supported&quot;). The lack of measured serotonin differences further raises concern that this is not the true pathway. This is another major point that deserves further experimental evidence, because without it, the entire approach (behavioral pharm screen) seems more shaky as a way to identify mechanisms. There are any number of testable hypotheses to pursue such as a) Using transient transgenesis to visualize 5HT neuron morphology (is development perturbed: cell number, neurite morphology, synapse formation); b) Using transgenic Ca reporters to assay 5HT neuron activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding the comment, “is it not just possible that the drug acts in parallel to the true disrupted pathway”, we think no, assuming we understand correctly your question. Key to our argument is the fact that <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout larvae react differently to the drug than control larvae. As an example, take night-time sleep bout length, which was not affected by knockout of <italic>sorl1</italic> (Fig. 4–suppl. 5). For the sake of the argument, say only dopamine signalling (the “true disrupted pathway”) was affected in <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts but that serotonin signalling was intact. Assuming that citalopram specifically alters serotonin signalling, then treatment should cause the same increase in sleep bout length in both knockouts and controls as serotonin signalling is intact in both. This is not what we see, however. Citalopram caused a <italic>greater</italic> increase in sleep bout length in <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts than in scrambled-injected larvae. In other words, the effect is non-additive, in the sense that citalopram did not add the same number of Z-scores to <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts or controls. We think this shows that serotonin signalling is somehow different in <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts. Nonetheless, we would concede that the experiment does not necessarily says much about the importance of the serotonin disruption caused by loss of Sorl1. It could be, for example, that the most salient consequence of loss of Sorl1 is cholinergic disruption (see reply to Reviewer #1 above) and that serotonin signalling is a minor theme.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we agree with you and Reviewer #2 that the conclusions are overly confident. We will repeat this experiment with another SSRI as you suggest. Your suggestions to further test the serotonin system in the <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts are excellent as well, however we do not plan to pursue them at this stage.</p>
