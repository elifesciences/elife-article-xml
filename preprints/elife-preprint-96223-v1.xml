<title>Summary</title><p>Behaviorally relevant, higher order representations of an animal’s environment are built from the convergence of visual features encoded in the early stages of visual processing. Although developmental mechanisms that generate feature encoding channels in early visual circuits have been uncovered, relatively little is known about the mechanisms that direct feature convergence to enable appropriate integration into downstream circuits. Here we explore the development of a collision detection sensorimotor circuit in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the convergence of visual projection neurons (VPNs) onto the dendrites of a large descending neuron, the giant fiber (GF). We find VPNs encoding different visual features establish their respective territories on GF dendrites through sequential axon arrival during development. Physical occupancy, but not developmental activity, is important to maintain territories. Ablation of one VPN results in the expansion of remaining VPN territories and functional compensation that enables the GF to retain responses to ethologically relevant visual stimuli. GF developmental activity, observed using a pupal electrophysiology preparation, appears after VPN territories are established, and likely contributes to later stages of synapse assembly and refinement. Our data highlight temporal mechanisms for visual feature convergence and promote the GF circuit and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> optic glomeruli, where VPN to GF connectivity resides, as a powerful developmental model for investigating complex wiring programs and developmental plasticity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In a developing brain, the coordinated wiring of multiple inputs onto a neuron and organization of these inputs across a neuron’s dendrites establish the computational role for that neuron. Uncovering the mechanisms that assemble and localize multiple inputs is pivotal to understand how inputs are miswired in neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> and how developmental processes attempt to compensate when particular inputs are missing or fail to connect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Across species, we know little about how multiple inputs that converge upon a neuron are wired during development because the underlying circuits are often not well established – we are missing the solution to the wiring program, where all inputs are known and synapse locations are mapped.</p>
<p>Here, we capitalize on recent connectome data and functional investigations within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> optic glomeruli, a central brain region where visual feature inputs converge onto sensorimotor circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Optic glomeruli are the output region for columnar visual projection neurons (VPNs) that are hypothesized to encode visual features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. VPN dendrites are retinotopically distributed to tile the lobula and the lobula plate of the fly’s optic lobes, while fasciculated VPN axons terminate within their respective glomerulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Within each glomerulus, VPNs synapse with multiple targets, including descending neurons (DNs) that project axons to the ventral nerve cord (VNC, the fly spinal cord homologue) where they in turn synapse onto interneurons and motoneurons that generate behavioral outputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Unlike the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory glomeruli which have a predominantly one to one olfactory receptor neuron to projection neuron mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, each VPN glomerulus is not dedicated to a single DN type. Instead, DN dendrites infiltrate multiple, semi-overlapping subsets of glomeruli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, essentially assembling VPN features into higher order, behaviorally relevant motor and premotor outputs. How this complex wiring of visual feature inputs onto DNs is established during development is presently unknown.</p>
<p>A pair of large DNs called the giant fibers (GFs) receive major input from two VPN types in the optic glomeruli: lobula columnar type 4 (LC4) neurons and lobula plate - lobula columnar type 2 (LPLC2) neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. LC4 and LPLC2 encode the angular velocity and angular size of an expanding object, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and enable the GFs to drive a rapid takeoff escape in response to an object approaching on a direct collision course<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The GF circuit within the optic glomeruli presents an ideal model for developmental investigations. GF connectivity in adult flies has been recently established through electron microscopy, genetic access exists for the GF and its major visual input cell types, and the large GF dendrites within the glomeruli can be resolved and tracked across development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Additionally, the accessibility of the GF to electrophysiology enables the functional consequences of developmental events to be directly evaluated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. GF dendrites are also in close proximity to VPNs that are not synaptic partners in the adult, like lobula plate - lobula columnar type 1 (LPLC1) neurons. This provides an opportunity to investigate developmental interactions with cell types that do or do not select the GF as a synaptic partner.</p>

<p>Here, we establish the GF circuit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> as a model for visual feature convergence in a developing nervous system. We screened VPN and GF GAL4 and LexA driver lines for early developmental expression and cell-type specificity. We then used identified driver lines to characterize the timecourse of VPN and GF interactions across metamorphosis that lead to their final organization in the adult. Combining a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas of the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, synaptic protein labeling over development, and a novel <italic>ex-plant</italic> electrophysiology preparation that enabled us to record from the GF at distinct developmental timepoints, we correlated the time course of VPN to GF interactions with the arrival of synaptic machinery and neural activity. To determine how competition shapes VPN synapse organization along GF dendrites, we genetically ablated one VPN cell type (LC4) and investigated both structural and functional compensation from the surviving VPN partner (LPLC2). Our data provide a thorough characterization of the assembly of visual feature convergence onto GF dendrites and establish the optic glomeruli as a genetically and functionally tractable model to uncover mechanisms underlying complex wiring programs.</p>

<title>VPNs are localized to stereotyped regions on GF dendrites</title>
<p>GF dendrites extend into the optic glomeruli in close proximity to multiple VPN cell-types (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A,B</xref>). EM reconstruction of a full adult fly brain (FAFB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>) previously revealed that 55 LC4 and 108 LPLC2 neurons connect directly onto GF optic glomeruli dendrites, contributing 2,442 and 1,366 synapses, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. VPN synapses segregate across the medial-lateral axis, with LC4 predominantly localized to medial, and LPLC2 to lateral, dendritic regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. To investigate stereotypy in VPN to GF connectivity, we utilized a second EM dataset of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> hemibrain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In this EM reconstruction, we found LC4 (71/71) and LPLC2 (85/85) neurons established 2,290 and 1,443 synapses onto the GF optic glomeruli dendrites, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). We confirmed LC4 and LPLC2 synapses segregate along the medial-lateral axis, with only 2/85 LPLC2 neurons making synapses in predominantly LC4 occupied medial areas.</p>
<p>Since existing EM data only represent connectivity within two fly brains, we further investigated localization stereotypy by examining contacts between GF and VPN membranes across multiple adult flies. We used split-GAL4 driver lines that selectively labeled LC4 (<italic>LC4_4- split-GAL4</italic>, generated for this paper<italic>)</italic> or LPLC2 (<italic>LPLC2-split-GAL4</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, and simultaneously labeled the GF with a LexA line (<italic>GF_1-LexA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, left). As a proxy for membrane contacts, we performed intensity-based thresholding on each cell-type of interest to generate representative masks, and then visualized colocalized regions along GF dendrites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, right). We consistently observed LC4 contacts on the most medial regions of the GF optic glomeruli dendrites and LPLC2 contacts on the most lateral regions. We also found on occasion (4/17 brain hemispheres), as seen in the hemibrain dataset, a small subset of LPLC2 axons extending into the most medial regions on the GF (Supplemental Figure 1, arrow)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. These data suggest that LC4 and LPLC2 consistently segregate to stereotyped regions along the medial-lateral axis with rare exceptions.</p>
<p>We used the same approach to assess the projections of LPLC1 (<italic>LPLC1_1-split-GAL4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup></italic>, a cell-type adjacent to LC4 and LPLC2 that does not synapse directly with the GF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. As expected, no synapses were identified in the hemibrain EM dataset (Supplemental Figure 2) and no membrane contacts were observed between GF and LPLC1 across all adult flies imaged with confocal microscopy (Supplemental Figure 2). We additionally employed GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners (GRASP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> to visualize contacts between adjacent membranes and observed GFP expression between GF and LC4/LPLC2 in their respective medial/lateral locations, but not between GF and LPLC1 (Supplemental Figure 3).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>GF lateral dendrites extend, elaborate, and then refine across pupal stages</title>
<p>Following our detailed anatomical characterization, we sought to determine how the precise VPN localization along GF dendrites arises across development. Prior developmental investigations into the GF have focused on axonal wiring with respect to postsynaptic interneuron and motor neuron partners in the ventral nerve cord (VNC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. However, little is known about how GF dendrites develop in the central brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. The GF is born during embryonic stages but does not generate neurites until the third instar larval stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. To track the GF at these early timepoints, we used the <italic>GF_1-LexA</italic> line that labels the GF starting in late larval stages (Supplemental Figure 4) and dissected pupae in 12-hour increments over metamorphosis, a period marked as the time between pupa formation and eclosion.</p>
<p>Across development, we tracked the complexity and size of GF optic glomeruli dendrites by quantifying their volume (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,B</xref>) and the length of the maximum dendrite extension along the medial-lateral axis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,C</xref>). In the early stages of metamorphosis, 24-48 hours after pupa formation (hAPF), the GF exhibited numerous filopodia, long thin protrusions without a bulbous head, and arbor complexity increased with the GF projecting between 3.1 <underline>+</underline> 1.0 primary dendrites laterally (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,B</xref>). During the middle stages of metamorphosis, from 48 hAPF to 60 hAPF, the GF dendrites had the largest increase in their medial-lateral extent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), followed by a peak in the overall volume and extension length at 72 hAPF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref>). During this time, filopodia were still present, but visibly shorter than in the first half of metamorphosis. In the final stages of metamorphosis from 72 hAPF to eclosion, the volume of GF dendrites significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref>), while the medial-lateral length was maintained. Filopodia were no longer obvious, and branches appeared less complex and began to resemble their adult morphology.</p>

We hypothesized VPNs would commence outgrowth and partner matching in coordination with GF dendrite development. To visualize developmental interactions of select VPN and GF, we used existing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> or newly developed VPN split-GAL4 driver lines screened for pupal expression (Supplemental Figure 4), to concurrently label select VPN cell-types (<italic>LC4_4-split-GAL4</italic>, <italic>LPLC2-split-GAL4, LPLC1_1-split-GAL4</italic>) and the GF (<italic>GF_1-LexA</italic>) over metamorphosis. To quantify interactions, we employed our membrane colocalization method (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) instead of synapse labeling methods (such as t-GRASP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>) because we wanted to track all putative interactions, including those that precede synapse formation, over time and did not want to create ectopic adhesions between membranes. We additionally compared our membrane colocalization method to a GRASP variant that is not restricted to presynaptic terminals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and found no statistical difference between the number of colocalized or GFP positive pixels (Supplemental Figure 5).</p>
<p>Using colocalization as a proxy for membrane contacts, we investigated developmental interactions between GF and its known adult partner VPNs, LC4 and LPLC2. We observed LC4 axonal extension and initial contact with GF at 24 hAPF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). At this timepoint, LC4 axons diverge into a dorsal fraction projected near the dorsal branch of the GF optic glomeruli dendrites, and a ventral fraction projected towards the proximal regions of the GF dendrites (Supplemental Figure 6). At 36 hAPF, contacts between the GF and LC4 increased, with both dorsal and ventral fractions still apparent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, arrow, arrowhead, respectively). Although <italic>LPLC2-split-GAL4</italic> shows obvious expression at this time, we did not observe any contacts between LPLC2 and the GF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E,G</xref>).</p>
<p>At 48 hAPF, LC4 and GF continued to show an increase in contacts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), and LC4 dorsal and ventral axons had converged (Supplemental Figure 6). At this time, approximately 24 hours after initial GF and LC4 contact, we observed GF contacts with LPLC2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E,G</xref>) as the dorsal branch of the GF dendrites extended past LC4 axons (Supplemental Figure 6, arrowhead). Altogether, our data suggest that during the first half of metamorphosis, as the GF is seeking out synaptic partners, interactions with VPN are staggered in time.</p>
<p>After the initial establishment of contacts, we next observed a significant increase in contacts between partner VPNs and GF from 60 hAPF to 72 hAPF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-G</xref>). At 84 hAPF through eclosion, contacts between GF and both VPNs decreased and then stabilized. Our results suggest that in the second half of metamorphosis, GF prioritizes dendritic outgrowth, enhances contacts with partner VPN, and eventually refines and stabilizes contacts with appropriate VPN partners, LC4 and LPLC2.</p>
<p>We next investigated interactions between GF and a neighboring VPN, LPLC1, that does not maintain synapses with GF in adulthood (Supplemental Figure 2). We observed a relatively small number of contacts between GF and neurons labeled with <italic>LPLC1_1-split-GAL4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> appearing around 48 hAPF, peaking around 60 hAPF, and disappearing around 84 hAPF (Supplemental Figure 7A,B). This driver line, however, may also label a subset of VPN that are not LPLC1 during development (Supplemental Figure 7D,E), so we repeated our contact analysis by generating two new LPLC1 driver lines, <italic>LPLC1_2-split-GAL4</italic> and <italic>LPLC1_3-split-GAL4</italic> (Supplemental Figure 4). While these driver lines revealed GF and LPLC1 membranes are adjacent at 60 hAPF, we observed minimal to no contacts with GF (Supplemental Figure 7C).</p>
<p>Altogether, these results suggest that early in development, GF contacts are already biased towards VPNs that are synaptically coupled to the GF in the adult.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>LC4 and LPLC2 occupy and maintain distinct regions along the GF dendrite</title>
<p>In the adult GF circuit, LC4 inputs are localized to the medial regions of GF dendrites, whereas LPLC2 inputs are localized to the most lateral regions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). It is unknown if this medial-lateral segregation is established initially or arises over development. To address this, we manually aligned the GF dendrites across brains and quantified the density of contacts along the medial-lateral axis. Across all time points, we found minimal overlap between LC4 and LPLC2; the peak density of contacts for LC4 and LPLC2 consistently occupied the most medial and lateral regions, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H-J</xref>).</p>
<p>The GF optic glomeruli dendrites contain dorsal and ventral branches, therefore we repeated the analysis of membrane contacts along the dorsal-ventral axis. At 48 hAPF, LPLC2 contacts were primarily confined to the dorsal regions, and LC4 to the ventral regions (Supplemental Figure 8). This segregation was reduced at 60 hAPF and less obvious in the later stages of development (84 hAPF – 96 hAPF), in alignment with previous investigations into adult synapse localization along the dorsal-ventral axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Altogether, our results highlight the importance of the medial-lateral division of LC4 and LPLC2 inputs onto GF dendrites, where targeting is established early and maintained throughout development.</p>

<p>As developmental clusters corresponding to LC4, LPLC2, and LPLC1 have been identified in this dataset, we re-analyzed these data to determine when genes required for synaptic transmission were upregulated in metamorphosis. We first investigated the expression of <italic>brp</italic>, a presynaptic active zone protein that is homologous to the mammalian ELKS/CAST family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> that is commonly used to label presynaptic terminals. We found <italic>brp</italic> to be present as early as 24 hAPF and gradually increase up until 60 – 72 hAPF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, Supplemental Figures 9,10). Presynaptic genes in the SNARE complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> <italic>nSyb</italic>, <italic>cpx</italic>, <italic>Snap25</italic> and <italic>Syx1A</italic> were also present at early pupal stages, but significant upregulation was delayed with respect to <italic>brp</italic>, from around 60 hAPF until the end of metamorphosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, Supplemental Figures 9,10).</p>
<p>LC4, LPLC1 and LPLC2 are predicted to be cholinergic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, and we found genes for cholinergic synapse function (<italic>ChAT</italic> and <italic>VAChT</italic>) were upregulated in the late stages of metamorphosis (<underline>&gt;</underline> 60 hAPF) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, Supplemental Figure 9-10), delayed from the initial appearance of presynaptic machinery, but following the time course reported for other cholinergic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. This upregulation coincides with our observed decrease in GF dendritic complexity, and refinement and stabilization of GF and VPN contacts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F,G</xref>, Supplemental Figure 7A-C). These data suggest that although a subset of presynaptic components are expressed and potentially assembled early, VPN cholinergic machinery arrives too late to contribute to the initial targeting and localization of VPN axons on GF dendrites. Cholinergic activity instead is likely to participate in VPN and GF synapse refinement and stabilization.</p>
<p>Given the significant role electrical synapses play across development, we also examined expression of the innexin family of gap junction proteins. Shaking-B (<italic>shakB</italic>) has been denoted to be the predominant innexin over development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, and we also observed a significant increase as early as 36 hAPF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, Supplemental Figures 9,10) with all other innexins showing minimal to no expression across metamorphosis. <italic>shakB</italic> expression peaked between 48-60 hAPF, followed by a significant decrease from 60 hAPF to 72 hAPF for all cell types (Supplemental Figures 9,10). Interestingly, this decrease occurred as <italic>ChAT</italic> and <italic>VAChT</italic> increased, potentially marking the transition from predominantly electrical synaptic coupling to chemical synaptic coupling.

<title>GF and VPN synapse assembly is initiated during the partner matching stages</title>
<p>While our scRNA-seq data provide an estimate of gene expression across development, relative levels of mRNA do not necessarily correlate linearly to protein translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Therefore, using our scRNA-seq data to guide our hypotheses, we next investigated the temporal expression patterns of select pre- and postsynaptic proteins in VPN and GF. We utilized an iteration of Synaptic Tagging with Recombination (STaR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> to visualize LPLC2 and LC4 specific Brp, driven by its endogenous promoter and tagged with smGdP-V5. From our scRNA-seq data, <italic>brp</italic> is expressed early in both LC4 and LPLC2 (Supplemental Figures 9,10). Using <italic>LC4_4-split-GAL4</italic> and <italic>LPLC2-split-GAL4</italic> driver lines that turn on prior to 36 hAPF, we quantified the fluorescence of V5-tagged Brp over metamorphosis (Supplemental Figure 11). We found Brp already present in LC4 at 36 hAPF, as supported by the RNAseq data, and that Brp expression increased until 60 hAPF. Unexpectedly, we witnessed a delay in the appearance and peak expression of Brp in LPLC2, similar to the staggered arrival times of LC4 and LPLC2 onto GF dendrites. It is possible that the assembly of synaptic machinery is delayed in LPLC2 to accommodate its arrival time. However, because V5-tagged Brp expression is dependent not only on the native <italic>brp</italic> promoter but also limited by when the VPN driver line turns on, the differences in Brp appearance could also be due to temporal differences in the driver lines. These data suggest presynaptic machinery is already present during initial partner matching between VPN and GF and increases as contacts are refined and stabilized.</p>
<p>We next investigated whether Brp accumulating at presynaptic terminals in VPNs was directly opposed to postsynaptic machinery, as an indicator of functional pre/postsynaptic sites. To label presynaptic Brp in VPN, we established a new transgenic line that expresses Brp-Short tagged with GFP under the control of the lexAop promoter (<italic>lexAop-Brp-Short-GFP)</italic>. Brp-Short is a truncated, non-functional Brp protein that localizes to sites of endogenous full-length Brp without disrupting morphology or function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> and has been used to map synaptic organization in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. To label postsynaptic machinery in the GF, we targeted discs large 1 (<italic>dlg1</italic>), the fly PSD-95 ortholog<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> using <italic>dlg1[4K]</italic>, a conditional tagging strategy that enables cell-type specific (<italic>UAS-FLP</italic>) V5-tagging of endogenous DLG1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Combining these tools with our GF and VPN driver lines, we achieved co-expression of LC4-specific Brp-Short-GFP, and GF-specific DLG1-V5 and investigated protein expression patterns at distinct developmental stages. We observed faint, diffuse DLG1-V5 expression 36 hAPF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C,D</xref>), around the time when initial GF and VPN contacts are observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). However, significant DLG1-V5 and Brp-Short colocalization was not observed until 48 hAPF, although it remained only a small fraction of what was witnessed in the adult (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Our data suggest that although pre- and postsynaptic proteins are present at the initial stages of partner matching, it is not until around 48 hAPF that they begin to assemble functional synaptic connections.</p>

<title>GF exhibits stimulus-independent neural activity during development</title>
<p>Our Brp-Short / DLG1-V5 dual labeling experiments suggest functional pre- and postsynaptic sites are present around 48 hAPF. Interestingly, within fly optic lobe neurons, sporadic and infrequent neural activity is first witnessed, through Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, around 45 hAPF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Developmental activity within DNs has not been investigated, so we set out to determine when activity first initializes within the GF and characterize GF activity patterns over development. We developed an <italic>ex-plant</italic> pupal electrophysiology preparation for high resolution recordings of the GF membrane potential over time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Briefly, the entire pupal CNS was dissected and mounted onto a coverslip, which was then attached to a customized holder that enabled us to perfuse oxygenated extracellular saline during recordings. Using our preparation, we recorded from the GF for approximately one hour in current-clamp mode at distinct developmental time periods. At 45 hAPF, we witnessed sporadic, infrequent depolarizing events (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> and Supplemental Figure 12), aligning with the emergence of activity in the optic lobes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> and the initial opposition of Brp/DLG puncta (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C,D</xref>). The number of depolarizing events increased exponentially as development progressed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F,G</xref>, Supplemental Figure 12), mirroring the increased expression of cholinergic synaptic machinery within the scRNA-seq data (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, Supplemental Figures 9,10). As expected with an increase in the number of depolarizing events, the interval between events decreased (inter-event frequency increased) as a function of age (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>, Supplemental Figure 12).</p>
<p>Our recordings enabled us to observe hyperpolarizing events (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>, arrow) that occasionally proceeded large depolarizing events (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>, arrowheads), and small amplitude events that would not be resolvable with Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. We also observed a broad distribution in event frequency (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G,I</xref>) instead of one dominant frequency from distinct alternating phases between silence and activity as seen in optic lobe or whole brain Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging from 55 - 65 hAPF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. It is possible our <italic>ex-plant</italic> preparation may alter activity patterns from those observed <italic>in-vivo</italic>. Alternatively, our recordings report activity not resolvable in Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, and central brain neurons like the GF may display broader patterns as they pool input across many diverse cell types. Altogether, our data (summarized in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>) suggest initial GF partner matching precedes synaptogenesis. GF synapses become functional around 48 hAPF, with an upregulation of gap junction proteins and the appearance of apposed pre and postsynaptic machinery suggesting electrical (predominant) and chemical (minor) synapses contribute to the underlying activity witnessed at this stage. In the later stages of development, the frequency of synaptic events increase as gap junction proteins are downregulated and cholinergic presynaptic machinery is upregulated to enhance and stabilize synapses with intended synaptic partners while refining unintended contacts.</p>

<title>LC4 ablation results in an increase of GF contacts with the LPLC2 glomerulus</title>
<p>After establishing our timecourse of GF and VPN interactions, we next investigated potential mechanisms that regulate VPN targeting and localization onto GF dendrites. Our data suggest synaptic activity does not contribute to the initial stages of VPN to GF partner matching. However, activity could be necessary for maintenance of the medial-lateral division of LC4 and LPLC2 inputs on GF dendrites, as neuronal activity can be crucial for proper refinement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. To test this, we attempted to silence LC4 during development by expressing the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> using <italic>LC4_4-split-GAL4</italic>. However, we found early expression of <italic>Kir2.1</italic> resulted in a significant loss of LC4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>; Supplemental Figure 13A-D).

Co-expression of an apoptosis inhibitor p35<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> with Kir2.1 using our <italic>LC4_4-split-GAL4</italic> driver line, however did not prevent cell death (Supplemental Figure 13E,F), potentially due to redundancies in apoptosis pathways or the relative timing of expression.</p>

<p>With our finding we could use Kir2.1 as a tool to ablate LC4, we reframed our question to examine how the physical loss of LC4 alters LPLC2 morphology and targeting. Given that LC4 contacts GF dendrites ∼24 hours prior to LPLC2, we wondered if LC4 physically restricts LPLC2 from extending to medial regions of the GF optic glomeruli dendrites. We expressed tdTomato in LPLC2 using a LexA driver line (<italic>LPLC2-LexA)</italic> while simultaneously driving myrGFP or Kir2.1 with <italic>LC4_4-split-GAL4</italic>. In adult flies where Kir2.1 expression ablated the majority of LC4, the LPLC2 axon bundle extended into areas where the LC4 glomerulus would be expected and we witnessed a significant increase the LPLC2 glomerulus volume (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Due to the witnessed expansion of the LPLC2 glomerulus, we next investigated whether the loss of LC4 increased the territory GF dendrites occupied within the LPLC2 glomerulus. We expressed Kir2.1 with <italic>LC4_4-split-GAL4</italic> to achieve LC4 cell death, while simultaneously expressing tdTomato in GF using <italic>GF_1-LexA.</italic> We identified the LPLC2 glomerulus using a neuropil label (Brp) and again found that LC4 cell loss resulted in an LPLC2 glomerulus with altered morphology as compared to control flies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D,E</xref>). We then quantified the overlap between GF dendrites and the LPLC2 glomerulus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). We found that LC4 ablation more than doubled the amount of colocalization between GF dendrites and the LPLC2 glomerulus, with the glomerulus expanding onto more medial regions of the GF dendrites as compared to controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-F</xref>). In summary, our data demonstrate LC4 ablation results in altered LPLC2 axonal morphology and increased GF dendritic arborizations within the LPLC2 glomerulus, suggesting the early arrival and physical presence of LC4 may impede LPLC2 from contacting more medial regions of the GF.</p>
<p>To revisit our original question as to whether activity influences GF and VPN connectivity, we expressed Kir2.1 in LC4 using our late, <italic>LC4_1-split-GAL4</italic> driver line, and tdTomato in GF using our <italic>GF_1-LexA</italic> driver. The <italic>LC4_1-split-GAL4</italic> driver line should be effective at silencing LC4 as it expresses Kir2.1 prior to the onset of GF activity, as witnessed here (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F,G</xref>, Supplemental Figure 12), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity, as observed in the fly’s visual system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. We found no significant difference in the density or localization of contacts between GF and LC4 whether we expressed Kir2.1 or myrGFP in LC4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G,H</xref>). These data suggest LC4 localization along GF dendrites is activity independent, and the early arrival and physical presence of LC4 axons restricts LPLC2 targeting to the lateral regions of GF dendrites.</p>

<title>Functional compensation in the GF circuit occurs after LC4 ablation</title>
<p>Our anatomical data suggest the loss of LC4, but not silencing of its activity, during development results in a reconfiguration of contacts between LPLC2 and GF. We next investigated whether the apparent change in connectivity had functional consequences, affecting GF’s encoding of ethologically relevant visual stimuli. GF are tuned to looming stimuli – the 2D projections of an object approaching on a direct collision course. LC4 provides to the GF information about the angular speed while LPLC2 provides information about the angular size of a looming object<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.

<p>We found, as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, that silencing LC4 by expressing Kir2.1 using the <italic>LC4_1-split-GAL4</italic> driver line reduced the GF response to looming stimuli as stimuli became more abrupt (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I-K</xref>). To further verify Kir2.1 silencing was effective, we expressed Kir2.1 in lamina monopolar cells 1 and 2 (L1-L2), the early-stage inputs to motion vision processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> which ameliorated GF responses, as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> (Supplemental Figure 14). However, in contrast to what we witnessed with silencing, we found the ablation of the majority of the LC4 population, by expressing Kir2.1 with our <italic>LC4_4-split-GAL4</italic> driver line, resulted in an enhanced GF response to looming stimuli (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I-K</xref>), aligned with the observed increase in GF dendrites occupying the LPLC2 glomerulus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-F</xref>). Our data support that the developmental reorganization of LPLC2 and GF following LC4 ablation is functionally significant and leads to an over-compensation in the GF looming response.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, our investigation into the interactions of GF dendrites and VPN axons support a developmental program where GF and partner VPNs make initial contact in precise, stereotyped regions that are maintained into eclosion through competitive, physical interactions. Ablation of one major VPN partner (LC4) results in territory expansion of another VPN (LPLC2) that confers compensatory functional changes within the GF circuit. After initial VPN territories are established, GF dendrites continue to arborize and increase contacts with VPNs, while avoiding contacts with non-synaptic neighbors. This developmental stage coincides with an upregulation of gap junctions, the opposition of pre- and postsynaptic proteins, and the onset of developmental activity in the GF. This outgrowth is followed by a period of stabilization/refinement that coincides with an upregulation of cholinergic synaptic machinery and an increase in the frequency of developmental activity in the GF. This developmental time course is summarized in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A,J</xref>. Our data establish the GF escape circuit as a sophisticated developmental model that can be used to study mechanisms establishing integration of sensory inputs within a sensorimotor circuit, the role neural activity plays in shaping circuit connectivity and refinement, and the relationship between expressed genes and circuit development and function.</p>
<p>The development of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system proceeds in a series of steps which likely serve to reduce the complexity of wiring paradigms from neurons of the same or neighboring cell-types, highlighting the importance of timing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. We found staggered interactions of the GF with VPN partners, where LC4 contacts the GF approximately 24-36 hours prior to LPLC2. This staggered arrival of VPN axons could reduce the complexity of decisions made by the GF during partner matching, as is also seen in the olfactory glomeruli in an <italic>ex-plant</italic> preparation where axons of pioneer olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) terminate in posterior regions, and ORNs arriving later terminate in anterior regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. From 36-72 hAPF, we observe an increase in GF dendritic complexity and extension and increase in contacts with VPN partners, coordinated with an upregulation of genes involved in the SNARE complex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A,B</xref>). This period of precise targeting and outgrowth likely reflects a robust partner matching program, potentially through ligand-receptor or attractive/repulsive cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Our confocal data provide high-resolution snapshots of membranes at distinct periods over metamorphosis, but as metamorphosis is a dynamic process, future work could incorporate time-lapsed imaging to investigate transient interactions that may have been missed.</p>
<p>Our GF and VPN colocalization data show a developmental progression that begins with partner matching between VPN and GF in stereotyped regions, an increase of contacts with synaptic partners, proceeded by refinement as neurons assume their adult morphology. Comparison with the time course of scRNA-seq data provides insight into genes that may play a role in these processes. We find gap junction coupling may serve a role in partner matching, as <italic>shakB</italic> expression is high at this time (Supplemental Figure 9)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Our data also support a transition from predominantly electrical to chemical synapses as witnessed in other species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> at the onset of refinement. <italic>shakB</italic> is downregulated while cholinergic synaptic machinery <italic>ChAT</italic> and <italic>VAChT</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and Supplemental Figures 9,10) are upregulated. Our model system is well poised to investigate the role of electrical and chemical signaling, and their supporting genes, in circuit development and function.</p>
<p>We provide the first electrophysiological recordings of developmental neural activity in pupal neurons, a phenomenon that has been documented in developing vertebrate systems, and recently proposed within the fly with Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Our data demonstrate activity in the GF emerges as early as 45 hAPF, and increases in frequency as a function of time. While scRNA-seq data and our Brp-Short and DLG1-V5 protein expression data suggests this activity is driven through functional electrical and chemical synapses, changes in GF intrinsic properties may also contribute to witnessed changes in frequency. For example, recordings from the superior olivary nucleus in the avian auditory brainstem over embryonic development to hatching show neuronal excitability increases due to changes in K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> ion channel conductance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>, therefore further investigation into what drives these changes in GF activity is warranted.</p>
<p>To record spontaneous activity in pupal GF neurons we developed an <italic>ex-plant</italic> system that differs from established <italic>ex-vivo</italic> systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> in that we are not attempting to culture our ex-plant long term and replicate <italic>in-vivo</italic> conditions through the addition of ecdysone to aid neuronal development. To our knowledge, developmental activity within these ex-vivo systems has yet to be reported. We find in our ex-plant noticeable similarities to the recent discovery of <italic>in-vivo</italic> activity patterns in the developing fly nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. We first observe GF stimulus independent activity (stimulus independent because all sensory organs are no longer connected) as infrequent events around 45 hAPF, similar to sparse Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity witnessed in the fly optic lobes at this same time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. As development progresses, the frequency of depolarizing events in the GF increases, similar to what has been reported <italic>in-vivo.</italic> However, we find no discernible phases of activity and silence as observed <italic>in-vivo</italic> via calcium imaging around 55-65 hAPF, classified as the periodic stage of patterned, stimulus independent neural activity (PSINA). We instead witness a progression into what resembles the later turbulent phase of PSINA that occurs around 70 hAPF to eclosion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. As in-vivo activity in individual developing DNs or central brain neurons has as of yet to be reported, our data could represent actual in-vivo activity patterns from neurons in the central brain where multiple inputs converge. Alternatively, even if our removal of the CNS disrupts activity patterns observed in-vivo, our ex-plant could provide a highly accessible model system to uncover the underlying mechanisms for how particular activity patterns arise.</p>
<p>The location of a synapse on a dendrite can impact its overall effect on a neuron, and establish how it contributes to neural computations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. We find the location of synapses of each VPN cell type to be highly stereotyped, suggesting location may impact computation, although this has yet to be directly investigated. Our contact data suggest that targeting of LC4 and LPLC2 to their respective regions is established upon initial contact instead of refinement in the later stages of development. This is noticeably different from ORN axonal targeting to olfactory glomeruli, where axons target many neighboring glomeruli and are eventually refined to a specific glomerulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. It is possible specific protein interactions establish LC4 and LPLC2 target specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>, similar to how basket interneurons target the axon initial segment of Purkinje cells in the vertebrate cerebellum via localized cell adhesion molecules and adaptor proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>. Our data, however, support that axon arrival times also play a role, with LC4 first contacting GF dendrites in medial regions, physically impeding LPLC2, and leaving LPLC2 segregated to the lateral regions. This physical barrier may explain why LPLC2 is able to extend into medial regions following LC4 ablation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-F</xref>). We do however find LPLC2 does not fully replace LC4 along the dendrites, suggesting segregation may arise from a combination of physical restraints from LC4 and potentially other neurons, in addition to molecular interactions. It does not appear that activity-based mechanisms influence the localization of LC4 and LPLC2 to specific regions because silencing activity in LC4 does not result in significant changes in LC4/GF contact density or localization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G,H</xref>). In addition, elimination of the majority of LC4 neurons did not affect targeting of the remaining LC4 neurons to the GF dendrites in the expected regions.</p>
<p>We also report altered GF output to looming stimulus presentations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J,K</xref>) following LC4 ablation as an example of developmental plasticity to preserve an evolutionary conserved escape behavior that is critical to the fly’s survival. Because we observe a significant increase in GF dendritic occupancy within the LPLC2 glomerulus, our prevailing hypothesis is that LPLC2 synaptic inputs to GF have increased. Alternatively, the 1-7 LC4 neurons that remain after ablation may also have increased synaptic input, however the consistency of the compensatory responses as looming stimulus parameters change (<italic>r</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) and the limited visual field coverage with just 1-7 LC4 neurons supports compensation through remaining LC4 is unlikely to underlie the enhanced GF responses.</p>
<p>While we here demonstrate stereotyped targeting of VPNs to distinct regions on GF dendrites, emerging work suggests an additional level of targeting may occur within individual VPNs. It was previously suggested, based on light microscopy data, that retinotopy is lost within the seemingly random terminations of VPN axons in most optic glomeruli, unlike in vertebrate systems where established retinotopy in the retina is maintained in projections to the lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus/tectum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>. However, recent evidence suggests VPNs preserve spatial information by biasing synaptic input to postsynaptic neurons relative to their receptive field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. This is seen in LC4 synaptic inputs to postsynaptic DNp02 and DNp11 neurons, where LC4 synaptic inputs to DNp02 increase along the posterior to anterior visual axis, and LC4 synaptic inputs to DNp11 increase along the anterior to posterior visual axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. LC4 inputs to GF do not appear to bias synapse numbers based on their receptive field, but a bias of synaptic inputs from LPLC2 to GF exists along the ventral to dorsal axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. As synaptic gradients appear to be utilized amongst many VPN neurons, our model system is well poised to investigate when and how these synaptic biases arise.</p>
<p>In summary, our data provides a detailed anatomical, transcriptomic, and functional description of GF and VPN development. Our model is unique in that we can observe multiple visual feature inputs competing for dendritic space, providing a complex sensorimotor model to the field that will be useful to determine the relationship between connectivity and sensorimotor integration. The GF also receives input from other brain regions outside of the optic glomeruli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>, and it would be interesting to characterize the development of GF with respect to these other regions and further investigate how these inputs influence GF output. Finally, these VPN are only a few of the 20+ VPN that terminate in the optic glomeruli, and GF is one of hundreds of DNs, expanding the opportunity to uncover conserved, fundamental mechanisms for the wiring of sensorimotor circuits.</p>

Imaging parameters were minimally adjusted between images to achieve an image that utilizes the full pixel intensity range without oversaturating pixels. This was necessary as driver lines in earlier pupal developmental periods showed lower levels of expression than in later pupal developmental stages, therefore imaging parameters were adjusted to optimize the membrane signal-to-noise ratio for each developmental stage that would allow for optimized mask generation used in image analysis.

<title>Image analyses</title>
<p>A region of interest (ROI) was drawn around the GF optic glomeruli dendrites to quantify dendritic complexity and length. To quantify dendritic complexity, all pixels in this ROI were summed. The Euclidean distance was measured from the beginning (most medial aspect) of the GF optic glomeruli dendrites to the tip to calculate dendritic length.</p>
<p>To quantify membrane colocalization between GF and VPN neurons across development, intensity-based thresholding was first used to generate a binary mask of each neuron membrane. Using a custom GUI written in MATLAB, threshold values were manually selected to include processes of each cell-type while excluding background and regions of the neuron that were out of focus in each z-plane. Generated binary masks were inspected to make sure each mask was representative of the imaged neuron membrane channel. In certain cases, the set threshold did not include very fine neurites that were difficult to discriminate from background. Lowering threshold values to capture these processes in the mask would result in background being included into the mask as well, therefore generated masks may exclude some of the finer dendritic processes with low SNR. Using these masks, colocalized pixels were collected plane-by-plane across the entire image stack using Boolean operators between GF and VPN masks.</p>
<p>This output matrix resulted in a z-stack where only GF and VPN membranes were colocalized. In some images, GF membrane labeling had a low SNR and prevented accurate mask generation and was therefore excluded from analyses. In some cases, non-GF and non-VPN cell-types were labeled with the driver lines, therefore these data were excluded from analyses. To increase rigor, a second method to quantify GF to VPN membrane colocalization was used. Confocal stacks of labeled neuronal membranes were 3D rendered in Imaris using the Surfaces function. Thresholds were manually applied to generate 3D masks of neuronal membranes so that the rendered 3D image was representative of the imaged membrane. Similar to MATLAB thresholding, in certain cases the set threshold did not include fine neurites as they were difficult to discriminate from the background using automated algorithms. Following initial 3D membrane renderings, renderings were inspected and regions where faint processes were still visible but not detected in the thresholding pipeline were manually filled in using the ‘Magic Wand’ function. Once 3D rendering was complete, areas of colocalization were identified using the ‘Surface-Surface contact area’ XTension, and the volume of this output was quantified.</p>
<p>To determine the density of VPN contacts along the GF optic glomeruli dendrite, a z-projection of the GF was manually aligned and rotated using anatomical landmarks consistently observed to align the lateral dendrite along the medial-lateral axis (x-axis). The same rotation and alignment were applied to the appropriate membrane colocalization matrix. An ROI was then drawn around the GF optic glomeruli dendrites, with anatomical landmarks consistently observed used to denote the beginning and end of the optic glomeruli dendrite. To account for variation in the optic glomeruli dendrite extension across images, we normalized the x-axis to the length of the drawn ROI (i.e., GF lateral dendrite). To determine where VPN contacts were localized along the dorsal-ventral axis (y-axis), the same images were used, but normalized the y-axis to the length of the drawn ROI. Total colocalized pixels were summed along each column or row, respectively, and the pixel density for each column or row was averaged across brains in each condition, then plotted along the normalized axis.</p>
<p>To quantify the average pixel intensity of VPN-specific Bruchpilot (Brp) puncta across developmental timepoints, VPN masks were generated from the membrane channel using the same pipeline used for the GF and VPN membrane colocalization. These binary masks were then multiplied to the Brp-puncta channel to gather raw pixel intensities for Brp-V5 puncta localized to the VPN membrane. The total intensity sum of the glomerulus was divided by the total number of membrane localized pixels to calculate the average pixel intensity.</p>
<p>To isolate Brp pixels that colocalized with DLG, the DLG channel was first thresholded using FIJI’s default auto-thresholding function, binarized in MATLAB, and then multiplied to the Brp channel. An ROI mask was then used to restrict Brp analysis to the VPN glomerulus of interest. The total number of Brp positive pixels was then calculated and the overall volume of Brp-DLG colocalization computed by multiplying the total pixel count by the image voxel size.</p>
<p>To quantify LPLC2 glomerulus volume, the LPLC2-membrane channel and Brp channel were thresholded in Fiji and binarized using MATLAB as described above. The two channels were then multiplied where pixels containing both membrane label and Brp were considered part of the glomerulus. Glomerulus volume was determined by multiplying the total glomerulus pixel count by image voxel size.</p>
<p>For analyses where dendrite complexity and extension were quantified (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,C</xref>), a median filter was used to remove background noise. For all other images, no pre-processing was performed, and only the brightness and contrast were adjusted to highlight neuronal processes when preparing images for figure generation. For all data sets using the GF-LexA driver line, any images that had non-GF cell types within our ROI and low or no GF expression because of driver line stochasticity were excluded from analyses.</p>

<title>Visual Stimuli</title>
<p>Visual stimuli were projected on a cylindrical screen surrounding a head fixed fly during whole-cell electrophysiology following the protocol described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>. A 4.5-inch diameter mylar cylindrical screen covered 180° in azimuth, and two DLP projectors (Texas Instruments Lightcrafter 4500) were used to minimize luminance attenuation at the end of the screen edge. The projections from the two projectors were calibrated on the cylindrical screen surface as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup> and the two projections overlapped 18° in azimuth at center of the screen and blended for uniform illumination. Generated looming stimuli based on the equation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup> below and constant velocity expansion stimuli were displayed with 912 x 1140 resolution in 6bit grayscale at 240 Hz which is above the flicker fusion frequency of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (100 Hz<sup>105</sup>). Looming stimuli were generated by simulating a 2D projection of an object approaching at a constant velocity which mimics an approaching predator. The angular size (θ) of the stimulus subtended by the approaching object and was calculated over time (<italic>t</italic>) by the following equation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup>:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="504653v3_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>t</italic>&lt;0 before collision and <italic>t</italic>=0 at collision for an approaching object with a half size (r) and constant velocity (v). Four looming stimuli (r/v = 10, 20, 40, 80ms) were displayed, starting at 10°, expanding to 63° and then held for 1 second. Stimuli were presented once per trial, in a randomized order, every 30 seconds. For each fly, two trials of the entire set of stimuli were averaged.</p>

<title>Data analysis and Statistics</title>
<p>No power analysis was performed prior to statistical analysis. Volume analysis in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> was performed by a researcher blinded to the genotypes. All data from confocal microscopy experiments were tested for normality using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or Anderson-Darling test and the appropriate parametric or non-parametric test was performed, as stated in the figure captions.</p>
<p>For boxplots, the dividing line in the box indicates the median, the boxes contain the interquartile range, and the whiskers indicate the extent of data points within an additional 1.5 × interquartile range.</p>
<p>For <italic>in-vivo</italic> electrophysiology analyses in adult recordings, all analyses were performed using custom MATLAB scripts. Recordings for each stimulus presentation were baseline subtracted by taking the average response one second prior to the stimulus onset. The magnitude of the GF expansion peak was measured after filtering each recording (Savitzky–Golay, fourth order polynomial, frame size is 1/10th the length of the stimulus). The normality of the data was assessed using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If the data were found to not follow a normal distribution, the appropriate non-parametric test was selected. For non-parametric analyses, a Kruskal-Wallis test was performed, and Tukey-Kramer post hoc test was performed for significant groups.</p>
<p>For <italic>ex-plant</italic> pupal recordings, all analyses were performed using in-house MATLAB scripts. Potential 60Hz noise was filtered out using a band-stop filter, and thirty minutes of data were quantified. The baseline was determined after two rounds of computing the average signal envelope. Peaks were identified by capturing all depolarizations that were 3mV above baseline and separated by at least 100ms. Time intervals between events were transformed into instantaneous frequency for histogram plots.</p>

<p>This study establishes a two distinct feature-encoding visual projection neurons in Drosophila as a model for the development of synaptic specificity. The comprehensive description of connectivity development in this system is <bold>valuable</bold> to a more general understanding of principles that underlie neural circuit development. The high-quality supporting evidence is <bold>convincing</bold>.</p>

<p>This is a strong paper that sets the foundation for future work that will explore the innervation of the giant fiber, allowing experiments that will link molecular/developmental mechanisms to circuit function at a level of resolution that has not previously been possible. In the course of this work the investigators discover an axon-axon competition that reflects the order of innervation of the target. In addition, a host of reagents are developed that will be of wide use in dissecting this system.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The developmental, functional and connectomic characterization of the wiring pattern to be dissected is impressively thorough and quantitative.</p>
<p>
(2) The reagents that the authors establish will be foundational to subsequent effort.</p>
<p>
(3) The discovery that axon-axon competition is involved in patterning this system, and might combined with innervation order to give a deterministic outcome is an interesting one (and might be useful to address variation in cell number (see below)!</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) In my opinion, the authors miss an opportunity to leverage their connectomics characterization somewhat more. That is, from characterization of the connectomes of two flies, the authors describe substantial variation in the number of pre-synaptic cells providing inputs (for example, in FAFB, there are 55 LC4 cells, while in the hemibrain, there are 71 - almost 30 percent more), yet the number of total synapses provided by each class of cell types is remarkably stereotyped 2442 synapses versus 2290 synapses). And the ratio of LC4 to LPLC2 synapses is even more stereotyped... As this kind of stereotypy would be consistent with the authors competition model, but inconsistent with a model in which each cell makes a similar number of synapses (which would be the model from the periphery of the visual system), the authors should comment a bit more on what they see. Perhaps the wiring model the authors advocate for compensates for what appears to be quite significant variation in the numbers of LC neurons?</p>
<p>(2) I appreciate how the authors pivoted to interpreting their results using Kir2.1 to reflect the effects of cell ablation. However, I worry that since the mechanism behind Kir2.1 mediated ablation is unknown, there could be other effects associated with this perturbation, creating indirect effects that alter LPLC2 cells somehow. I would therefore ask that the authors repeat these experiments with a more standard cell ablation strategy (such as a light gated caspase, or ricin). More crucially, the author's model that arrival order is functionally important would be greatly strengthened if they did the reciprocal ablation of LPLC2 and asked what happens to LC4. One could easily imagine a model in which these two cell types mutually compete for real estate, after an initial bias is set by arrival order.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigate axonal and synapse development in two distinct visual feature-encoding neurons (VPN), LC4 and LPLC2. They first show that they occupy distinct regions on the GF dendrites, and likely arrive sequentially. Analysis of the VPNs' morphology throughout development, and synaptic gene and protein expression data reveals the temporal order of maturation. Functional analysis then shows that LPLC2 occupancy of the GF dendrites is constrained by LC4 presence.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors investigate an interesting and very timely topic, which will help to understand how neurons coordinate their development. The manuscript is very well written, and data are of high quality, that generally support the conclusions drawn (but see some comments for Fig. 2 below). A thorough descriptive analysis of the LC4/LPLC2 to GF connectivity is followed by some functional assessment showing that one neuron's occupancy of the GF dendrite depend on another.</p>
<p>
The manuscripts uses versatile methods to look at membrane contact, gene and protein expression (using scRNAseq data and state-of-the art genetic tools) and functional neuronal properties. I find it especially interesting and elegant how the authors combine their findings to highlight the temporal trajectory of development in this system.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>After reading the summary, I was expecting a more comprehensive analysis of many VPNs, and their developmental relationships. For a better reflection of the data, the summary could state that the authors investigate *two* visual projection neurons (VPNs) and that ablation *of one cell type of VPNs* results in the expansion of the remaining VPN territory.</p>
<p>The manuscript is falling a bit short of putting the results into the context of what is known about synaptic partner choice/competition between different neurons during neuronal or even visual system development. Lots of work has been done in the peripheral the visual system, from the Hiesinger lab and others. Both the introduction and the discussion section should elaborate on this.</p>
<p>The one thing that the manuscript does not unambiguously show is when the connections between LC4 and LPLC2 become functional.</p>
<p>Figure 2:</p>
<p>
Figure 2A-C: I found the text related to that figure hard to follow, especially when talking about filopodia. Overall, life imaging would probably clarify at which time point there really are dynamic filopodia. For this study, high magnification images of what the authors define as filopodia would certainly help.</p>
<p>
L137ff: This section talks about filopodia between 24-48 hAPF, but only 36h APF is shown in A, where one could see filopodia. The other time points are shown in B and C, but number of filopodia is not quantified.</p>
<p>
L143: &quot;filopodia were still present, but visibly shorter&quot;: This is hard to see, and again, not quantified.</p>
<p>
L144f: &quot;from 72h APF to eclosion, the volume of GF dendrites significantly decreased&quot;: this is not actually quantified, comparisons are only done to 24, 36 and 48 h APF.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, 72h APF is not shown here, but in Figure 2D, so either show here, or call this figure panel already?</p>
<p>Figure 2D/E: to strengthen the point that LC4 and LPLC2 arrive sequentially, it would help to show all time points analyzed in Figure D/E.</p>
<p>L208: &quot;significant increase ... from 60h APF to 72h APF&quot;: according to the figure caption, this comparison is marked by &quot;+&quot; but there is no + in the figure itself.</p>
<p>Figure 3:</p>
<p>
A key point of the manuscript is the sequential arrival of different VPN classes. So then why is the scRNAseq analysis in Figure 3 shown pooled across VPNs? Certainly, the reader at this point is interested in temporal differences in gene expression. The class-specific data are somewhat hidden in Supp. Fig. 9, and actually do not show temporal differences. This finding should be presented in the main data.</p>
<p>L438: &quot;silencing LC4 by expressing Kir2.1... reduced the GF response&quot;: Is this claim backed by some quantification?</p>
<p>Figure 4K: Do the control data have error bars, which are just too small to see? And what is tested against what? Is blue vs. black quantified as well? What do red, blue, and black asterisks indicate? Please clarify in figure caption.</p>
<p>Optogenetics is mentioned in methods (in &quot;fly rearing&quot;, in the genotypes, and there is an extra &quot;Optogenetics&quot; section in methods), but no such data are shown in the manuscripts. (If the authors have those data, it would be great to know when the VPN&gt;GF connections become functional!)</p>
<p>Methods:</p>
<p>Antibody concentrations are not given anywhere and will be useful information for the reader</p>
<p>Could the authors please give more details on the re-analysis of the scRNAseq dataset? How did you identify cell type clusters in there, for example?</p>
<p>L785 and L794: I am curious. Why is it informative to mention what was *not* done?</p>
<p>Custom-written analysis code is mentioned in a few places. Is this code publicly available?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, MacFarland et.al. show that difference in the time of contact between axons of LC4 and LPLC2 visual projection neurons (VPNs) in the optic glomeruli and dendrites of large descending neuron, the giant fiber (GF) shapes the differential connectivity between these neurons.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors analyzed the development of a well-known circuit between GF dendrites and LC4 andLPLC2 axons using different approaches. Additionally, they developed an ex-vivo patch clamping technique to show, together with correlative RNA-sequencing data, that contact site restriction is not dependent on neuronal activity. Based on this study, the connectivity pattern between GF and the adjacent different sets of VPNs now provides a very interesting model to investigate developmental programs that lead to synaptic specificity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Following are the concerns that significantly impact the veracity of conclusions drawn based on the data provided.</p>
<p>(1) All the data related to the activity of VPNs and GF and how this activity is related to the connectivity and/or maintaining and stabilizing this connectivity is correlative. The expression profiles of synaptic molecules (only at RNA level) over time or the appearance of pre and post synaptic proteins or the spontaneous spike patterns in GF do not show the role of activity in synapse specificity program. Synaptic molecules have been previously shown to be present at presynaptic sites without being involved in activity (Chen et al., 2014, Jin et al., 2018). To show whether activity is indeed not required for connectivity for either of the cell types (LC4 and LPLC2), they should silence each and also both cell types as early as possible (with the LC4 driver that does not ablate them) and then quantify the contacts with GF. In the same vein, the authors should knock down components of the synaptic machinery as early as possible to show directly the effect on 1) contact formation and 2) contact stabilization. For example, authors state in the lines 267-269 &quot;VPN cholinergic machinery arrives too late to contribute to the initial targeting and localization of VPN axons on GF dendrites. Cholinergic activity instead is likely to participate in VPN and GF synapse refinement and stabilization.&quot; This statement would only be valid if the authors knock down the cholinergic machinery and find the contact numbers unchanged in the early stages but significantly different in later stages in comparison to the controls. Furthermore, authors only show increase in the VAChT and ChAT in the presynaptic cells but do not show if the cholinergic receptor AChRs are even expressed in GF cells or at what point they are expressed. Without these receptor expression, cholinergic system might not even be involved in the process. Also, there might be other neurotransmitter systems involved. Authors should at least check if other neurotransmitter systems are expressed in these cells, both pre-and post-synaptic.</p>
<p>
Line 371-374: &quot;In the later stages of development, the frequency of synaptic events increase as gap junction proteins are downregulated and cholinergic presynaptic machinery is upregulated to enhance and stabilize synapses with intended synaptic partners while refining unintended contacts&quot;. The authors did not show the activity they observed in GF is due to the contacts they make with LC4s and LPLC2s. The functionality of these contacts can be shown by silencing the LC4s and LPLC2s and then doing the patch clamping in GF to see a decrease in the activity. Further, the authors did not show that the reduction in contacts are only by refining &quot;unintended&quot; contacts. There is no evidence that can support this statement.</p>
<p>(2) In the LC4 ablation experiments, authors claim that LC4_4 split Gal4 line is expressed around 18APF, prior to GF LC4 initial contact (Line 387). However, authors do not show the time point of first contact between GF dendrites and LC4 cells. In Fig. 2 the first time point shown is at P36, where there is already significant overlap between GF dendrites and LC4 axons. Authors should show the very first time point where they see any, even if minimal, overlap and/or contact between GFs and LC4s. Once the LC4s are ablated, is the increase in the colocalization between GF and LPLC2 due to LPLC2s increasing their contact numbers or due to them not decreasing the maximum contact numbers that the authors observed at P72 (Fig 2G)? In other words, once the LC4s are ablated, what would the new graph for temporal contact numbers for LPLC2 look like and how it would compare to Fig2G?</p>
<p>(3) If the developmental stages for different lines match, that would be more helpful for comparison. Also, as the authors analyzed expression every 12 hours from 0APF, the panel should also contain earlier time points (e.g. P0, P12) for all lines. This is critical to understand at what point the axons of LC4, LPLC2 and LPLC1 reach their position. From the scale bar in Supp Fig.4, it seems LC4 axons have already reached final position at P24 and there is no extension between P24 and P60. Do the authors know at what point LC4 axons start extending and reach the final position? If the LC4 and LPLC2 arbors are already separated medio-laterally even before GF dendrites extend towards them, it would explain why GF dendrites extending from medial region of the brain would encounter LC4 axons first and LPLC2 axons later, just based on their localization in space.</p>
<p>
Further to this point, the authors show in the section two of the paper that it is the GF dendrites that extend, elaborate and refine during the phase the authors analyzed and the authors do not show any morphological change in the axons of the VPNs. Therefore, the title of the paper is 'axon arrival times and physical occupancy establish visual projection neuron integration on developing dendrites in the Drosophila optic glomeruli' is slightly misguided.</p>
<p>(4) In the absence of LC4s, does the LPLC1 and GF colocalization increase or do they still stay disconnected?</p>
<p>(5) Does the absence of LC4s have any effect on GF arbor complexity? Does the graph in Fig 2B and C change? Can the increase in colocalization between LPLC2 and GF be at least partially due to the expansion of GF dendritic volume?</p>
<p>(6) Why is there a segregation in the medial-lateral axis but not in the dorso-ventral axis? Wouldn't the same segregation mechanism be in play in both axes? Also, the authors should clarify if this reduction in dorsal-ventral distribution is because dorso-ventral expansion of GF dendrites beyond the LC4 and LPLC2 axons? Theoretically that would seem to make the LC4s move more ventrally and LPLC2 move more dorsally in comparison to the total arbor.</p>
<p>(7) Why the LPLC2 medial connections are regarded as &quot;mistargeting&quot; in the heading of Supplemental Figure 1? Both in EM data and in some of the confocal datasets, these connections are observed. What is the criteria to label a connection &quot;mistargeting&quot; if it is observed, albeit occasionally, both in EM and confocal datasets?</p>
<p>(8) In Line 126-127, authors state that &quot;we sought to determine how the precise VPN localization along GF dendrites arises across development&quot;. However, based in EM and microscopic data, there is considerable variability in the contact numbers and distribution. With such variability present, how can the localization be termed &quot;precise&quot;? Authors should clarify.</p>

<p>We thank the editors for their assessment of our manuscript. We appreciate the reviewers’ thoughtful comments and plan to incorporate their feedback into a revised manuscript. We agree that incorporating an additional, more common ablation tool would be highly complementary to our Kir2.1 ablation studies. We also agree that images across timepoints should be expanded for contact analyses, connectomics data can be better leveraged, additional quantifications can be performed as suggested by the reviewers to better support claims, and that the introduction and discussion can be revised to better position our work in the context of previous studies.  We also strongly agree that providing data on receptor RNA and protein expression in the GF across timepoints would be extremely informative, however we have found acquiring these data, at the necessary resolution, would require new approaches and tools that may be outside the scope of the project.</p>
