<title>Summary</title><p>Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) are key for regulating protein function and turnover via ubiquitination but it remains undetermined which E2s maintain proteostasis during aging. Here, we find that E2s have diverse roles in handling a model aggregation-prone protein (huntingtin-polyQ) in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> retina: while some E2s mediate aggregate assembly, UBE2D/effete (eff) and other E2s are required for huntingtin-polyQ degradation. UBE2D/eff is key for proteostasis also in skeletal muscle: eff protein levels decline with aging, and muscle-specific eff knockdown causes an accelerated buildup in insoluble poly-ubiquitinated proteins (which progressively accumulate with aging) and shortens lifespan. Transgenic expression of human UBE2D2, homologous to eff, partially rescues the lifespan and proteostasis deficits caused by muscle-specific eff<sup>RNAi</sup> by re-establishing the physiological levels of eff<sup>RNAi</sup>-regulated proteins. Interestingly, UBE2D/eff knockdown in young age reproduces many of the proteomic changes that normally occur in old muscles, suggesting that the decrease in UBE2D/eff protein levels that occurs with aging contributes to reshaping the composition of the muscle proteome. Altogether, these findings indicate that UBE2D/eff is a key E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme for maintaining a youthful proteome and for ensuring protein quality control during aging.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protein degradation regulates many cellular functions, and its derangement is the underlying cause of many human diseases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></italic>). Most proteins are regulated via degradation to ensure dynamic adjustments in their concentrations in response to cellular challenges and to maintain physiologic homeostasis. Moreover, damaged and misfolded proteins are degraded to avoid toxicity caused by their interaction with native proteins (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></italic>). Because of these important functions, protein degradation is tightly controlled. In most cell types, the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for most of the protein degradation in the nucleus and cytoplasm whereas the autophagy/lysosome system degrades cellular organelles, protein aggregates, and long- lived proteins (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></italic>). In addition, several proteases and peptidases cooperate with the proteasome and autophagy in degrading target proteins (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>To route proteins for degradation, the UPS relies on ubiquitination, a post-translational modification that also regulates protein function and localization (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></italic>). Through the concerted actions of a single ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ∼35 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), and ∼620 E3 ubiquitin ligases, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) orchestrates the specific poly-ubiquitination of protein substrates in humans, which can lead to their degradation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></italic>). Depending on the ubiquitin lysine residue employed to build poly-ubiquitin chains, poly-ubiquitinated proteins can be preferentially degraded by the proteasome or by the autophagy-lysosome system (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></italic>). E2s have a pivotal role in the ubiquitination cascade and direct the recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligases and target proteins (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>In addition to regulating normal protein turnover, E2s can also ensure proteostasis. For example, the E2 enzyme UBE2B and its associated E3 ligase UBR4 have been found to regulate muscle protein quality during aging in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></italic>). The capacity of E2s to maintain proteostasis may derive from their capacity to guide the ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></italic>) and to trigger autophagy (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). Moreover, because some E2s are physically associated with the proteasome, it has been proposed that they may directly regulate its proteolytic activity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></italic>). For example, the E2 enzymes Ubc1/2/4/5 interact with the proteasome and this association further increases with heat stress in yeast (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></italic>), a condition where proteasome function is modulated by ubiquitination of proteasome components, such as Rpn13, mediated by the proteasome-associated E3 UBE3C (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></italic>). While E2s may regulate proteostasis via several mechanisms, it remains largely undetermined which E2s are crucial for maintaining protein quality control during aging.</p>
<p>Here, we have utilized a model aggregation-prone protein (GFP-tagged pathogenic huntingtin, Htt-polyQ- GFP) expressed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> retina to test the impact of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes on proteostasis. In addition, we have similarly tested a set of E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). These analyses revealed diverse functions of E2s and associated enzymes in proteostasis. Contrary to the expectation that E2s may generally promote the proteasomal degradation of Htt-polyQ and hence reduce Htt-polyQ levels, we find that the knockdown of several E2s has the opposite effect, i.e. it decreases Htt-polyQ aggregates.</p>
<p>Knockdown of the E2 enzyme effete (eff), homologous to human UBE2D1/2/3/4 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, is one of the relatively few RNAi interventions that increase the amount of Htt-polyQ aggregates, and we find that this is due to an impediment in Htt-polyQ protein degradation. Consistent with a prevalent role of UBE2D/eff in proteostasis across aging tissues in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we find that UBE2D/eff protein levels significantly decline during aging in skeletal muscle, and that muscle-specific eff knockdown increases the age-associated accumulation of insoluble poly-ubiquitinated proteins and reduces lifespan. Interestingly, the proteostasis deficits caused by UBE2D/eff knockdown are partially rescued by transgenic expression of one of its human homologs, UBE2D2, suggesting that UBE2D ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes have evolutionary conserved roles in maintaining protein quality control during aging. Altogether, our study identifies diverse roles for E2 ubiquitin- conjugating enzymes in handling aggregation-prone proteins and managing proteostasis, and that UBE2D/eff is key for ensuring protein quality control during aging.</p>

<title>Diverse roles of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in the disposal of pathogenic huntingtin</title>
<p>Huntington disease (HD) is caused by pathogenic huntingtin with polyQ tract expansion (Htt-polyQ), a toxic, aggregation- prone protein that induces neurodegeneration (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></italic>). Previous studies have shown that ubiquitination is a conserved regulator of polyglutamine aggregation and that E2 loss can both increase and decrease the size and number of Htt-polyQ aggregates (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></italic>). However, as for other analyses of E2 function, a complete understanding of the role of E2s in polyglutamine aggregation is missing.</p>
<p>The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is an ideal model for studying the mechanisms of Htt-polyQ protein degradation. GFP-tagged Htt-polyQ72 can be expressed in the fly retina (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></italic>) and fluorescent Htt-polyQ-GFP aggregates can be visualized from intact animals over time (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></italic>). In particular, the fly retina is a convenient tissue to examine Htt-polyQ because this tissue is dispensable for fly survival. With this model, it was previously found that there is an age-dependent increase in the amount of Htt-polyQ72 protein aggregates, which reflects the overall age dependency of HD phenotypes also observed in humans (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>To test whether E2s regulate Htt-polyQ-GFP aggregation during aging, multiple RNAi lines were utilized to target each of the 21 <italic>Drosophila</italic> E2s. For these studies, transgenic RNAi was driven in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> retina with the UAS/Gal4 system and GMR-Gal4, concomitantly with Htt-polyQ-GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). After 30 days at 29°C, the total area of Htt-Q72-GFP fluorescent aggregates was scored with CellProfiler and compared to control RNAi interventions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-C</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). Overall, there was a trend towards decreased aggregate area upon knockdown of several E2s, including the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologs of UBE2F/M, UBE2I, UBE2QL1, and UBE2Z, suggesting that these E2s may be required for ubiquitination-dependent aggregation of Htt-polyQ-GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). Analyses of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and E3 ubiquitin ligases identified from mapping the E2 interactome in human cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></italic>) indicate that RNAi for these interactors yields overall similar phenotypes as those found by knocking down the interacting E2s (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-C</xref>). For example, RNAi for E3s and DUBs that interact with Ubc10 (UBE2L3) and CG7656 (UBE2R1/2) reduce the area of Htt-polyQ-GFP aggregates, as found for knockdown of these E2s (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The decreased polyglutamine aggregation that is observed upon E2 RNAi may indicate that E2-mediated ubiquitination is required for Htt aggregate formation. Consistent with this model, it was previously reported that K48 linkage-specific ubiquitination drives Htt degradation by the proteasome whereas K63 ubiquitination promotes Htt aggregation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>). Our comprehensive analysis now highlights the differential effects of distinct E2s on Htt disposal and suggests that this may occur because of the specificity in the E3s and DUBs interacting with each E2.</p>

Specifically, RNAi for Ubc6 (homologous of UBE2A/B) and for its associated E3 ubiquitin ligases Ubr4 and Kcmf1 increases the amount of Htt-polyQ72-GFP protein aggregates. Similar increases are also seen with knockdown of eff/UBE2D and the associated E3 HUWE1, and with RNAi for Ubc10/UBE2L3, Ubc84D/UBE2L6, and for the associated E3 enzyme BTBD8. Positive controls include Akt RNAi, which reduces protein aggregates, and Hsp83 RNAi, which increases them.

<title>UBE2D/eff knockdown increases aggregates of pathogenic huntingtin in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> retina</title>
<p>In addition to RNAi lines that decrease the amount of Htt aggregates, we found that RNAi-mediated knockdown of other E2s causes an increase in Htt aggregates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-C</xref>). Specifically, RNAi for Ubc6 (UBE2A/B), eff (UBE2D), Ubc10 (UBE2L3), and Ubc84D (UBE2L6) increased the total area of protein aggregates. Likewise, RNAi for E3/DUBs that physically associate with these E2s (such as Ubr4 and Kcfm1, associated with UBE2A/B; and HUWE1, associated with UBE2D) led to higher levels of polyglutamine aggregates. A possible interpretation of these results is that these E2s are necessary for the degradation of aggregation-prone Htt and, consequently, their loss leads to the accumulation of detergent-insoluble polyglutamine aggregates. To test this hypothesis, we further characterized the molecular mechanisms by which eff/UBE2D regulates Htt proteostasis. We first measured by qRT-PCR the levels of Htt-polyQ-GFP and found that there are no changes in its expression upon eff RNAi compared to controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), indicating that increased levels of Htt-polyQ-GFP aggregates observed upon eff RNAi do not arise from increased transgenic expression of Htt-polyQ-GFP. Next, we utilized western blot to analyze the levels of Htt-polyQ-GFP monomers (∼50 kDa) and high-molecular-weight (HMW) Htt-polyQ- GFP aggregates that accumulate in the stacking gel (&gt;250 kDa). Remarkably, 2 different RNAi lines targeting eff/UBE2D increase HMW Htt-polyQ-GFP levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), suggesting that eff/UBE2D-mediated ubiquitination may be required for Htt degradation. In summary, these findings indicate an extensive role of E2 ubiquitin- conjugating enzymes in modulating Htt-Q72-GFP aggregation during aging in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> retina.</p>

<title>Htt-induced retinal degeneration exacerbated by UBE2D/eff knockdown is rescued by human UBE2D2/4</title>
<p>Htt-polyQ causes retinal degeneration, which is characterized by loss of pigmentation and a “rough eye” phenotype, indicative of photoreceptor death and derangement of inter-ommatidial bristles (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></italic>). Compared to control RNAi, Htt-induced retinal degeneration is exacerbated by RNAi for Ubc6 and for eff, as indicated by the increase in the eye area occupied by necrotic patches or with loss of pigmentation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). On this basis, we next examined whether concomitant transgenic expression of the human homologs of these <italic>Drosophila</italic> E2s would rescue retinal degeneration. On this basis, we expressed human UBE2B (homologous to Ubc6, DIOPT homology score=13) and human UBE2D2 and UBE2D4 (homologous to eff, DIOPT scores of 13 and 10, respectively) and compared their capacity to rescue retinal degeneration compared to mock mcherry overexpression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). As expected based on the sequence homology, hUBE2B (but not mcherry, hUBE2D2, and hUBE2D4) rescued retinal degeneration (i.e. necrotic patches and depigmentation) induced by Ubc6 RNAi. Similarly, hUBE2D2 and to a lower extent hUBE2D4 rescued depigmentation caused by eff knockdown. Altogether, these findings indicate that Ubc6 and eff loss can be rescued by transgenic expression of their respective human homologs UBE2B and UBE2D2/4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>On this basis, we next examined whether hUBE2D can rescue the defects in Htt-polyQ proteostasis caused by eff RNAi. Specifically, we compared eff RNAi versus control RNAi, with the concomitant expression of either mcherry or hUBE2D2. Image analysis of Htt-poly-GFP aggregates indicates that hUBE2D2 impedes the accumulation of Htt-polyQ-GFP aggregates which are otherwise increased by eff RNAi (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Similar results were also obtained by western blot: there was lower accumulation of HMW Htt-polyQ-GFP in eff<sup>RNAi</sup>+hUBE2D2 versus eff<sup>RNAi</sup>+mcherry and the other controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).

<title>UBE2D/eff protein levels decline with aging, and UBE2D/eff knockdown impairs skeletal muscle proteostasis as observed during aging</title>
<p>The comprehensive analysis reported above has revealed a range of diverse roles for E2s in modulating polyglutamine aggregates in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. UBE2D/eff appears to be one of the E2s with the most striking effects in preserving proteostasis, i.e. it is required for preventing the accumulation of HMW Htt-polyQ-GP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). On this basis, we further probed the role of UBE2D/eff in protein quality control. To this purpose, we examined skeletal muscle aging, which is characterized by a progressive decline in proteostasis and by the age-related accumulation of detergent-insoluble poly-ubiquitin protein aggregates (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></italic>).</p>

<p>To test this hypothesis, we reduced UBE2D/eff levels from young age by driving UBE2D/eff RNAi with MhcF3-Gal4 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></italic>) in skeletal muscle, and compared this intervention to a control mcherry RNAi. Immunostaining and confocal microscopy of skeletal muscle of flies at 3 weeks of age indicate that UBE2D/eff RNAi significantly increases the size of poly-ubiquitin protein aggregates and that there is an overall trend towards a higher total area of aggregates, compared to control RNAi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-D</xref>).

<p>Curated analyses revealed that, as expected, eff protein levels declined in response to eff RNAi compared to control RNAi (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). The levels of several other proteins were increased upon eff RNAi but reduced by concomitant rescue with hUBE2D2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). These proteins include Arc1 and Arc2 (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein 1 and 2), which regulate starvation-induced locomotion, the neuromuscular junction, and metabolism (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></italic>); the glycine N-methyltransferase Gnmt enzyme, which generates sarcosine and controls the amount of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></italic>); and CG4594, which encodes for an enzyme involved in fatty acid beta oxidation. In addition to rescuing protein changes induced by eff RNAi, overexpression of hUBE2D2 by itself reduced the levels of Arc1, Arc2, Gnmt, and CG4594. Altogether, these proteomics analyses identify protein targets that are modulated by eff/UBE2D in skeletal muscle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Improper eff/UBE2D-mediated turnover of these proteins and their consequent accumulation may contribute to derange muscle protein quality control and in turn to reduced survival. In agreement with this hypothesis, it was previously found that elevation of Arc1 protein levels in Alzheimer’s disease models causes cytotoxicity and contributes to neuronal death in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Conversely, there were other proteins that were induced in muscles with eff/UBE2D knockdown and that may represent a protective response that mitigates the derangement of proteostasis due to eff/UBE2D knockdown. These included Pomp, involved in proteasome assembly (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></italic>), the chaperones Hsp22, Hsp23, and Hsp26, and the ubiquitin-like protein UBL3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, these studies indicate that eff/UBE2D knockdown induces several proteomics changes, some of which are rescued by hUBE2D2. While some of these changes may be cytotoxic (e.g. increased Arc1 levels, (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></italic>)), others may conversely limit the derangement of protein quality control and/or improve survival.</p>

<p>We have found that UBE2D/eff protein levels decline during aging in skeletal muscle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B</xref>) and that the experimental induction of UBE2D/eff knockdown in young age induces a premature decline in proteostasis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), which otherwise is normally lost only in old age (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></italic>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have examined the role of the 21 <italic>Drosophila</italic> E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in modulating aggregates of polyglutamine proteins. By analyzing pathogenic huntingtin in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> retina, we found that E2s have diverse functions in modulating Htt-polyQ-GFP. Specifically, the knockdown of many E2s reduces polyglutamine protein aggregates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), suggesting that ubiquitination by these E2s promotes sequestration of pathogenic huntingtin into aggresomes, as found in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></italic>). Aggregation of Htt has been previously found to decrease its toxicity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></italic>), and therefore E2s that drive Htt aggregation may protect from polyglutamine disease via this mechanism. However, there were also RNAi interventions for other E2s, such as eff/UBE2D, and associated enzymes (DUBs and E3s) that increased the levels of high-molecular-weight assemblies of Htt-polyQ-GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), suggesting that these E2s and interacting partners are necessary for Htt-polyQ-GFP degradation. Likewise, eff/UBE2D knockdown compromises protein quality control also in <italic>Drosophila</italic> skeletal muscle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), as indicated by the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, and this is in part re-established via overexpression of one of its human homologs, UBE2D2.</p>
<p>Previously, UBE2D ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (UBE2D1/2/3/4) were found to contribute to several cellular processes that impact proteostasis. These include the association of UBE2Ds with the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP to promote the degradation of misfolded proteins (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></italic>). Likewise, UBE2Ds were found to confer resistance to elevated temperatures in yeast by promoting the selective ubiquitination and degradation of misfolded proteins (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></italic>). Moreover, UBE2Ds can interact with the E3 ligase parkin to promote mitophagy (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></italic>) and with the E3 ligase RNF138 to mediate DNA repair (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></italic>). In addition to these cellular functions, UBE2D also plays a key role in protein import into peroxisomes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>We have found that eff/UBE2D knockdown leads to the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins and that eff/UBE2D is a key E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme for maintaining protein quality control during aging. Because eff/UBE2D knockdown reduces eff/UBE2D-mediated ubiquitination, the poly-ubiquitinated proteins that accumulate upon eff/UBE2D RNAi likely consist of proteins different from eff/UBE2D ubiquitination substrates. How eff/UBE2D knockdown deranges proteostasis and promotes the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins may occur via multiple mechanisms. One possibility is that proteostasis is deranged by eff/UBE2D knockdown because of the previously-reported roles of eff/UBE2D in mitophagy (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></italic>) and in the removal of misfolded proteins (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></italic>) in concert with E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></italic>). Accumulation of such faulty proteins may clog or burden the proteasome and hence generally impair the degradation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins.</p>
<p>In an alternative model, proteostasis and survival are reduced by eff/UBE2D knockdown because of the accumulation of specific UBE2D protein targets that directly perturb these processes. While many substrates of eff/UBE2D ubiquitination accumulate and may play such role, Arc1 and the related Arc2 protein are of particular interest. Specifically, Arc1 and Arc2 protein levels increase upon UBE2D/eff knockdown and, conversely, they are reduced by hUBE2D2. Interestingly, Arc1 upregulation was found to be cytotoxic and to drive neurodegeneration in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> Alzheimer’s disease model (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></italic>). This suggests that the accumulation of Arc1/2 in response to eff/UBE2D knockdown may derange proteostasis and reduce survival. Arc1 and Arc2 protein levels increase also in response to aging in skeletal muscle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). More globally, eff RNAi induces many proteomic changes reminiscent of aging: ∼70% of the proteins that are significantly modulated by eff RNAi in young age are also consistently regulated by aging (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). These findings, therefore, indicate that UBE2D/eff maintains a youthful proteome and that the age-dependent decline in UBE2D/eff protein levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) may contribute to the proteomic changes that occur with aging.</p>
<p>In addition to reshaping the composition of the muscle proteome and impairing proteostasis, we have found that muscle-specific eff/UBE2D knockdown reduces organismal survival: while muscle-specific eff/UBE2D RNAi reduces lifespan, this is partially rescued by concomitant expression of an RNAi-resistant human UBE2D2 transgene which re-establishes the physiological levels of eff/UBE2D-regulated targets such as Arc1/2. These findings, therefore, reinforce the notion that skeletal muscle is a key tissue that influences systemic aging, and that preserving muscle protein quality control is necessary for optimal organismal survival (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>In summary, our study highlights the important role of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme eff/UBE2D in maintaining protein quality control during aging, suggesting that interventions that promote UBE2D function may contrast age-related diseases that arise from the loss of proteostasis.</p>

<title>Analysis of pathogenic Huntingtin aggregation</title>
<p>Pathogenic huntingtin-polyQ72-GFP protein aggregates (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></italic>) were imaged with an epifluorescence ZEISS SteREO Discovery V12 microscope with consistent exposure time and settings. The acquired grayscale images were then analyzed in an automated manner by using Cell Profiler 3.0.0 (cellprofiler.org) to determine the number and/or total area of protein aggregates (Huntingtin-polyQ72-GFP speckles) normalized by the retinal tissue area. This analysis was done with male flies after aging at 25°C for 30 days; the same conditions were applied to all the samples and the respective controls in any given experiment. The raw values for each set of flies were normalized by the corresponding raw values of the negative control RNAi intervention from the same fly stock collection.</p>

<title>Protein sample preparation, protein digestion, and peptide isobaric labeling by tandem mass tags</title>
<p>For each TMT <italic>Drosophila</italic> sample, 50 thoraces (consisting primarily of skeletal muscle) from 1-week-old and 8- weeks-old male <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> flies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and from 2-weeks-old male flies of the genotypes indicated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) were collected and homogenized in 8M urea lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.5, 8 M urea). After homogenization with zirconium beads in a NextAdvance bullet blender, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate was added to the tissue homogenates, which were then pelleted to remove fly debris. The resulting supernatant was submitted for TMT mass spectrometry and digested with LysC (Wako) at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w) for 2 hours in the presence of 1 mM DTT. Following this, the samples were diluted to a final 2 M Urea concentration with 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.5), and further digested with trypsin (Promega) at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w) for at least 3 hours. The peptides were reduced by adding 1 mM DTT for 30 min at room temperature (RT) followed by alkylation with 10 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 30 minutes in the dark at RT. The unreacted IAA was quenched with 30 mM DTT for 30 minutes. Finally, the digestion was terminated and acidified by adding trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to 1%, desalted using C18 cartridges (Harvard Apparatus), and dried by speed vac. The purified peptides were resuspended in 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.5) and labeled with 16-plex Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) reagents (ThermoScientific) following the manufacturer’s recommendations and our optimized protocol (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></italic>).</p>

TMT tags on Lys and N-termini (+304.20715 Da) were used for static modifications and Met oxidation (+15.99492 Da) was considered as a dynamic modification. Matched MS/MS spectra were filtered by mass accuracy and matching scores to reduce protein false discovery rate to ∼1%. Proteins were quantified by summing reporter ion intensities across all matched PSMs using the JUMP software suite (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></italic>).

<p>This study presents <bold>valuable</bold> findings on the role of the Drosophila ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2D/eff in maintaining proteostasis during aging. Protein levels of UBE2D decrease with age, and knockdown of UBED2 leads to an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, and a shortened lifespan that can be rescued by ectopic expression of the human homologous gene. The work supports a role of this ubiquitin conjugating enzyme in proteostasis, although the evidence is still <bold>incomplete</bold>. The study will be of broad interest to cell biologists working in aging and age-related diseases.</p>

<p>In this study, Hunt et al investigated the role of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2D/effete (eff) in maintaining proteostasis during aging. Utilizing Drosophila as a model, the researchers observed diverse roles of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in handling the aggregation-prone protein huntingtin-polyQ in the retina. While some E2s facilitated aggregate assembly, UBE2D/eff and other E2s were crucial for degradation of htt-polyQ. The study also highlights the significance of UBE2D/eff in skeletal muscle, showing that declining levels of eff during aging correlate with proteostasis disruptions. Knockdown of eff in muscle led to accelerated accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, shortened lifespan, and mirrored proteomic changes observed in aged muscles. The introduction of human UBE2D2, analogous to eff, partially rescued the deficits in lifespan and proteostasis caused by eff-RNAi expression in muscles.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, although a more precise mechanistic explanation of phenotypes associated with UBE2D/eff deficiency would have strengthened the study. Additionally, some aspects of image quantification and data analysis need to be clarified and/or extended.</p>

<p>Important findings:</p>
<p>• Knockdown of UBE2D increases HTT aggregation.</p>
<p>• Knockdown of UBE2D leads to an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and reduces the lifespan of Drosophila, which is rescued by an ectopic expression of the human homolog.</p>
<p>• UBE2D protein levels decline with aging.</p>
<p>• UBE2D knockdown is associated with an up- and downregulation of several different cellular pathways, including proteostasis components.</p>
<p>Caveats:</p>
<p>• The readout of HTT aggregation (with methods that are not suitable) as a proxy for the role of UBE2D in proteostasis is not convincing. It would probably improve the manuscript to start with the proteomic analysis of UBE2D to demonstrate that its protein levels decrease with aging. The authors could then induce UBE2D in aged animals to assess the role of UBE2D in the proteome with aging.</p>
<p>• UBE2D knockdown increases the number of HTT foci (Figure 1A), but the quantification is less convincing as depicted in Figure 1B, and other E2 enzymes show a stronger effect (e.g. Ubc6 that is only studied in Figures 1 and 2 without an explanation and Ubc84D). The graph is hard to interpret. What is the sample size and which genetic conditions show a significant change? P values and statistical analyses are missing.</p>
<p>• The quantification of the HTT fluorescence cannot be used as a proxy for HTT aggregation. The authors should assess HTT aggregation by e.g. SDD-AGE, FRAP, filter retardation, etc. The quantification of the higher MW species of HTT in the SDS-PAGE is not ideal either as this simply reflects material that is stuck in the wells that could not enter the gel. Aggregation and hence high MW size could be one reason, but it can also be HTT trapped in cell debris, etc.</p>
<p>• Does UBE2D ubiquitinate HTT? And thus, is HTT accumulation a suitable readout for the functional assessment of the E2 enzyme UBE2D?</p>
<p>• The proteomic analyses could help to identify potential substrates for UBE2D.</p>
<p>• Are there mutants available for UBE2D or conditional mutants? One caveat of RNAi is: first not complete knockdown and second, variable knockdown efficiencies that increase variability.</p>
<p>• The analysis of the E3 enzymes does not add anything to this manuscript.</p>
<p>• Figure 2B: the fluorescence intensities in images 2 and 4 are rather similar, yet the quantification shows significant differences.</p>
<p>• The proteomic analyses could provide insights into the functional spectrum of UBE2D or even the identification of substrates. Yet apart from a DAVID analysis, none of the hits were followed up. In addition, only a few hits were labelled in the volcano plots (Figure 5). On what basis did the authors select those?</p>
<p>• The manuscript remains at this stage rather descriptive.</p>

<p>This is a potentially quite interesting paper that defines E2 and E3 genes in Drosophila that can impact the accumulation of the Q72-GFP protein in the fly eye. The authors then focus on the eff gene, showing which human homolog can rescue fly knockdown. They extend to skeletal muscle, from the htt protein, to show that eff by TMT mass spec decreases with age normally in the fly muscle and that there is a significant overlap of proteins that are disrupted with eff knockdown in young animals in muscle vs aged animals normally in muscle.</p>
<p>Overall these data suggest eff decrease with age may contribute to the increase in ubiquitinated proteins in muscle with age, and that upregulation of eff activity might be of interest to extending lifespan. Because eff function can be performed by a human homologue, the findings may also apply to human situations of aging.</p>
<p>These data are overall interesting and are of relevance for those interested in neurodegenerative disease and aging, although a number of points from the figures seem confusing and need more explanation or clarity.</p>
