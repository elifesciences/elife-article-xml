<title>Abstract</title><p>Retinitis Pigmentosa is a chronic retinal degenerative disease characterized by the gradual loss of rod, and later, cone photoreceptors until the individual is completely blind. Regeneration of photoreceptors from endogenous progenitor cells is a possible therapeutic approach, but mammals do not do this naturally. Mammalian models can be induced to generate retinal progenitors from Müller glial cells, but there has been limited success in rod photoreceptor specific regeneration. Unlike mammals, zebrafish have the natural ability to regenerate neurons after injury or disease and can provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of regeneration. In this study, we used a zebrafish model of Retinitis Pigmentosa to investigate the class of progenitors responsible for rod photoreceptor regeneration in the context of chronic disease. Using bioinformatic analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we identified master regulator genes responsible for proliferation of retinal progenitors, differentiation of progenitors into rod photoreceptors, and maturation of the new rod photoreceptors. Using transient knockdown of gene expression in adult regenerating retina we determined that <italic>e2f1</italic>, <italic>e2f2</italic>, <italic>e2f3</italic> and <italic>aurkb</italic> are critical for proliferation of progenitors, and <italic>prdm1a</italic> is critical for differentiation of progenitors into rod photoreceptors. This study provides a list of master regulators responsible for the specific regeneration of rod photoreceptors during chronic retinal degeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited chronic retinal degenerative disease that affects about 1 in 4,000 people worldwide and results in nearly a billion dollars of added healthcare costs annually to patients in the United States (US) alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). With loss of vision starting in young adults, some patients are completely blind by their late twenties/early thirties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Characterized by the progressive loss of first rod photoreceptors and, later, all photoreceptors, much research has gone into investigating how to reduce progression of the disease as well as how to restore vision. While gene therapy for one variant of RP has been effective, the large number of genes that can cause RP has left many patients with no effective treatment options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). As such, regenerative medicine offers significant hope for preserving and restoring vision to patients with RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>While mammalian models are excellent for studying the progression of retinal degeneration, they have only limited capacity to naturally regenerate neurons through Müller glial cell (MGC) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Zebrafish (Zf), on the other hand, have a retinal circuitry very comparable to mammals as well as the innate ability to regenerate neurons following retinal injury or disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). In acute damage models, MGCs activate, de-differentiate into multipotent progenitor cells that then proliferate, re-differentiate into retinal cells, and integrate into the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). In chronic retinal degeneration models, such as Zf with RP, how rod photoreceptor regeneration occurs still remains largely unexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Currently, it is known that regenerated rod photoreceptors come from progenitor cells that reside in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) rather than directly from MGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). MGCs are predominantly inactive in these models, while the progenitors in the outer nuclear layer proliferate and differentiate into rod photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). However, the transcription factors that regulate proliferation and differentiation of these progenitor cells remain unknown.</p>
<p>Previously, we have generated and characterized a P23H mutant rhodopsin transgenic zebrafish model of RP that shows continuous degeneration of rod photoreceptors and regeneration through progenitor cells found predominantly in the ONL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). We have also previously utilized Single-Cell RNA Sequencing (SC-RNA seq) to identify the molecular basis of retinal remodeling that occurs in our Zf model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). In this study, we identify the master regulators critical for each step of rod photoreceptor regeneration. Through transient knockdowns of these master regulators, we show that <italic>e2f1</italic>, <italic>e2f2</italic>, <italic>e2f3</italic>, and <italic>aurkb</italic> play critical roles in progenitor cell proliferation. We also show that without affecting proliferation, <italic>prdm1a</italic> is important for the differentiation of progenitor cells into rod photoreceptors. We also show that when differentiation into rods is inhibited, these progenitor cells do not differentiate into other cell types. Overall, this study reveals the transcription factors necessary for rod photoreceptor regeneration in a Zf model with chronic retinal degeneration and regeneration.</p>

<title>Rod degeneration and progenitor cell populations in the P23H Zf retina</title>
<p>In previous studies, we have used immunohistochemistry and Single-Cell RNA Sequencing (SC-RNA Seq) analyses on retinas from adult WT and P23H transgenic Zf (expressing Flag-tagged P23H mutant rhodopsin in rods) to characterize how the retinal environment changed during continuous rod photoreceptor degeneration and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). The degeneration of rod photoreceptors in the P23H Zf is characterized by a decrease in the number of rod photoreceptors as compared to WT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, 1C; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>)). Furthermore, the rod photoreceptors that are present have much smaller outer segments as compared to WT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, 1C blue arrows; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>)). It should be noted that the Retp1 antibody against the amino terminus of rat rhodopsin labels both zebrafish rods and the green cone outer segments (orange arrows, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) due to highly similar amino acid sequences of the epitope recognized. SC-RNA Seq analysis reveals that the P23H retina contains a distinct rod population not found in WT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, 1D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>)). This cluster contains genes found unique to both retinal progenitor cell and rod photoreceptor populations (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We believe this cluster to be new rod photoreceptors derived from progenitor cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>Consistent with our previous studies, progenitor cells labeled with Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) antibody were found predominantly in the ONL in our P23H Zf model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>)). SC-RNA Seq analysis revealed 2 progenitor cell clusters in the P23H data that have previously been identified as Neurogenic Progenitor Cells (NPCs) and Retinal Progenitor Cells (RPCs) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>)). We performed HiPlex in-situ hybridizations to visually differentiate the two clusters. <italic>Fam60al</italic> was a gene found to be predominantly unique to and highly expressed in both progenitor cell clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>Aurkb</italic> was found to be predominantly unique to and highly expressed only in the RPC cluster (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). To differentiate between the clusters visually, RPCs were expected to express both <italic>fam60al</italic> and <italic>aurkb</italic>, while NPCs were expected to express only <italic>fam60al</italic>. HiPlex data showed that cells expressing both <italic>fam60al</italic> and a<italic>urkb</italic> were found predominantly in the ONL, while cells expressing only <italic>fam60al</italic> were predominantly located in the inner nuclear layer (INL) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, D, E). Thus, we identified the PCNA-labeled cell population present in the ONL as the RPC population and the NPC population to be an unlabeled cell class located in the INL.</p>

<title>Rapid turnover of progenitor cells and rods in P23H Zf retina</title>
<p>To assess the rate of regeneration and degeneration, we performed a Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse-chase experiment. Both WT and P23H Zf were given intraperitoneal injections of BrdU for 3 consecutive days. Zf were then collected 5 hours after the last injection as well as 7 days after the last injection. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> shows a timeline schematic of the injection and collection timepoints. Wholemounts of retinas were collected and immunostained for rhodopsin (Retp1) and BrdU. WT retinas collected on the last day of injections and imaged at the level of the ONL showed rhodopsin detected in a mosaic pattern (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), consistent with modest intracellular labeling in the cell bodies in the ONL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). BrdU labeling was very sparse and irregularly found (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), amounting to 30.8 ± 9.4 labeled nuclei per 40x image field (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). A 3D projection of the wholemount revealed that BrdU-positive cells were sparsely distributed in both the ONL and INL of the retina (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). WT retinas collected 7 days after the last injection showed the same mosaic labeling of rhodopsin with no significant changes to BrdU labeling throughout the retina (28.2 ± 8.8 nuclei/field; p = 1.0; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, H). P23H Zf retinas collected on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of injections did not have a regular mosaic labeling pattern for rhodopsin because rhodopsin was delocalized over the entire rod photoreceptor and was visible in somata imaged in the ONL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Furthermore, P23H retinas had a significantly higher number of BrdU-positive cells when compared to WT (684.2 ± 27.2 nuclei/field; p &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). A 3D projection of the wholemount revealed that BrdU-positive cells were predominantly found in the ONL, with very few in the INL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), suggesting that the rapidly proliferating cell population is the one we identified as RPCs. P23H retinas collected 7 days after the last injection still did not have a mosaic pattern of rhodopsin labeling in the ONL and the number of BrdU positive cells (299.0 ± 26.4 nuclei/field) was still significantly higher than WT (28.2 ± 8.8; p &lt; 0.0001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, H). Furthermore, a portion of BrdU-positive cells were also rhodopsin positive, indicating that the RPCs had differentiated into rod photoreceptors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). However, the number of BrdU-positive cells after 7 days (299.0 ± 26.4) was significantly reduced compared to the number found in P23H retinas collected on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of injections (684.2 ± 27.2; p &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Thus, 56% of BrdU-labeled cells were lost in 7 days in the P23H Zf model, suggesting that the half-life of a regenerated rod photoreceptor is less than a week.</p>

<title>Prediction of transcriptional programs required for rod photoreceptor regeneration</title>
<p>The high turnover rate of regenerated rod photoreceptors in the P23H transgenic model was advantageous for the analysis of the transcriptional mechanisms of rod regeneration, as cells at all stages of differentiation were present in our SC-RNA Seq datasets. This allowed us to evaluate trajectories of gene expression changes from potential progenitor cell populations to mature rods within the same dataset. To identify the transcription factors responsible for rod photoreceptor regeneration in the P23H Zf model, SC-RNA Seq data were first run through Monocle3. Monocle3 uses a machine learning algorithm to identify the changes in gene expression needed to go from one cell type (cluster) to another cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Trajectories are plotted through expression score analyses as well as pseudotime analyses. Predicted trajectories were selected based on having a high expression score and a low pseudotime. When WT data were processed, one trajectory was observed to predict the differentiation of RPCs and NPCs into amacrine cells, bipolar cells, and rod photoreceptors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). When P23H data were processed, three trajectories were predicted. The first trajectory predicted a similar differentiation of RPCs and NPCs into amacrine cells, bipolar cells and rods (specifically new rods) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The second trajectory predicted the differentiation of RPCs (and some NPCs) into new rods (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The third trajectory predicted the maturation of new rods (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). The network of genes involved in each of the trajectories found from the P23H data were then run through DrivAER analysis to identify potential master regulators of these networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). DrivAER analysis predicted 49 transcription factor master regulators of the proliferation of progenitor cells; however, <italic>e2f1</italic>, <italic>e2f2</italic>, and <italic>e2f3</italic> had the greatest number of trajectory gene hits (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>; Supplementary Table 1). Differentiation of progenitor cells into rod photoreceptors had 16 predicted master regulators, with <italic>prdm1a</italic> having the greatest number of trajectory gene hits (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>; Supplementary Table 1). Maturation of rod photoreceptors only had 2 predicted transcription factor master regulators (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>; Supplementary Table 1). It was predicted that e2<italic>f1, e2f2, and e2f3</italic> were responsible for the proliferation of progenitor cells, <italic>prdm1a</italic> was responsible for the differentiation of progenitor cells into rod photoreceptors, and <italic>sp1</italic> was responsible for the maturation of rod photoreceptors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). The list of genes from the predicted trajectories regulated by each transcription factor is provided in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures 1</xref>-<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The remainder of this study will explore the proliferation and differentiation aspects of rod photoreceptor regeneration.</p>

<title>Proliferation knockdown in P23H Zf retina</title>
<p>To test whether master control genes identified in the DrivAER analysis are central to the processes they were associated with, we performed targeted knock-downs of the top hits associated with each process in adult P23H zebrafish retina. Proliferation of the RPC population is the first prerequisite for regeneration of rods, and members of the <italic>e2f</italic> family of transcription factors were identified as the top regulators of this process. To test the effects of <italic>e2f1, e2f2,</italic> and <italic>e2f3</italic> on proliferation, translation-blocking Vivo-morpholino oligonucleotides were generated to target each of the transcription factors (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Adult P23H Zf were intravitreally injected with a cocktail of the <italic>e2f1, e2f2,</italic> and <italic>e2f3</italic> Vivo-morpholinos or a control Vivo-morpholino, followed by intraperitoneal injections of BrdU on the following two days (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Once Zf retinas were collected and processed, tissue slices were immunostained and quantified for BrdU labeling. 5 hr after the last BrdU injection, control retina slices had 15.0 ± 3.1 BrdU positive cells per 40x image field (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, H). Tissue slices collected from retinas injected with a cocktail of <italic>e2f1, e2f2,</italic> and <italic>e2f3</italic> Vivo-morpholinos had a significant reduction in BrdU positive cells when compared to the controls (p = 0.0439) with 4.2 ± 1.9 BrdU positive cells per image field (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, H). <italic>Aurkb</italic> is known to play an important role in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) and has been found to regulate regeneration of spinal motor neurons in developing Zf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). It was unique to RPCs in our P23H SC data and hence we have generated a translation blocking Vivo-morpholino to target <italic>aurkb</italic> (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Adult P23H Zf were intravitreally injected with the <italic>aurkb</italic> Vivo-morpholino followed by intraperitoneal injections of BrdU at similar time points as the <italic>e2f</italic> and control conditions. Tissue slices collected from retina injected with the <italic>aurkb</italic> Vivo-morpholino had a significant reduction in BrdU positive cells when compared to the control (p = 0.0239) with 2.5 ± 2.1 BrdU positive cells per image field (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, H). There was no significant difference between BrdU positive cell count between <italic>aurkb</italic> and <italic>e2fs</italic> Vivo-morpholinos condition (p = 0.8689), indicating that both are essential for RPC proliferation.</p>

<p>While reduced proliferation of progenitor cells is the most likely explanation for the reduced incorporation of BrdU, an alternative explanation could be that knockdown or <italic>e2fs 1-3</italic> or <italic>aurkb</italic> triggered apoptosis in retinal progenitor cells or newly formed rods, reducing the number of BrdU-labeled cells. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed a TUNEL staining assay to identify cells undergoing apoptosis. Control retina slices had 12.1 ± 1.3 TUNEL positive cells in the ONL per 40x image field (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>, I). Tissue slices collected from retinas injected with a cocktail of <italic>e2f1</italic>, <italic>e2f2</italic>, and <italic>e2f3</italic> Vivo-morpholinos had no significant reduction in TUNEL positive cells in the ONL when compared to the controls (p = 0.7266) with 9.7 ±3.3 TUNEL positive cells per 40x image field (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>, I). While retinas injected with the <italic>aurkb</italic> Vivo-morpholino did display additional TUNEL labeling of unidentified cells in the INL and inner plexiform layer (IPL; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>), there was no significant change in TUNEL positive cells in the ONL when compared to the controls (p = 0.7266) with 9.7 ± 3.3 TUNEL positive cells per image field (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>, I). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between TUNEL positive cell count in the ONL between <italic>aurkb</italic> and <italic>e2fs</italic> Vivo-morpholinos condition (p = 0.8563). The decrease in proliferation without an increase in cell death indicates that both <italic>e2fs</italic> and <italic>aurkb</italic> are essential for the proliferation step of regeneration.</p>
<p>To investigate the global effects of <italic>e2fs</italic> and <italic>aurkb</italic> knockdown, retinas undergoing the same experimental paradigm as described above were collected and subjected to liquid chromatography-mass spec (LC-MS-MS) total proteome analysis. When compared to the control retina, retinas with <italic>e2f1</italic>, <italic>e2f2</italic>, and <italic>e2f3</italic> knockdowns had on average a 1.17 log2 fold decrease in expression of the targeted proteins (Supplementary Table 2). Furthermore, expression of proteins known to be directly targeted by the <italic>e2fs</italic>, such as <italic>rrm1</italic>, <italic>ccnyl1,</italic> and <italic>ddx55</italic> were significantly decreased in the knockdown conditions. Biological processes including ncRNA processing, rRNA processing, retina development processes, and photoreceptor cell development processes were downregulated (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Conversely, mRNA processing, oxoacid metabolic processes and phototransduction through cone opsins were all upregulated after <italic>e2fs1-3</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In the <italic>aurkb</italic> knockdown condition, <italic>aurkb</italic> expression was reduced on average by 1.34 log2 fold when compared to the control (Supplementary Table 2). Genes downstream of <italic>aurkb</italic> that are involved in cytokinesis, such as <italic>igf2bp3</italic> and <italic>dock11</italic>, were downregulated (Supplementary Table 2). Biological processes such as histone modification, positive regulation of transcription, covalent chromatin modification and visual perception were downregulated (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Conversely, biological processes involved in gene silencing, establishment of mitotic spindle localization and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression were upregulated (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Differentiation knockdown in P23H Zf retina</title>
<p><italic>Prdm1a</italic> was identified as a top transcription factor driving the differentiation of RPCs into rod photoreceptors.

<p>In order to test whether differentiation is affected by <italic>prdm1a</italic> inhibition, adult P23H Zf were given intraperitoneal injections of BrdU first, followed by intravitreal injections of either the <italic>prdm1a</italic> Vivo-morpholino or control Vivo-morpholino. Zebrafish were maintained for 4 days to allow for differentiation of progenitor cells into rod photoreceptors (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). Once Zf were collected and processed, tissue slices were immunostained and quantified for BrdU labeling and rhodopsin (Retp1) expression. Rhodopsin expression was significantly lower in tissue slices from the <italic>prdm1a</italic> Vivo-morpholino when compared to the control (p = 0.0314; <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>, C). Surprisingly, the knockdown of <italic>prdm1a</italic> resulted in a significantly higher number of rhodopsin-positive cells in the INL (p = 0.0293; <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>, D). Tissue slices from the control Vivo-morpholino-injected fish had 14.9 ± 1.9 BrdU positive cells present per 40x image field of retina and were not significantly different from tissue slices from the <italic>prdm1a</italic> Vivo-morpholino-injected fish, which had 14.5 ± 1.1 BrdU positive cells present per 40x image field of retina (p = 0.8546; <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>’, C’, E). The number of BrdU-positive cells that colocalized with rhodopsin expression was then used as a measure of progenitor cells differentiating into new rods. In the control group, 94.0 ± 1.2 % of all BrdU-positive cells in the ONL colocalized with rhodopsin expression (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>’’, F). In the <italic>prdm1a</italic> knockdown group, 62.3 ± 1.8 % of all BrdU positive cells in the ONL colocalized with rhodopsin expression (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>’’, F). <italic>Prdm1a</italic> knockdown significantly reduced the number of progenitor cells that differentiated into rod photoreceptors (p = 0.0001; <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9F</xref>).

<p>Because <italic>prdm1a</italic> knockdown significantly reduced the number of BrdU-positive cells that differentiated into rod photoreceptors, we wanted to investigate whether or not those BrdU-positive cells were differentiating into other cell types.

BrdU-positive cells did not label for either Pkcα or ZPR-1 (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Retinitis Pigmentosa is a chronic retinal degenerative disease characterized by initial degeneration of rod photoreceptors followed by complete degeneration of all photoreceptors through a bystander effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Early stages of RP are characterized by night blindness and loss of peripheral vision as rod photoreceptors gradually degenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Later stages of RP are characterized by complete blindness as cone photoreceptors degenerate via the bystander effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). While gene therapy for one variant of RP has been effective, the large number of genes that can cause RP has left many patients with no effective treatment options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). As such, regenerative medicine offers significant hope in preserving and restoring vision to patients with RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have investigated regenerative approaches to replace rod photoreceptors and prevent further degeneration of cone photoreceptors as well as replace all photoreceptors to restore vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). While not found to occur naturally in mammalian models, Müller glial cells (MGCs) do have the potential to de-differentiate into multipotent progenitor cells, proliferate, and re-differentiate to replace lost retinal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Regeneration is achieved through MGC activation via <italic>lin28/ascl1</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). After activation, MGCs de-differentiate into multi-potent progenitor cells, proliferate, and re-differentiate into different retinal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Several studies have been successful in driving these progenitor cells to re-differentiate into specific populations of cone photoreceptors, bipolar cells (BPCs), amacrine cells (ACs), and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in models with retinal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). However, rod photoreceptor-specific regeneration has been much more difficult to attain as rod photoreceptors formed in limited numbers, did not successfully integrate into the retina, and/or have only been achieved in a model with no retinal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike mammalian models, Zf have the ability to naturally regenerate neurons when injury or disease is detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). In acute damage models, MGCs activate, de-differentiate into multipotent progenitor cells, proliferate, re-differentiate into retinal cells, and integrate into the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Many acute damage paradigms ablate groups of retinal neurons (e.g. photoreceptors, outer retinal cells, inner retinal cells) and have identified that progenitor cells derived from MGCs follow fate-specific programs similar to retina formation during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). While regeneration in acute damaged Zf models stems from MGC activation parallel to mammalian models, regeneration of rod photoreceptors in a Zf model with chronic photoreceptor degeneration stems from retinal progenitor cells found in the ONL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). The mechanisms that drive these progenitor cells to proliferate, differentiate into rod photoreceptors, and develop into mature rod photoreceptors remain unknown. In this study, we investigated these mechanisms and have identified master regulators that control each step of regeneration.</p>
<p>In our P23H Zf model with chronic rod photoreceptor degeneration and regeneration, we have found progenitor cells actively proliferating predominantly throughout the ONL of the retina (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). SC-RNA Seq analysis identified 2 progenitor cell populations in our P23H Zf model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Through HiPlex in-situ hybridization, we were able to identify the RPC cluster as the predominant cluster of progenitor cells found in the ONL (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D,E</xref>). When performing a pulse-chase experiment, we were able to show that these progenitor cells differentiated into rod photoreceptors and degenerated within a span of 1 week (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-G</xref>). Our Zf model shows continuous degeneration and regeneration of only rod photoreceptors throughout the ventral, dorsal, and central ONL regions of the retina in adult Zf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). This unique model allows us to study what regeneration would look like in mammalian models with early phases of RP, when cone photoreceptors have yet to begun degenerating and retina remodeling is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). The findings in this study could potentially lead to a higher success rate of permanent rod photoreceptor integration in mammalian models at an early stage of RP.</p>
<p>Monocle3 analysis of the SC-RNA seq data had predicted a trajectory of NPCs differentiating into rod photoreceptors, bipolar cells, or amacrine cells for both WT and P23H datasets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, B). HiPlex in-situ hybridization has shown that this cluster appears to be located in the INL throughout the retina (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), while PCNA immunohistochemistry and BrdU incorporation showed very little active proliferation in the INL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref>, 3C, F). Previous studies have shown that MGCs undergo multiple states between de-differentiation into multipotent progenitor cells and becoming proliferative progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). We believe this cluster could represent non-proliferative multipotent progenitor cells and be a source of replenishment for RPCs in the ONL.</p>
<p>Unique to the P23H dataset were 2 other trajectories that predicted progenitor cell differentiation into rod photoreceptors and maturation of these newly formed rods (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, D). In these trajectories, regeneration was divided into 3 main phases: proliferation of progenitor cells, differentiation of progenitor cells into rod photoreceptors, and maturation of newly formed rod photoreceptors. DrivAER analysis predicted a set of master transcription factor regulators responsible for each phase of regeneration. <italic>E2f1, e2f2,</italic> and <italic>e2f3</italic> were important master regulators of progenitor cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). E2f1, E2f2, and E2f3 are known to be cell cycle activators that play an important role in progressing proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>). Knockdown of these transcription factors in our P23H model resulted in a significant decrease in proliferation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, D). In acute damaged models, <italic>myc/lin28/ascl1</italic> have been found to drive proliferation of NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). In our SC-RNA seq analysis, these genes were not highly upregulated or unique to progenitor cell populations, suggesting that proliferation in a chronic model undergoes an alternative mechanism than acutely damaged models.</p>
<p>Mass spec analysis of whole retina tissues collected after <italic>e2fs1-3</italic> knockdown revealed a significant downregulation of the targeted proteins as well as proteins involved in retina development and photoreceptor cell development (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Furthermore, regulation of transcription through ncRNA processing, rRNA processing, nucleobase transport, and protein trafficking were significantly downregulated while processes involved in RNA and histone methyltransferase were upregulated when compared to the control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, 4). Similarly, mitochondrial processes involved with cell division and proliferation were downregulated, while processes involved in negatively regulating autophagy were upregulated (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, 4). Through mass spec analysis, knockdown of <italic>e2fs1-3</italic> appears to show a decrease in proliferation throughout the retina. As proliferation, and by extension regeneration, is decreased, the increase in different metabolic processes activated indicates that the remaining cells may be undergoing additional stress and are compensating metabolically. Previously, we have shown that with continuous degeneration and regeneration, the retinal environment has a significant increase in oxidative metabolism, glycolysis, and synaptic remodeling when compared to WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). We believe that the knockdown of regeneration further elevates the stress of retinal cells throughout the retina, enhancing these changes. DrivAER analysis also predicted <italic>prdm1a</italic> (previously called <italic>blimp1a</italic>) to be the top master regulator driving progenitor cell differentiation into rod photoreceptors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Many studies have shown that rod photoreceptor differentiation during development can be driven with expression of <italic>otx2</italic>, <italic>crx</italic>, and <italic>nrl</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>). During development, late progenitor cells can differentiate into either bipolar cells or rod photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). While both cell types are <italic>otx2</italic> positive<italic>, prdm1a</italic> expression has been found to stabilize the progenitor cell fate towards photoreceptors and is found to be upstream of <italic>crx</italic> and <italic>nrl</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>prdm1a</italic> in our Zf model resulted in a significant reduction of the number of rod photoreceptors as early as 48 hours post knockdown, without depleting the number of BrdU positive cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8B</xref>, C, 9B, C). At 4 days post knockdown, there was a significant reduction in the number of BrdU-positive cells that had differentiated into rod photoreceptors (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>’’, D), but these cells did not differentiate into other types of neurons that we could detect (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>). Thus, <italic>prdm1a</italic> knockdown halted RPC differentiation into rod photoreceptors, but did not change the cell fate. This finding is consistent with other studies that claim progenitor cells in the ONL are unipotent for rod photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>
<p>Mass spec analysis of retinas collected after <italic>prdm1a</italic> knockdown revealed a significant downregulation of processes involved in visual perception (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref> <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Tables 7</xref>, <xref rid="tbl8" ref-type="table">8</xref>). Furthermore, genes directly targeted by <italic>prdm1a</italic> as well as processes involved in cell differentiation, neuronal morphogenesis, axon guidance, and embryonic pattern specification were all downregulated (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>; <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Tables 7</xref>, <xref rid="tbl8" ref-type="table">8</xref>). Altogether, knockdown of <italic>prdm1a</italic> confirms it to be an important transcription factor in rod photoreceptor formation and development. Surprisingly, when <italic>prdm1a</italic> was knocked down, the whole retina saw a downregulation of the negative regulation of the innate immune response (i.e. an upregulation of the innate immune response; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>; <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). As microglia are the only resident innate immune cells found in the retina, it appears that <italic>prdm1a</italic> may play a role in communicating with them. Previous studies have shown that a pro-inflammatory response is necessary for MGC derived regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). As our model shows regeneration is predominantly from progenitor cells in the ONL, with very little activity from MGCs, prolonged knockdown of <italic>prdm1a</italic> could result in the pro-inflammatory response necessary to activate MGCs.</p>
<p>There was a significantly higher number of mislocalized rhodopsin-expressing cells in the INL in the <italic>prdm1a</italic> knockdowns at 4 days post knockdown as compared to the control (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>, C, D). These cells may have differentiated from MGC derived NPCs found in the INL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, 8B). However, they may result from a phenomenon paralleling nuclear migration found during retinal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>). Through this process, progenitor cells move in an apical/basal motion in step with the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>). After exiting the cell cycle differentiated neurons have then been known to translocate and migrate towards their typical location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>). Future studies will have to further investigate this possibility.</p>
<p>In this study, we have identified a class of progenitor cells that appear to be responsible for rod photoreceptor regeneration. We have used SC-RNA Seq analysis to predict master regulators responsible for each step of rod photoreceptor regeneration: proliferation of progenitor cells, differentiation of progenitor cells into rod photoreceptors, and maturation of rod photoreceptors. We have validated the roles of the master regulators responsible for the proliferation of progenitor cells and differentiation of progenitor cells into rod photoreceptors with transient gene knockdown studies. While this study identifies how rod photoreceptors are regenerated in a Zf model with chronic retinal degeneration parallel to early stages of RP in mammalian models, there is still a need for the investigation of how rod photoreceptors are able to mature and successfully integrate into the retinal circuitry.</p>

Wild-type (WT) AB zebrafish (RRID:ZFIN_ZDB-GENO-960809-7) were purchased from the Zebrafish International Resources Center (ZIRC; Eugene, OR, USA). All Zf used in this study were between 6 months and 1 year of age. Upon random selection for experiments, sex and age of the Zf were noted. While we see no difference between sexes of fish, it should be noted that about 40% of the fish used were males and 60% of the fish used were females. All procedures that required the use of Zf comply with the U.S. Public Health Service policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals and the NRC guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and have been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Houston under PROTO202100037.</p>

Plotted as an expression score analysis, clusters that express similar genes are given a higher expression score than other clusters. Monocle3 also provides a pseudotime analysis that allows the user to identify the relative likeliness of trajectories.

<p>For each retina used for immunohistochemistry, 9 sections throughout the dorsal, central, and ventral retina were labeled, imaged, and analyzed. For each retina used for TUNEL staining, 6 sections throughout the dorsal, central, and ventral retina were labeled, imaged, and analyzed. An image sequence (6.63 µm total thickness divided into 17 sections, each 0.39 µm thick) was taken with a 40X objective lens at 1x confocal zoom (160µm x 160 µm image field). A maximum intensity projection of each sequence was made and imported into FIJI (ImageJ 1.53t). The image was then split by each channel (i.e., red, green, blue). For each channel, a threshold was adjusted to capture only the signal. After applying the threshold, a binary image mask showed the signal as white and background as black. When measuring expression levels, for each image the ratio of white pixels (signal) to total pixels was calculated. To assess differentiation of progenitor cells into rods, the ‘colocalization’ plugin in FIJI was used to assess how many cells expressed both BrdU and rhodopsin (RetP1 immunolabeling). To measure TUNEL-positive cells, the number of regions of interest identified by the threshold was counted. For each experimental animal (biological replicates), the mean data from the 9 imaged sections were compared for statistical analyses. In Graphpad Prism 9, a two-tailed t-test was performed to compare signals between the control and injected fish. For the BrdU-pulse chase and proliferation knockdown experiments, an ANOVA analysis followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test was performed to compare quantifications between different conditions. A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered significantly different.</p>

<title>Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry Proteomics</title>
<p>After carrying out the experimental paradigms described earlier, retinas were collected, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until prepared for mass spectrometry. For each condition, two retinas from separate animals were processed separately and treated as biological replicates. The proteomic sample preparation was performed by following the Sample Preparation by Easy Extraction and Digestion (SPEED) procedure previously described by Doellinger, et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>). Briefly, 10 µl of trifluoroacetic acid were added to each retina tissue sample and vortexed until all samples were dissolved. Next, 100 µl of 2M tris base was added, followed by a mixture of TCEP (10 mM) and CAA (40 mM). The samples were heated at 95°C for 5 minutes before adding 500 µl of HPLC grade water. 3 µg of proteins from each sample were transferred to a 96-well plate with 30 µg of SeraSil-Mag magnetic beads (28967388, Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA) per well. An SP3 protocol and on-bead digestion using Trypsin (w/w 1:50) were used to generate peptide samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>). 100 ng of peptides were loaded onto Evotip and analyzed using an EVOSEP One LC (EVOSEP, Odense, Denmark) connected to a timsTOF Pro2 (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The standard 60 sample per day method (21-minute gradient) was used with a C18 column (EV1109, EVOSEP). A data-independent acquisition parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (diaPASEF) scheme with 16 m/z and ion mobility windows was used for mass spec (MS) data acquisition. The electrospray voltage was 1.5 kV, and the ion transfer tube temperature was 180°C. Full MS scans were acquired over the range m/z of 100-1700. The collision energy was ramped linearly as a function of the mobility from 20 eV at 1/K0 = 0.6 V•s/cm<sup>2</sup> to 59 eV at 1/K0 = 1.6 V•s/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<title>MS Data Analysis</title>
<p>The software DIANN version 1.8 was used with default settings for peptide and protein identification and quantification from diaPASEF data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>). Data were searched against the UniProt-SwissProt <italic>Danio rerio</italic> database (Taxon ID 7955 downloaded on 8/27/2024; 3338 entries). Cysteine carbamidomethylation was listed as a fixed modification and methionine oxidation and acetylation as variable modifications. The false discovery rate (FDR) was controlled at &lt;1% at both peptide and protein levels. For each experimental condition performed, duplicates were run through MS analysis (Supplementary Table 2). Expression levels were averaged. A ratio of the experimental condition to its proper control was used to identify proteins that were greater than 3 log2 folds or less than 0.5 log2 folds. Proteins within each threshold were run through the Cytoscape (V3.10.2) plugin ClueGo (V2.5.10) to identify the GO Biological Processes upregulated or downregulated for each dataset.</p>

<p>Shihabeddin et al utilized single-cell RNA-Seq analysis of adult P23H zebrafish animals to identify transcription factors (e2fs, Prdm1a, Sp1) expressed selectively in neural progenitors and immature rods, and validated their necessity for regeneration using morphant analysis.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Shihabeddin et al. used bioinformatic and molecular biology tools to study the unique regeneration of rod photoreceptors in a zebrafish model. The authors identified a few transcription factors that seem to play an important role in this process.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript is well prepared. The topic of this study is an interesting and important one. Bioinformatics clues are interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Considering the importance of the mechanism, the knockdown experiments require further validation. The authors over-emphasized this study's relevance to RP disease (i.e. patients and mammals are not capable of regeneration like zebrafish). They under-explained this regeneration's relevance or difference to normal developmental process, which is pretty much conserved in evolution.</p>

<p>This is an interesting and important work from Shihabeddin et al, to identify master regulators for rod photoreceptor regenerations in a zebrafish model of Retinitis Pigmentosa. Building on their scRNA-seq data, Shihabeddin et al dissected the progenitor cell types and performed trajectory analyses to predict transcription factors that apparently drive the progenitor proliferation and differentiation into rod photoreceptors. Their analyses predicted e2f1, e2f2, and e2f3 as critical drivers of progenitor proliferation, Prdm1a as a driver of rod photoreceptor differentiation, and SP1 as a driver of rod photoreceptor maturation. Genetic experiments provide clear support for the roles of e2fs in progenitor proliferation. It's also apparent from Figure 8 that prdm1 knockdown appears to cause a decrease in rhodopsin expression. By colocalizing BrdU and Retp1, the authors inferred that the apparent &quot;new rods&quot; (which exhibit mixed BrdU and Retp1 signal) are decreased with prdm1, providing further support. Overall I found the work to be interesting, rigorous, and informative for the community.</p>
<p>I have a few suggestions for the authors to consider:</p>
<p>(1) Perhaps the authors can consider explaining why the Prdm1a knock-down cells would have a higher Retp1 signal per cell in Fig 9B. Is this a representative picture? This appears to contradict Figure 8's conclusion, although I could tell that the number of Retp1+ cells in the ONL appears to be lower.</p>
<p>(2) The authors noted &quot;Surprisingly, the knockdown of prdm1a resulted in a significantly higher number of rhodopsin-positive cells in the INL (p=0.0293)&quot;, while it appears in Figure 9B, 9C that the difference is 2 cells vs 0 in a rightly broader field. It seems to be too strong of a statement for this effect.</p>
<p>(3) It appears to this reviewer that the proteomic data didn't reveal much in line with the overall hypothesis or the mechanism, and it's unclear why the authors went for proteomics rather than bulk RNA-seq or ChIP-seq for a transcription factor knock-down experiment. Overall this is a minor point.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study uses a combination of single-cell RNA-Seq to globally profile changes in gene expression in adult P23H transgenic zebrafish, which show progressive rod photoreceptor degeneration, along with age-matched controls. As expected, mitotically active retinal progenitors are identified in both conditions, the increased number of both progenitors and immature rods are observed. DrivAER-mediated gene regulatory network analysis in retinal progenitors, photoreceptor precursors, and mature rod photoreceptors respectively identified e2f1-3, prdm1a, and sp1 as top predicted transcriptional regulators of gene expression specific to these cell types. Finally, morpholino-mediated knockdown of these transcription factors led to expected defects in proliferation and rod differentiation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this is a rigorous study that is convincingly executed and well-written. The data presented here will be a useful addition to existing single-cell RNA-Seq datasets obtained from regenerating zebrafish retina.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Multiple similar studies have been published and it is something of a missed opportunity in terms of identifying novel mechanisms of rod photoreceptor regeneration. Several other recent studies have used both single-cell RNA and ATAC-Seq to analyze gene regulatory networks that regulate neurogenesis in zebrafish retina following acute photoreceptor damage (Hoang, et al. 2020; Celloto, et al. 2023; Lyu, et al. 2023; Veen, et al 2023) or in other genetic models of progressive photoreceptor dystrophy such cep290 mutants (Fogerty, et al. 2022).</p>
<p>The gene regulatory network analysis here would also benefit from the addition of matched scATAC-Seq data, which would allow the use of more powerful tools such as Scenic+ (Bravo and de Winter, et al. 2023). It would also benefit from integration with single-cell multiome data from developing retinas (Lyu, et al. 2023). The genes selected for functional analysis here are all either robustly expressed in retinal progenitor cells (ef1-3 and aurka) or in developing rods (prdm1a), so it is not really surprising that defects are observed. Identification of factors that selectively regulate rod photoreceptor regeneration, rather than those that regulate both development and regeneration, would provide additional novelty. This would also potentially allow the use of animal mutants for candidate genes, rather than exclusively relying on morphant analysis, which may have off-target effects.</p>
<p>The description of the time points analyzed is vague, stating only that &quot;fish from 6 to 12 months of age were analyzed&quot;. Since photoreceptor degeneration is progressive, it is unclear how progenitor behavior changes over time, or how the gene expression profile of other cell types such as microglia, cones, or surviving rods is altered by disease progression. Most similar studies address this by analyzing multiple time points from specific ages or times post-injury.</p>

<p>Reviewer 1: “The authors over-emphasized this study's relevance to RP disease (i.e. patients and mammals are not capable of regeneration like zebrafish).”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is true that humans and other mammals are not capable of regeneration.  This is why we and many other groups study zebrafish to identify mechanisms of regeneration that successfully form new rods.  That said, our previous paper on the molecular basis or retinal remodeling in this zebrafish model system (Santhanam et al., 2023; Cell Mol Life Sci. 2023;80(12):362) revealed remarkable similarities in the stress and physiological responses of rods, cones, RPE and inner retinal neurons to those in mammalian RP models.  Thus, we believe this zebrafish is an adequate model of RP and an excellent model to study rod regeneration.</p>

<p>Reviewer 3: “It would also benefit from integration with single-cell multiome data from developing retinas (Lyu, et al. 2023).”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is an excellent suggestion to compare the regenerative response we have studied in a chronic degeneration/regeneration model to the trajectory of developmental rod formation. In Lyu, et at. 2023, it was found that while retinal regeneration has similarities to retinal development, it does not precisely recapitulate the same transcription factors and processes. Any differences between this trajectory and that revealed in developmental studies would be enlightening.  We intend to do such analyses to add to a revised manuscript in the future.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>These are different experimental paradigms.  Figure 8 shows knockdown 48 hours after injection, at which time <italic>prdm1a</italic> knockdown is affecting rhodopsin expression directly.  That experiment investigated whether <italic>prdm1a</italic> knockdown affected progenitor proliferation.  Figure 9 shows a time point 6 days after injection, at which time we were asking if <italic>prdm1a</italic> knockdown affected differentiation of progenitors into rods.</p>

It seems to be too strong of a statement for this effect.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This was a very unexpected finding.  We included statistics (Figure 9D) to support the finding, so we don’t think it is too strong a statement to make.  Speculation as to what might cause this is fascinating.  Are Muller cells producing progenitors that fail to migrate to the ONL before differentiating into rods?  The lack of BrdU labeling does not support this idea.  Do neurogenic progenitor cells in the INL differentiate towards rods via a pathway that does not require prdm1a?  Perhaps.  Perhaps there are other explanations.</p>

Overall this is a minor point.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that bulk RNA sequencing would provide a similar answer, possibly with greater sensitivity.  We chose proteomics for two reasons: 1) We wanted an independent assessment of the knockdown effects that could evaluate whether the knockdowns worked and what pathways were affected.  Since our pathway comparison is to single cell RNAseq data, bulk RNA seq did not seem to be fully independent. 2) Because we used translation-blocking antisense oligos for most knockdown experiments, we did not expect the transcript abundance of the targeted gene to be affected, although these oligos can lead to target transcript degradation.  Thus, we were not likely to be able to validate that our knockdown worked with this technique.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reviewer 3: “The gene regulatory network analysis here would also benefit from the addition of matched scATAC-Seq data, …”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is certainly true, and the reviewer points to several studies that have made excellent use of this strategy.  Given the 1-2 year timeline to obtain and analyze such data, it is unlikely that we will be able to incorporate such data in our revised manuscript, but we hope to do so for follow-up studies.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We have shown in a previous study (Santhanam et al. Cells. 2020;9(10)) that rod degeneration and regeneration are in a steady state from at least 4 to 8 months of age, and in other experiments in the lab at least to 12 months of age.  In this age range, regeneration keeps up with the pace of degeneration, both of which are very fast.  This encompasses the cell types that we specifically study in this manuscript.  The reviewer is right that other cell types could undergo changes.  This is a separate topic of study in the lab.</p>
