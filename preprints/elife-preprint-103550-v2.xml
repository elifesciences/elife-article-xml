<title>Abstract</title><p>Skeletal muscle regeneration is a multistep process involving the activation, proliferation, differentiation, and fusion of muscle stem cells, known as satellite cells. The fusion of <underline>s</underline>atellite <underline>c</underline>ell-derived mononucleated <underline>m</underline>uscle cells (SCMs) is indispensable for the generation of multinucleated, contractile myofibers during muscle repair. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying SCM fusion during muscle regeneration remain poorly understood. In this study, we uncovered an essential role for branched actin polymerization in SCM fusion. Using conditional knockouts of the Arp2/3 complex and its actin nucleation-promoting factors, N-WASP and WAVE, we demonstrated that branched actin polymerization is required for the SCM fusion, but not for satellite cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. We showed that the N-WASP and WAVE complexes have partially redundant functions in regulating SCM fusion. Furthermore, we revealed that branched actin polymerization is essential for generating invasive protrusions at the fusogenic synapses in SCMs. Taken together, our study has identified new components of the myoblast fusion machinery in skeletal muscle regeneration and demonstrated a critical role for branched actin-propelled invasive protrusions in this process.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Skeletal muscle is a unique tissue composed of elongated multinucleated cells known as myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Frontera and Ochala 2015</xref>). In response to injury, skeletal muscle has the capacity to repair injured myofibers in a process called muscle regeneration. Muscle regeneration is dependent on the resident muscle stem cells, known as satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yin et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Relaix et al. 2021</xref>). Satellite cells are located between the myofiber plasma membrane and the basement membrane (BM), the latter of which is a layer of extracellular matrix material composed of collagen, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Seale et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Webster et al. 2016</xref>). Satellite cells express high levels of Pax7, which is a paired domain-containing transcription factor, and remain quiescent under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Seale et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Le Grand and Rudnicki 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cheung and Rando 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yin et al. 2013</xref>). Upon injury, satellite cells are activated and then proliferate and differentiate into fusion-competent muscle cells to repair the injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Le Grand and Rudnicki 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cheung and Rando 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yin et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hindi and Millay 2022</xref>). Once the satellite cell-derived mononucleated muscle cells, which will be referred to as SCMs hereafter, fill the space within the BM remnants, known as ghost fibers, they would fuse with each other and/or with injured myofibers to regenerate the muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Webster et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Collins et al. 2024</xref>). SCM fusion occurs rapidly between day 3.5 to 5 post injury (dpi) and persists till ∼dpi 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Collins et al. 2024</xref>). Despite the importance of SCM fusion in skeletal muscle regeneration, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying SCM fusion during muscle regeneration remain poorly understood. To date, only two proteins, the bi-partite myoblast fusogens myomaker (MymK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Millay et al. 2013</xref>) and myomixer (MymX)/myomerger/minion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bi et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Quinn et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shi et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhang et al. 2017</xref>), have been shown to be required for SCM fusion <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Millay et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bi et al. 2018</xref>). Identifying additional components of the SCM fusion machinery will not only facilitate our understanding of muscle regeneration but also provide more options to enhance muscle regeneration upon injury.</p>
<p>Studies in multiple organisms have provided significant insights into the evolutionarily conserved mechanisms underlying myoblast fusion during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kim et al. 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schejter 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Deng et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kim and Chen 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lee and Chen 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Petrany and Millay 2019</xref>). It has been demonstrated that embryonic myoblast fusion in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, zebrafish and mouse embryos is mediated by an invasive podosome-like structure composed of actin-propelled membrane protrusions at the fusogenic synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sens et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Luo et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lu et al. 2024</xref>). The branched actin nucleator, the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Richardson et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Berger et al. 2008</xref>), and its actin nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs), the Neural Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein (N-WASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Massarwa et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Schäfer et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sens et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gruenbaum-Cohen et al. 2012</xref>), and WASP-family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schroter et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Richardson et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gildor et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sens et al. 2010</xref>), are required for generating the invasive protrusions at the fusogenic synapse. Additional actin cytoskeletal regulators upstream of the NPFs also function in mammalian myoblast fusion during development, such as activators for N-WASP (Cdc42) and WAVE (Rac1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Vasyutina et al. 2009</xref>), and the bi-partite guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1 (Dock180 [also known as Dock1] and Elmo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Laurin et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tran et al. 2022</xref>). A subunit of the WAVE complex (Nap1) has been shown to promote myoblast fusion in cultured C2C12 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nowak et al. 2009</xref>). Previous studies have shown actin-propelled protrusions between cultured SCMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Randrianarison-Huetz et al. 2018</xref>), as well as membrane protrusions at the fusion sites of cultured SCMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Eigler et al. 2021</xref>). Recent studies have revealed the mechanism underlying the formation of invasive protrusions at the fusogenic synapses – it takes the coordination of two Arp2/3 NPFs (WAVE and N-WASP) and two actin-bundling proteins (dynamin and WASP-interacting protein (WIP)) to generate mechanically stiff actin bundles that propel invasive protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhang et al. 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lu et al. 2024</xref>). The essential function of the actin cytoskeleton in myoblast fusion has been further highlighted by the fact that each of the bi-partite muscle fusogens, MymK and MymX, requires a functional actin cytoskeleton to induce myoblast fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Millay et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhang et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite all the previous studies, the potential function of branched actin polymerization in muscle regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic> has not been directly tested. Here, using satellite cell-specific knockout (KO) mice of Arp2/3 and NPFs, we show that branched actin polymerization is indispensable for muscle regeneration. In particular, Arp2/3 and NPFs are required for the formation of invasive protrusions during SCM fusion, but not satellite cell proliferation, differentiation or migration. Thus, we have identified new components of the SCM fusion machinery <italic>in vivo</italic> and demonstrated a critical role for branched actin-propelled invasive protrusions in skeletal muscle regeneration.</p>

<title>SCMs populate the ghost fibers after macrophage departure at early stages of skeletal muscle regeneration</title>
<p>To examine SCMs after injury, we injured the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles by BaCl<sub>2</sub> injection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), and labeled the differentiating SCMs using an antibody against NCAM, a cell adhesion molecule highly expressed in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Capkovic et al. 2008</xref>), and ghost fibers using an antibody against Laminin, a major component of the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Webster et al. 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Since macrophages are present in the ghost fibers to clear the necrotic debris of the damaged myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Collins et al. 2024</xref>), we also labeled macrophages with an antibody against MAC-2, a member of the lectin family expressed on the cell surface of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hohsfield et al. 2022</xref>). At dpi 2.5, the differentiating SCMs and macrophages were two major cell populations residing within the ghost fibers, occupying 39.9% and 47.8% of the total volume, respectively. By dpi 3.5, SCMs filled 98.2% of the ghost fiber volume, whereas macrophages only accounted for 1.8% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), with most of the macrophages residing in the interstitial space outside of the ghost fibers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), which would account for the high overall number of macrophages in the regenerating muscle tissues in this time period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Collins et al. 2024</xref>). Of note, our confocal (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video1">Supplementary Video 1 &amp; 2</xref>) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>) analyses of regenerating TA muscles at dpi 3 also revealed narrow openings (∼1 μm diameter) on the BM of the ghost fibers, through which macrophages (MAC-2<sup>+</sup>) with a ∼20 μm diameter (as a round cell) were traversing, suggesting that macrophages enter and/or escape the ghost fibers by squeezing through tiny openings on the BM. By dpi 4.5, most of the SCMs have fused into multinucleated primary myofibers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Collins et al. 2024</xref>).</p>

<title>Branched actin polymerization is required for mammalian skeletal muscle regeneration</title>
<p>Given that the Arp2/3 complex-mediated branched actin polymerization is required for myoblast fusion during mouse embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lu et al. 2024</xref>), we asked whether the Arp2/3 complex is required for skeletal muscle regeneration in adults. Toward this end, we generated satellite cell-specific, tamoxifen-inducible KO mice for ArpC2, a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Goley and Welch 2006</xref>), by breeding <italic>Pax7</italic><sup>CreERT2</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lepper et al. 2009</xref>) with <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wang et al. 2016</xref>).

However, muscle injury by BaCl<sub>2</sub> resulted in a significant decrease (87.7 <bold>±</bold> 2.0%) in the cross-sectional area (CSA) of regenerated myofibers in <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mice compared to their littermate controls at dpi 14 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>) and dpi 28 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4B</xref>).

<title>Branched actin polymerization is required for SCM fusion</title>
<p>To pinpoint the specific step of skeletal muscle regeneration – satellite cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and SCM fusion – in which branched actin polymerization is required, we performed immunostaining using antibodies that specifically mark these steps. As shown in <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>-<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5E</xref>, the percentages of muscle cells positive for the proliferation marker (Ki67) and the muscle differentiation marker (MyoG) in the injured TA muscles were similar between control and <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mice (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>-<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5E</xref>). In addition, live imaging analysis showed that cultured <italic>ArpC2</italic> KO SCMs exhibited normal migration and cell-cell contact behaviors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video3">Supplementary Video 3</xref>). Thus, branched actin polymerization is dispensable for satellite cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration during skeletal muscle regeneration. The reduced muscle size in the <italic>ArpC2</italic> mutant mice is, at least in part, due to defects in SCM fusion.</p>
<p>To monitor the SCM fusion phenotypes, we examined the regenerating TA muscles of the control and <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mice at dpi 4.5, when myoblast fusion leading to primary myofiber formation is mostly completed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Collins et al. 2024</xref>). While most of the SCMs within the ghost fibers had fused in the control animals, the ghost fibers in the <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mice contained differentiated (NCAM<sup>+</sup>), but mostly unfused, SCMs, which were readily observed in cross sections, comparable to those in the <italic>MymX</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>). Consistent with this, the frequency distribution of SCM numbers in a cross section per ghost fiber in the <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> and <italic>MymX</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mice displayed a dramatic shift toward higher numbers compared with that of the wild-type mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). These results indicate that the actin cytoskeleton plays as an essential role in SCM fusion as the fusogenic proteins. Interestingly, expression levels of the fusogenic proteins, MymK and MymX, in the TA muscle of <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mutant mice were either similar or higher compared to that of wild-type mice (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5F</xref>-<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5H</xref>), suggesting that the fusion defect in the <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mutant mice was not due to a lack of fusogen expression. Consistent with this, cultured <italic>ArpC2</italic> KO SCMs exhibited a severe fusion defect despite undergoing normal differentiation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>) and pharmacologically inhibiting Arp2/3 with CK666 also led to a similar fusion defect (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6B</xref>-<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6D</xref>). In addition, cell-mixing experiments using wild-type and <italic>ArpC2</italic> KO SCMs showed that <italic>ArpC2</italic> KO SCMs failed to fuse with wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>), indicating that branched actin polymerization is required in both fusing partners. Taken together, these results demonstrate that branched actin polymerization is required for SCM fusion during skeletal muscle regeneration.</p>

<title>Branched actin polymerization promotes invasive protrusion formation during SCM fusion</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanism by which branched actin polymerization regulates SCM fusion during muscle regeneration, we first examined the cellular structure at the fusogenic synapse of cultured SCMs. Live cell imaging of cultured SCMs expressing Arp2-mNeongreen (mNG) and LifeAct-mScarleti (mScar) at day two in differentiation medium (DM) revealed Arp2-and F-actin-enriched finger-like protrusions projecting from the invading cells into their fusion partners (receiving cells) at the fusogenic synapse prior to cell membrane fusion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video4">Supplementary Video 4</xref>). Consistent with this, TEM analysis of the TA muscle at dpi 3.5 in wild-type mice revealed finger-like protrusions projected by SCMs invading their neighboring cells (20.3 ± 16.5% of SCMs exhibited invasive protrusions, n = 83 SCMs from 20 ghost fibers examined) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). The average length and width of the invasive finger-like protrusions were 422 ± 200 nm and 121 ± 73 nm, respectively (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7B</xref>, n = 32 invasive protrusions examined).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we show that the Arp2/3 complex-mediated branched actin polymerization is indispensable for SCM fusion, but not for satellite cell proliferation, migration, or differentiation during muscle regeneration. The Arp2/3 NPFs, N-WASP and WAVE, exhibit partially redundant functions in regulating SCM fusion. Our live cell imaging and electron microcopy analysis revealed actin-propelled invasive protrusions at the fusogenic synapses of SCMs, and our genetic analysis demonstrated a requirement for branched actin polymerization in generating these protrusions. Taken together, we propose that branched actin polymerization promotes mammalian muscle regeneration by facilitating the formation of invasive protrusions at the fusogenic synapse (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies in multiple organisms, including <italic>Drosophila</italic>, zebrafish, and mouse, have demonstrated that myoblast fusion during embryogenesis is mediated by actin-propelled invasive membrane protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sens et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jin et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Duan et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Duan et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Luo et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lu et al. 2024</xref>). These protrusions enhance the plasma membrane contact areas between the fusion partners and increase the mechanical tension of the fusogenic synapse to promote fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shilagardi et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kim et al. 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kim et al. 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kim and Chen 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lee and Chen 2019</xref>). The current study has revealed a similar role for invasive protrusions in promoting myoblast fusion during adult skeletal muscle regeneration, demonstrating that the same cell fusion machinery required during embryogenesis is reused in adult muscle regeneration. It is striking that depleting the branched actin polymerization machinery results in a severe SCM fusion defect similar to depleting the fusogenic protein MymX, highlighting the indispensable role for actin cytoskeletal rearrangements in SCM fusion. Indeed, our previous work with a reconstituted cell-fusion culture system led to the discovery that fusogens and branched actin regulators are two minimal components of the cell-cell fusion machinery, and that actin-propelled invasive protrusions are required to bring the two apposing cell membranes into close proximity for fusogen engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shilagardi et al. 2013</xref>). It would be interesting to determine whether invasive protrusions promote the trans-interactions of fusogens at the mammalian fusogenic synapse.</p>

Then, the sections were fixed in 2% PFA for 5 minutes at RT, washed three time with PBS and incubated with blocking buffer supplemented with M.O.M blocking reagent (1:25; Vector; MKB-2213-1) for 60 minutes at RT, followed by overnight incubation with mouse anti-Pax7 (1:2; DSHB; Pax7), mouse anti-MyoG (1:2; DSHB; F5D), rat anti-Laminin-2 (1:500; Sigma; L0663), and rat anti-Ki67 (1:500; ThermoFisher Scientific; 14-5698-82) at 4°C. After the incubation with primary antibodies, the sections were extensively washed with PBS and then incubated with alexa fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies for one hour at RT. Subsequently, the sections were washed with PBS and subjected to imaging using a Leica TCS SP8 inverted microscope.</p>

<title>Western Blot</title>
<p>For western blots, proteins were isolated from the cultured SCMs or TA muscle using ice-cold RIPA buffer (150mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS and 50mM Tris, PH7.4) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Cell Signaling Technologies; 5872) for 20 minutes. The supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 140,000 x g for 15 minutes. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad; 5000201). 10-30 μg total protein was loaded for each sample and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore; GVHP29325). Then, the membranes were blocked for one hour at RT in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween-20 (PBSBT) and subsequently were incubated with primary antibodies diluted at 1:1000 in PBSBT overnight at 4°C. The membranes were then washed with PBST and incubated with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in PBSBT for one hour at RT. After extensive washes with PBST, the membranes were developed with the ECL western blotting substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific; 32209). The following primary antibodies were used: sheep anti-ESGP/MymX (1:1000; R&amp;D Systems; AF4580), mouse anti-MymK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al. 2020a</xref>) (1:1000), and rabbit anti-β-Tubulin (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technologies; 2146).</p>

<title>Time-lapse Imaging and Analysis</title>
<p>Time-lapse imaging of cells incubated in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37 °C was performed on a Nikon A1R confocal microscope with a Nikon Biostation CT. The satellite cells were seeded on fibronectin-coated cover glass (MATTEK; P35G-0-14-C) and imaged using a 40× (0.4 NA) objective at indicated time points after switching from GM to DM. The cells were imaged at two- or five-minute interval. After time-lapse imaging, ImageJ (NIH, 64-bit Java 1.8.0_172) was used to project the z-stacks in 2D, using maximum intensity projection and the resulting 2D images were assembled into a time-lapse video.</p>

<p>To observe the invasive protrusions at the contact sites of SCMs during muscle regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic>, TA muscle at dpi 3.5 were fixed in a solution containing 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde, 1% sucrose, 3mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) overnight at 4°C. Samples were subsequently washed with 0.1M cacodylate buffer containing 3% sucrose and 3mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and post fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1.5 hours on ice. The muscle samples were stained with 2% uranyl acetate, dehydrated and embedded in EPON resin as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhang and Chen 2008</xref>). The embedded samples were then cut into 70-nm thick sections using LEICA ultramicrotome (UC6) and collected on copper slot grids. These sections were post-stained with 2% uranyl acetate and sato’s lead solution and examined using a JEOL 1400 transmission electron microscope.</p>

<p>Overall, the manuscript reveals the role for actin polymerization to drive fusion of myoblasts during adult muscle regeneration. This pathway regulates fusion in many contexts, but whether it was conserved in adult muscle regeneration remained unknown.

<p>To fuse, differentiated muscle cells must rearrange their cytoskeleton and assemble actin-enriched cytoskeletal structures. These actin foci are proposed to generate mechanical forces necessary to drive close membrane apposition and the fusion pore formation. While the study of these actin-rich structures has been conducted mainly in drosophila and in vertebrate embryonic development, the present manuscript present clear evidence this mechanism is necessary for fusion of adult muscle stem cells in vivo, in mice. The data presented here clearly demonstrate that ARP2/3 and SCAR/WAVE complexes are required for differentiating satellite cells fusion into multinucleated myotubes, during skeletal muscle regeneration.</p>

<p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed my inquiries. However, I had to look quite hard to find where they responded to my final comment regarding the potential role of Arpc2 post-fusion during myofiber growth and/or maintenance, which I eventually located on page 7. I would appreciate it if the authors could state this point more explicitly, perhaps by adding a sentence such as &quot;However, we cannot rule out the possibility that Arpc2 may also play a role in.....&quot; to improve clarity of communication.</p>
<p>While I understood from the original version that this issue falls beyond the immediate scope of the study, I believe it is important to adopt a more cautious and rigorous interpretative framework, especially given the widespread use of this experimental approach. In particular, when a gene could potentially have additional roles in myofibers, it may be helpful to explicitly acknowledge that possibility. Even if Arpc2 may not necessarily be one of them, such roles cannot be fully excluded without direct testing.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>We very much appreciate the positive comments from this Reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There are a few interpretations that could be adjusted.</p>
<p>The beginning of the results about macrophages traversing ghost fibers after regeneration was a surprise given the context in the abstract and introduction. These results also lead to new questions about this biology that would need to be answered to substantiate the claims in this section. Also, it is unclear the precise new information learned here because it seems obvious that macrophages would need to extravasate the basement membrane to enter ghost fibers and macrophages are known to have this ability. Moreover, the model in Figure 4D has macrophages and BM but there is not even mention of this in the legend. The authors may wish to consider removing this topic from the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment and acknowledge that the precise behavior of macrophages when they infiltrate and/or exit the ghost fibers during muscle regeneration is not the major focus of this study. However, we think that visualizing macrophages squeezing through tiny openings on the basement membrane to infiltrate and/or exit from the ghost fibers is valuable. Thus, we have moved the data from the original main Figure 2 to the new Figure S1.</p>
<p>Regarding the model in Figure 4D, we have removed the macrophages because the depicted model represents a stage after the macrophages’ exit from the ghost fiber.</p>

<p>The authors comment: 'Interestingly, expression of the fusogenic proteins, MymK and MymX, was up-regulated in the TA muscle of these mice (Figure S4F), suggesting that fusogen overexpression is not able to rescue the SCM fusion defect resulted from defective branched actin polymerization.' It is unclear if fusogens are truly overexpressed because the analysis is performed at dpi 4 when the expression of fusogens may be decreased in control mice because they have already fused. Also, only two animals were analyzed and it is unclear if MymX is definitively increased. The authors should consider adjusting the interpretation to SCM fusion defect resulting from defective branched actin polymerization is unlikely to be caused by a lack of fusogen expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that fusogen expression may simply persist till later time points in fusion mutants without being up-regulated. We have modified our interpretation according to the Reviewer’s suggestion.</p>

<p>To fuse, differentiated muscle cells must rearrange their cytoskeleton and assemble actinenriched cytoskeletal structures. These actin foci are proposed to generate mechanical forces necessary to drive close membrane apposition and fusion pore formation.</p>
<p>While the study of these actin-rich structures has been conducted mainly in drosophila, the present manuscript presents clear evidence this mechanism is necessary for the fusion of adult muscle stem cells in vivo, in mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank this Reviewer for the positive comment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>However, the authors need to tone down their interpretation of their findings and remember that genetic proof for cytoskeletal actin remodeling to allow muscle fusion in mice has already been provided by different labs (Vasyutina E, et al. 2009 PMID: 19443691; Gruenbaum-Cohen Y, et al., 2012 PMID: 22736793; Hamoud et al., 2014 PMID: 24567399). In the same line of thought, the authors write they &quot;demonstrated a critical function of branched actin-propelled invasive protrusions in skeletal muscle regeneration&quot;. I believe this is not a premiere, since Randrianarison-Huetz V, et al., previously reported the existence of finger-like actin-based protrusions at fusion sites in mice myoblasts (PMID: 2926942) and Eigler T, et al., live-recorded said &quot;fusogenic synapse&quot; in mice myoblasts (PMID: 34932950). Hence, while the data presented here clearly demonstrate that ARP2/3 and SCAR/WAVE complexes are required for differentiating satellite cell fusion into multinucleated myotubes, this is an incremental story, and the authors should put their results in the context of previous literature.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this study, we focused on elucidating the mechanisms of myoblast fusion during skeletal muscle regeneration, which remained largely unknown. Thus, we respectfully disagree with this Reviewer that “this is an incremental story” for the following reasons –</p>
<p>First, while we agree with this Reviewer that “genetic proof for cytoskeletal actin remodeling to allow muscle fusion in mice has already been provided by different labs”, most of the previous genetic studies, including ours (Lu et al. 2024), characterizing the roles of actin regulators (Elmo, Dock180, Rac, Cdc42, WASP, WIP, WAVE, Arp2/3) in mouse myoblast fusion were conducted during embryogenesis (Laurin et al. 2008; Vasyutina et al. 2009; Gruenbaum-Cohen et al. 2012; Tran et al. 2022; Lu et al. 2024), instead of during adult muscle regeneration, the latter of which is the focus of this study.</p>
<p>Second, prior to this study, several groups tested the roles of SRF, CaMKII theta and gemma, Myo10, and Elmo, which affect actin cytoskeletal dynamics, in muscle regeneration. These studies have shown that knocking out SRF, CaMKII, Myo10, or Elmo caused defects in mouse muscle regeneration, based on measuring the cross-sectional diameters of regenerated myofibers only (Randrianarison-Huetz et al. 2018; Eigler et al. 2021; Hammers et al. 2021; Tran et al. 2022). However, none of these studies visualized myoblast fusion at the cellular and subcellular levels during muscle regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic>. For this reason, it remained unclear whether the muscle regeneration defects in these mutants were indeed due to defects in myoblast fusion, in particular, defects in the formation of invasive protrusions at the fusogenic synapse. Thus, the previous studies did not demonstrate a direct role for the actin cytoskeleton, as well as the underlying mechanisms, in myoblast fusion during muscle regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Third, regarding actin-propelled invasive protrusions at the fusogenic synapse, our previous study (Lu et al. 2024) revealed these structures by fluorescent live cell imaging and electron microscopy (EM) in cultured muscle cells, as well as EM studies in mouse embryonic limb muscle, firmly establishing a direct role for invasive protrusions in mouse myoblast fusion in cultured muscle cells and during embryonic development. Randrianarison-Huetz et al. (2018) reported the existence of finger-like actin-based protrusions at cell contact sites of cultured mouse myoblasts. It was unclear from their study, however, if these protrusions were at the actual fusion sites and if they were invasive (Randrianarison-Huetz et al. 2018). Eigler et al. (2021) reported protrusions at fusogenic synapse in cultured mouse myoblasts. It was unclear from their study, however, if the protrusions were actin-based and if they were invasive (Eigler et al. 2021). Neither Randrianarison-Huetz et al. (2018) nor Eigler et al. (2021) characterized protrusions in developing mouse embryos or regenerating adult muscle.</p>
<p>Taken together, to our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize myoblast fusion at the cellular and subcellular level during mouse muscle regeneration. We demonstrate that branched actin polymerization promotes invasive protrusion formation and myoblast fusion during the regeneration process. We believe that this work has laid the foundation for additional mechanistic studies of myoblast fusion during skeletal muscle regeneration.</p>
<p>The citations in the original manuscript were primarily focused on previous <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of Arp2/3 and the actin nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs), N-WASP and WAVE (Richardson et al. 2007; Gruenbaum-Cohen et al. 2012), and of invasive protrusions mediating myoblast fusion in intact animals (<italic>Drosophila</italic>, zebrafish and mice) (Sens et al. 2010; Luo et al. 2022; Lu et al. 2024). We agree with this reviewer, however, that it would be beneficial to the readers if we provide a more comprehensive summary of previous literature, including studies of both intact animals and cultured cells, as well as studies of additional actin regulators upstream of the NPFs, such as small GTPases and their GEFs. Thus, we have significantly expanded our Introduction to include these studies and cited the corresponding literature in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(1) I am concerned that the authors did not evaluate the efficiency of the target allele deletion efficiency following Pax7-CreER activation.

<p>(2) Can the authors provide evidence that the N-WASP, CYFIP1, and ARPC2 proteins are depleted in TAM-treated tissue? Alternatively, can the author perform RT-qPCR on freshly isolated MuSCs to validate the absence of N-WASP, CYFIP1, and ARPC2 mRNA expression?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for these comments. We have assessed the target allele deletion efficiency with isolated satellite cells from TAM-injected mice in which Pax7-CreER is activated. Western blot analyses showed that the protein levels of N-WASP, CYFIP1, and ArpC2 significantly decreased in the satellite cells of knockout mice. Please see the new Figure S2.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript by Lu et al. explores the role of the Arp2/3 complex and the actin nucleators NWASP and WAVE in myoblast fusion during muscle regeneration. The results are clear and compelling, effectively supporting the main claims of the study. However, the manuscript could benefit from a more detailed molecular and cellular analysis of the fusion synapse. Additionally, while the description of macrophage extravasation from ghost fibers is intriguing, it seems somewhat disconnected from the primary focus of the work.</p>
<p>Despite this, the data are robust, and the major conclusions are well supported. Understanding muscle fusion mechanism is still a widely unexplored topic in the field and the authors make important progress in this domain.</p>

<p>I have a few suggestions that might strengthen the manuscript as outlined below.</p>
<p>(1) Could the authors provide more detail on how they defined cells with &quot;invasive protrusions&quot; in Figure 4C? Membrane blebs are commonly observed in contacting cells, so it would be important to clarify the criteria used for counting this specific event.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for this suggestion. We define invasive protrusions as finger-like protrusions projected by a cell into its fusion partner. Based on our previous studies (Sens et al. 2010; Luo et al. 2022; Lu et al. 2024), these invasive protrusions are narrow (with 100-250 nm diameters) and propelled by mechanically stiff actin bundles. In contrast, membrane blebs are spherical protrusions formed by the detachment of the plasma membrane from the underlying actin cytoskeleton. In general, the blebs are not as mechanically stiff as invasive protrusions and would not be able to project into neighboring cells. Thus, we do not think that the protrusions in Figure 4B are membrane blebs. We clarified the criteria in the text and figure legends of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Along the same line, please clarify what each individual dot represents in Figure 4C. The authors mention quantifying approximately 83 SCMs from 20 fibers. I assume each dot corresponds to data from individual fibers, but if that's the case, does this imply that only around four SCMs were quantified per fiber? A more detailed explanation would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To quantitatively assess invasive protrusions in Ctrl and mutant mice, we analyzed 20 randomly selected ghost fibers per genotype. Within each ghost fiber, we examined randomly selected SCMs in a single cross section (a total of 83, 147 and 93 SCMs in Ctrl, <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> and <italic>MymX</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mice were examined, respectively).</p>
<p>In Figure 4C, each dot was intended to represent the percentage of SCMs with invasive protrusions in a single cross section of a ghost fiber. However, we mistakenly inserted a wrong graph in the original Figure 4C. We sincerely apologize for this error and have replaced it with the correct graph in the new Figure 4C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Localizing ArpC2 at the invasive protrusions would be a strong addition to this study. Furthermore, have the authors examined the localization of Myomaker and Myomixer in ArpC2 mutant cells? This could provide insights into potential disruptions in the fusion machinery.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have examined the localization of the Arp2/3 complex on the invasive protrusions in cultured SCMs and included the data in Figure 4A of the original manuscript. Specifically, we showed enrichment of mNeongreen-tagged Arp2, a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, on the invasive protrusions at the fusogenic synapse of cultured SCMs (see the enlarged panels on the right; also see supplemental video 4). The small size of the invasive protrusions on SCMs prevented a detailed analysis of the precise Arp2 localization along the protrusions.  Please see our recently published paper (Lu et al. 2024) for the detailed localization and function of the Arp2/3 complex during invasive protrusion formation in cultured C2C12 cells.</p>
<p>We have also attempted to localize the Arp2/3 complex in the regenerating muscle <italic>in vivo</italic> using an anti-ArpC2 antibody (Millipore, 07-227-I), which was used in many studies to visualize the Arp2/3 complex in cultured cells. Unfortunately, the antibody detected non-specific signals in the regenerating TA muscle of the <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> animals. Thus, it cannot be used to detect specific ArpC2 signals in muscle tissues. Besides the specificity issue of the antibody, it is technically challenging to visualize invasive protrusions with an F-actin probe at the fusogenic synapses of regenerating muscle by light microscopy, due to the high background of F-actin signaling within the muscle cells.</p>
<p>Regarding the fusogens, we show that both are present in the TA muscle of the <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> animals by western blot (Figure S5F-S5H). Thus, the fusion defect in these animals is not due to the lack of fusogen expression. Since the focus of this study is on the role of the actin cytoskeleton in muscle regeneration, the subcellular localization of the fusogens was not investigated in the current study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) As a minor curiosity, can ArpC2 WT and mutant cells fuse with each other?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our previous work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos showed that Arp2/3-mediated branched actin polymerization is required in both the invading and receiving fusion partners (Sens et al. 2010).  To address this question in mouse muscle cells, we co-cultured GFP<sup>+</sup> WT cells with mScarleti<sup>+</sup> WT (or mScarleti<sup>+</sup> <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> cells) <italic>in vitro</italic> and assessed their ability to fuse with one another. We found that <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> cells could barely fuse with WT cells (new Figure 3F and 3G), indicating that the Arp2/3-mediated branched actin polymerization is required in both fusion partners. This result is consistent with our findings in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors report a strong reduction in CSA at 14 dpi and 28 dpi, attributing this defect primarily to failed myoblast fusion. Although this claim is supported by observations at early time points, I wonder whether the Arp2/3 complex might also play roles in myofibers after fusion. For instance, Arp2/3 could be required for the growth or maintenance of healthy myofibers, which could also contribute to the reduced CSA observed, since regenerated myofibers inherit the ArpC2 knockout from the stem cells. Could the authors address or exclude this possibility? This is rather a broader criticism of how things are being interpreted in general beyond this paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting question. It is possible that Arp2/3 may play a role in the growth or maintenance of healthy myofibers. However, the muscle injury and regeneration process may not be the best system to address this question because of the indispensable early step of myoblast fusion. Ideally, one may want to knockout <italic>Arp2/3</italic> in myofibers of young healthy mice and observe fiber growth in the absence of muscle injury and compare that to the wild-type littermates. Since these experiments are out of the scope of this study, we revised our conclusion that the fusion defect in <italic>ArpC2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mice should account, at least in part, for the strong reduction in CSA at 14 dpi and 28 dpi, without excluding additional possibilities such as Arp2/3’s potential role in the growth or maintenance of healthy myofibers.</p>
