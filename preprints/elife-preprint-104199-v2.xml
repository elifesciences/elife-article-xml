<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most bacteria divide by a highly conserved process termed binary fission, which occurs through the symmetric division of the parental cell into two daughter cells (Harpring 2023). However, <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> serovar L2 (<italic>Ct</italic>), a coccoid, gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium divides by a polarized cell division process characterized by an asymmetric expansion of the membrane from one pole of a coccoid cell resulting in the formation of a nascent daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdelrahman 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ouellette SP 2022</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Ct</italic> undergoes a biphasic developmental cycle during infection. Non-replicating and infectious elementary bodies (EBs) bind to and are internalized by target cells. Following internalization, EBs within a membrane vacuole, termed the inclusion, differentiate into replicating reticulate bodies (RBs). After replication, RBs undergo secondary differentiation into EBs, which are released from cells to initiate another round of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abdelrahman 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In evolving to obligate intracellular dependence, <italic>Ct</italic> has eliminated several gene products essential for cell division in other bacteria, including the central coordinator of divisome formation, FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Stephens 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ouellette SP 2020</xref>). This tubulin-like protein forms filaments that associate to form a ring at the division plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barrows 2021</xref>), which serves as a scaffold for the assembly of the other components of the bacterial divisome that regulate the processes of septal peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis and chromosomal translocation. Of the twelve divisome proteins shown to be essential for cell division in the model gammaproteobacterial organism, <italic>E. coli, Ct</italic> encodes homologues of FtsK, a chromosomal translocase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>); FtsQLB, regulators of septal PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ouellette SP 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kaur 2022</xref>), FtsW, a septal transglycosylase (Putman T 2019), and penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP3/FtsI), a septal transpeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the divisome, rod-shaped bacteria employ another multiprotein complex, the elongasome, which directs sidewall PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu 2020</xref>) necessary for cell lengthening and the maintenance of cell shape prior to division. Although <italic>Ct</italic> is a coccoid organism, it encodes several elongasome proteins, including MreB, MreC, RodA, RodZ, and penicillin binding protein 2 (PBP2), a sidewall transpeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ouellette SP 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cox 2020</xref>). The actin-like protein MreB is essential for cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdelrahman 2016</xref>) and forms septal rings in <italic>Ct</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kemege 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Liechti 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lee 2020</xref>). These observations led to the proposal that MreB replaces FtsZ in <italic>Ct</italic> and serves as a scaffold necessary for the assembly of the chlamydial divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lee 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>While inhibitor studies suggest that chlamydial cell division is dependent upon elements of the divisome and elongasome from other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdelrahman 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cox 2020</xref>), the composition and ordered assembly of the chlamydial divisome and its distribution during polarized budding are undefined. We hypothesized that FtsK, a chromosomal translocase, serves a critical function in regulating the division process of <italic>Ct,</italic> given previous observations demonstrating it interacts with elements of both the elongasome and divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>). We show here that FtsK is critical for the assembly of the hybrid divisome complex of <italic>Ct</italic> and that MreB does not serve as a scaffold necessary for the assembly of the chlamydial divisome. Rather, chlamydial MreB associates with this hybrid divisome complex late in the chlamydial divisome assembly process, and MreB filament formation is necessary for the formation of septal PG rings. Therefore, our data identify FtsK as a key regulator of the cell division process of <italic>Ct</italic>.</p>

<title>FtsK Forms Foci in <italic>Ct</italic> that Mark the Location of Divisome Complexes</title>
<p>In the <italic>E. coli</italic> linear divisome assembly pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Du 2017</xref>), FtsK is the first protein downstream of FtsZ encoded by <italic>Ct</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In other organisms, FtsK is uniformly distributed at the septum of dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Yu 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Wang 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Veiga 2017</xref>). To investigate the localization of FtsK during cell division in <italic>Ct</italic>, HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic>. To overcome the challenges associated with assessing cell morphologies in densely packed inclusions in infected cells, we analyzed FtsK localization in <italic>Ct</italic> derived from lysates of infected HeLa cells at 21 hrs post-infection (hpi) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ouellette SP 2022</xref>). <italic>Ct</italic> were stained with an antibody against the chlamydial major outer membrane protein (MOMP) and an antibody that recognizes endogenous FtsK. Blotting analysis revealed that this FtsK antibody recognizes a single protein with the predicted molecular mass of FtsK (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S1A</xref>). Our results showed that, unlike FtsK in other organisms, chlamydial FtsK accumulates in discrete foci in the membrane of coccoid cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In cell division intermediates, FtsK localized in foci at the septum, foci at the septum and at the base of the progenitor mother cell, or foci at the base of the progenitor mother cell only (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The chlamydial FtsK foci observed during cell division were not uniformly distributed at the septum, rather septal foci of FtsK were restricted to one side of the MOMP-stained septum. In addition, the FtsK foci were often above or below (marked with arrowheads in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) the MOMP-stained septum. Similar analyses were performed using <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with the pBOMB4-Tet (-GFP) plasmid encoding FtsK with a C-terminal mCherry tag. The expression of this mCherry fusion is under the control of an anhydrotetracycline (aTc)-inducible promoter. HeLa cells were infected with the transformant, and the expression of the fusion was induced by the addition of 10nM aTc to the media of infected cells at 19hpi. RBs were harvested from the induced cells at 21hpi and stained with MOMP antibodies. Imaging analyses revealed that like endogenous FtsK, FtsK-mCherry accumulated in foci in coccoid cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), and in division intermediates, it localized in foci at the septum, foci at the septum and at the base of the progenitor mother cell, or foci at the base of the progenitor mother cell only (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). The foci of FtsK-mCherry, like endogenous FtsK, were often offset relative to the plane defined by MOMP staining at the septum (arrowhead in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Inclusion forming unit (IFU) assays demonstrated that overexpression of the FtsK-mCherry fusion had no effect on chlamydial developmental cycle progression and the production of infectious EBs (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S2A</xref>). While it is possible that the population of FtsK at the base of the mother cell is a remnant of FtsK from a previous division, ∼20% of dividing cells have a secondary bud (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), and FtsK and FtsK-mCherry accumulate in foci at the base of secondary buds (arrowheads in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>), suggesting that the population of FtsK at the base of the mother cell corresponds to a nascent divisome complex that forms at the site where the daughter cell will arise in the next round of division.</p>

<p>To investigate the distribution of other putative chlamydial divisome components during budding, we transformed <italic>Ct</italic> with plasmids encoding PBP2, PBP3, or MreC with an N-terminal mCherry tag. IFU assays demonstrated that the aTc induced overexpression of the PBP2, PBP3, and MreC fusions had no effect on the developmental cycle progression of <italic>C</italic>t (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S2A</xref>). In addition, blotting analyses revealed that mCherry antibodies primarily detected single species with the predicted molecular mass of the FtsK, PBP2, PBP3, and MreC fusions in lysates prepared from induced cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S1B</xref>). The PBP2, PBP3, and MreC fusions were induced by the addition of 10nM aTc to infected cells at 19hpi, and the induced cells were harvested at 21hpi and stained with MOMP antibodies. Imaging analyses revealed that the PBP2, PBP3, and MreC fusions accumulated in foci in coccoid cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), and in cell division intermediates, the fusions accumulated in foci at the septum, in foci at the septum and at the base of the progenitor mother cell, or in foci only at the base of the progenitor mother cell (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Similar analyses with an MreB_6xHis fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lee 2020</xref>) revealed that MreB exhibited a similar localization profile (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2A and B</xref>). Each of these fusions, like FtsK, were restricted to one side and were often slightly above or slightly below (marked with arrowheads in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) the MOMP-stained septum in dividing cells. The foci of the fusions were also detected at the base of secondary buds (arrowheads in <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S2B</xref>). Quantification of the localization profiles of endogenous FtsK and the various fusion proteins revealed that the distribution profile of FtsK-mCherry accurately reflected the distribution of endogenous FtsK (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Furthermore, a greater percentage of FtsK was associated with the base of dividing cells (including cells with septum and base, and cells with base alone) suggesting that FtsK associates with nascent divisomes at the base of dividing cells prior to the other putative divisome proteins assayed. Finally, this analysis suggested that MreB associated with nascent divisomes at the base of dividing cells after mCherry-PBP2 and mCherry-PBP3 (marked with # in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The localization profiles of the chlamydial divisome proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) likely reflect the assembly of divisome complexes at the septum and at the base of the progenitor mother cell, and the disassembly of the septal divisome when divisome proteins are only present at the base of the mother cell.</p>

<caption><p>HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with PBP2, PBP3, or MreC with an N-terminal mCherry tag, or with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with an MreB_6xHis fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lee 2020</xref>). Each of the fusions was induced by adding 10nM aTc to the media at 17hpi. Lysates were prepared at 21hpi and the cells were fixed and stained with a MOMP antibody. The distribution of the mCherry fluorescence in (A) coccoid cells and in (B) dividing cells that had not initiated secondary bud formation is shown. Cells expressing the MreB_6xHis fusion were stained with rabbit anti-6x His antibody (red) and MOMP antibodies (green). Dividing cells with foci at the septum, foci at the septum and foci at the base of the mother cell, or foci at the base alone are shown for each of the fusions. Arrowheads in B denote foci of the divisome proteins above or below the plane of the MOMP-stained septum. (C) HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic> L2. Alternatively, cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic> that were transformed with FtsK-mCherry, mCherry-PBP2, mCherry-PBP3, mCherry-MreC, or MreB_6xHis. The cells expressing the fusions were induced with aTc for 1.5hrs then fixed at 21hpi and the distribution of endogenous FtsK, or the mCherry fluorescence in cells inducibly expressing the mCherry fusions, or the distribution of MreB in cells where the MreB_6xHis fusion was inducibly expressed was quantified. A small fraction (2 %) of dividing cells contained multiple foci of each of the divisome proteins at the septum and/or the base of the cell. Since these cells were relatively rare, we included these cells with cells that contained a single foci in the quantification. The localization profiles were quantified in 100 cells. Three independent replicates were performed, and the values shown are the average of the 3 replicates. Chi-squared analysis revealed that the localization profiles of endogenous FtsK and FtsK-mCherry are not statistically different from each other, but they are statistically different than the PBP2, PBP3, MreC and MreB localization profiles (* – p&lt;0.009). The localization profile of the MreB fusion is also statistically different than the localization profiles of the mCherry fusions of PBP2 and PBP3 (#-p = 0.05). (D) Hela cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with PBP2, PBP3, or MreC with a N-terminal mCherry tag, or with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with an MreB_6xHis fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lee 2020</xref>). The fusions were induced by adding 10 nM aTc to the media at 17hpi. The cells were harvested at 21hpi and <italic>Ct</italic> were harvested and stained with FtsK and MOMP antibodies. The cells expressing the MreB fusion were stained with FtsK, MOMP, and 6xHis antibodies. Imaging analyses revealed that FtsK was present in foci at the septum and in foci at the base in these cells, while each of the fusions was only detected at the septum where they overlapped the distribution of septal FtsK (Bars are1μm).</p></caption>

<p>Since it was possible that the localization profiles of the mCherry-PBP2 and mCherry-PBP3 fusions were at least in part due to their induced over-expression, we performed similar studies with rabbit antibodies generated against peptides derived from PBP2 or PBP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>). Blotting analyses (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S1C</xref>) with these antibodies revealed that they recognized mCherry-PBP2 and mCherry-PBP3 in <italic>Ct</italic> lysates, and immunofluorescent staining with the PBP2 and PBP3-specific antibodies (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S1D</xref>) completely overlapped the mCherry fluorescence in cells when the mCherry PBP2 and PBP3 fusions were inducibly expressed in <italic>Ct</italic>. Imaging analyses with the antibodies that recognize endogenous PBP2 and endogenous PBP3 indicated that these antisera detected foci in coccoid cells, and in cell division intermediates, the PBP2 and PBP3 antibodies detected foci at the septum, foci at the septum and at the base of the mother cell, or foci at the base alone (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S3A</xref>). Quantification revealed that the localization profiles of endogenous PBP2 and PBP3 in division intermediates (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S3B</xref>) were not statistically different than the localization profiles observed for the mCherry fusions of PBP2 and PBP3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>The quantification in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> suggested that FtsK is recruited to nascent divisomes that form at the base of dividing cells prior to the other divisome components assayed. This hypothesis was tested by staining cells expressing the PBP2, PBP3, MreC, or MreB fusions with antibodies that recognize endogenous FtsK. Imaging analyses revealed that in a subset of cells, FtsK was detected in foci at the septum and at the base of dividing cells, while each of the fusions was only detected at the septum where they overlapped the distribution of septal FtsK (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), indicating that FtsK is recruited to nascent divisomes at the base of the cell prior to the other divisome components assayed. Additional analyses revealed that FtsK also overlapped the distribution of the PBP2, PBP3, MreC, and MreB fusions following their appearance at the base of dividing cells (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S4A</xref>). Quantification revealed the percentage of cells in which FtsK overlapped the distribution of each of the fusions at the septum, at the septum and the base, and at the base alone in division intermediates (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S4B</xref>).</p>

<title>MreB Filament Formation is not Required for Foci Formation by FtsK, PBP2, and PBP3</title>
<p>MreB was one of the last components that associated with nascent divisomes forming at the base of the progenitor mother cell (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). To investigate whether MreB filament formation was required for the formation of foci by the other chlamydial divisome components, HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with the FtsK, PBP2, PBP3, MreC, or MreB fusions, and the fusions were induced by adding 10nM aTc to the media of the infected cells at 20hpi for 1hr. During the induction period, cells were incubated in the absence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>) or presence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>) of the MreB inhibitor, A22, which inhibits MreB filament formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bean, 2009</xref>). RBs were harvested at 21hpi and stained with the appropriate antibodies to assess the effect of A22 on the cellular distribution of the fusions. As previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cox 2020</xref>), A22 inhibits chlamydial budding and most cells in the population were coccoid following A22 treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Furthermore, approximately 50% of the untreated control cells were coccoid, which is consistent with prior estimates of the number of non-dividing RBs at this stage of the developmental cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Lee 2018</xref>), indicating that our lysis procedure does not lead to a bias in the number of non-dividing coccoid cells in the population. MreB in coccoid cells adopted a diffuse pattern of localization following A22 treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). A22 also had a statistically significant effect on the percent of coccoid cells containing MreC foci, but it did not affect the ability of FtsK, PBP2, or PBP3 to form foci in coccoid cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>).

<title>Effect of <italic>ftsk</italic> and <italic>pbp2</italic> Knockdown on Cell Division and Divisome Assembly in <italic>Ct</italic></title>
<p>To further investigate the mechanisms that regulate divisome assembly in <italic>Ct</italic>, we inducibly repressed the expression of <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic> using CRISPRi technology, which has been used to inducibly repress the expression of genes in <italic>Ct</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ouellette SP 2021</xref>). CRISPRi employs a constitutively expressed crRNA that targets an inducible dCas enzyme (dCas12) to specific genes where it binds but fails to cut, thus inhibiting transcription. We transformed <italic>Ct</italic> with the pBOMBL12CRia plasmid that constitutively expresses an <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic>-specific crRNA, which target sequences in the <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic> promoter regions. To determine whether <italic>ftsK</italic> and <italic>pbp2</italic> transcript levels were altered using this CRISPRi approach, dCas12 expression was induced by the addition of 5nM aTc to the media of infected cells at 8hpi. Control cells were not induced. Nucleic acids were isolated from induced cells and uninduced control cells at various times, and RT-qPCR was used to measure <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic> transcript levels. This analysis revealed that the induction of dCas12 resulted in ∼10-fold reduction in <italic>ftsK</italic> transcript levels by 15hpi in cells expressing the <italic>ftsK-</italic>targeting crRNA (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S5A</xref>), and ∼8-fold reduction in <italic>pbp2</italic> transcript levels in cells expressing the <italic>pbp2</italic>-targeting crRNA (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S5B</xref>), while these crRNAs had minimal or no effect on chlamydial <italic>euo</italic> and <italic>omcB</italic> transcript levels, suggesting that the <italic>ftsK</italic> and <italic>pbp2</italic> crRNAs specifically inhibit the transcription of <italic>ftsK</italic> and <italic>pbp2</italic> (Supp. Figs. S5A and S5B). To investigate the effect of <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic> down-regulation on developmental cycle progression, dCas12 was induced by the addition of aTc to the media of infected cells at 4hpi. Control cells were not induced. The cells were then fixed at 24hpi and stained with MOMP and Cas12 antibodies. Imaging analysis revealed that <italic>Ct</italic> morphology was normal and dCas12 was undetectable in the inclusions of uninduced control cells, while foci of dCas12 were observed in the induced cells, and <italic>Ct</italic> in the inclusion exhibited an enlarged aberrant morphology (Supp. Figs. S5C and S5D), suggesting that the inducible knockdown of <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic> blocks chlamydial cell division. In additional studies, we induced dCas12 at 17hpi in cells expressing the <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic>-targeting crRNAs. Lysates were prepared and the cells were fixed at 21hpi, and localization studies revealed that foci of endogenous FtsK and PBP2 were almost undetectable when <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic> were transiently knocked down using this CRISPRi approach (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S5E</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess whether the knockdown of <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic> arrests <italic>Ct</italic> division at a specific stage of polarized budding, HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with the pBOMBL12CRia plasmids encoding the <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic>-targeting crRNAs. At 17hpi, dCas12 was induced by the addition of 20nM aTc to the media. Control cells were not induced. RBs were harvested from induced and uninduced control cells at 22hpi and stained with MOMP antibodies, and imaging analyses quantified the division intermediates present in the population. These analyses revealed that &gt;60% of the <italic>Ct</italic> in the uninduced controls were at various stages of polarized budding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4A and B</xref>), while ∼90% of the cells were coccoid when <italic>ftsK</italic> was knocked down (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), and ∼85% of the cells were coccoid following <italic>pbp2</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), suggesting that the initiation of polarized budding of <italic>Ct</italic> is inhibited when <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic> are knocked down.</p>

<p>We next examined whether the knockdown of <italic>ftsK</italic> affected foci formation by PBP2 or PBP3 in coccoid cells. HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with the pBOMBL12CRia plasmid encoding the <italic>ftsK</italic>-targeting crRNA. At 17hpi, dCas12 was induced by the addition of 10nM aTc to the media. Control cells were not induced. RBs were harvested from induced and uninduced control cells at 22hpi, and the localization of endogenous PBP2 and PBP3 in coccoid cells was assessed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). This analysis revealed that the number of coccoid cells with polarized foci of PBP2 and PBP3 were reduced by approximately 80% following <italic>ftsK</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). In similar analyses, we assessed the effect of <italic>pbp2</italic> knockdown on the ability of FtsK and PBP3 to form foci in coccoid cells. While FtsK retained its ability to form foci in coccoid cells following <italic>pbp2</italic> knockdown, foci of PBP3 were almost entirely absent in <italic>pbp2</italic> knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). Quantification of these assays revealed that FtsK is necessary for foci formation by both the PBP2 and PBP3 transpeptidases, while PBP2 is necessary for foci formation by PBP3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Our data place FtsK upstream of, and necessary for, the addition of PBP2 and PBP3 to the <italic>Ct</italic> divisome, and PBP2 upstream of and necessary for the addition of PBP3 to the <italic>Ct</italic> divisome. These results are consistent with inhibitor studies that indicated PBP2 acts upstream of PBP3 in the polarized budding process of <italic>Ct</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cox 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether the catalytic activity of PBP2 is necessary to maintain its association with the <italic>Ct</italic> divisome, HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic>, and mecillinam, an inhibitor of the transpeptidase activity of PBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Kocaoglu 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cox 2020</xref>), was added to the media of infected cells at 20hpi. Cells incubated in the absence of mecillinam were included as a control. Mecillinam-treated and control cells were harvested at 22hpi and the effect of inhibiting the catalytic activity of PBP2 on the localization of FtsK, PBP2, and PBP3 was determined. As shown previously, mecillinam blocks chlamydial division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cox 2020</xref>), and most cells in the population assumed a coccoid morphology (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). We then determined the localization of endogenous FtsK, PBP2, and PBP3 in drug-treated and control coccoid cells. Mecillinam treatment resulted in a ∼50% reduction in the number of cells with polarized foci of PBP2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5B</xref> - <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). There was a similar reduction in polarized foci of PBP3 following mecillinam treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5B</xref> - <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). These data indicate that the catalytic activity of PBP2 is necessary for PBP2 to efficiently associate with or maintain its association with polarized divisome complexes. Furthermore, consistent with <italic>pbp2</italic> knockdown studies, PBP3 association with the divisome complex is dependent on the prior addition of PBP2 to the complex, but foci formation by FtsK is unaffected when PBP2 foci are reduced in number (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Effect of Inhibitors and <italic>ftsk</italic> Knockdown on PG Organization in <italic>Ct</italic></title>
<p>To assess the morphology of PG at the septum and the base of dividing cells, we used an EDA-DA labeling strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Liechti 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cox 2020</xref>). This approach enabled the detection of PG foci, bars, and rings in dividing <italic>Ct</italic> (Liechti 2021).

In the example shown (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>), a PG foci was detected at the septum while a PG ring was detected at the base of the mother cell. In additional analyses, we compared the localization of mCherry-PBP3 to the localization of PG in cells where the expression of this mCherry fusion had been induced by the addition of aTc to the media. This analysis, which was restricted to PG formation at the septum of dividing cells, revealed that multiple foci of PBP3 were associated with a septal PG ring (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Furthermore, the PG ring was at an angle relative to the MOMP-stained septum. Similar analyses revealed that 2 foci of endogenous FtsK were associated with PG that was again at an angle relative to the MOMP-stained septum. This was true even though the PG had not fully reorganized into a ring structure (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p>

<p>We then determined the effect of A22 and mecillinam on PG synthesis/organization. Since both of these drugs induce <italic>Ct</italic> to assume a coccoid morphology, we initially characterized PG organization in untreated coccoid cells. We detected foci, bars, or rings in ∼80% of untreated coccoid cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>), which make up ∼50% of the cells in the inclusion at this stage of the developmental cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Lee 2018</xref>). Furthermore, each of these PG intermediates exhibited a polarized distribution in untreated coccoid cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Although we cannot rule out that continued PG synthesis and reorganization occurs in polarized division intermediates, PG rings can arise prior to any of the morphological changes that occur during the polarized division of <italic>Ct</italic>.</p>
<p>Prior studies have shown that inhibitors of MreB filament formation prevent the appearance of PG-containing structures in <italic>Ct</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Liechti 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ouellette SP 2022</xref>). To assess whether MreB filament formation is required for PG synthesis and/or PG reorganization, we infected HeLa cells with <italic>Ct</italic>, and EDA-DA and A22 were added to the media of infected cells at 18hpi. The cells were harvested at 22hpi, lysates were prepared, and PG localization was determined. These analyses revealed that PG was diffuse/undetectable in the majority of A22-treated cells, and, in those cells where PG was still detected, it could not convert into ring structures (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). In similar experiments, we assessed the effect of mecillinam on the appearance of PG intermediates in coccoid cells.

However, these PG intermediates could not convert into PG rings when the transpeptidase activity of PBP2 was inhibited. Finally, we assessed PG organization in cells where <italic>ftsK</italic> was knocked down by inducing dCas12 in the <italic>ftsK</italic> knockdown strain by the addition of aTc to the media of infected cells at 17hpi.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results presented here provide insight into the molecular mechanisms governing the FtsZ-less polarized cell division process of <italic>Ct</italic>. This study is the first to document the ordered assembly of divisome proteins in <italic>Ct</italic> and to investigate the roles of divisome proteins in regulating PG synthesis/organization in this obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen. Our studies showed that the divisome in <italic>Ct</italic> is hybrid in composition, containing elements of the divisome and elongasome from other bacteria, and a putative pathway for the assembly of the novel hybrid divisome of <italic>Ct</italic> is shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>. Although we focused our study on a subset of the divisome and elongasome proteins that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> expresses (bolded in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>), our results support our conclusion that chlamydial budding is dependent upon a hybrid divisome complex and that FtsK is required for the assembly of this hybrid divisome. At this time, we cannot rule out that other proteins act upstream of FtsK to initiate divisome assembly in this obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen.</p>
<p>The domain organization of FtsK is highly conserved among bacteria. The C-terminus of the protein mediates the ATP-dependent directional translocation of the protein along DNA through interaction with KOPS (Fts<bold>K o</bold>rienting <bold>p</bold>olar <bold>s</bold>equences) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barre, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Massey, 2006</xref>) and stimulates XerCD-dependent recombination at the <italic>dif</italic> site near the chromosomal terminus to decatenate chromosomal dimers that arise from homologous recombination during DNA replication to monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Blakely, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Massey, 2006</xref>). The C-terminus of chlamydial FtsK is 41% identical to the C-terminus of <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsK. The N-terminus of <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsK encodes 4 predicted transmembrane spanning helices, which are sufficient to direct the protein to the septum in dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Yu, 1998</xref>). The N-terminus of chlamydial FtsK, which is also predicted to encode 4 transmembrane-spanning helices, is 34% identical to <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsK.</p>
<p>Our analyses revealed a novel spatiotemporal localization pattern of FtsK during the chlamydial division process. Chlamydial FtsK forms discrete foci at the septum, foci at the septum and at the base of the mother cell, or in foci only at the base of the mother cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Our data indicate that the foci at the base of the mother cell correspond to nascent divisome complexes that form prior to the formation of a secondary bud at the base of the progenitor mother cell. Our analyses further revealed there was no correlation between the stage of bud formation by the initial bud (early, mid-late; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ouellette SP, 2022</xref>), and the appearance of nascent divisomes at the base of the progenitor mother cell (data not shown).</p>
<p>The <italic>Ct</italic> divisome is hybrid in nature, containing elements of the divisome (FtsK and PBP3) and elongasome (PBP2, MreB, and MreC) from other bacteria. Each of these proteins formed foci at the septum, foci at the septum and at the base of the mother cell, or foci only at the base of the mother cell, and the foci of each protein were restricted to one side of the MOMP-stained septum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>ftsK</italic> using CRISPRi revealed that FtsK is necessary for the assembly of this hybrid divisome complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Knockdown and inhibitor studies further revealed that PBP2 is necessary for the addition of PBP3 to the divisome in <italic>Ct</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).</p>
<p>The chlamydial divisome proteins all form foci in coccoid cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and FtsK forms foci in dividing <italic>Ct</italic> that only partially overlap the distribution of PBP2, PBP3, MreC, and MreB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S4A</xref>). The lack of overlap of FtsK with MreB and MreC is most clearly evident in <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S4A</xref>, and while it is unclear why FtsK only partially overlaps the distribution of the other divisome components in dividing <italic>Ct</italic>, MreB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Liechti 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kemege 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lee 2020</xref>) and MreC (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S6A</xref>) can reorganize into rings in dividing cells, and the MreC rings we detected, like PG rings (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), were at an angle relative to the MOMP-stained septum. MreC also forms rings in coccoid cells (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. S6B</xref>). Although MreB and MreC form rings in <italic>Ct</italic>, we never detected FtsK rings in dividing or coccoid chlamydial cells. The relevance of the angled orientation of PG and MreC rings relative to the MOMP-stained septum in division intermediates is unclear. However, it appears to be a conserved feature of the cell division process and may arise because the divisome proteins are often positioned slightly above or below the plane of the MOMP-stained septum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies hypothesized that MreB filaments may substitute for FtsZ and form a scaffold necessary for the assembly of the divisome in <italic>Ct</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ouellette SP 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ouellette SP 2020</xref>). However, our analyses have indicated that MreB is one of the last components recruited to nascent divisomes that form at the base of the mother cell in <italic>Ct,</italic> and localization studies revealed that foci formation by FtsK, PBP2, and PBP3 are not dependent on MreB filament formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Although our data indicate that MreB filaments do not form a scaffold necessary for the assembly of all components of the divisome in <italic>Ct</italic>, MreB filaments are necessary for the conversion of PG foci into PG rings in <italic>Ct</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
<p>FtsZ treadmilling drives its rotational movement at the septum and this may be required for the positioning of peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzymes at the division plane in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bisson-Filho 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Yang 2017</xref>). The knockdown studies presented here demonstrated that in the absence of FtsZ, chlamydial FtsK is critical for divisome assembly and PG synthesis in <italic>Ct,</italic> and future real-time imaging studies will determine whether changes in the organization/distribution of FtsK occur during chromosomal translocation and/or cell division in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Furthermore, future studies will investigate the mechanisms that regulate the site of assembly of nascent divisomes in the mother cell during the polarized cell division process.</p>
<p><italic>Ct</italic> is a member of the Planctomycetes/Verrucomicrobia/Chlamydia superphylum and members of the Chlamydia and Planctomycetes phyla do not encode FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Rivas-Marín 2016</xref>). <italic>Planctospirus limnophila</italic> is a member of the Planctomycetes that divides by polarized budding, and recent knockout studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Rivas-Marin 2023</xref>) indicated that FtsK is the only protein of the chlamydial divisome we characterized here that is essential for the growth of this free-living organism. These results suggest that multiple mechanisms of FtsZ-independent polarized budding have evolved in members of this superphyla. It will be of interest in future studies to determine whether other members of the Planctomycetes that bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Wiegand 2020</xref>) divide using a divisome apparatus similar to <italic>Ct</italic>.</p>

The pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of 0.1x PBS (Gibco) and transferred to a 2mL tube containing 0.5mm glass beads (ThermoFisher Scientific). Cells were vortexed for 3 mins. then centrifuged at 800rpm for 2 mins. in a microfuge. 20μLs of the supernatant was mixed with 20μLs of 2x fixing solution (6.4% formaldehyde and 0.044% glutaraldehyde) and incubated on a glass slide for 10 min at room temperature.

For experiments with <italic>Ct</italic> L2, the cells were incubated with a goat primary antibody against the major outer-membrane protein (MOMP; Meridian, Memphis, TN), and the mouse primary antibody that recognizes endogenous FtsK raised against recombinant CT739 protein (https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.047746-0), or with rabbit antibodies raised against peptides derived from PBP 2 or PBP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>). Briefly, chlamydial antigens or peptides emulsified with Freund’s incomplete adjuvant were used to immunize animals via intramuscular injections three times with an interval of 2 weeks. Antisera were collected from the immunized animals 2 to 4 weeks after the final immunization as the primary antibodies. After the primary antibody labeling, the cells were then rinsed with PBS and incubated with donkey anti-goat IgG (Alexa 488) and donkey anti-mouse IgG (Alexa 594) or donkey-anti-rabbit IgG (Alexa 594) secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Experiments in which we visualized the distribution of the various mCherry fusions, the localization of the mCherry fluorescence was compared to the distribution of MOMP. In some experiments, we determined the distribution of the MreB_6x His fusion by staining cells expressing the fusion with a rabbit anti-6x His antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and the goat anti-MOMP antibody followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies. Cells were imaged using Zeiss AxioImager2 microscope equipped with a 100x oil immersion PlanApochromat objective and a CCD camera. During image acquisition, 0.3μm xy-slices were collected that extended above and below the cell. The images were collected such that the brightest spot in the image was saturated. The images were deconvolved using the nearest neighbor algorithm in the Zeiss Axiovision 4.7 software. Deconvolved images were viewed and assembled using Zeiss Zen-Blue software. For each experiment, three independent replicates were performed, and the values shown for localization are the average of the 3 experiments.

The fusions were induced with 10nM aTc at 17hpi. HeLa cells were harvested at 21hpi and lysates were prepared and characterized by immunoblotting analysis with a rabbit polyclonal mCherry antibodies. (C) HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed N-terminal fusions of PBP2 or PBP3. The fusions were induced (+aTc) at17hpi. Controls were not induced (-aTc). The cells were harvested at 21hpi and lysates were prepared as described in the Methods and characterized by immunoblotting analysis with rabbit antibodies raised against peptides derived from chlamydial PBP2 or PBP3. The PBP3 antibody primarily detects a single species with the predicted molecular mass of mCherry-PBP3 in the induced sample. The PBP2 antibody primarily detects a species of ∼120kD in the induced sample, which is smaller than the predicted molecular mass of mCherry-PBP2 (∼150kD). The failure to detect full length mCherry-PBP2 may be due to the masking of the epitope recognized by the PBP2 antibody by the N-terminal mCherry tag in the full-length protein.

<p>Understanding how the divisome is assembled in Chlamydia trachomatis, a bacterial pathogen, is crucial since this bacterium has a non-canonical cell wall and lacks the master regulator of cell division, FtsZ. This <bold>important</bold> study shows that a DNA translocase, FtsK, is an early and essential component of the Chlamydia trachomatis divisome. The evidence presented is <bold>convincing</bold>, leveraging the elegant use of genetics and fluorescence microscopy. As this role of FtsK is distinct relative to most other bacteria, these findings should be of significant interest to bacterial cell biologists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, Harpring et al. investigated divisome assembly in Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L2 (Ct), an obligate intracellular bacterium that lacks FtsZ, the canonical master regulator of bacterial cell division. They find that divisome assembly is initiated by the protein FtsK in Ct by showing that it forms discrete foci at the septum and future division sites. Additionally, knocking down ftsK prevents divisome assembly and inhibits cell division, further supporting their hypothesis that FtsK regulates divisome assembly. Finally, they show that MreB is one of the last chlamydial divisome proteins to arrive at the site of division and is necessary for the formation of septal peptidoglycan rings but does not act as a scaffold for division assembly as previously proposed.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use microscopy to clearly show that FtsK forms foci both at the septum as well as at the base of the progenitor cell where the next septum will form. They also show that the Ct proteins PBP2, PBP3, MreC, and MreB localize to these same sites suggesting they are involved in the divisome complex.</p>
<p>Using CRISPRi the authors knockdown ftsK and find that most cells are no longer able to divide and that PBP2 and PBP3 no longer localized to sites of division suggesting that FtsK is responsible for initiating divisome assembly. They also performed a knockdown of pbp2 using the same approach and found that this also mostly inhibited cell division. Additionally, FtsK was still able to localize in this strain however PBP3 did not suggest that FtsK acts upstream of PBP2 in the divisome assembly process while PBP2 is responsible for the localization of PBP3.</p>
<p>The authors also find that performing a knockdown of ftsK also prevents new PG synthesis further supporting the idea that FtsK regulates divisome assembly. They also find that inhibiting MreB filament formation using A22 results in diffuse PG, suggesting that MreB filament formation is necessary for proper PG synthesis to drive cell division.</p>
<p>Overall the authors propose a new hypothesis for divisome assembly in an organism that lacks FtsZ and use a combination of microscopy and genetics to support their model that is rigorous and convincing. The finding that FtsK, rather than a cytoskeletal or &quot;scaffolding&quot; protein is the first division protein to localize to the incipient division site is unexpected and opens up a host of questions about its regulation. The findings will progress our understanding of how cell division is accomplished in bacteria with non-canonical cell wall structure and/or that lack FtsZ.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No major weaknesses were noted in the data supporting the main conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Chlamydial cell division is a peculiar event, whose mechanism was mysterious for many years. C. trachomatis division was shown to be polar and involve a minimal divisome machinery composed of both homologues of divisome and elongasome components, in absence of an homologue of the classical division organizer FtsZ. In this paper, Harpring et al., show that FtsK is required at an early stage of the chlamydial divisome formation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well-written and the results are convincing. Quantification of divisome component localization is well performed, number of replicas and number of cells assessed are sufficient to get convincing data. The use of a CRISPRi approach to knock down some divisome components is an asset and allows a mechanistic understanding of the hierarchy of divisome components</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>Despite advances in the understanding of the importance of FtsK for chlamydial division, this manuscript does not show by which mechanism FtsK specifically localizes at the division site and how it mediates recruitment of other divisome members. Moreover, the potential link with DNA partitioning is not addressed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) divides by binary fission. It lacks FtsZ, but still has many other proteins that regulate synthesis of septal peptidoglycan, including FtsW and FtsI (PBP3) as well as divisome proteins that recruit and activate them, such as FtsK and FtsQLB. Interestingly, MreB is also required for division of Ct cells, perhaps by polymerizing to form an FtsZ-like scaffold. Here, Harpring et al. show that MreB does not act early in division and instead is recruited to a protein complex that includes FtsK and PBP2/PBP3. This indicates that Ct cell division is organized by a chimera between conserved divisome and elongasome proteins. Their work also shows convincingly that FtsK is the earliest known step of divisome activity, potentially nucleating the divisome as a single protein complex at the future division site. This is reminiscent of the activity of FtsZ, yet fundamentally different.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is very well written and presented, and the data are convincing and rigorous. The data underlying the proposed localization dependency order of the various proteins for cell division is well justified by several different approaches using small molecule inhibitors, knockdowns, and fluorescent protein fusions. The proposed dependency pathway of divisome assembly is consistent with the data and with a novel mechanism for MreB in septum synthesis in Ct.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed the weaknesses brought up in my previous review.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No major weaknesses were noted in the data supporting the main conclusions. However, there was a claim of novelty in showing that multiple divisome complexes can drive cell wall synthesis simultaneously that was not well-supported (i.e. this has been shown previously in other organisms). In addition, there were minor weaknesses in data presentation that do not substantially impact interpretation (e.g. presenting the number of cells rather than the percentage of the population when quantifying phenotypes and showing partial western blots instead of total western blots).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the weaknesses identified by the reviewer. We removed the statements in the Results and Discussion that multiple independent divisome complexes can simultaneously direct PG synthesis. We presented the data in Figs. 3-5 as % of the cells in the population, and complete western blots are shown in Supp. Fig. S1.</p>

<p>The authors did not analyse the role of all potential chlamydial divisome components and did not show how FtsK may initiate the positioning of the divisome.

</disp-quote>
<p>The following statement has been included in the Discussion (pg. 16 of the revised manuscript)  “Although we focused our study on a subset of the divisome and elongasome proteins that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> expresses (bolded in Fig. 6G), our results support our conclusion that chlamydial budding is dependent upon a hybrid divisome complex and that FtsK is required for the assembly of this hybrid divisome. At this time, we cannot rule out that other proteins act upstream of FtsK to initiate divisome assembly in this obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen.”</p>
<p>We will soon be submitting another manuscript that addresses how FtsK specifies the site of divisome assembly. This work is too extensive to be included in this manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) divides by binary fission. It lacks FtsZ, but still has many other proteins that regulate the synthesis of septal peptidoglycan, including FtsW and FtsI (PBP3) as well as divisome proteins that recruit and activate them, such as FtsK and FtsQLB. Interestingly, MreB is also required for the division of Ct cells, perhaps by polymerizing to form an FtsZ-like scaffold. Here, Harpring et al. show that MreB does not act early in division and instead is recruited to a protein complex that includes FtsK and PBP2/PBP3. This indicates that Ct cell division is organized by a chimera between conserved divisome and elongasome proteins. Their work also shows convincingly that FtsK is the earliest known step of divisome activity, potentially nucleating the divisome as a single protein complex at the future division site. This is reminiscent of the activity of FtsZ, yet fundamentally different.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is very well written and presented, and the data are convincing and rigorous. The data underlying the proposed localization dependency order of the various proteins for cell division is well justified by several different approaches using small molecule inhibitors, knockdowns, and fluorescent protein fusions. The proposed dependency pathway of divisome assembly is consistent with the data and with a novel mechanism for MreB in septum synthesis in Ct.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper could be improved by including more information about FtsK, the &quot;focus&quot; of this study. For example, if FtsK really is the FtsZ-like nucleator of the Ct divisome, how is the Ct FtsK different sequence-wise or structurally from FtsK of, e.g. E. coli? Is the N-terminal part of FtsK sufficient for cell division in Ct like it is in E. coli, or is the DNA translocase also involved in focus formation or localization? Addressing those questions would put the proposed initiator role of FtsK in Ct in a better context and make the conclusions more attractive to a wider readership.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will be submitting another manuscript soon that details the conserved domain organization of FtsK from different bacteria, and the role of the various domains of chlamydial FtsK (including the N-terminus and the C-terminal translocase domain) in directing its localization in dividing <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. We have added text to the discussion (pg. 16 of the revised manuscript) that describes the sequence homology of chlamydial FtsK to FtsK from <italic>E. coli.</italic></p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Another weakness is that the title of the paper implies that FtsK alone initiates divisome assembly. However, the data indicate only that FtsK is important at an early stage of divisome assembly, not that it is THE initiator. I suggest modifying the title to account for this--perhaps &quot;FtsK is required to initiate....&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and modified the title to “FtsK is Critical for the Assembly of the Unique Divisome Complex of the FtsZ-less <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis”.</italic> We have also modified the text throughout to indicate that FtsK is required for the assembly of the hybrid divisome of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Suggestions for improvement (mostly minor):</p>
<p>(1) For several of the graphs, the authors plot the number of cells with a given phenotype on the y-axis, but then describe percentages of cells in the text. It would make it clearer if all the graphs had the percentage of cells on the y-axis instead.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified the figures to indicate the percentage of cells on the y-axis with a given phenotype.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figures 3, 4, and 5 the authors show separate graphs for plus/minus drug or inducer. These should be on the same graph as they are directly comparing these two different conditions. Having them on separate graphs makes it less clear whether these differences are significant between the two conditions</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We modified Fig. 4 to show +/- inducer in <italic>ftsk</italic> and <italic>pbp2</italic> knockdown strains in the same graph.  Regarding Figures 3 and 5, we believe the figures in the original submission effectively demonstrate the +/- drug conditions, so these figures remain unchanged in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 2 the authors show microscopy of the colocalization of FtsK with several other divisome proteins from Ct. Quantification of the colocalization of FtsK with these other proteins would provide a more holistic understanding of their colocalization and help further support their argument that FtsK initiates the assembly of the divisome.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Supp. Fig. S4A of the revised manuscript contains images showing the colocalization of FtsK with the fusions at the septum and the base of dividing cells, and the colocalization of FtsK with the fusions that are only at the base of dividing cells.

<p>(4) In Figure 6 the authors mention that the PG ring was at a slight angle relative to the MOMP-stained septum. What is the significance of this? The authors mention it several times but do not explain its relevance to divisome assembly. It is not really evident in the images presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We mention in the discussion pgs. 17-18 of the revised manuscript that “The relevance of the angled orientation of PG and MreC rings relative to the MOMP-stained septum in division intermediates is unclear. However, it appears to be a conserved feature of the cell division process and may arise because the divisome proteins are often positioned slightly above or below the plane of the MOMP-stained septum. The positioning of divisome proteins above or below the septum is indicated in Figs. 1 and 2.</p>
<p>We included cartoons in Fig. 6C of the revised manuscript to assist the reader in visualizing the angled orientation of the PG ring relative to the MOMP-stained septum.</p>

<p>(5) In line 270 the authors claim that &quot;these are the first data in any system to suggest that septal PG synthesis/modification is simultaneously directed by multiple independent divisome complexes.&quot; However, their experiments do not demonstrate that multiple divisome complexes are active at the same time. They show that multiple foci of FtsK etc. are present at sites where PG synthesis has occurred, but that does not necessarily mean that each focus/complex was actively synthesizing PG at the same time. Moreover, similar approaches were used to support a claim that septal PG synthesis is directed by multiple discrete divisome complexes previously (e.g. in Figure 1 of Bisson-Filho et al. 2017 (PMID: 28209898) in Bacillus subtilis and in Perez et al 2021 (PMID: 33269494) in Streptococcus pneumoniae). This claim is not central to the main conclusions of the study and could just be removed.</p>

<p>(6) In Figure 6B the authors see three distinct FtsK foci. Why is this the only place in the manuscript where they see three foci? They mentioned previously that they saw foci at the septum and at the base of the progenitor mother cell, but why are there three foci here?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The vast majority of dividing cells displayed one foci at the septum and/or the base.  Representative images were chosen that reflected the localization profiles observed in the majority of cells. While we observed cells with  multiple foci, as shown in Figure 6C, these cells were relatively rare   (~2% of cells for all the divisome proteins in 3 independent experiments).  Since  the number of cells with multiple foci were relatively rare, we chose to group these cells with the cells that had single foci at the septum, the septum and base, or base alone categories in the quantification shown in Fig. 2C. This is stated in the legend of Fig. 2 of the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(7) The Discussion section is lacking a couple of things that would put the data in a broader context. Can the authors speculate on how FtsK knows how to find the division site? I.e. what might be upstream of FtsK localization? Additionally, the authors do not talk about the FtsK sequence or domains at any point in the paper. Does Ct FtsK have a similar sequence/structure to FtsKs from other bacteria? Are there any differences in sequence/structure that might tell us about its function in Ct?</p>

<p>We will be submitting another manuscript soon that examines how the site of assembly of the divisome is defined in dividing <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. This manuscript will also define the localization of the different sub-domains of chlamydial FtsK during cell division.  For this manuscript, we added a paragraph in the Discussion (pg. 16 of the revised manuscript) that states the domain organization is conserved in FtsK proteins from different bacteria. This paragraph includes information regarding the % sequence identity of the C-terminus and the N-terminus of chlamydial FtsK when compared to <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsK.</p>

<p>(8) For Supplementary Figure S1B-C. The authors should show the full blots rather than just the single band of the protein of interest to show that the antibodies are specific.

<p>We have included the full blots in Supp. Fig. S1 of the revised manuscript. We do not see the need for including a loading control for these blots because we are not making arguments about the relative level of the proteins that were assayed.

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>I am not convinced that this paper shows that FtsK initiates the assembly of the divisome since the authors did not analyse the role and localization of all other chlamydial divisome components. Out of the ten homologues of divisome and elongasome components encoded by C. trachomatis genome, only five are investigated in this study. There is no explanation about how these five were chosen.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We state on pg. 16 of the revised manuscript that “Although we focused our study on a subset of the divisome and elongasome proteins that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> expresses (bolded in Fig. 6G), our results support our conclusion that chlamydial budding is dependent upon a hybrid divisome complex and that FtsK is required for the assembly of this hybrid divisome. At this time, we cannot rule out that other proteins act upstream of FtsK to initiate divisome assembly in this obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Results convincingly indicate that FtsK is an early divisome component, but proofs are lacking to indicate that it initiates the divisome formation. Indeed, the authors do not show how FtsK would be the first protein to selectively accumulate at a given location to initiate the divisome formation. For this reason, the model they propose at the end of their study is not backed by sufficient data, to my opinion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that our data does not show that FtsK initiates divisome assembly. The title of the manuscript has been modified to “FtsK is Critical for the Assembly of the Unique Divisome Complex of the FtsZ-less <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>” and the text throughout has been modified to indicate that FtsK is the first protein we assayed that associates with nascent divisomes at the base of dividing cells. We will soon be submitting another manuscript that details how FtsK is recruited to a specific site to initiate nascent divisome assembly, This work is too extensive to be included in this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There are also discrepancies in the number of cells analysed to quantify the localization of divisome components, ranging from 50 to 250 cells. The authors could better explain why there are such variations.</p>

<p>(1) Lines 113-118: do Ct cells increase in size as they get closer to starting division? If so, could a pseudo-time course (demograph) be done to bolster the evidence that the base foci formed mainly in predivisional cells and not newborn cells? This evidence might be more convincing than the data in Figures 1F and G.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Chlamydial cells in the population were heterogeneous in size at the timepoint we are studying. This observation is consistent with previous reports in the literature (Liechti et al.,2021). While we agree that a pseudo-time course could potentially bolster the evidence about when FtsK foci appear, we believe our current analysis sufficiently demonstrates that basal foci of FtsK appear prior to the appearance of new buds at the base of dividing cells.</p>

<p>(2) Figure 3E: It looks like MreC localization to foci doesn't strictly require MreB polymerization. Is this known for E. coli or other species?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To our knowledge, MreC assembly into a filament has not been shown to be dependent upon MreB in other bacteria.  In <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, MreC forms a helical structure that is not dependent upon MreB or MreB filament formation (Dye et al., 2005. PNAS; Divakaruni et al., 2005. PNAS).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 5E: why is nearly half of PBP2 and PBP3 still localized to foci at the membrane even after treatment with mecillinam? This suggests, as the authors mention, that mecillinam reduces the efficiency of localization to the divisome but does not eliminate it. Any ideas why?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>At this time, we do not know why inhibiting the catalytic activity of PBP2 with mecillinam does not fully prevent the association of PBP2 with the chlamydial divisome. We have included a statement in the Results (pg. 13 of the revised manuscript) that inhibiting the catalytic activity of PBP2 prevents it from efficiently associating with or maintaining its association with polarized divisome complexes.</p>

<p>(7) Do the authors have any evidence that FtsK foci are mobile like treadmilling FtsZ?</p>

<p>(8) FtsK foci here are reminiscent of mobile foci formed by the FtsK-like SpoIIIE at the Bacillus subtilis sporulation septum. This might be a good idea to mention in the Discussion. Is it possible that Ct FtsK is also involved in coordinating chromosome partitioning through the developing septum? (That is another reason why it would be useful to know if the translocase domain was dispensable for localization/activity).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are currently preparing another manuscript that documents the contribution of the various domains of FtsK to its localization profile and whether the division defect in <italic>ftsk</italic> knockdown cells can be suppressed by specific subdomains of FtsK. This manuscript not only will include these data, it will also include experiments that address how the site of polarized budding is defined. In the revised manuscript, we have included a description of how the domain organization of chlamydial FtsK is similar to <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsK (pg. 16 of revision). Chlamydial FtsK also has a similar domain organization as SpoIIIE from <italic>B. subtilis.</italic> The C-terminal catalytic domain of SpoIIIE is 45% identical to chlamydial FtsK. The N-terminus of SpoIIIE is predicted to encode 4 transmembrane spanning helices, like chlamydial FtsK. However, the N-terminus of SpoIIIE shares no sequence homology with the N-terminus of chlamydial FtsK.  We have not included the similar domain organization of SpoIIIE and chlamydial FtsK in the revised manuscript.</p>
