<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have impaired alveolar gas exchange due to alveolar simplification and dysmorphic pulmonary vasculature. Advances in clinical care have improved survival for infants with BPD, but the overall incidence of BPD remains unchanged because we lack specific therapies to prevent this disease. Recent work has suggested a role for increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) signaling and myofibroblast populations in BPD pathogenesis, but the functional significance of each remains unclear. Here, we utilize multiple murine models of alveolar simplification and comparative single-cell RNA sequencing to identify shared mechanisms that could contribute to BPD pathogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a profound loss of myofibroblasts in two models of BPD and identifies gene expression signatures of increased TGFβ signaling, cell cycle arrest, and impaired proliferation in myofibroblasts. Using pharmacologic and genetic approaches, we find no evidence that increased TGFβ signaling in the lung mesenchyme contributes to alveolar simplification. In contrast, this is likely a failed compensatory response, since none of our approaches to inhibit TGFb signaling protect mice from alveolar simplification due to hyperoxia while several make simplification worse. In contrast, we find that impaired myofibroblast proliferation is a central feature in several murine models of BPD, and we show that inhibiting myofibroblast proliferation is sufficient to cause pathologic alveolar simplification. Our results underscore the importance of impaired myofibroblast proliferation as a central feature of alveolar simplification and suggest that efforts to reverse this process could have therapeutic value in BPD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During the alveolar phase of lung development, alveolar walls protrude from secondary crests into the lumen of existing airways and form new alveoli to increase the lung’s surface area for gas exchange <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Many premature infants are born prior to the onset of alveologenesis and develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of prematurity caused by developmental arrest of secondary alveolar septation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Over 50 years ago, Northway and colleagues described BPD as a heterogeneous pattern of severe lung injury with pathologic findings of severe inflammation, airway dysplasia, and fibrosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Despite advances in neonatal care, the incidence of BPD remains unchanged as 30% of infants born before 30 weeks of gestation will develop BPD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. More infants are now surviving at earlier gestational ages, and the lungs of these infants have a “new” BPD phenotype characterized by a homogenous process of alveolar simplification, dysmorphic pulmonary vasculature, and mild airway thickening and fibrosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. BPD is defined clinically by the need for prolonged respiratory support and supplemental oxygen, and infants with BPD suffer from long-term morbidity including severe respiratory infections, reactive airway disease, pulmonary hypertension, and neurodevelopmental impairment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The inflammatory response plays a significant role in BPD pathogenesis and results from a combination of perinatal infection, oxygen toxicity, and barotrauma from mechanical ventilation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Several recent studies have suggested a role for the pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) in BPD pathogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Infants with BPD have increased TGFβ in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Experimentally, murine models of BPD show increased TGFβ signaling and activation of downstream fibrotic pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. At the same time, TGFβ plays an important role in normal development, and complete loss of TGFβ signaling impairs either embryonic lung development or alveolar septation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. TGFβ is a known regulator of myofibroblasts in fibrotic disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, but it also drives mesenchymal cells to commit towards the myofibroblast lineage during embryonic lung development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Despite its essential role in normal lung development, the functional significance of increased TGFβ signaling in BPD pathogenesis remains unclear.</p>
<p>Alveolar myofibroblasts are contractile mesenchymal cells that are critical for alveolar septation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. They are characterized by the expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and the production of elastin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Myofibroblasts are derived from PDGFRα+ mesenchymal cells at birth and peak during alveologenesis when they colocalize with secondary septae <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Ablation of PDGFRα+ cells in neonatal mice causes alveolar simplification, while neonatal hyperoxia treatment causes loss of PDGFRα+ fibroblasts, dysregulated alveolar elastin deposition, and impaired PDGFRα+ cell contractility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Inhibition of myofibroblast contraction has been shown to lead to alveolar simplification <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. These studies support a fundamental functional role for myofibroblasts during alveologenesis, but whether the number of myofibroblasts is reduced in BPD or experimental models of BPD remains controversial <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To identify conserved mechanism of injury in BPD pathogenesis, we implemented a novel strategy to compare two murine models of alveolar simplification by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq): neonatal hyperoxia exposure and loss of epithelial TGFβ signaling. Using flow cytometry and sequencing, we observed a dramatic reduction of myofibroblasts in both models of disease. Additionally, we found that increased TGFβ signaling, decreased PDGFRα signaling, and impaired proliferation are hallmark features of injured myofibroblasts during alveologenesis. Blocking TGFβ through several different approaches consistently worsened hyperoxia-induced disease, suggesting TGFβ plays an essential homeostatic function in both normal alveolar development and hyperoxia-induced disease, but that increased TGFb signaling does not seem to be an important driver of alveolar simplification. We also demonstrated that PDGFRα+ cells undergo robust proliferation during normal alveologenesis, but this proliferation is impaired in both hyperoxia-treated and TGFβ-manipulated mice. We showed that modulation of PDGFRα+ cell proliferation is sufficient to cause alveolar simplification, even in the absence of inflammation or hyperoxic injury. These studies demonstrate that PDGFRα+ cells are profoundly sensitive to injury during alveologenesis, they require TGFβ signaling, and their proliferation is essential for normal alveolar development.</p>

<title>Neonatal Hyperoxia Exposure and Loss of Epithelial TGFβ Signaling Both Cause Alveolar Simplification</title>
<p>To identify conserved features of lung injury in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), we compared two different mouse models of lung injury known to cause alveolar simplification in mice. We first implemented the hyperoxia-induced model of BPD in which newborn mice are exposed to 75% oxygen from postnatal day (P) 0-10 and then recovered in room air until analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This model takes advantage of the fact that mice are born during the saccular phase of lung development and undergo alveolarization from postnatal day P4 – P39 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. We harvested lungs to analyze alveolar architecture after completion of alveolarization at P40. Hyperoxia-treated mice showed significant alveolar airspace enlargement compared to controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistent with findings from other groups using similar protocols <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, we did not see evidence of fibrosis, scarring or inflammation. In parallel, we used the flexiVent rodent ventilator to measure respiratory mechanics. Hyperoxia-treated mice had increased total lung capacity, increased compliance, and decreased elastance compared to control mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). These findings are consistent with those of emphysematous lungs, and these physiologic changes align with the enlarged, simplified alveolar structures observed by histology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>For our second model of alveolar simplification, we generated mice which lack the critical TGFβ receptor TGFBR2 in lung epithelium by crossing Nkx2.1-cre to the <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> conditional allele (Tgfbr2<sup>F/F</sup>;Nkx2.1-cre). These mice are viable at birth, have no respiratory distress, gain normal weight, and generate expected ratios of offspring with respect to each genotype (data not shown). Lungs from conditional knockout (cKO) mice show enlarged airspaces consistent with alveolar simplification, confirming earlier reports that TGFβ signaling in lung epithelium is required for normal secondary septation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We then used the flexiVent system to analyze respiratory mechanics in cKO mice and observed increased compliance and decreased elastance comparable to what we saw in hyperoxia-exposed mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Previous work demonstrated that Tgfbr2<sup>F/F</sup>;Nkx2.1-cre mice are protected from lung disease caused by transgenic overexpression of TGFβ1 or neonatal hyperoxia treatment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. To our surprise, Tgfbr2<sup>F/F</sup>;Nkx2.1-cre mice were not protected from disease in our model of neonatal hyperoxia, but rather developed worse disease. These data suggest TGFβ signaling to the lung epithelium is required for both normal alveologenesis and that it plays a protective role in the response to hyperoxia-induced injury.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Profound Loss of PDGFRα+ Fibroblasts During Hyperoxia Treatment</title>
<p>To begin exploring the mechanisms underlying alveolar simplification in these models, we treated wildtype mice with hyperoxia from P0-P10 and analyzed dissociated lung cells by flow cytometry at P10. While we observed changes in many cell types of the lung with hyperoxia treatment, the most striking result was the profound loss of PDGFRα+ fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>). Using flow cytometry, we found that both the percentage and absolute number of PDGFRα+ fibroblasts were substantially reduced with hyperoxia treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Next, we analyzed Tgfbr2<sup>F/F</sup>;Nkx2.1-cre mice at P10 in normoxia and observed a similar phenotype of reduced PDGFRα+ fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref>). While the magnitude of reduction was less impressive than we observed in the hyperoxia model, the most significant change in cell numbers in Tgfbr2<sup>F/F</sup>;Nkx2.1-cre mice was the reduction in PDGFRα+ fibroblasts. Together, these results are consistent with earlier studies which showed a loss of PDGFRα+ cells with neonatal hyperoxia treatment and reinforce the critical role of PDGFRα+ fibroblasts in normal alveolar development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>scRNA-seq Reveals Loss of Myofibroblasts in Both Models of Alveolar Simplification</title>
<p>To identify conserved molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying pathologic alveolar simplification, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on lungs from Tgfbr2<sup>F/F</sup> (CTRL) and Tgfbr2<sup>F/F</sup>;Nkx2.1-cre (cKO) mice in either normoxia or hyperoxia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). This approach allowed for simultaneous comparison of both injury models: normoxia versus hyperoxia in CTRL mice, and CTRL versus cKO mice in normoxia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Given the reduction of PDGFRα+ fibroblasts observed by flow cytometry in both models of lung injury, we hypothesized that changes in the lung mesenchyme might play a substantial role in the pathogenesis of alveolar simplification. To ensure sufficient mesenchymal cells in our analysis, we used flow cytometric sorting to enrich for mesenchymal and epithelial cells by limiting the input of hematopoietic and endothelial cells. After processing and combining all samples, we identified 24 clusters from 26,610 cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A-C</xref>). We focused our analysis on the lung mesenchyme and assigned identities to 7 distinct clusters by referencing previously published scRNA-seq studies of the developing lung (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1D</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Although flow cytometry had already shown a profound loss of PDGFRα+ cells in these two injury models, we could not attribute this loss to a specific fibroblast subset. Our single cell data enabled higher resolution assessment of the dynamics of fibroblast subsets (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). In particular, we observed a significant loss of alveolar and ductal myofibroblast clusters in both models of injury (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-E</xref>), suggesting that the reduction of PDGFRα+ cells by flow cytometry was due to the loss of alveolar and ductal myofibroblasts. To externally validate these findings, we re-analyzed two recently published scRNA-seq studies in which mice were treated with 85% oxygen from P0-P14 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Consistent with our own data, hyperoxia-treated mice in both studies showed a significant loss of myofibroblasts within the lung mesenchyme (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms driving the loss of myofibroblasts, we used Qiagen Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to compare differential gene expression in the myofibroblasts in both models of injury <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. After filtering for upregulated pathways, we identified 32 predicted upstream regulators that were shared in both models (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Of these pathways, we noted several predictions corresponding to TGFβ signaling, inhibitors of cell cycle, and Wnt signaling. These results are notable because TGFβ is a known driver of myofibroblast differentiation and profibrotic programs in fibroblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, while its overall contribution to alveolar simplification and BPD is unclear <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. The prediction of increased cell cycle inhibition is also of interest because it suggests that the reduction of myofibroblasts in these models might be caused by their impaired proliferation.</p>
<p>We used the NicheNet software package to gain insight into the specific cell-cell interactions which might be impacting the myofibroblasts in these two models of lung injury <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. We reasoned that epithelial-myofibroblast signals would be particularly important, since the defect in the cKO model is restricted to epithelial cells, yet the most prominent phenotype is found in myofibroblasts. To explore this further, we used NicheNet to identify shared patterns of changes in ligand-receptor signaling originating from the lung epithelium to the myofibroblasts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Here we again noted an increase in TGFβ signaling to the myofibroblasts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Of the decreased pathways, the most notable were Pdgfa-Pdgfra and Shh-Hhip, both of which are known to be critical for myofibroblast differentiation and function (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Additionally, the predicted reduction of Pdgfra signaling aligns with our flow cytometry data showing a loss of PDGFRα+ fibroblasts in both injury models as well as a reduction in the mean fluorescence intensity of PDGFRα antibody staining in these cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-D</xref>). Together, these data suggest that epithelial dysfunction may cause myofibroblast defects through loss of supportive signals and gain of inhibitory signals.</p>

<title>TGFβ Signaling Plays Homeostatic Role in Normal Alveolar Development and in Hyperoxia</title>
<p>Both IPA and NicheNet analyses predicted that TGFβ signaling is activated in myofibroblasts in both models of alveolar simplification (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Given the conflicting literature regarding the role of TGFβ in normal lung development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, we sought to determine the functional significance of TGFβ signaling during postnatal alveologenesis in both normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. We hypothesized that if excessive TGFβ signaling is a pathologic response in hyperoxia, titration of a pan-TGFβ-blocking antibody (1D11) could identify a therapeutic window to protect from disease while permitting normal development under normoxic conditions. Alternatively, worsened disease with 1D11 treatment would suggest that increased TGFβ is a compensatory response to injury rather than a primary driver of disease in the hyperoxia model. To test these hypotheses, we injected wildtype mice with 0, 10, 20 or 30 mg/kg of 1D11 from P2-P10 in either normoxia or hyperoxia and then harvested at P40 for analysis by histology (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). To our surprise, we found that while only the highest dose of 1D11 treatment caused alveolar simplification in normoxia, all doses of 1D11 treatment caused worse alveolar simplification in hyperoxia compared to PBS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Consistent with these histology results, lung physiology studies of 1D11-treated mice showed a pattern of emphysematous changes with increased compliance and decreased elastance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). These changes are similar to what we previously observed in hyperoxia-treated mice and in Tgfbr2<sup>F/F</sup>;Nkx2.1-cre mice and complement the histologic findings of alveolar simplification in 1D11-treated mice. Together, these results support the alternative hypothesis that TGFβ signaling plays a homeostatic role in both normal alveolar development and in hyperoxia.</p>

<p>Because 1D11 antibody treatment is systemic, we were unable to attribute the results of these studies to a specific cell type within the lung. Our current study, consistent with earlier reports, demonstrates that TGFβ signaling to the epithelium is required for normal alveolar development as well as an adaptive response to hyperoxia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. To interrogate the role of TGFβ signaling to the lung mesenchyme, we sought to cross Tgfbr2<sup>F/F</sup> mice to either the Pdgfra<sup>CreER</sup> or Gli1<sup>CreER</sup> allele to target <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> in myofibroblasts and mesenchymal cells during alveologenesis. While Pdgfra<sup>CreER</sup> has been used to specifically target PDGFRα+ cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, many studies have also used the broader Gli1<sup>CreER</sup> to target myofibroblasts during alveolar lung development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Because the Pdgfra<sup>CreER</sup> and Gli1<sup>CreER</sup> alleles were generated using a knock-in/knock-out approach, mice carrying the CreER allele are haploinsufficient for <italic>Pdgfra</italic> or <italic>Gli1</italic>, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. We conducted hyperoxia studies in each of these two lines and found that the Gli1<sup>CreER</sup> allele alone does not disrupt alveolar development in either normoxia or with hyperoxia treatment (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A-B</xref>). In contrast, mice with the Pdgfra<sup>CreER</sup> allele undergo normal development in normoxia, but they develop worse alveolar simplification with hyperoxia treatment compared to their cre-negative littermates (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A-B</xref>). These data support use of the Gli1<sup>CreER</sup> allele to target the lung mesenchyme in either normoxia or hyperoxia while limiting the use of Pdgfra<sup>CreER</sup> mice (and other <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-haploinsufficient alleles) to normoxic conditions.</p>
<p>Based on these validation studies, we generated Tgfbr2<sup>F/F</sup>;Gli1<sup>CreER/+</sup> mice to study the effects of TGFβ signaling to the lung mesenchyme. Interestingly, we observed a similar pattern of lung disease as 1D11 treatment when deleting <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> in the lung mesenchyme: Tgfbr2<sup>F/F</sup>;Gli1<sup>CreER/+</sup> mice developed alveolar simplification in normoxia when compared to littermate controls, and they developed worse disease than their littermates with hyperoxia exposure (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A-B</xref>). Together, these results show that TGFβ signaling is required to both the lung epithelium and mesenchyme for normal development, that it plays a homeostatic role in response to neonatal hyperoxia treatment, and that all our efforts to inhibit TGFb made hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification worse.</p>
<p>To address mechanisms of TGFβ activation in normal alveolar development and in the hyperoxia model of alveolar simplification, we generated Itgb6<sup>F/F</sup> mice and crossed them to the Nkx2.1-cre allele. The αvβ6 integrin is expressed predominantly in epithelial tissues, activates TGFβ <italic>in vivo</italic>, and has been shown to be a critical mediator of lung injury in models of acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Itgb6<sup>F/F</sup>;Nkx2.1-cre mice lack αvβ6 on lung epithelial cells and undergo normal alveolar development, but to our surprise, show no difference in disease severity with hyperoxia treatment (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C-D</xref>). Within the mesenchyme, αvβ1 and αvβ8 have been shown to activate TGFβ <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>, so we next deleted all αv-integrins in the lung mesenchyme by crossing Itgav<sup>F/F</sup> mice to the Gli1<sup>CreER</sup> allele. These mice develop spontaneous alveolar simplification in normoxic conditions, have lung physiology parameters consistent with an emphysematous phenotype, and develop worse lung disease with hyperoxia exposure (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-C</xref>). These data suggest that αvβ6 does not play a role in TGFβ activation during normal development or neonatal hyperoxia, while αv-integrins in the lung mesenchyme are required for normal development and play a protective role in response to hyperoxia.</p>

<title>Impaired Proliferation of PDGFRα+ Fibroblasts with Hyperoxia Treatment</title>
<p>Flow cytometry and scRNA-seq both showed a reduction of PDGFRα+ fibroblasts in hyperoxia-treated mice, which suggests these cells are exquisitely sensitive to injury. To address whether this might be due to impaired proliferation as suggested by IPA analysis, we exposed wildtype mice to hyperoxia and treated them with the nucleoside analogue 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) to identify proliferating cells. We found a decrease of PDGFRα+ cells in hyperoxia-treated mice by P8 both by percentage and by absolute number (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-C</xref>), which persisted to P10 and continued even with 4 days of normoxic recovery. Using EdU analysis, we found hyperoxia caused a proliferative defect in PDGFRα+ cells as early as P4, preceding the decrease in cell number. This early impairment of proliferation by PDGFRα+ cells was the most striking change observed across all subsets in our EdU analysis, and suggests that a proliferative defect contributes to the decreased cell number.</p>

<title>Impaired Proliferation of PDGFRα+ Fibroblasts Is Sufficient to Cause Alveolar Simplification</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using a combination of flow cytometry, lung physiology, and scRNA-seq, we identified several core features of lung injury that are conserved across multiple mouse models of alveolar simplification. We first compared neonatal hyperoxia exposure (75% hyperoxia P0-P10) to the loss of epithelial TGFβ signaling (Tgfbr2<sup>F/F</sup>;Nkx2.1-cre). Flow cytometric analysis of both models showed a significant reduction of PDGFRα+ cells, while scRNA-seq studies attributed these changes to a loss of alveolar and ductal myofibroblasts. Qiagen IPA and NicheNet ligand-receptor analyses identified several pathways that were upregulated in injured myofibroblasts in both models: increased TGFβ signaling, enrichment of inhibitors of cell cycle, and decreased Pdgfa-Pdgfra signaling. Using a combination of pharmacologic and genetic approaches, we demonstrated that increased TGFβ signaling in the mesenchyme does not seem to be a driver of alveolar simplification, but rather that TGFb signaling is critical for both normal alveolar development and for protecting against impaired alveolar development in response to hyperoxia. In contrast, we show that PDGFRα+ cell proliferation is reduced in multiple models of alveolar simplification, and that this impaired proliferation on its own is sufficient to cause alveolar simplification.</p>
<p>Several recent studies have identified lung mesenchymal cells as critical mediators of alveologenesis. Li <italic>et al.</italic> established the requirement of myofibroblasts during postnatal development by specifically ablating PDGFRα+ cells at the onset of alveologenesis and showing that these mice developed alveolar simplification <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Other work has identified essential functions of myofibroblasts during alveolar development, including contractility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and mitochondrial energetics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Ricetti <italic>et al</italic> used bulk RNA sequencing to show a skewing from myofibroblast to matrix fibroblast phenotypes after hyperoxia exposure along with reduced Ki-67 uptake and contractility in myofibroblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Our current study builds on this existing body of work by characterizing significant changes in PDGFRα+ cell number in several models of developmental lung injury. By flow cytometry, we found reduction in the number of PDGFRα+ cells in hyperoxia-treated mice and in Tgfbr2<sup>F/F</sup>;Nkx2.1-cre mice during the early phase of alveologenesis. Using scRNA-seq, we attributed this reduction to the alveolar and ductal myofibroblast populations. Importantly, we identified myofibroblast proliferation as a critical feature of normal alveolar development and validated this observation in several experimental models.</p>
<p>NicheNet analysis of our scRNA-seq data predicted decreased Pdgfa-Pdgfra signaling from the epithelium to the myofibroblasts in both hyperoxia-treated and Tgfbr2<sup>F/F</sup>;Nkx2.1-cre mice. This observation is interesting because several studies have focused on the requirement of Pdgfa-Pdgfra interactions for myofibroblast identity and function. Deletion of <italic>Pdgfra</italic> in mesenchymal populations of the neonatal lung has been shown to disrupt alveologenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Other studies have found lower <italic>Pdgfra</italic> expression in lung samples from BPD patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. In our current study we use flow cytometry to show a loss of PDGFRα+ cells in multiple models of alveolar simplification: hyperoxia-treated mice, Tgfbr2<sup>F/F</sup>;Nkx2.1-cre mice, 1D11-treated mice, and Ect2<sup>F/F</sup>;Pdgfra<sup>CreER/+</sup> mice. In addition to the loss of PDGFRα+ cells, we also observed decreased <italic>Pdgfra</italic> expression within the remaining PDGFRα+ cells (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref>). Given that EdU uptake is also reduced amongst the remaining PDGFRα+ cells these results suggest Pdgfa-Pdgfra signaling might regulate myofibroblast proliferation in addition to their identity and function during neonatal lung development.</p>
<p>As part of our current studies, we conducted control experiments with the Gli1<sup>CreER</sup> and Pdgfra<sup>CreER</sup> alleles and discovered results with broad implications for others utilizing similar genetic tools for their work. Both alleles were generated using a knock-in/knock-out gene targeting approach which disrupts the native expression of <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Pdgfra</italic>, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Because Hedgehog and Pdgfa-Pdgfra signaling pathways are important for lung development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, we sought to validate the effects of haploinsufficiency of <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Pdgfra</italic> when using these alleles. Both Gli1<sup>CreER/+</sup> and Pdgfra<sup>CreER/+</sup> mice underwent normal alveolar development in normoxic conditions when compared to cre-negative littermates. In contrast, Pdgfra<sup>CreER/+</sup> mice developed worse alveolar simplification after hyperoxia treatment compared to their cre-negative littermates (Pdgfra<sup>+/+</sup>). The Gli1<sup>CreER</sup> results suggest this allele can be used for conditional knockout studies in either normoxic or hyperoxic conditions with little impact from <italic>Gli1</italic> haploinsufficiency. The Pdgfra<sup>CreER</sup> results, however, should serve as a caution to researchers utilizing genetic tools with <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-haploinsufficiency.</p>
<p>Recent work has established an essential role for TGFβ signaling in normal alveolar development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, but the functional role of TGFβ in models of BPD and alveolar simplification remains unclear. Our scRNA-seq data showed increased TGFβ signaling in myofibroblasts in two injury models, so we hypothesized that excess TGFβ signaling might be a driver of disease pathogenesis. To determine the functional significance of TGFβ in the hyperoxia model, we treated mice with the pan-TGFβ-blocking antibody 1D11. Because TGFβ is required for normal alveologenesis, we hypothesized a dose titration approach might identify a “sweet spot” to neutralize an excess of TGFβ in hyperoxia while preserving normal development in normoxia. Instead, we found that every dose of 1D11 treatment worsened hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification while only the highest dose caused disease in normoxia. While the 1D11-normoxia results confirm an essential role for TGFβ in normal alveolar development, the 1D11-hyperoxia results suggest TGFβ plays a homeostatic function rather than a pathologic role in the hyperoxia model of injury. Because 1D11 treatment neutralizes TGFβ ligands systemically, we used Nkx2.1-cre and Gli1<sup>CreER/+</sup> alleles to conditionally delete <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> in the lung epithelium and mesenchyme, respectively. Confirming earlier reports, we found that disrupting TGFβ signaling to either of these populations causes alveolar simplification <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Of significance, however, both Tgfbr2<sup>F/F</sup>;Nkx2.1-cre and Tgfbr2<sup>F/F</sup>;Gli1<sup>CreER/+</sup> mice developed worse disease with neonatal hyperoxia treatment. Taken together with our 1D11-hyperoxia experiments, we conclude that TGFβ signaling to both the lung epithelium and mesenchyme is required for normal alveolar development and is protective rather than pathologic in hyperoxia-perturbed alveolar development.</p>
<p>Little is known about mechanisms of TGFβ activation in alveolar development and neonatal lung injury. TGFβ ligands are secreted as latent, inactive complexes that are anchored to the cell surface or the extracellular matrix <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. These complexes prevent TGFβ from engaging its receptors, and therefore TGFβ activation is tightly regulated in tissues despite the high levels of latent TGFβ complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Integrins are cell-surface proteins that regulate interactions in the extracellular matrix, and several studies by our group have demonstrated that the epithelial integrin αvβ6 is critical for TGFβ activation in models of acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. However, TGFβ activation by αvβ6 does not play a role in alveolar development in either normoxia or hyperoxia. We then deleted αv-integrins in the lung mesenchyme since αvβ1 and αvβ8 are the only other integrins known to activate TGFβ <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Interestingly, deletion of αv-integrins under normoxic conditions only produced a modest degree of alveolar simplification but clearly led to more severe alveolar simplification after hyperoxia.</p>
<p>We originally hypothesized that increased TGFβ signaling was a pathologic response to neonatal hyperoxia treatment and that targeting the TGFβ pathway might protect from disease pathogenesis. While our results disproved this hypothesis, they also seem at odds with published data where blocking TGFβ signaling was beneficial in various lung injury models. For example, it was unexpected that Tgfbr2<sup>F/F</sup>;Nkx2.1-cre mice develop worse lung injury in our hyperoxia-induced model of BPD because earlier work showed these same mice to be protected from hyperoxia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We suspect this difference in outcome can be explained by the more aggressive models of lung injury used by this earlier study. Specifically, these authors used either transgenic overexpression of TGFβ or 100% hyperoxia exposure which both resulted in neonatal mortality and severe inflammation, neither of which are observed in our model of 75% hyperoxia. Additionally, many earlier studies focused on TGFβ activation in hyperoxia-induced BPD utilized chronic 85% hyperoxia such as P0-P14 or P0-P28, both of which result in inflammation and fibrosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Similarly, one earlier study used transgenic expression of Il-1b in the developing airways to produce a BPD-like phenotype due to inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. Deletion of <italic>Itgb6</italic>, and therefore loss of epithelial αvβ6 integrins, conferred partial protection from disease in this injury model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. A common theme across these earlier studies implicating TGFβ in pathology is that they utilized aggressive models of lung injury which caused severe inflammation, fibrosis, and neonatal mortality, all of which recapitulate the histopathologic features of “old BPD” in the clinical setting. In contrast, the hyperoxia model used in our current study more closely represents the “new BPD” phenotype of emphysematous changes with simplified alveolar structures in the absence of lung scarring and fibrosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Collectively, these data suggests that while inhibition of TGFβ may have some protective role in severe injury models associated with significant fibrosis, the major functions of TGFβ signaling during normal alveolar development and in response to moderate hyperoxia are homeostatic and protective.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to our current study. We used flow cytometry to phenotype population-level changes across several models of neonatal lung injury. While flow cytometry is a powerful tool to quantify population subsets and sort cells for scRNA-seq, it requires tissue digestion and generation of single-cell suspensions for downstream analysis. The cells which survive these protocols may represent a skewed population and may not be completely representative of <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. For example, many fragile and dying/apoptotic cells do not survive this processing and would be excluded from analysis. Another drawback to flow cytometry is that our ability to define population subsets is limited by the knowledge and feasibility of using cell-surface markers to faithfully distinguish cell types within each population. Recent work by our group has identified cell-surface markers to characterize fibroblast subsets in the adult lung by flow cytometry, but we are unaware of similar protocols to address fibroblast heterogeneity in the neonatal lung <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. We used scRNA-seq to characterize cell subsets within the lung mesenchyme, but the identification and validation of cell-surface proteins suitable for flow cytometric analysis of these same populations is beyond the scope of this current study. Our scRNA-seq data, together with emerging scRNA-seq from multiple other laboratories should provide a rich dataset for others to identify cell surface markers that allow more precise analysis and sorting of distinct mesenchymal populations in the developing lung.</p>
<p>In summary, our current work highlights the essential role of myofibroblast proliferation and TGFβ signaling in normal alveologenesis. We show that myofibroblasts are depleted during neonatal lung injury and that their loss is at least partially due to impaired proliferation and expansion during this critical window of development. We confirm the results of others in the field who have observed increased TGFβ signatures in the hyperoxia-injured neonatal lung that generated hope for targeting this pathway as a therapeutic intervention for BPD. However, after conducting exhaustive studies targeting TGFβ ligands, receptors and activating integrins, we conclude that increased TGFβ signaling in myofibroblasts more likely represents a failed compensatory mechanism rather than a central driver of disease pathogenesis. Finally, our sequencing data should provide useful insights to the broader community studying alveolar development and neonatal lung injury. Although our current work focuses on a few of the genes and pathways highlighted by these data, we are optimistic that others will utilize this dataset to expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving both normal and aberrant alveolar development.</p>

<p>Twenty-three clusters were initially identified from a total of 27,839 cells using Seurat’s <italic>FindNeighbors</italic> and <italic>FindClusters</italic> functions with resolution = 0.3.

Cluster 9 (729 cells) was identified as a contaminant and excluded from further analysis due to cells showing up in multiple locations across the UMAP embedding. While re-clustering and annotating epithelial, hematopoietic, and endothelial subpopulations we identified an additional 500 cells that clustered independently from known cell types within each subcluster, had less than 1000 detected genes, and were enriched for the expression of multiple canonical cell types, suggesting these cells were also contaminants.

To identify shared predicted upstream regulators, lists were filtered for z-score &gt;1.5 (upregulated) or z-score &lt;-1.5 (downregulated), and the filtered results were compared by Venn diagram between the two comparisons.</p>
<p>NicheNet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> was used to compare signaling between conditions, as described in the “Differential NicheNet analysis between conditions of interest” vignette on the GitHub repository. Standard NicheNet statistical thresholds described in the vignette were used in the analysis. Alveolar epithelial subtypes (AT2, AT2 Lyz1, AT2 Activated, AT1/AT2, and Prolif. AT2) were used as a combined sender cell population, and alveolar and ductal myofibroblasts were used as combined receiver cell populations. Differential signaling from sender-to-receiver cells was compared across two conditions, CTRL RA vs CTRL O2 and CTRL RA vs cKO RA, and the results were examined for pathways present in both comparisons.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors used both the commonly used neonatal hyperoxia model as well as cell-type-specific genetic inactivation of Tgfbr2 models to study the basis of BPD. The bulk of the analyses focus on the mesenchymal cells. Results indicate impaired myofibroblast proliferation, resulting in decreased cell number. InactzXivation of Etc2 in Pdgfra-lineaged cells, preventing cytokinesis of myofibroblasts, led to alveolar simplification. Together, the findings demonstrate that disrupted myofibroblast proliferation is a key contributor to BPD pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this comprehensive study of BPD models advances our understanding of the disease. The data are of high quality.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The critiques are mostly minor and can be addressed without extensive experimentation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors systematically explore the mechanism(s) of impaired postnatal lung development with relevance to BPD (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) in two murine models of 'alveolar simplification', namely hyperoxia and epithelial loss of TGFb signaling. The work presented here is of great importance, given the limited treatment options for a clinical entity frequently encountered in newborns with high morbidity and mortality that is still poorly understood, and the unclear role of TGFb signaling, its signaling levels, and its cellular effects during secondary alveolar septum formation, a lung structure generating event heavily impacted by BPD. The authors show that hyperoxia and epithelial TGFb signaling loss have similar detrimental effects on lung structure and mechanical properties (emphysema-like phenotype) and are associated with significantly decreased numbers of PDGFRa-expressing cells, the major cell pool responsible for generation of postnatal myofibroblasts. They then use a single-cell transcriptomic approach combined with pathway enrichment analysis for both models to elucidate common factors that affect alveologenesis. Using cell communication analysis (NicheNet) between epithelial and myofibroblasts they confirm increased projected TGFb-TGFbR interactions and decreased projected interactions for PDGFA-PDGFRA, and other key pathways, such as SHH and WNT. Based on these results they go on to uncover in a sequela of experiments that surprisingly, increased TGFb appears reactive to postnatal lung injury and rather protective/homeostatic in nature, and the authors establish the requirement for alpha V integrins, but not the subtype alphaVbeta6, a known activator of TGFb signaling and implied in adult lung fibrosis. The authors then go beyond the TGFb axis evaluation to show that mere inhibition of proliferation by conditional KO of Ect2 in Pdgfra lineage results in alveolar simplification, pointing out the pivotal role of PDGFRa-expressing myofibroblasts for normal postnatal lung development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The approach including both pharmacologic and mechanistically-relevant transgenic interventions both of which produced consistent results provides robustness of the results presented here.</p>
<p>(2) Further adding to this robustness is the use of moderate levels of hyperoxia at 75% FiO2, which is less extreme than 100% FiO2 frequently used by others in the field, and therefore favors the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>(3) The prudent use of advanced single-cell analysis tools, such as NicheNet to establish cell interactions through the pathways they tested and the validation of their scRNA-seq results by analysis of two external datasets. Delineation of the complexity of signals between different cell types during normal and perturbed lung development, such as attempted successfully in this study, will yield further insights into the underlying mechanism(s).</p>
<p>(4) The combined readout of lung morphometric (MLI) and lung physiologic parameters generates a clinically meaningful readout of lung structure and function.</p>
<p>(5) The systematic evaluation of TGFb signaling better determines the role in normal and postnatally-injured lungs.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While the study convincingly establishes the effect of lung injury on the proliferation of PDGFRa-expressing cells, differentiation is equally important. Characterization of PDGFRa expressing cells and tracking the changes in the injury models in the scRNA analysis, a key feature of this study, would benefit from expansion in this regard. PDGFRa lineage gives rise to several key fibroblast populations, including myofibroblasts, lipofibroblasts, and matrix-type fibroblasts (Collagen13a1, Collagen14a1). Lipofibroblasts constitute a significant fraction of PDGFRa+ cells, and expand in response to hyperoxic injury, as shown by others. Collagen13a1-expressing fibroblasts expand significantly under both conditions (Figure 3), and appear to contain a significant number of PDGFRa-expressing cells (Suppl Fig.1). Effects of the applied injuries on known differentiation markers for these populations should be documented. Another important aspect would be to evaluate whether the protective/homeostatic effect of TGFb signaling is supporting the differentiation of myofibroblasts. Postnatal Gli1 lineage gains expression of PDGFRa and differentiation markers, such as Acta2 (SMA) and Eln (Tropoelastin). Loss of PDGFRa expression was shown to alter Elastin and TGFb pathway-related genes. TGFb signaling is tightly linked to the ECM via LTBPs, Fibrillins, and Fibulins. An additional analysis in the aforementioned regard has great potential to more specifically identify the cell type(s) affected by the loss of TGFb signaling and allow analysis of their specific transcriptomic changes in response and underlying mechanism(s) to postnatal injury.</p>
<p>(2) Of the three major lung abnormalities encountered in BPD, the authors focus on alveolarization impairment in great detail, to a very limited extent on inflammation, and not on vascularization impairment. However, this would be important not only to better capture the established pathohistologic abnormalities of BPD, but also it is needed since the authors alter TGFb signaling, and inflammatory and vascular phenotypes with developmental loss of TGFb signaling and its activators have been described. Since the authors make the point about the absence of inflammation in their BPD model, it will be important to show the evidence.</p>
<p>(3) Conceptually it would be important that in the discussion the authors reconcile their findings in the experimental BPD models in light of human BPD and the potential implications it might have on new ways to target key pathways and cell types for treatment. This allows the scientific community to formulate the next set of questions in a disease-relevant manner.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper seeks to understand the role of alveolar myofibroblasts in abnormal lung development after saccular stage injury.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Multiple models of neonatal injury are used, including hyperoxia and transgenic models that target alveolar myofibroblasts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are several weaknesses that leave the conclusions significantly undersupported by the data as presented:</p>
<p>(1) There is no validation of the decreased number of myofibroblasts suggested by flow cytometry/scRNAseq at the level of the tissue. Given that multiple groups have reported increased myofibroblasts (aSMA+ fibroblasts) in humans with BPD and in mouse models, demonstrating a departure from prior findings with tissue validation in the mouse models is essential. There are many reasons for decreased numbers of a subpopulation by flow cytometry, most notably that injured cells may be less likely to survive the cell sorting process.</p>
<p>(2) The hallmark genes used to define the subpopulations are not given in single-cell data. As the definition of fibroblast subtypes remains an area of unsettled discussion in the field, it is possible that the decreased number by classification and not a true difference. Tissue validation and more transparency in the methods used for single-cell sequencing would be critical here.</p>
<p>(3) There is an oversimplification of neonatal hyperoxia as a &quot;BPD model&quot; used here without a reference to detailed prior work demonstrating that the degree and duration of hyperoxia dramatically change the phenotype. For example, Morty et al have shown that hyperoxia of 85% or more x 14 days is required to demonstrate the septal thickening observed in severe human BPD. Other than one metric of lung morphometry (MLI), which is missing units on the y-axis and flexivent data, the authors have not fully characterized this model. Prior work comparing 75% O2 exposure for 5, 8, or 14 days shows that in the 8-day exposed group (similar to the model used here), much of the injury was reversible. What evidence do the authors have that hyperoxia alone is an accurate model of the permanent structural injury seen in human BPD?</p>
<p>(4) Thibeault et al published a single-cell analysis of neoantal hyperoxia in 2021, with seemingly contrasting findings. How does this dataset compare in context?</p>
