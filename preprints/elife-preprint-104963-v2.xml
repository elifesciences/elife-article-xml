<title>Abstract</title><p>Megakaryocytes, the progenitor cells of blood platelets, play a crucial role in hemostasis by residing in the bone marrow and ensuring continuous platelet production. Unlike other hematopoietic cells, megakaryocytes do not enter the blood circulation intact. They remain anchored within the bone marrow while extending cytoplasmic protrusions called proplatelets through the sinusoidal endothelial barrier. These proplatelets subsequently fragment into functional platelets. This unique process of intravasation facilitates efficient platelet production while maintaining the megakaryocyte cell body within the bone marrow niche, thus preventing potential thrombotic complications. How the extracellular matrix (ECM) influences the delicate balance between megakaryocyte retention and proplatelet extension remains largely unknown. Here, we investigate the spatial organization and functional role of ECM components in the megakaryocyte vascular niche. Our findings reveal that laminin and collagen IV form three-dimensional (3D) ECM cages encompassing megakaryocytes and anchor them to the sinusoidal basement membrane. Gene deletion shows the existence of laminin α4 in the ECM cage that is necessary to maintain megakaryocyte-sinusoid interactions. Notably, megakaryocytes actively contribute to the ECM cage assembly; β1/β3 integrin knockout weakens these structures, increasing intravasation and entire megakaryocyte entry into circulation. The retention of megakaryocytes by these 3D ECM cages depends on dynamic remodeling processes. Inhibition of ECM proteolysis results in denser cage formation, increasing the frequence of immature megakaryocytes with impaired demarcation membrane system (DMS) development. Thus, the ECM cage represents a novel concept of an active and dynamic 3D microenvironment that is continuously remodeled and essential for maintaining megakaryocyte perivascular positioning. This specific microarchitecture guides megakaryocyte maturation and intravasation, underscoring the critical role of ECM microarchitecture and dynamics in megakaryocyte function.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>Outlined below is an overview describing the 3 major points that have been considered to address the concern raised by the reviewer.
Point 1. Reviewer asked how integrins affect megakaryocyte interactions with their microenvironment. In the revised manuscript, we discuss the potential impact of reduced RhoA activation and integrin-mediated traction forces on DKO megakaryocytes.
The reviewer also suggested using transcriptomic analysis to study how integrins help megakaryocytes to shape their matrix. However, it is technically difficult to isolate enough native megakaryocytes from DKO mice and this would require many animals. Instead, we analysed mouse platelets using targeted RT-PCR arrays for key extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling and adhesion genes. However, we found no significant differences (over threefold) between the control and DKO groups.
Point 2. As recommended, we conducted functional studies to examine the link between the ECM cage and platelet production. As expected, Itgb1-/-/Itgb3-/- mice showed impaired integrin-mediated aggregation. In contrast, platelet function was unchanged in both MMP inhibitor-treated mice and Lamα4⁻/⁻ mice. These new findings have been included in the revised manuscript, along with a discussion on how changes in ECM composition may affect signaling pathways and megakaryocyte maturation, but do not abrogate platelet function.
We also propose that differences in the molecular composition of the ECM may allow some signaling pathways to stay active, which could explain the different platelet counts seen in integrin- and Lamα4-deficient mice.
Point 3. We have addressed concerns about overly strong statements by emphasizing the nuanced role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in megakaryocyte function and platelet production in the revised manuscript. In summary, we now highlight that - the ECM cage serves as a finely tuned facilitator that enhances the efficiency and precision of platelet production by directing megakaryocytes to the appropriate location at the right time - .</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Megakaryocytes, the precursors of blood platelets, differentiate from hematopoietic stem cells and mature in a complex bone marrow microenvironment. Megakaryocytes are large, highly polyploid cells that contain a complex invaginated network of membranes, known as the demarcation membrane system (DMS), which serves as a membrane reservoir for platelet production. In contrast to other hematopoietic cells, megakaryocytes exhibit a unique platelet production process. They do not enter the bloodstream intact. Instead, they remain anchored in the bone marrow and extend cytoplasmic protrusions called proplatelets through the sinusoidal endothelial barrier. These protrusions protrude into the lumen of bone marrow sinusoids, where they undergo fragmentation to release individual platelets into the circulation. This distinctive mechanism allows for the efficient production and release of platelets while maintaining the megakaryocyte cell body within the bone marrow microenvironment, thus reducing the risk of thrombotic complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Boscher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Stone et al., 2022</xref>). The remaining cell body, composed of a nucleus surrounded by a thin rim of cytoplasm, is ultimately phagocytosed in the stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Radley &amp; Haller, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>Megakaryocytes are strategically located at the interface between the bone marrow and the blood circulation, specifically at the parasinusoidal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lichtman et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Stegner et al., 2017</xref>). Intravasation, the coordinated passage of megakaryocyte fragments through the sinusoidal barrier, requires an original, complex, and dynamic adaptation of megakaryocytes to highly different microenvironments, both mechanically and biologically. They are positioned next to the endothelial lining and its underlying basement membrane, in equilibrium between the constrained 3D environment of the bone marrow and the fluid environment of the blood. In this context, they are in contact with two types of ECM organization: basement membrane and interstitial ECM.</p>
<p>Megakaryocytes actively influence their structural microenvironment through several ECM remodeling mechanisms, including the endocytosis of plasma proteins like fibrinogen, and the synthesis and release of extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as fibronectin laminin, and type IV collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbonante et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Handagama et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Malara et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, they produce ECM-modifying proteins, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), and lysyl oxidase (LOX), which facilitate the continuous renewal and regulation of the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eliades et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Malara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Villeneuve et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, we have recently discovered that megakaryocytes could remodel the substrate-bound fibronectin matrix into basal fibrillar structures surrounding the cells. The extent of fibrillogenesis depended on the stiffness of the substrate, and relied on both β1 and β3 integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Guinard et al., 2023</xref>). This intricate interplay between megakaryocytes and their surrounding ECM remodeling demonstrates the dynamic nature of the vascular niche and highlights its critical role in platelet production.</p>
<p>The ECM surrounding megakaryocytes plays a crucial role in their development and function. Numerous studies have identified essential components of this matrix, including collagen IV, fibronectin, fibrinogen, and laminin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Larson &amp; Watson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Malara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Semeniak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Susek et al., 2018</xref>). The presence and function of collagen I fibers remain a subject of ongoing debate, with some researchers proposing that they guide megakaryocyte proplatelets toward sinusoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Oprescu et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that while collagen I may inhibit proplatelet formation, other ECM components, like collagen IV, fibrinogen, and fibronectin, can facilitate this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Balduini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Malara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sabri et al., 2004</xref>). The diverse and sometimes contradictory roles of these ECM components in megakaryocyte behavior underscore the complexity of this research area and highlight the need for further investigation, particularly <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The present study provides new insight into the spatial organization of the ECM that envelops megakaryocytes, elucidating its specific architecture and molecular mechanisms governing its dynamics and function. We performed advanced 2D and 3D analyses of mouse bone marrow and identified a novel ECM cage containing laminin chains ϒ1 and α4, and collagen IV that anchored megakaryocytes to the sinusoidal basement membrane. Deleting laminin α4 impairs the connections between megakaryocytes and sinusoids. Megakaryocytes act actively in forming and maintaining this ECM cage, relying on their integrins β1 and β3. Indeed, deleting these integrins causes significant impairment of the cage’s integrity, resulting in increased intravasation of megakaryocytes and an unexpected release of intact megakaryocytes into the bloodstream. Moreover, <italic>in vivo</italic>, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) inhibition reveals that dynamic ECM remodeling is crucial for maintaining the cage structure and supporting megakaryocyte development. In conclusion, our study unveils a 3D ECM cage that physically stabilizes megakaryocytes within their vascular niche. This structure facilitates the physiological regulation of megakaryocyte maturation and intravasation at the bone marrow-bloodstream interface.</p>

<title>Laminin and collagen IV create a 3D cage around sinusoid-associated megakaryocytes</title>
<p>The organization of the ECM around megakaryocytes in the vascular niche is not well understood due to challenges in <italic>in vivo</italic> observation. To investigate this, we utilized immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy on ultrathin bone marrow cryosections (250 nm thickness). This approach offers superior axial resolution compared to traditional confocal microscopy, enabling high-resolution localization of ECM components. Megakaryocytes were visualized using antibodies against GPIbβ, while sinusoids were identified with antibodies against FABP4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Our findings revealed that laminin ϒ1 chains and collagen IV delineated the basement membrane underlying the endothelium of sinusoids and the outer contour of mature megakaryocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 1Aa</xref>). Adjacent cells exhibited granular staining for laminin ϒ1 and collagen IV, which may indicate a potential contribution to the ECM constitution (arrow in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 1Ag-h</xref>). Fibronectin was detected in the basement membrane and around megakaryocytes, while fibrinogen was more widespread, associated with the basement membrane, the megakaryocyte surface, and intracellular granules (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 1Ab-c</xref>). Von Willebrand factor (VWF) signal was restricted to the alpha granules of megakaryocytes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 1Ad</xref>). We observed no detectable signals for type I and III collagen around megakaryocytes or sinusoids despite using antibodies validated on positive controls (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 1Ae-f</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 1B-C</xref>).</p>

    <p>Having established the expression of laminin ϒ1, collagen IV, fibronectin, and fibrinogen in the direct megakaryocyte microenvironment, their spatial organization was next investigated using 3D imaging of whole-mount bone marrow preparations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Analysis of maximum Z-stack projections revealed that laminin ϒ1 and collagen IV formed a reticular 3D ECM cage completely enveloping megakaryocytes and extending radially from the sinusoidal basement membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-C</xref>). With this approach, the basement membrane-ECM cage connections were clearly visible when examining the full z-stack series. Examples are shown in movies 1 and 2 and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Suppl. Figures 1D-E</xref>. Quantification showed that almost all megakaryocytes near sinusoids (sMK, 92.8 ± 3.3 %) have a laminin cage, compared to only 11.4 ± 4.8 % of megakaryocytes in the parenchyma (pMK) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 1F-G</xref>). Parenchymal megakaryocytes (pMK), which represented only 18 ± 1.3 % of all megakaryocyte population (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 1H</xref>), were instead surrounded by a a sparse thin network of laminin ϒ1 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 1F</xref>). Althought we cannot exclude that ECM cage can be form on its own, our data suggests that ECM cage assembly may require interactions between megakaryocytes and the sinusoidal basement membrane. Parenchymal megakaryocytes (pMK), which represented only 18 ± 1.3 % of all megakaryocyte population (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 1H</xref>), were instead surrounded by a a sparse thin network of laminin ϒ1 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 1F</xref>). The ECM cage was present at all stages of megakaryocyte maturation, including megakaryocytes with proplatelet extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Suppl. Figures 1I-J</xref>). Remarkably, after mechanical dissociation and size exclusion, nearly half of the megakaryocytes successfully retained their cages (53.4 ± 5.6 %, 329 megakaryocytes counted from 3 mice), indicating strong physical attachments between both components (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). While fibronectin and fibrinogen are present around megakaryocytes and at the vessel-cell interface, they do not form a reticular ECM cage. Furthermore, no connection was found between fibronectin and fibrinogen deposition with the sinusoid basement membrane, in contrast to the findings for laminin and collagen IV (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 1K</xref>). These observations demonstrate that megakaryocytes establish precise and tight interactions with an ECM cage made of laminin ϒ1 and collagen IV in a spatially confined microenvironment at the sinusoidal basement membrane.</p>

<p>We next examined the ECM cage using an antibody against laminin γ1.

However, collagen IV organization remained unaltered around the megakaryocytes in these mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>, lower panels), showing that laminin α4 is not necessary for collagen IV cage formation. We also analyzed megakaryocyte localization in the bone marrow of Lamα4<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).

<title>Integrins maintain the structural properties of the ECM cages</title>
<p>Integrins play a crucial role in ECM remodeling. Megakaryocytes express β1 and β3 integrins as main ECM receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). To elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing the intricate interactions between megakaryocytes and the ECM cage, we investigate the subcellular localization of integrins on immunostained ultrathin bone marrow cryosections. Using conformation-independent antibodies, we showed the presence of β1 subunit at on the plasma membrane and on the DMS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Similar findings were obtained for total β3 integrins (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, the activated form of β1 integrin was expressed only at interaction sites with laminin γ1 and collagen IV, suggesting that activated β1 integrins mediate megakaryocyte interactions with the ECM cage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Activated β3 integrin involvement remains to be determined, as no specific signal was detected when testing two different antibodies (JonA-PE, Pac 1).</p>

    <p>To test if integrin-mediated signaling plays a role in the structural assembly of the ECM cage, a transgenic mouse model lacking β1 and β3 integrins in the megakaryocyte lineage was used (<italic>Itgb1<sup>-/-</sup>/Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup>) (</italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). <italic>Itgb1<sup>-/-</sup>/Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were generated crossing the two single loxP-flanked lines (β1<sup>fl/fl</sup> and β3<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice) with <italic>Pf4-Cre</italic> mice (expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the <italic>Pf4</italic> promoter). Our analysis revealed a 2.6-fold reduction in laminin γ1 deposition on the megakaryocyte surface in <italic>Itgb1<sup>-/-</sup>/Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to <italic>Pf4-Cre</italic> control mice. Furthermore, intensity profiles demonstrated that laminin γ1 forms a less dense network around the megakaryocytes in the double knockout mice, with significantly increased mesh sizes (10.6 ± 1.3 µm vs 6.3 ± 0.6 µm, respectively) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Notably, this lower ECM density surrounding megakaryocytes in <italic>Itgb1<sup>-/-</sup>/Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice is not linked to increased matrix degradation or reduced laminin synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Suppl. Figures 3B-C</xref>). As expected, the laminin γ1 network at the basement membrane remained unaffected in these mice, as the integrin deletion is restricted to megakaryocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Suppl.

    <p>Further confocal and immunoEM examination revealed a decrease in the expression of fibrillar fibronectin around <italic>Itgb1<sup>-/-</sup>/Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>megakaryocytes, along with mislocalization of fibrinogen in the extracellular space of the DMS instead of the granules (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl.

<title>Normal ECM organization is essential for proper megakaryocyte intravasation</title>
    <p>Next, we investigate the relevance of the ECM cage to platelet and megakaryocyte functions. Flow cytometry showed that <italic>Itgb1<sup>-/-</sup>/Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>platelets have intact α-granule secretion but impaired integrin-mediated aggregation, consistent with the bleeding phenotype observed in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Janus-Bell et al., 2024</xref>) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl.

However, consistent with previous reports, these mutant megakaryocytes have a disorganized membrane system and smaller cytoplasmic areas compared to normal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Suppl.

<p>To elucidate which of the two integrins was responsible for the observed phenotype, we employed single-knockout mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Analysis of the ECM cage revealed a trend towards decreased laminin ϒ1 density around <italic>Itgb1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> megakaryocytes, while no notable changes were observed around <italic>Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>cells. No statistically significant increase in intravasation events was observed in either single knock-out mouse model. This suggests a redundant role of both integrins in regulating the megakaryocyte ECM cage and the intravasation process, potentially compensating for each other’s role. Additionally, we investigate the role of GPVI, one of the two well-characterized collagen receptors in this process (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), and no alterations in ECM cage formation or intravasation behavior were noticed, which is in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Semeniak et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>To understand the unusual localization of circulating <italic>Itgb1<sup>-/-</sup>/Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>megakaryocytes in the bloodstream, we used intravital 2-photon microscopy imaging to describe the dynamic of the megakaryocyte behavior. We used the GPIX marker, a subunit of the GPIb-V-IX complex that is expressed on mature megakaryocytes, to track the behavior of megakaryocyte in living mice. Among the stabilized megakaryocytes at the parasinusoidal interface, we could observe the cellular distortions of <italic>Itgb1<sup>-/-</sup>/Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> megakaryocytes and their exit of the marrow (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4D-E</xref>, movie 3). Flow cytometry analysis did not allow us to detect intact megakaryocytes in the blood in <italic>Itgb1<sup>-/-</sup>/Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>blood samples (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 4F</xref>). However, large megakaryocyte nuclei were observed within the downstream pulmonary capillaries of these mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4F-G</xref>), suggesting that circulating megakaryocytes in <italic>Itgb1<sup>-/-</sup>/Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice are in large proportion retained in lung microvasculature shortly after entering the bloodstream. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation confirmed that intact <italic>Itgb1<sup>-/-</sup>/Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> megakaryocytes were similar in size and ultrastructure to those in the stroma compartment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). Furthermore, no significant change in the size of the endothelial pores (<italic>Itgb1<sup>-/-</sup>/Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>: 4.6 ± 0.3 µm; <italic>Pf4Cre</italic>: 4.3 ± 0.4 µm) was observed, indicating that increased megakacaryocyte intravasion in not link to endothelium alteration in mutant mice.</p>

<title>Integrins promote megakaryocyte adhesion to the ECM components of the bone marrow</title>
    <p>We next assessed the contribution of integrins adhesive function in megakaryocyte anchorage to ECM.

We next measured the adhesive potential of freshly isolated bone marrow megakaryocytes to test for such an adhesive role. To this end, we used a miniaturized microfluidic-based experimental model in which individual megakaryocyte detachment was tracked when exposed to a flow rate of 300s-1, similar to the flow typically found in sinusoids (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 5A-B</xref>). <italic>Pf4-Cre</italic> megakaryocytes had capture yields of 70.5% on laminin, 83.6% on fibrillar fibronectin, and 82.0% on fibrinogen. Laminin exhibited the least adhesion, emphasizing the importance of the molecular composition of the said 3D ECM cage and its evident impact on the adhesion response of megakaryocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C-D</xref>). <italic>Pf4-Cre</italic> megakaryocytes remained anchored, while <italic>Itgb1⁻/⁻/Itgb3⁻/⁻</italic> megakaryocytes experienced higher detachment rates across various ECMs (movies 4 and 5). In line with this conclusion, we used the bone marrow explant model to study the adhesion properties of the megakaryocytes associated with their 3D ECM cage (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5E-F</xref>). This model enabled us to quantify the physical detachment of megakaryocytes at the periphery of the explants. After 3 hours, more megakaryocytes detached from <italic>Itgb1<sup>-/-</sup>/Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>bone marrow tissue than <italic>Pf4-Cre</italic> explants, reaching a plateau at 6 h.

<title>Cage compression via metalloproteinase inhibition affects the maturation of megakaryocytes</title>
    <p>Our results suggest that a weakened ECM cage promotes megakaryocyte intravasation through reduced adhesion. We, therefore, tested whether an increase in cage density also may affect megakaryocyte functions. For that purpose, we proposed to decrease the catabolic aspect occurring in the ECM equilibrium between its synthesis and degradation. To this aim, mice were injected with batimastat (30 mg/kg) and ilomastat (20 mg/kg) for 7 days, in order to inhibit the activation of MMPs in the megakaryocyte microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Winer et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supplemental Figure 6A</xref>).

<p>We investigated whether this denser ECM cage might affect megakaryopoiesis. Remarkably, treatment with MMP inhibitors resulted in a significantly higher proportion of smaller megakaryocytes compared to untreated mice (white arrows in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C-D</xref>). To better evaluate the extent of this defect, we employed TEM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). We found that 53.7% of the megakaryocytes lacked the appropriate organization of the DMS in MMP inhibitors-treated mice, reflecting a primary failure in the cytoplasmic maturation (Stage II in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref> right). To determine whether MMP inhibition could directly affect megakaryocytes, we cultured primary megakaryocytes in the presence of increasing concentrations of inhibitors. We found no significant change in their proliferation, maturation, and proplatelet formation (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 6D</xref>). Although these <italic>in vitro</italic> system and exogenous MMPs may not fully recapitulate the complexity of the bone marrow situation, these findings suggest that disturbing ECM remodelling significantly impacts megakaryocyte maturation.</p>
    <p>An additional phenotype associated with a denser ECM environment is a significant increase in the total megakaryocyte number in MMP inhibitor-treated mice compared to the control condition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref> left). Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis of bone marrow sections revealed an upregulation of activated β1 integrin (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 6E</xref>). These results indicate that increased ECM density may promote megakaryocyte adhesion within the congested microenvironment of the bone marrow. To further investigate this point, we quantified the number of megakaryocytes released from bone marrow explants. We observed a significant reduction in megakaryocyte egress from the bone marrow microenvironment after 6 h in MMP inhibitor-treated compared to control mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G-H</xref>). Together, these results indicate that MMPs are essential regulators of ECM homeostasis within the bone marrow, influencing megakaryocyte maturation and attachment to the vascular niche.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Physiological platelet formation relies on the strategic positioning of mature megakaryocytes at sinusoids to facilitate polarised proplatelet extension and platelet release into circulation. This study identifies a 3D ECM cage anchoring megakaryocytes to bone marrow sinusoids. This cage, composed of laminin γ1 and α4 and collagen IV fibers, extends from the basement membrane and surrounds megakaryocytes. Megakaryocyte integrin signaling and ECM proteolysis regulate its remodeling and adhesive properties. This dynamic microenvironment is key for megakaryocyte positioning, maturation, and intravasation into the bloodstream, representing a novel concept in understanding physiological platelet formation (Graphical Abstract, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Guinard et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Larson &amp; Watson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Malara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Semeniak et al., 2016</xref>), we identified the presence of collagen IV, laminin γ1, fibronectin, and fibrinogen surrounding sinusoid-associated megakaryocytes. Notably, when analyzed using immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), collagen I fibers were absent under steady-state conditions. The discrepancy between our results and those reported in the literature may be attributed to differences in staining methodologies or variations in the physiological context of the bone marrow. Furthermore, our findings indicate that GPVI-deficient megakaryocytes do not display alterations in ECM cage formation, vessel association and intravasation behavior. These observations support studies showing GPVI and α2β1 integrins are not critical for megakaryocyte function, underscoring potential redundancy in ECM-receptor interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Semeniak et al., 2019</xref>). Besides, non-protein ECM molecules, including glycosaminoglycans, have been shown to play an essential role in supporting megakaryocyte function, including maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Petrey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Piszczatowski et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Vögtle et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>We identify laminin and collagen IV as the principal structural components of this ECM cage. Consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abbonante et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Susek et al., 2018</xref>), these ECM proteins were detected intracellularly within megakaryocytes and in stromal cells situated in their vicinity. This indicates that the ECM cage proteins may be derived from autocrine synthesis and their production by neighbouring cells. Interestingly, while fibronectin and fibrinogen were found around megakaryocytes, they do not form a ECM cage, suggesting distinct functional roles, potentially related to megakaryocyte expansion in bone marrow fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Malara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Matsuura et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
    <p>Our findings in <italic>Lamα4</italic>-deficient mice reveal that the ECM cage is critical for positioning megakaryocytes near sinusoids. It is established that CXCL12 is a most potent physiological chemoattractant for megakaryocytes and that the parasinusoidal location of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow is mediated by the CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hamada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Other chemoattractive factors also include fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Avecilla et al., 2004</xref>) and VWF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ouzegdouh et al., 2018</xref>). Besides its potential role as a reservoir of such growth factors, we show that the ECM cage is also a crucial element in maintaining megakaryocytes in the proximity of sinusoids, which is essential for their efficient maturation and optimal platelet production. We also find the persistent presence of this ECM cage throughout megakaryocyte maturation, supporting previous findings that megakaryocyte development occurs primarily at the sinusoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gaertner et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lichtman et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Stegner et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study highlights the indispensable roles of β1 and β3 integrins in maintaining megakaryocyte stability within the vascular niche. We demonstrate that these integrins are crucial for two fundamental processes : (1) the building of the 3D ECM cages, and (2) the ECM-mediated adhesion mechanisms to the vascular niche. Integrins biochemical and mechanical signal transduction play key roles in ECM remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Larsen et al., 2006</xref>) and can generate the forces that may cause these changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lemmon et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, RhoA inhibition in <italic>Itgb1⁻/⁻/Itgb3⁻/⁻</italic> megakaryocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Guinard et al., 2023</xref>) is likely contributing to the altered ECM remodeling. Nevertheless, we still need to understand how in megakaryocyte β1 or β3 integrins participate in ECM remodelling and ECM cage dynamics. Our work further demonstrates that in these mice, intact megakaryocytes can enter the general circulation. Of note, no intravascular megakaryocytes were found in <italic>Lamα4</italic>-deficient mice, which have a normal collagen IV cage but a compromised laminin cage. This indicates that integrity of all components of the cage is not needed to keep megakaryocytes from entering circulation. Importantly, circulating megakaryocytes have also been observed in humans during emergency megakaryopoiesis, such as in cases of infectious diseases, inflammatory conditions, and following cardiopulmonary bypass procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Frydman et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gelon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Puhm et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rapkiewicz et al., 2020</xref>). These circulating megakaryocytes have been implicated in thrombotic complications, underscoring the importance of integrin signaling-dependent mechanisms regulating megakaryocyte retention and release.</p>
<p>The precise role of the ECM cage in platelet production remains incompletely understood. In the Lamα4⁻/⁻ mice, a collagen-rich ECM cage persists with normal fibronectin deposition, whereas the <italic>Itgb1⁻/⁻/Itgb3⁻/⁻</italic> model displays a much more severe phenotype, characterized by the loss of both the laminin cage and collagen, along with the absence of fibrillar fibronectin. The preserved collagen and fibronectin in Lamα4⁻/⁻ mice may allow for residual activation of signaling pathways - potentially through integrins or alternative mechanisms - compared to the <italic>Itgb1⁻/⁻/Itgb3⁻/</italic>model, where these matrix components are absent.</p>
<p>MMPs profoundly influence megakaryocyte maturation and their association with the vascular niche by modulating the density of ECM cage architecture. This finding highlights the dynamic nature of the bone marrow microenvironment and its impact on megakaryopoiesis. Dysregulation of ECM production, often associated with bone marrow pathologies, can lead to its uncontrolled accumulation. In myelofibrosis, for instance, megakaryocytes secrete transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) which stimulates excessive ECM production by stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abbonante et al., 2016</xref>). This pathological ECM accumulation leads to abnormally smaller megakaryocytes that exhibit reduced platelet production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gianelli et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Malara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sarachakov et al., 2023</xref>). Likewise, we observed smaller and immature megakaryocytes retained in the constrained ECM microenvironment of the bone marrow, associated with an upregulation of activated β1 integrin in treated mice. Interestingly, previous research by K. Hoffmeister’s group has demonstrated that proper megakaryocyte localization at the sinusoids depends on β1 integrin glycosylation. Specifically, the absence of galactosylation in β4galt1<sup>-/-</sup> megakaryocytes leads to hyperactivity of β1 integrin, which negatively impacts the formation of the DMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Giannini et al., 2020</xref>). Building on these insights, our study shows the coordinated interplay between integrin-mediated signaling and MMP proteolysis, working together to tightly regulate the density and cross-linking properties of the ECM cage and thereby control megakaryocyte maturation at the bone marrow-blood interface. Intriguingly, despite these effects on megakaryocyte maturation, we observed no significant changes in circulating platelet counts, and importantly, platelet function remained preserved. This supports the idea that differences in ECM composition can influence the signaling environment and megakaryocyte maturation, but do not fully abrogate platelet function.</p>
<p>The influence of ECM features - like fiber length and pore size - on megakaryocyte biology is complex and not yet fully understood. Longer ECM fibers may help cells adhere better (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Barriga et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dolega et al., 2021</xref>). Larger pores could make it easier for megakaryocytes to mature and to extend proplatelets at the bone marrow-blood interface. Also, the mechanical properties of the ECM, particularly its stiffness, have emerged as critical environmental determinants of megakaryocyte development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbonante et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aguilar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Guinard et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Leiva et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, megakaryocytes possess mechanosensing capabilities, primarily mediated by the β3 integrin subunit, enabling them to detect and respond to changes in substrate stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Guinard et al., 2023</xref>). The assembly of extracellular matrix (ECM) fibronectin around megakaryopoiesis involves a more complex interplay of integrins, with both β1 and β3 integrins playing essential roles in fibrillogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Abbonante et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Guinard et al., 2023</xref>). This cooperative relationship appears to be conserved across various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Attieh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">De Mets et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kyumurkov et al., 2023</xref>). This may explain why the deletion of both integrins is required to affect the 3D ECM cage and megakaryocyte behavior significantly. We can not exclude that other ECM ligands of β3 integrins, such as fibronectin, may contribute to the organization of collagen IV and laminin, influencing the overall architecture of the vascular niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Petito &amp; Gresele, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, it is known that the fibronectin matrix favors the deposition of other ECM proteins, such as collagens IV and various other glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Saunders &amp; Schwarzbauer, 2019</xref>). This hypothesis underscores the need for further investigation into the spatio-temporal dynamics of ECM component assembly in the megakaryocyte vascular niche.</p>
<p>Overall, our findings reveal the supportive role of the ECM cage in platelet biogenesis. Integrin-mediated ECM interactions are clearly crucial, as demonstrated by the 50% reduction in platelet counts observed in integrin double knockout mice. In summary, the ECM cage acts as a finely tuned facilitator, optimising the efficiency and precision of platelet production by guiding megakaryocytes to the right place at the right time.</p>

<title>3D confocal analysis on bone marrow vibratome sections</title>
<p>Whole-mount bone marrow preparations were used to investigate i) the localization of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and the lung and ii) the spatial organization of ECM around sinusoid-associated megakaryocytes. Megakaryocytes were classified based on their maturation stage: stage I (presence of granules, no clear DMS visible), stage II (developing DMS not yet organized), and stage III (DMS organized in platelet territories). Mice from each genotype were analyzed and image acquisitions were performed in a blinded manner.</p>
<p>For megakaryocyte localization, sections of femurs’s bone marrow or lungs fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 1 hour, with a thickness of 250 µm, were incubated with FABP4 overnight. This was followed by overnight staining with Alexa 568-conjugated anti-GPIbβ antibody and Alexa 488 Donkey anti-Goat for FABP4. Finally, Hoechst 33342 was used for counterstaining for 10 minutes. The fluorescently labeled tissue was placed cut-face down into incubation chambers and mounted with Mowiol mounting solution. The Leica SP8 confocal microscope was used to collect a series of x-y-z images. The images were typically 194×194 µm x-y size and were collected along the z-axis at 1 µm step size through 50 µm of bone marrow tissue. The 40x objective with a numerical zoom of 4 (pixel size: 0.142 µm) was used. The lung was imaged using an x63 objective with a 2.5 digital zoom (pixel size: 0.145 µm).</p>
<p>To perform 3D ECM analysis, bone marrow samples were fixed in 4% PFA and 0.4% GA for 1 hour, then embedded in 4% agarose and cut into 250 µm-thick sections using a vibratome. These sections were then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies targeting laminin, type IV collagen, fibronectin, and fibrinogen, followed by corresponding secondary antibodies and Hoechst 33342 counterstaining. Series of x-y-z images of typically 46.13*46.13 µm x-y size were collected along the z-axis at 1 µm step size through 15-35 µm of sinusoid-associated megakaryocytes, using the 63x objective with a numerical zoom of 4 (pixel size: 0.09) from a Leica SP8 confocal microscope.

<p>Image processing to perform quantitative analyses of fluorescence profiles and fiber length are explained in <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 7</xref>. The random length measurement method uses random sampling to provide unbiased data on laminin/collagen fibers in a 3D cage. Measurements included intervals between different branching points throughout the cage, including branch ends. Processing involved five steps: 1) acquiring 3D images, 2) projecting onto 2D planar sections, 3) selecting random intersection points for measurement, 4) measuring intervals using ImageJ software, and 5) repeating the process for a representative dataset. Briefly, a binary threshold mask (0 for the background and 1 for the ECM network, threshold to reduce signal noise) was generated from the channel showing labeled collagen or laminin. The mask was then applied to the channel showing megakaryocytes, resulting in an image that corresponded to only an active ECM signal that colocalized with megakaryocytes. The mask was then applied to the collagen/laminin channel to determine the amount of fluorescent ECM within the mask. This enabled the determination of the cell area and the elimination of the signal outside the mask.</p>

<p>For SEM, native bone marrow megakaryocytes were allowed to adhere to a surface coated with 300 µg/ml fibronectin, 100 µg/ml fibrinogen, or 50 µg/ml laminin 511. After gentle agitation to detach non-adherent cells, the remaining adherent cells were fixed in 2.5 % glutaraldehyde for 1 hour, dehydrated, attached to stubs, sputter coated, and examined under a Helios NanoLab microscope at 5kV (ThermoFisher, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Adherent megakaryocytes where counted and classified as spreading or round cells. The results were obtained by the average from three independent mice.</p>

<title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>Flow cytometry was used to investigate i) megakaryocyte ploidy, ii) intact megakaryocytes in the blood and iii) platelet activation.</p>
<p>For the ploidy analysis of the native megakaryocytes, mouse femurs, tibias, and iliac crests were harvested, cut into small fragments, and incubated in a PBS-collagenase-dispase mix (at 3 mg/mL and 4 mg/mL, 5mL/mouse respectively) for 30 min at 37°C. Then, the tube was filled with PBS-2% NCS to stop the collagenase, and the supernatant was 70 µm filtered to eliminate the bone fragments. After red cell lysis, the freshly isolated bone marrows were washed in PBS-2% NCS and stained with anti-CD41 and anti-CD42c antibodies and Hoechst. Anti Gr-1, B220, F4/80, and TER119 probes were used as a negative control to exclude granulocytes, B lymphocytes, macrophages, and erythrocytes from the total bone marrow suspension. The freshly isolated megakaryocytes were identified as a CD41/CD42c positive cell population and ploidy analysis was performed using Hoechst 33342. The results are representative of three independent experiments.</p>
<p>For detection of intact megakaryocytes in the blood, red blood cell lysis was performed using BD Lysing buffer solution according to manufacturer’s instruction. The resulting mononucleated cells were labelled with fluorescent conjugated antibodies: anti CD41-PE-Cy7 (clone MWReg30), anti-CD42c-Alexa 488 (clone RAM-1), anti-CD45-PE (clone 30-F11), TER119-APC (clone TER119), antibodies from ebiosciences except RAM-1 antibody produced in house. Megakaryocytes enriched from bone marrow using BSA gradient were spiked into blood sample to validate the gating strategy to identify potential circulating megakaryocytes as CD45<sup>+</sup>TER119<sup>-</sup>CD41<sup>+</sup>CD42c<sup>+</sup> events. 300.10<sup>3</sup> CD45<sup>+</sup>TER119<sup>-</sup> events were recorded. Data acquisition was performed on a Symphony A1 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using BD FACS Diva Software (BD Biosciences).</p>
<p>For platelet activation studies, whole blood was collected from the tail vein and anticoagulated with hirudin (200 U /ml). Platelets were activated or not with collagen-related peptide (CRP, 40 µg/ml) and TRAP (4mM) for 15 min at 37°C and stained with FITC-labelled or 647-labelled rat anti-mouse GPIbβ and APC-labeled rat anti-mouse P-selectin or PE-labelled rat anti-mouse activated-αIIbβ3 antibodies. Fluorescence was quantified using an LSRFortessa cell analyze (BD Biosciences) and BD FACSDiva software. A total of 20.000 events were analyzed for each sample.</p>

<title>Microfluidic experiments</title>
    <p>The PDMS microfluidic chamber channels were assembled and connected to a peristaltic pump, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Osmani et al., 2021</xref>). The channels were washed with PBS for 5 min and coated with laminin 511 (50 µg/ml), fibrillar fibronectin (300 µg/ml), or fibrinogen (100 µg/ml) overnight at 4°C, followed by a blocking stage with human serum albumin (1 %) for 30 min at RT. To produce fibrillar fibronectin, we use the method of mechanical stretching as described in Maurer et al, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Maurer et al., 2015</xref>). Freshly isolated megakaryocytes were seeded at a concentration of 30 cells /µL per channel and incubated for 15 min – 45 min at 37 °C with 5 % CO<sub>2.</sub> In previous work, the seeding time was determined with capture efficiencies of over 80 % for Pf4cre megakaryocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Suppl. Figure 4B</xref>). The channels were then perfused under a flow of 300 µm/s and the megakaryocyte behavior was monitored in real-time, for 1 min, using a Leica DMI8 microscope (x20) equipped with a CMOS Camera (Hamamatsu ORCA fusion). Megakaryocyte capture yield was measured by quantifying the number of adherent megakaryocytes before and after flow induction (expressed as a percentage) on an average of 20 stage positions (n= 50 megakaryocytes analyzed/test). The results are an average of three independent experiments, the values were expressed as a mean ± sem.</p>

<title>Bone marrow explants</title>
<p>Preparation of bone marrow explants was performed as described in Guinard et al., 2021 to investigate proplatelet formation. For investigating megakaryocyte emigration, bone marrows were flushed from femurs of <italic>Pf4cre</italic> and<italic>Itgb1<sup>-/-</sup>/Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>; Lamα4<italic><sup>+/+</sup></italic> and Lamα4<italic><sup>-/-</sup></italic>; as well as from DMSO- and B+I-treated mice and ten 0.5 mm-thick sections were placed in an incubation chamber. Megakaryocytes at the periphery of the explants were counted under an inverted phase contrast microscope coupled to a video camera (DMI8 Leica microscope, 40x objective). A motorized multiposition stage (in <italic>x, y</italic>, <italic>z</italic>) was used, and an average of 100 stages positions showing megakaryocytes was followed. Results are expressed as the number of total emigrating megakaryocytes at the indicated time points. In each case, a minimum of six independent experiments were performed. Mice from each genotype were analyzed and image acquisitions were performed in a blinded manner.</p>

<title>Effects of MMP inhibition</title>
<p>Batimastat plus ilomastat treatment was tested for their potential impact on the ECM in the microenvironment of the megakaryocyte vascular niche. Mice were treated daily with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Batimastat at 30 mg/kg + Ilomastat at 50 mg/kg) or vehicle (DMSO) for 7 consecutive days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pielecka-Fortuna et al., 2015</xref>). The platelet count was monitored every two days. On the eighth day, the mice were sacrificed, and their bone marrow was collected for analysis of ECM organization and megakaryocyte behavior, as explained in the 3D confocal analysis on bone marrow vibratome sections.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>All values are reported as the mean ± sem. n= number of megakaryocytes studied. Statistical analyses were performed with PrismGraphpad software (La Jolla, CA, USA). For group comparison, data were tested for Gaussian distribution. Then, a Student t-test (Gaussian) or Mann-Whitney U test (non-Gaussian) were used to compare individual groups; multiple groups were compared by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test or by a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, with a threshold of significance of 5%.

<p>In this revised version, the authors provide a thorough investigation of the interaction of megakaryocytes (MK) with their associated extracellular matrix (ECM) during maturation; they provide <bold>compelling</bold> evidence that the existence of a dense cage-like pericellular structure containing laminin γ1 and α4 and collagen IV is key to fixing the perisinusoidal localization of MK and preventing their premature intravasation. Adhesion of MK to this ECM cage is dependent on integrin beta1 and beta3 expressed by MK. This strong conclusion is based on the use of state-of-the art techniques such as the use of primary murine bone marrow MK cultures, mice lacking ECM receptors, namely integrin beta1 and beta3 null mice, as well as high-resolution 2D and 3D imaging. The study provides <bold>valuable</bold> insight into the role of cell-matrix interactions in MK maturation and provides an interesting model with practical implications for the fields of hemostasis and thrombosis</p>

<p>The authors report on a thorough investigation of the interaction of megakaryocytes (MK) with their associated ECM during maturation. They report convincing evidence to support the existence of a dense cage-like pericellular structure containing laminin γ1 and α4 and collagen IV, which interacts with integrins β1 and β3 on MK and serve to fix the perisinusoidal localization of MK and prevent their premature intravasation. As with everything in nature, the authors support a Goldilocks range of MK-ECM interactions - inability to digest the ECM via inhibition of MMPs leads to insufficient MK maturation and development of smaller MK. This important work sheds light into the role of cell-matrix interactions in MK maturation, and suggests that higher-dimensional analyses are necessary to capture the full scope of cellular biology in the context of their microenvironment. The authors have responded appropriately to the majority of my previous comments.</p>
<p>Some remaining points:</p>
<p>In a previous critique, I had suggested that &quot;it is unclear how activation of integrins allows the MK to become &quot;architects for their ECM microenvironment&quot; as the authors posit. A transcriptomic analysis of control and DKO MKs may help elucidate these effects&quot;. The authors pointed out the technical difficulty of obtained sufficient numbers of MK for such analysis, which I accept, and instead analyzed mature platelets, finding no difference between control and DKO platelets. This is not necessarily surprising, since mature circulating platelets have no need to engage an ECM microenvironment, and for the same reason I would suggest that mature platelet analyses are not representative of MK behavior as regards ECM interactions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study makes a significant contribution to understanding the microenvironment of megakaryocytes (MKs) in the bone marrow, identifying an extracellular matrix (ECM) cage structure that influences MK localization and maturation. The authors provide compelling evidence for the presence of this ECM cage and its role in MK homeostasis, employing an array of sophisticated imaging techniques and molecular analyses.</p>
<p>The authors have addressed most of the concerns raised in the previous review, providing clarifications and additional data that strengthen their conclusions</p>
<p>More broadly, this work adds to a growing recognition of the ECM as an active participant in haematopoietic cell regulation in the bone marrow microenvironment. This work could pave the way to future studies investigating how the megakaryocytes' ECM cage affects their function as part of the haematopoietic stem cell niche, and by extension, influences global haematopoiesis.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review)</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors postulate a synergistic role for Itgb1 and Itgb3 in the intravasation phenotype, because the single KOs did not replicate the phenotype of the DKO. However, this is not a correct interpretation in the opinion of this reviewer. The roles appear rather to be redundant. Synergistic roles would rather demonstrate a modest effect in the single KO with potentiation in the DKO.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the interaction between Itgb1 and Itgb3 appears redundant and we have corrected this point in the revised manuscript (page 10).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The experiment does not explain how these integrins influence the interaction of the MK with their microenvironment. It is not surprising that attachment will be impacted by the presence or absence of integrins. However, it is unclear how activation of integrins allows the MK to become &quot;architects for their ECM microenvironment&quot; as the authors posit. A transcriptomic analysis of control and DKO MKs may help elucidate these effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not yet understand how the activation of α5β1 or αvβ3 integrins affects ECM remodeling by megakaryocytes. Integrins are key regulators of ECM remodeling (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceb.2006.08.009">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceb.2006.08.009</ext-link>) and can transmit traction forces that induce these changes (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2008.10.009">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2008.10.009</ext-link>). Our previous study also found reduced RhoA activation in double knockout (DKO) megakaryocytes (MKs) (Guinard et al., 2023, PMID: 37171626), which likely affects ECM organization. These findings are discussed in the Discussion section of the paper (page 14).</p>
<p>As suggested, conducting a transcriptomic analysis of control and DKO MKs may help to elucidate these effects. However, isolating native rare MKs from DKO mice is technically challenging and requires too many animals. To overcome this issue, we instead isolated mouse platelets and used targeted RT-PCR arrays to profile key ECM remodelling (ECM proteins, proteases…) and adhesion molecules (Zifkos et al., Circ. Res. 2024, PMID, 38563147). Quality controls confirmed that integrin RNA was undetectable in the DKO samples, ruling out contamination. Nevertheless, we found no significant expression differences exceeding the 3-fold change threshold between the control and DKO groups. The high Ct (threshold cycles) values indicate low transcript abundance, which may mask subtle changes (see the scatter plot below). As an example, we present a typical result obtained for the reviewer.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Integrin DKO have a 50% reduction in platelets counts as reported previously, however laminin α4 deficiency only leads to 20% reduction in counts. This suggests a more nuanced and subtle role of the ECM in platelet growth. To this end, functional assays of the platelets in the KO and wildtype mice may provide more information.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The exact contribution of the extracellular matrix (ECM) cage to platelet growth remains incompletely understood. In the Lamα4⁻/⁻ model, a collagen-rich ECM cage persists alongside normal fibronectin deposition. By contrast, the integrin DKO model exhibits a markedly severe phenotype characterized by the loss of both the laminin cage and collagen and the absence of fibrillar fibronectin. Also, the preserved collagen and fibronectin in Lamα4⁻/⁻ mice may permit residual activation of signaling pathways - potentially via integrins or alternative mechanisms- compared to the DKO model. We appreciate the reviewer’s feedback on this adjustment, which has been incorporated into the discussion (page 15).</p>
<p>As suggested by the reviewer, we performed functional assays that demonstrated normal platelet function in Lamα4⁻/⁻ mice and impaired integrin-mediated aggregation in Itgb1<sup>-/-</sup>/Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup>  mice, as shown by the new data presented in the publication (see pages 7 and 9). Platelet function remained preserved following treatment with MMP inhibitors. This supports the idea that differences in ECM composition can influence the signaling environment and megakaryocyte maturation, but do not fully abrogate platelet function (page 15).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) There is insufficient information in the Methods Section to understand the BM isolation approach. Did the authors flush the bone marrow and then image residual bone, or the extruded bone marrow itself as described in PMID: 29104956?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Additional methodological information has been provided to clarify that only the extruded bone marrow, and not the bone itself, is isolated (page 17).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The references in the Methods section were very frustrating. The authors reference Eckly et al 2020 (PMID : 32702204) which provides no more detail but references a previous publication (PMID: 24152908), which also offers no information and references a further paper (PMID: 22008103), which, as far as this reviewer can tell, did not describe the methodology of in situ bone marrow imaging.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this confusion, we have added the reference &quot;In Situ Exploration of the Major Steps of Megakaryopoiesis Using Transmission Electron Microscopy&quot; by C. Scandola et al. (PMID : 34570102) in the « Isolation and preservation of murine bone marrow » section (page 20), which provides a standardized protocol for bone marrow isolation and in situ bone marrow imaging.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Therefore, this reviewer cannot tell how the preparation was performed and, importantly, how can we be sure that the microarchitecture of the tissue did not get distorted in the process?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. While we cannot completely rule out the possibility of distortion, we have clarified the precautions taken to minimize it. We used a double fixation procedure immediately after bone marrow extrusion, followed by embedding it in agarose to preserve its integrity as much as possible. We have elaborated on this point in greater detail in the Methods section of the revised version (page 18).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) ECM cage imaging</p>
<p>(a) The value or additional information provided by the staining on nano-sections (A) is not clear, especially considering that the thick vibratome sections already display the entirety of the laminin γ1 cage structure effectively. Further clarification on the unique insights gained from each approach would help justify its inclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Ultrathin cryosectioning enables high-resolution imaging with a threefold increase in Z-resolution, facilitating precise analysis of signal superposition. This approach was particularly valuable for clearly visualizing activated integrin in contact with laminin and collagen IV fibers (see Fig. 3 in revised manuscript, pages 6, 8 and 18). Additionally, 3D reconstructions and z-stack data reveal complex interactions between the basement membrane and the cellular ECM cage that are not evident in 2D projections (see page 6). These complementary methods help elucidate the detailed molecular and three-dimensional organization of the ECM cage surrounding megakaryocytes. These points have been clarified in the method and result sections.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) The sMK shown in Supplementary Figure 1C appears to be linked to two sinusoids, releasing proplatelets to the more distant vessels. Is this observation representative, and if so, can further discussion be provided?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This observation is not representative; MKs can also be associated with just one sinusoid.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(c) Freshly isolated BM-derived MKs are reported to maintain their laminin γ1 cage. Are the proportions of MKs with/without cages consistent with those observed in microscopy?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>After mechanical dissociation and size exclusion, almost half of the MKs successfully retained their cages (53.4% ± 5.6%, based on 329 MKs from three experiments; see page 7 of the manuscript for new data). This highlights the strong physical connection between MK and their cage.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) ECM cage formation</p>
<p>(a) The statement &quot;the full assembly of the 3D ECM cage required megakaryocyte interaction with the sinusoidal basement membrane&quot; on page 7 is too strong given the data presented at this stage of the study. Supplemental Figure 1C shows that approximately 10% of pMKs form cages without direct vessel contact, indicating that other factors may also play a role in cage formation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct. We have adjust the text to reflect a more cautious interpretation of our results. « Althought we cannot exclude that ECM cage can be form on its own, our data suggests that ECM cage assembly may require interactions between megakaryocytes and the sinusoidal basement membrane » suggests that the assembly of the 3D ECM cage may require interactions between megakaryocytes and the sinusoidal basement membrane » (page 7).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) The data supporting the statement that &quot;pMK represent a small fraction of the total MK population&quot; (cell number or density) could be shown to help contextualize the 10% of them with a cage.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the reviewer's recommendation, a new bar graph has been added to illustrate the 18 ± 1.3 % of MK in the parenchyma relative to the total MK in the bone marrow (page 7 and Suppl. Figure 1H).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(c) How &quot;the full assembly of the 3D ECM cage&quot; is defined at this stage of the study should be clarified, specifically regarding the ECM components and structural features that characterize its completion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We recognize that the term ' full assembly' of the 3D ECM cage can be misleading, as it might suggest different stages of cage formation, such as a completed cage, one in the formation process, or an incomplete cage. Since we have not yet studied this concept, we have eliminate the term &quot;full assembly&quot; from the manuscript to avoid confusion. Instead, we mention the presence of a cage.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Data on MK Circulation and Cage Integrity: Does the cage require full component integrity to prevent MK release in circulation? Are circulating MKs found in Lama4-/- mice? Is the intravasation affected in these mice? Are the ~50% sinusoid associated MK functional?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In lamα4-deficient (Lamα4-/-) mice, which possess an intact collagen IV cage but a structurally compromised laminin cage, electron microscopy and whole-mount imaging revealed an absence of intact megakaryocytes within the sinusoidal lumen. This observation indicates that the structural integrity of all components of the ECM cage is critical for preventing megakaryocyte entry into the circulation. Despite the laminin deficiency, mature Lamα4-/- megakaryocytes exhibited normal ultrastructure and maintained typical intravasation behavior. Furthermore, analysis of bone marrow explants from Lamα4-/- mice demonstrated that megakaryocytes retained their capacity to extend proplatelets. These findings are presented on page 7 and further discussed on page 14.</p>

<p>(b) The description of 'random length measuring' is unclear, and the rationale behind choosing random quantification should be explained. Additionally, in the shown image, it appears that only the branching ends were measured, which makes it difficult to discern the randomness in the measurements.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The random length measurement method uses random sampling to provide unbiased data on laminin/collagen fibers in a 3D cage. Contrary to what the initial image might have suggested, measurements go beyond just the branching ends ; they include intervals between various branching points throughout the cage. This is now explained page 19.</p>
<p>To clarify this process, we will outline these steps page 19 as : 1) acquire 3D images, 2) project onto 2D planar sections, 3) select random intersection points for measurement, 4) measure intervals using ImageJ software, and 5) repeat the process for a representative dataset. This will better illustrate the randomness of our measurements.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The data linking ECM cage formation to MK maturation raises several interesting questions. As the authors mention, MKs have been suggested to mature rapidly at the sinusoids, and both integrin KO and laminin KO MKs appear mislocalized away from the sinusoids. Additionally, average MK distances from the sinusoid may also help separate whether the maturation defects could be in part due to impaired migration towards CXCL12 at the sinusoid. Presumably, MKs could appear mislocalized away from the sinusoid given the data presented suggesting they leaving the BM and entering circulation. Additional data or commentary on intrinsic (ex-vivo) MK maturation phenotypes may help strengthen the author's conclusions and shed light on whether an essential function of the ECM cage is integrin activation at the sinusoid.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The idea that megakaryocytes move toward CXCL12 is still debated. Some studies suggest mature MKs are mainly sessile (PMID: 28743899), while others propose that CXCL12 may guide MK progenitors rather than mature MKs (PMID: 38987596, this reference has been added). To address the reviewer’s concerns regarding CXCL12-mediated migration, we conducted additional investigations.</p>
<p>For DKO integrins, Guinard et al. (2023, PMID: 37171626) reported no significant change in the distance between MKs and sinusoids, indicating that integrin deficiency does not impair MK migration toward sinusoidal vessels.</p>
<p>In our own study involving Lamα4-/- mice, we utilized whole-mount bone marrow preparations, labeling MKs with GPIbβ antibodies and sinusoids with FABP4 antibodies. We observed a 1.6-fold increase in the proximity of MKs to sinusoids in Lamα4-/- mice compared to controls (see figure below). However, the absolute distances measured were less than 3 µm in both groups, much smaller than the average diameter of a mature MK (20 - 25 µm), raising questions about the biological significance of these findings in active MK migration. What happens with MK progenitors - a population not detectable in our experiments using morphological criteria or GPIb staining - remains an open question.</p>
<p>These results are provided for the reviewer’s information and will be available to eLife readers, along with the authors’ responses, in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(2) The data demonstrating intact MKs in the circulation is intriguing - can the authors comment or provide evidence as to whether MKs are detectable in blood? A quantitative metric may strengthen these observations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To investigate this, we conducted flow cytometry experiments and prepared blood smears to determine the presence of intact Itgb1-/-/Itgb3-/- megakaryocytes in the blood. Unfortunately, we could not detect any intact megakaryocytes in the blood samples using FACS (see new Supplementary Figure 4E) nor any on the blood smears (data not shown). However, we observed that large, denuded megakaryocyte nuclei were retained in the downstream pulmonary capillaries of these mice. Intravital imaging of the lung has previously provided direct evidence for the phenomenon of microvascular trapping (Lefrançois et al., 2017; PMID: 28329764), demonstrating that megakaryocytes can be physically entrapped within the pulmonary circulation due to size exclusion while releasing platelets. This has been clarified in the revised paper (Results section, page 10).</p>

<p>(3) Supplementary Figure 6 - shows no effect on in vitro MK maturation and proplt, or MK area - But Figures 6B/6C demonstrate an increase in total MK number in MMP-inhibitor treated mice compared to control. Some additional clarification in the text may substantiate the author's conclusions as to either the source of the MMPs or the in vitro environment not fully reflecting the complex and dynamic niche of the BM ECM in vivo.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a valid point. We have revised the text to be more cautious and to provide further clarification on these points (page 12).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Similarly, one function of the ECM discussed relates to MK maturation but in the B1/3 integrin KO mice, the presence of the ECM cage is reduced but there appears to be no significant impact upon maturation (Supplementary Figure 4). By contrast, MMP inhibition in vivo (but not in vitro) reduces MK maturation. These data could be better clarified in the text, or by the addition of experiments addressing whether the composition and quantity of ECM cage components directly inhibit maturation versus whether effects of MMP-inhibitors perhaps lead to over-activation of the integrins (as with the B4galt KO in the discussion) are responsible for the differences in maturation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out.</p>
<p>In our study of DKO integrin mice with a reduced extracellular matrix (ECM) cage, we observed normal proportions of MK maturation stages. However, these mutant MKs had a disorganized membrane system and smaller cytoplasmic areas compared to wild-type cells, indicating issues in their maturation. This is detailed further in the manuscript (see page 9).</p>
<p>In the context of MMP inhibition in vivo, which also leads to reduced MK maturation, our immunofluorescence analysis revealed in an increased presence of activated β1 integrin in bone marrow sections (see Supplementary Figure 6E). As suggested by the reviewer, this increase may explain the maturation defect.</p>
<p>In summary, while it's challenging to definitively determine how ECM cage composition and quantity affect MK maturation in vivo, our results show that changes to the ECM cage - whether through genetic modification (DKO) or MMP inhibition - are consistently linked to defects in MK maturation.</p>

<p>(1) Figure 1 Panel C: The sinusoidal basement membrane staining is missing, making it difficult to conclude that the collagen IV organization extends radially from the sinusoidal basement membrane.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As recommended by the reviewer, we have updated Figure 1C with a new image illustrating the basement membrane (FABP4 staining) and the collagen IV cage. This new image confirms that the cage extends radially from the basement membrane.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Arrows in 1B: Based on the arrow's localisation, the description of &quot;basement membrane-cage connection&quot; is not evident from the images as it looks like the signal colocalization (right lower panel) occurs below the highlighted areas. Clarification or additional evidence of co-localization is required.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The apparent localization of the signal &quot;below&quot; the highlighted areas in the maximal projection image is due to the nature of 2D projections, which compress overlapping signals from multiple depths within the bone marrow into a single plane. This can obscure the spatial relationship between the basement membrane and extracellular matrix (ECM) components. However, when the complete z-stack series is examined, the direct connection between the basement membrane and the ECM cage becomes evident in three dimensions. Therefore, we have now added a comprehensive analysis of the entire z-stack dataset, allowing us to accurately interpret the spatial relationships between the basement membrane and ECM in the native bone marrow microenvironments (movies 1 and 2, and Suppl. Figure 1D-E).</p>

<p>(3) In Figure 4C, GPIX is used to identify MKs by IVM while GP1bβ is used throughout the rest of the manuscript. It would be helpful for readers who are less familiar with MKs to understand whether GPIX and GP1bβ identify the same population of MKs and the rationale for choosing one marker over the other.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>GPIX and GPIbβ are components of the GPIb-IX complex, identifying mature megakaryocytes (Lepage et al., 2000, PMID : 11110688). The choice of one over the other in different experiments is primarily based on technical considerations. The intravital experiments have been standardized using an AF488-conjugated anti-GPIX to identify mature megakaryocytes consistently. GPIbβ (GP1bβ) is used in the rest of the manuscript due to its strong and specific bright staining. We have clarified this point in the Result (page 10) and in the Material/methods section (page 17).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Some minor comments:</p>
<p>(1) If there is specific importance to some of the analyses of the cage structure, such as fiber length, and pore size, (eg. if they may have biological significance to the MK) it may help readers to give additional context to what differences in the pore size might imply. For example, do pores constrain MKs at sites where actin-driven proplatelet formation could be initiated?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The effects of extracellular matrix (ECM) features - like fiber length and pore size - on megakaryocyte (MK) biology are not fully understood. Longer ECM fibers may help MKs adhere better and sense their environment. Larger pores could make it easier for MKs to grow, communicate, and extend proplatelets through blood vessel walls. The role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade the ECM, adds to the complexity, and how this occurs in vivo is not yet well understood.</p>
<p>As suggested, some of these points have been addressed in the revised manuscript (Discussion, page 16).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) &quot;Although fibronectin and fibrinogen were readily detected around megakaryocytes, a reticular network around megakaryocytes was not observed. Furthermore, no connection was identified between fibronectin and fibrinogen deposition with the sinusoid basement membrane, in contrast to the findings for laminin and collagen IV (Supp. Figures 1E).&quot; - Clarification of how these data are interpreted might be helpful as to what the authors are intending to demonstrate with these data as at least in Figure 1E, fibronectin, and fibrinogen do appear expressed along the MK surface and at the sinusoidal-MK interface.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While fibronectin and fibrinogen are present around megakaryocytes and at the vessel-cell interface, they do not form a reticular ECM cage. The functional implications of this finding remain unclear. One can imagine that the specific spatial arrangement of various ECM components may lead to different functional roles. Laminin and collagen IV may provide structural support by forming a 3D cage that is essential for the proper positioning and maturation of megakaryocytes. In contrast, fibronectin and fibrinogen may have different functions, potentially related to megakaryocyte expansion in bone marrow fibrosis (Malara et al., 2019, PMID : 30733282) and (Matsuura et al., 2020, PMID : 32294178).</p>
<p>This topic has been adressed in the Results page 7 and discussion on page 13.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Given the effects of dual B1/B3 integrin inhibition on MK intravasation, can the authors comment on the use of integrin RGD-based inhibitors? Are these compounds and drugs likely to interfere with MK retention?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our study shows that MK retention depends on the integrity of both components of the cage, collagen IV and laminin (see also point 3 of reviewer 2). Collagen IV contains RGD sequences, making it susceptible to RGD-based inhibition, whereas laminin does not utilize the RGD motif, raising questions about the overall efficacy of these inhibitors.</p>
<p>In addition, the in vivo efficacy and potential off-target effects of these inhibitors in the complex bone marrow microenvironment remain to be fully elucidated. This intriguing issue warrants further investigation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Beyond protein components, other non-protein ECM molecules including glycosaminoglycans (HA, HS) have essential roles in supporting MK function, including maturation (PMIDs: 31436532, 36066492, 27398974) and may merit some brief discussion if the authors feel this is helpful.</p>
