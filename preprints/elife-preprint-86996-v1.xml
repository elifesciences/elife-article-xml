<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) adapt to tissue physiology and contribute to immunity, inflammatory pathology and metabolism. We show that mouse uterine ILC2s have a heightened type-2 gene signature and expand during pregnancy. Indeed, maternal ILC2s promote fetal growth and protect against fetal mortality upon systemic endotoxin challenge. Absence of ILC2s leads to utero-placental abnormalities, including poor vascular remodelling, increased <italic>Il1b</italic> and decreased <italic>Il4, Il5</italic>, and <italic>Il13</italic> gene expression, and reduced alternative activation of dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. Placentas exhibit signs of adaptation to stress, including larger maternal blood spaces and increased expression of nutrient transporter genes. Endotoxin induces the expansion of IL-1β-producing uterine DCs and, in response, more uterine ILC2s produce IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. In a protective feedback mechanism, these cytokines suppress IL-1β-producing DCs, in line with a protective role of uILC2s against endotoxin-induced abortion. Uterine ILC2s emerge as pivotal for both normal and complicated pregnancies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Poor fetal growth and infections are among the main causes of perinatal morbidity that account for 10% of the global burden of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">WHO | The Global Burden of Disease: 2004 Update, 2014</xref>). Maternal immune cells, including lymphocytes resident in the uterus regulate fetal growth and participate in defense against pathogens, however it is unclear how they achieve the right balance between trophic and immune functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shmelova &amp; Colucci, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Erlebacher, 2013</xref>). Both heterogeneity and tissue specialization of immune cells may hold the key to understanding the pathophysiology of some important pregnancy complications, such as miscarriage and fetal growth restriction (FGR), which is defined as the failure of the fetus to achieve its genetically determined growth potential. Consequently, it is critical that we understand the cellular and molecular immune factors that regulate the uterine environment. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) lack antigen receptors but are equipped with receptors for cytokines, hormones, and paracrine signals enabling them to sense their environment and respond quickly by producing factors that influence parenchymal cells and other resident immune cells. Despite often comprising only a small proportion of tissue resident immune cells, ILCs are present in most tissues and have been shown to orchestrate inflammatory responses to viruses, intracellular bacteria and parasites. Through alternative activation of macrophages and other myeloid cells, ILCs also drive and support repair mechanisms that maintain tissue integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Artis &amp; Spits, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kim &amp; Van Dyken, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Xiong et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The diverse responses of ILCs can be ascribed to three main groups of cell populations defined by their differential expression of the transcription factors and cytokines they respond to and produce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eberl et al., 2015</xref>). Group 2 ILCs (ILC2s), are characterized by the transcription factor GATA-3 and the IL-33 specific receptor ST-2. They respond to IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP and produce both amphiregulin, which is involved in tissue repair, and classical type-2 cytokines including IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Through the production of these soluble factors and by interacting with other immune cells, such as eosinophils, type-2 helper T cells and alternatively activated macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), ILC2s are attuned to the physiology of the tissue in which they differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jenkins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kim &amp; Van Dyken, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Molofsky et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nussbaum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Spitz &amp; Mjosberg, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Xiong et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>We, and others, have described ILCs resident in the uterus before and during pregnancy, in human and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Doisne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Miller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sugahara et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Vacca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). While functions have been suggested for uterine group 1 and 3 ILCs in mice or humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ashkar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Boulenouar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Croxatto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Montaldo et al., 2015</xref>), the physiological roles of ILC2s in normal and complicated pregnancies remain poorly understood, also because very few if any ILC2s are found in human endometrium or decidua in early pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Doisne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Vento-Tormo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Huhn et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>dams completely but not selectively lack ILC2s and have impeded vascular remodelling of the uterine arteries, inefficient placentas, and growth restricted fetuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Boulenouar et al., 2016</xref>). Uterine ILC2s respond to the alarmin IL-33 and are regulated by female sex hormones in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bartemes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Miller et al., 2022</xref>). Pups from dams lacking the IL-33 receptor ST-2 have increased neonatal mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bartemes et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, polymorphisms in genes coding for cytokines of the IL-1 family, including <italic>IL1B</italic> and <italic>IL33</italic>, are associated with recurrent miscarriage in certain populations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yue et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) and ILC2 are increased in the decidua of women with preterm labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). Both IL-33 and ST-2 have been implicated in pre-eclampsia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Granne et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, IL-33 and maternal lymphocytes are linked to preterm labour in both humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, there is emerging evidence that IL-33 and ILC2s are involved in both healthy and complicated pregnancies but more investigation is required to understand their role in reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Miller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Miller et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Dysregulation of cytokines and immune cell types in the uterus may impair placental function, thus triggering pregnancy syndromes, including FGR and miscarriage. A number of fetal abnormalities can be ascribed to malfunctioning placentas(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Perez-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>) and the maternal environment influences the interdependent growth of both fetus and placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sferruzzi-Perri &amp; Camm, 2016</xref>). Indeed, a reduction in the ratio between fetal and placental weight generally reflects reduced placental efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fowden et al., 2009</xref>). Placental insufficiency is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rehn et al., 2004</xref>). In fetuses that fail to attain their genetically determined growth potential, a circulatory compensation occurs where changes in cerebral blood flow allow for the brain to develop despite FGR. This seemingly advantageous ‘brain sparing effect’ is however linked to cognitive defects later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Scherjon et al., 2000</xref>). Maternal immune activation also influences fetal brain development(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Smith et al., 2007</xref>) and dysregulation of uterine immune cells, such as ILC2s, may adversely affect fetal development of the brain.</p>
<p>Based on the evidence that IL-33 and ST-2 are involved in pregnancy complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Miller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Miller et al., 2022</xref>) and considering the prominent roles of ILC2s in homeostasis and immunity in lung, intestine, and adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Klose &amp; Artis, 2016</xref>), we hypothesized that uterine ILC2s play essential roles in normal and complicated pregnancies. Our data show that ILC2s have unique features in the mouse uterus. Whole genome transcriptome analysis shows that the typical type-2 immunity gene signature characterized by GATA-3, ST-2 and IL-5 is enhanced in uterine ILC2s compared to lung and lymph nodes. Using a mouse model of selective ILC2 deficiency, we show that the uterine immune environment of ILC2-deficient dams is dysregulated and pro-inflammatory. Pregnancies in ILC2-deficient dams are characterized by growth-restricted fetuses. Moreover, due to the unbalanced uterine immunological environment, ILC2-deficient dams are more susceptible to fetal demise when exposed systemically to bacterial endotoxin. Together, our data demonstrate uILC2s as master regulators of type-2 immunity in the mouse uterus and as key immune cells in the maintenance of immunological homeostasis during both normal and complicated pregnancies.</p>

<title>ILC2s colocalize with IL-33 in the mouse uterus and are found in the human uterus</title>
<p>The mouse uterus contains ILC2s (uILC2s) that reside in the muscle layer of the uterine wall (myometrium), and expand over 5-fold, from about 500 to 3,000 cells, during pregnancy (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold> and <bold>S1A</bold>). Since IL-33 is a known driver of ILC2 expansion, and GWAS studies have linked <italic>IL33</italic> to pregnancy abnormalities, we examined <italic>Il33</italic>-citrine reporter mice (<italic>Il33</italic><sup><italic>cit/wt</italic></sup>) for the presence of IL-33 expression in the uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hardman et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, we identified <italic>Il33</italic>-citrine<sup>+</sup> cells, mainly localized in the myometrium, where ILC2s reside, with some <italic>Il33-</italic>citrine expression also in the decidua (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). Cells expressing <italic>Il33</italic> were restricted to the stromal CD45<sup>-ve</sup> population in the myometrium at both midgestation (gestation day 9.5 = gd9.5) and term (gd18.5) (<bold>Fig. S1B, C</bold>), and this is consistent with IL-33 protein levels in the uterus (<bold>Fig. S1D</bold>). Dams deficient in both copies of <italic>Il33</italic> (<italic>Il33</italic><sup><italic>cit/cit</italic></sup>, hereafter referred to as IL-33KO mice) have a 90% reduction in the total number of uILC2s (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref></bold>), demonstrating the vital role that IL-33 plays in ILC2 homeostasis in the uterus. Although similar to the mouse, human CD127<sup>hi</sup> uILC2s are virtually absent in the uterine mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Doisne et al 2015</xref>), we have now identified uILC2s within CD127<sup>low/-ve</sup> cells in both the non-pregnant endometrium and the decidua (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1SE, F</xref></bold>). These results show that both murine and human uterine tissues contain small populations of uILC2s, which, like in other tissues, in the mouse depend on and colocalise with IL-33.</p>

<title>Fetal growth restriction in fetuses of ILC2-deficient dams</title>
<p>Since uILC2s expand during pregnancy and ILC2s are known regulators of tissue physiology, we reasoned that, despite the small number of uILC2 in the uterus, they may also play important roles in reproduction and fetal development. To test this hypothesis, we utilised <italic>Rora</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>Il7ra</italic><sup><italic>cre/wt</italic></sup> ILC2-deficient mice (hereafter referred to as ILC2KO mice), in which the RORα transcription factor that is critical for ILC2 development is deleted in IL7Rα-expressing ILC2s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Oliphant et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schlenner et al., 2010</xref>). As expected, maternal uILC2s were undetectable in the uterus of ILC2KO females mated with wild-type males (<bold>♀</bold>ILC2KO x ♂WT), whereas normal numbers of maternal uILC2s at mid-gestation were present in the uterus of WT females mated with ILC2KO males (<bold>♀</bold>WT x ♂ILC2KO) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). It is important to note that the genetic make-up of the fetuses and their placentas are equivalent in both crosses. Strikingly, although gestation goes to term with unaltered litter sizes and low perinatal mortality in both <bold>♀</bold>ILC2KO x WT and reverse <bold>♀</bold>WT x ♂ ILC2KO cross (Fig. <bold>S2A</bold>), fetuses at term (gd 18.5) from <bold>♀</bold>ILC2KO x ♂WT cross are on average about 8% lighter than fetuses from the reverse <bold>♀</bold>WT x ♂ILC2KO cross (1.105+/- 0.01 gr and 1.203+/-0.008 gr, respectively, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). Thus, the absence of maternal ILC2s, and not the fetal genotype, is responsible for intrauterine fetal growth restriction (FGR) in this model. Similarly, the <bold>♀</bold>IL-33KO x ♂WT cross produce lighter fetuses (1.089+/-0.018 gr), further supporting the hypothesis that the maternal IL-33-ILC2 pathway is important for optimal fetal growth. The ratio between fetal weight and placental weight is a gross indicator of placental efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fowden et al., 2009</xref>), with the fetus weighing normally about 15 times its placenta at term. Interestingly, we found that both the ♀ILC2KO x ♂WT and the <bold>♀</bold>IL-33KO x ♂WT crosses result in significantly reduced fetal/placental weight ratio compared with those from control crosses (<bold>Fig. S2B</bold>). Moreover, the lack of maternal IL-33 also affects placental growth as the placentas generated in the <bold>♀</bold>IL-33KO x ♂WT crosses are heavier than controls (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>). FGR is usually caused by placental insufficiency, to which fetuses respond with the brain-sparing effect, a phenomenon that spares the fetal brain from hypoxia but exposes it to neurological disorders later in life. Notably, measurements of 3D-reconstructed CT-scan images of fetus head demonstrated that fetuses carried by dams lacking ILC2s (<bold>♀</bold>ILC2KO x ♂WT) display significantly smaller head diameter than those carried by ILC2 sufficient dams (<bold>♀</bold>WT x ♂ILC2KO, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-D</xref></bold>). The brain volume, but not the femur length of these fetuses is also reduced (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-E</xref></bold>), suggesting that bone development may be less affected than brain development. However, the ratio between brain volume and the total body weight is similar in fetuses from both crosses, suggestive of overall symmetric FGR (<bold>Fig. S2C</bold>). Taken together, these data highlight the importance of the maternal IL-33-ILC2 pathway in placental efficiency and fetal growth.</p>

<title>Abnormal utero-placental adaptations to pregnancy in ILC2KO dams</title>
<p>In an attempt to determine the nature of FGR in fetuses of ILC2-deficient dams, we analysed the decidua (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref></bold>) and the placenta (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">E</xref></bold>) of these mice to seek evidence of abnormalities in the utero-placental unit. Uterine arteries undergo a critical transformation early in human and murine gestation, so that the lumen increases to provide blood supply to the placenta. Strikingly, in ILC2KO dams the decidual vessels/lumen ratio is greater than in WT dams (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>), suggesting insufficient widening of the uterine arteries. During uterine vascular remodelling, arterial smooth muscle actin becomes degraded at mid-gestation, a process readily visible in WT dams, but clearly less pronounced in ILC2KO dams (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>), confirming sub-optimal vascular changes. ILC2s secrete type-2 cytokines and in their absence the uterine immune microenvironment may be dysregulated. We measured transcripts of inflammatory cytokines and found significantly enhanced expression of <italic>Il1b</italic> in the decidua of ILC2KO dams, suggesting a pro-inflammatory microenvironment (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>). Furthermore, we found that the expression of 4 genes coding for glucose and amino acid transporters (<italic>Glut1, Glut3, Snat2</italic> and <italic>Snat4</italic>) is enhanced in term placentas of ILC2KO dams, suggesting compensatory placental mechanisms occur in an attempt to optimise the supply of nutrients in the face of an adverse environment caused by maternal ILC2 deficiency (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>). Increased maternal blood spaces in the placentas of ILC2KO dams also support this idea (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref></bold> and <bold>Fig. S3, and Table S1</bold>). These results demonstrate that maternal ILC2s contribute to the widening of the decidual vessels and also counteract the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in the decidua, two roles that can affect placental function. Taken together these data suggest the placentas adopt compensatory mechanisms which serve to optimise nutrient and oxygen delivery to the fetus in ILC2KO dams.</p>

<title>Comparative transcriptome analysis of uterine, lymph node and lung ILC2s</title>
<p>We next turned to a molecular analysis to understand functions that may explain the contribution of uILC2s to the utero-placental unit. Considering the previously reported differences in the functional profile of ILC2s in the uterus and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Doisne et al., 2015</xref>), we set out to analyse the transcriptome of uILC2s to determine their molecular identity. To do this, we compared the genome-wide transcriptome of murine ILC2s of the uterus (from virgin WT mice and from dams of <bold>♀</bold>WT x ♂WT crosses, at mid-gestation and at term), the lung and the lymph nodes (mesenteric, para-aortic and inguinal lymph nodes pooled together) of virgin WT mice. Principal component analysis showed that uILC2s cluster separately from ILC2s purified from the lung and the lymph nodes (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>), suggesting uterine-specific features. To identify uterine-specific genes in uILC2s we generated a gene list comparing the three uterine ILC2 populations to those of lung and lymph nodes. We found that 3,279 genes were upregulated in uILC2s (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>). These included canonical ILC2-signature genes such as <italic>Gata3</italic> and <italic>Il1rl1</italic> (coding for the IL-33 receptor ST-2), as well as <italic>Il4, Il5, Il13</italic>, and <italic>Areg</italic> coding for Amphiregulin, which could regulate trophoblast growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lysiak et al., 1995</xref>). High levels of <italic>Arg1</italic> coding for Arginase-1 are also detected in uILC2s. Arginase-1 regulates bioenergetics and type-2 immune responses in lung ILC2s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Monticelli et al., 2016</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,C</xref></bold>). Interestingly, as well as being more highly expressed in uILC2s, these type-2 genes also increase in uILC2s as pregnancy progresses, with highest expression levels at term. Genes associated with immunoregulation are also upregulated in uILC2s, including <italic>Ctla4, Foxp3, Tgfb1</italic> and <italic>Tgfb2</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,D</xref></bold>). Heat maps of expression of these selected genes across gestation and, in comparison with lung and lymph node, showed that the enhanced type-2 signature and the expression of immunomodulatory genes in uILC2s both increase with gestation (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C, D</xref></bold>). Protein expression analysis by flow cytometry supported RNA-seq findings that uILC2 have an enhanced type-2 signature and distinct functions compared to lung resident ILC2s. uILC2s showed higher expression of IL-5 and ST-2 in response to IL-25 and IL-33, as well as constitutively higher expression of CTLA-4 and FoxP3, than lung ILC2s (<bold>Fig. S4A-C</bold>). Other genes upregulated in uILC2s include non-cytotoxic granzymes <italic>Gzma, Gzmc, Gzmd, Gzme, Gzmf, Gzmg, Gzmk</italic>, most likely involved in tissue remodeling and <italic>Csf1</italic>, encoding CSF-1, a crucial regulator of macrophages and DC dynamics in the uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tagliani et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, Gene Ontology analysis also highlighted the expression of genes involved in controlling recruitment and homeostasis of T cells, eosinophils and myeloid cells, such as <italic>Ccl5, Csf1, Csf2, Csf2rb, Csf2rb2, Csf3, Cxcl2</italic>, as well as genes mediating the response to oestrogens and estradiol and the oestrogen receptor <italic>Ers1</italic> (<bold>Fig. S4D</bold> and <bold>Table S2</bold>). The combined higher expression of GATA-3, IL-5 and ST-2 in uILC2s showcases their enhanced type-2 profiles compared to lung and lymph node. This suggests that uILC2s have uterine-specific regulatory functions that may support gestation. Moreover, the expression of genes likely to regulate other immune cells suggest that the role of uILC2s in gestation may also be mediated through interaction with these cells in the uterus.</p>

<title>ILC2s maintain a type-2 immune environment in the uterus</title>
<p>The gene signature analysis of uILC2s suggests multiple interactions with different cell types in the uterus. We therefore hypothesized that cell types interacting with ILC2s may be affected and their number altered in the absence of uILC2s. We found that, at midgestation, the uterus of ILC2KO dams had increased dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils and macrophages, with extremely low number of eosinophils, as detected by flow cytometry (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A, B</xref>)</bold>. Macrophages and DCs were also visualized in uterine sections and appeared more abundant in ILC2KO dams (<bold>Fig. S5A</bold>). Mouse macrophages can be broadly distinguished as inflammatory M1 and alternatively activated M2 subsets, based on the expression of MHC class II molecules being higher in M1 subsets. We found that both subsets were increased in the uterus of ILC2KO dams, with a more pronounced increase in M1 macrophages (<bold>Fig. S5B, C</bold>). However, the numbers of uterine lymphocytes, including decidual group 1 ILC subsets (composed of tissue-resident uNK cells, conventional NK cells and uterine ILC1s) and T cells, were unaffected (<bold>Fig. S5D-E</bold>). This suggests that ILC2s preferentially affect the numbers of uterine myeloid cells. Notably, the anomalies in myeloid cell composition are restricted to the uterus as the numbers of DCs and macrophages in the spleen of ILC2KO dams were normal, as were the number of total splenic CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref></bold>). The lack of uILC2s may be expected to affect the cytokine milieu in the uterus. Strikingly, when we analysed type-2 cytokines expression in the uterus of ILC2KO dams at mid-gestation, we found that <italic>Il4, Il5</italic> and <italic>Il13</italic> transcripts were barely detectable, or much reduced, compared to WT uteri (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref></bold>). We also found profound skewing in gene expression profile of uterine DCs with reduced <italic>Il4, Arg1, Chi3l3, Clec7a, Mrc1</italic> and <italic>Retnla</italic> expression and modestly elevated inflammatory <italic>Il1b</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref></bold>), consistent with increased decidual <italic>Il1b</italic> expression in these dams (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref></bold>). Similar skewing was observed in uterine macrophages, with reduced <italic>Il4, Arg1</italic>, and <italic>Chi3l3</italic> expression (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref></bold>). In line with this finding, fewer uterine DCs and macrophages in ILC2KO dams produced Arginase-1 as detected by intracellular flow cytometry (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E-F</xref></bold>), suggesting that both uterine DCs and macrophages were less polarised towards alternative activation in the absence of ILC2s. These results show that uILC2s maintain a type-2 anti-inflammatory immune environment in the pregnant uterus, including orchestrating the reprogramming of gene expression in uterine DCs and macrophages towards alternative activation to promote tissue remodeling conducive to fetal development.</p>

<title>ILC2-deficiency leads to enhanced endotoxin-induced abortion that correlates with expansion of IL-1β-producing uterine DC</title>
<p>The observed skewed immune microenvironment in the uterus of ILC2KO dams results in the observed utero-placental abnormalities and FGR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and Fig.3 and S3). It is also possible that the effects of the dysregulated uterine micro-environment observed in ILC2KO dams may have more severe consequences during pregnancy complications such as infection. To address this hypothesis and test whether ILC2s may also protect the fetus, we administered a dose of lipopolysaccaride (LPS) that induced ~50% fetal loss in WT and <italic>IL7ra</italic><sup><italic>cre/wt</italic></sup> control dams, to mimic a systemic bacterial infection (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref></bold> and data not shown). Notably, fetal loss was increased in ILC2KO dams, reaching over 80% (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A, B</xref></bold>), suggesting a protective role of uILC2s in this system. No difference in uterine <italic>Il6, Tnfa</italic> and <italic>Ifng</italic> gene expression was detected (data not shown). However, uterine <italic>Retnla</italic> transcripts significantly decreased and <italic>Il1b</italic> increased upon LPS administration in ILC2KO dams. Interestingly, and in line with the results in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, both <italic>Retnla</italic> and <italic>Il1b</italic> transcripts of sham-treated ILC2KO dams were altered (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref></bold>). We also measured protein levels of type-2 and inflammatory cytokines in the uterus and plasma of both sham-treated and LPS-treated dams. Supporting the key role of ILC2s in maintaining a type-2 immune environment, IL-5 was significantly decreased both in the uterus and plasma of ILC2KO dams, and in both sham- and LPS-treated conditions (<bold>Fig. S6A-B</bold>). Uterine IL-6 was not significantly changed in either group of mice regardless of treatment. However, plasma IL-6 was increased upon LPS-treatment in ILC2KO, compared with WT dams (<bold>Fig. S6A-B</bold>). IL-1β was increased in both the uterus and in plasma of ILC2KO dams upon LPS challenge (<bold>Fig. S6A-B</bold>). Interestingly, sham-treated ILC2KO dams also showed a tendency to generate higher levels of both pro-IL-1β and mature IL-1β in the uterus compared to WT dams (<bold>Fig. S6C</bold>). Additionally, the number of IL-6 and TNF-α-producing macrophages in sham-treated ILC2KO dams is greater than in WT dams (<bold>Fig S6D</bold>). These results show increased endotoxin-induced fetal loss in pregnant mice lacking ILC2s and confirm that ILC2s sustain type-2 immunity. In the absence of ILC2s, more inflammatory cytokines are produced both locally and systemically, in response to endotoxin as well as constitutively. Thus, maternal ILC2s protect against exaggerated inflammatory responses by maintaining a balanced immune microenvironment and by preventing expansion of specific inflammatory cell types and cytokines that exacerbate pregnancy complications.</p>

<title>ILC2s provide a protective feedback mechanism by constraining the expansion of IL-1β-producing DCs induced by endotoxin</title>
<p>We hypothesised that uILC2s may counter the detrimental effects of inflammatory cytokines produced by other uterine cells, thus preventing endotoxin-induced fetal loss. Intracellular staining confirmed that a higher proportion of DCs from sham-treated ILC2KO mice expressed the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, as compared to controls, confirming a pro-inflammatory environment prior to exposure to endotoxin (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref></bold>). To dissect underlying mechanisms, we isolated leukocytes from WT mice at mid-gestation and stimulated them with LPS <italic>in vitro</italic>. This induced elevated numbers of ILC2s producing type-2 cytokine IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 as determined by intracellular cytokine staining (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref></bold>). It has been shown previously that ILC2s do not respond directly to LPS, as they lack TLR4. However, ILC2s can respond to IL-1β, which is released by DCs and macrophages, by increasing type-2 cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ohne et al., 2016</xref>). To test if LPS-driven IL-1β-release was responsible for activating uILC2 <italic>in vitro</italic> we added an IL-1R antagonist to the uterine leukocyte cultures. The inhibition of IL-1 signalling completely abrogated the LPS-driven expansion of ILC2s producing type-2 cytokines (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref></bold>). Consistent with the <italic>ex-vivo</italic> data showing LPS-driven expansion of inflammatory cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and S6), <italic>in vitro</italic> LPS-treated DCs from uILC2KO mice had a greater propensity to produce IL-1β (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref></bold>). Notably, the addition of either IL-4 or IL-5 to LPS-treated DCs reduced the expression of IL-1β (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref></bold>). Taken together, these results show that uILC2s respond to endotoxin-induced DC-derived IL-1β by increasing type-2 cytokines. In a protective feedback mechanism, these type-2 cytokines in turn suppress IL-1β-producing DCs in the uterus, and help maintain a safe environment for the fetus.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Dissecting the mechanisms by which tissue resident immune cells mediate both physiological and pathological processes is one of the most exciting challenge facing modern immunologists. Our data add a new pathway to the immune regulation of pregnancy. The whole-genome transcriptome analysis comparing uterine with lung and lymph node ILC2s shows that uterine ILC2s have an enhanced type-2 immune signature. The cellular and molecular changes in the uterus of ILC2 deficient dams showed that uILC2s are crucial for the establishment and maintenance of type-2 immunity, which is required for optimal fetal growth and for safeguarding the fetus during infection (<bold>Fig. S7</bold>). Because the mouse model we use is not tissue-specific, we cannot exclude the effects of systemic ILC2s, although it is clear that maternal, not fetal ILC2s, contribute both to fetal growth and protection from endotoxin-induced abortion.</p>
<p>We have also identified an additional role for IL-1β in regulating the uILC2 response through the upregulation of type-2 cytokine production. IL-4 and IL-5 limit the expansion of IL-1β-producing DCs induced by endotoxin in a protective feedback mechanism that helps to maintain a safe environment for the fetus. Here we show that in the absence of uILC2s an acute inflammatory challenge results in elevated endotoxin-induced IL-1β production, a decreased type-2 response, and enhanced fetal loss. Since we also show that uILC2s respond to IL-1β by upregulating IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, these results support a role for uILC2s in protecting the fetus by counteracting the effects of endotoxin-induced IL-1β and the resulting pro-inflammatory environment. While IL-4 may act directly on DCs, IL-5 may operate indirectly through tissue eosinophils (which are greatly reduced in the absence of uILC2), which in turn produce IL-4. In the adipose tissue eosinophils and ILC2s collaborate to induce the switch of macrophages from M1 to M2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Molofsky et al., 2013</xref>). A similar mechanism may occur in the uterus, thus linking the low levels of <italic>Il4</italic> and eosinophils to the decrease in alternative activation in uterine DCs and macrophages observed in ILC2KO mice. It is notable that uILC2 respond to IL-1β by upregulating type-2 cytokines. This is distinct from the response reported for lung and gut ILC2s, where ILC2s exposed to IL-1β convert into IFN−γ producing ILCs, and thus contribute to the inflammatory pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ohne et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Silver et al., 2016</xref>). This may reflect the more profoundly type-2 environment encountered in the uterus, and the differential thresholds for mounting type-1 responses in the different tissues following pathogen exposure. Interestingly, in line with our results, human IL-4 and IL-13 downregulate LPS-induced inflammation in explanted gestation tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bryant et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, uterine and placental deficiency in IL-4 are associated with pregnancy complications in response to inflammatory stimuli in both murine and human pregnancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wang et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The increased expression of FoxP3 and CTLA-4 in uILC2s that accompanies higher GATA-3, IL-5 and ST-2 expression, may be mediated by IL-33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wallrapp et al., 2017</xref>) and suggests that uILC2s may overlap with the intestinal regulatory ILCs (ILCregs) that contribute to resolution of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast with uterine ILC2s, however, ILCregs express low levels of <italic>Gata3, Il5</italic> and <italic>IL13</italic> excluding an overlapping phenotype. It may be argued, nevertheless, that uterine ILC2s, through expressing immune regulatory molecules Foxp3 and CTLA-4, may contribute to immunological tolerance of the fetus. The traditional view on immune regulation during pregnancy is that type-2 responses are required to maintain maternal tolerance of the fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Offenbacher Champagne et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sykes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wegmann et al., 1993</xref>), but KO mouse models deficient for type-2 cytokines have so far failed to show obvious phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bonney, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fallon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Robertson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Svensson et al., 2001</xref>). However, our crosses were syngeneic and therefore not conducive to address this issue.</p>
<p>While we have shown the importance of the IL-33-dependent ILC2s axis in suppressing inflammatory DCs and protecting against endotoxin-induced abortion, precisely how ILC2s regulate placental function and fetal growth remains to be determined. The failure to achieve the genetically determined growth potential in fetuses may be due to inadequate maternal or placental responses to fetal demands. Our data clearly show that fetal growth restriction is linked to the maternal genotype and that maternal ILC2s influence the utero-placental unit. Other maternal ILC subsets, notably uNK cells, have clearly been shown to regulate the utero-placental unit, with consequences on fetal and placental growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gaynor &amp; Colucci, 2017</xref>). The feto-placental phenotype of dams with hypofunctional or reduced uNK cells partially overlaps with that of ILC2-deficient dams, including incomplete uterine decidual adaptations, placental insufficiency and fetal growth restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ashkar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Boulenouar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kieckbusch et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, ILC2-deficient dams show spontaneously increased <italic>Il1b</italic> and decreased <italic>Il4, Il5</italic> and <italic>Il13</italic> transcripts in the uterus, together with cell-intrinsic gene signatures consistent with polarization towards inflammatory responses in resident uterine DCs and macrophages, alongside dysregulated immune cells consistent with a pro-inflammatory environment. Accordingly, the endometrium of women with recurrent pregnancy loss shows features of a pro-inflammatory microenvironment with reduced tolerogenic DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Liu et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>IL-1β is a highly pleiotropic cytokine that may play multiple roles in pregnancy and <italic>IL1B</italic> polymorphism is linked to miscarriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). The poor decidual arterial remodelling and placental transport capacity observed in ILC2 deficient dams can be caused by elevated IL-1β levels and is expected to reduce blood supply of resources, subsequently leading to reduced fetal growth in later pregnancy. Although IL-1β does not cross the placenta, it can directly affect the invading fetal trophoblast. Maternal or placental IL-1β is known to reduce insulin signalling in human trophoblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aye et al., 2013</xref>). The nature of fetal signals that regulate placental allocation of maternal resources is largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Constância et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Higgins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jansson, 2016</xref>). Fetal genes do regulate fetal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Warrington et al.,2019</xref>), however maternal genotype also influences placental functions and fetal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kieckbusch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sferruzzi-Perri et al., 2016</xref>). It is conceivable that fetal growth restriction in ILC2KO dams might have been even more marked in the absence of placental adaptations later in pregnancy, such as increased expression of transporter genes and greater maternal blood spaces. Similar compensatory strategies are seen in other adverse gestational environments, like undernutrition, hypoxia and obesity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Constância et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Higgins et al., 2016</xref>). This may be the first study to describe placental adaptation to an immune-mediated stress.</p>
<p>Growth restricted fetuses are associated with asymmetric growth because a circulatory adaptation preferentially shunts blood to the head, preserving its growth. ILC2KO dams produced symmetric fetal growth restriction, with no apparent brain sparing. The lack of brain sparing may be due to the low degree of growth restriction, which may be relatively well tolerated and therefore does not trigger the circulatory adaptation. Future work will be required to dissect the mechanisms and assess the extent of defective fetal growth in ILC2 KO dams.</p>
<p>Despite these anomalies in ILC2KO dams, they have litters of normal size with low neonatal mortality. Therefore, the immune dysregulation found in ILC2KO dams seems to be relatively well tolerated under pathogen-free conditions and in steady state. By contrast, increased neonatal mortality has been reported in pups from ST-2 KO dams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bartemes et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that maternal IL-33 signaling may affects additional pathways that also impact on neonatal survival.</p>
<p>In conclusion, IL-33 dependent maternal ILC2s emerge as key cells in maintaining a healthy utero-placental environment conducive to both fetal growth and protection against endotoxin-induced abortion (<bold>Fig. S7</bold>). Our data establish that maternal ILC2s are critical for the achievement of genetically determined fetal growth potential and for safeguarding the fetus by preventing abortion induced by systemic endotoxin insult.</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Diagram showing tissue localisation of uterine (u) macrophages (blue), dendritic cells (DCs, orange), NK cells (red) and ILC2s (green) in virgin WT mice, and in dams from ♀WT x ♂WT crosses at mid-gestation (gestation day 9.5 = gd9.5) and at term (gd18.5). The mesometrial lymphoid aggregate of pregnancy (MLAp), that forms in dams between the two uterine smooth muscle layers is highlighted. Representative flow cytomery data show CD45<sup>+ve</sup> NK1.1<sup>-ve</sup> NKp46<sup>-ve</sup> CD11b<sup>-ve</sup> CD3<sup>-ve</sup> CD19<sup>-ve</sup> CD90<sup>+ve</sup> CD127<sup>+ve</sup> uILC2s at each time point during pregnancy.

<p><bold>Figure S7: Summary diagram of the proposed mechanism</bold></p>
<p>Diagram summarising the molecular mechanism of the roles ILC2s play during physiological pregnancy and bacterial infection. In normal pregnancy, uILC2s sustain the production of type-2 cytokines to favour type-2 polarisation of myeloid cells. This controlled immune environment promotes normal decidual vascularization, placental function and fetal growth. In murine models lacking ILC2s, these processes are compromised leading to FGR, including reduced brain volume. During systemic endotoxin challenge, LPS activates DCs and macrophages in the uterus, which produce inflammatory cytokines (including IL-1β), which in turn stimulate uterine ILC2s to produce more type-2 immune cytokines, thus contrasting IL-1β-producing DCs and protecting against excessive inflammation. In the absence of maternal ILC2s in pregnant KO females, the excess of uterine myeloid cells and their inflammatory cytokine production cannot be counterbalanced by prompt production of type-2 cytokines, resulting in enhanced rate of abortion.</p>

<p>Uterine tissues were dissected at gd9.5 and fixed in 10% formalin for 5h at RT. Tissues were paraffin-embedded and cut into serial sections at 7μm. To assess arterial remodeling sections were stained in 50% Hematoxylin Gill (Sigma) and Eosin (Sigma) and evaluated as described in Kieckbusch et al, Jove, 2015(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kieckbusch, Gaynor, et al., 2015</xref>).To assess macrophage infiltration antigen retrieval with either proteinase K (Sigma) or sodium citrate buffer was perfomed followed by avidin-biotin blocking (Vector Labs), endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked in 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in ddH<sub>2</sub>O to avoid non-specific staining. Macrophages were stained with Rat IgG2b anti-mouse anti F4/80 (MCA497A488T BioRad) with Immpress Kit (Vector labs). To detect citrine mouse anti-mouse anti YFP (Abcam) and MOM kit (Vector Labs) combined with Vectastain Elite ABC-Alkaline phosphatase kit (Vector Labs) were used. To stain for DCs sections in cryo-embedded uterine tissue from pregnant females at gd9.5 were cut at 7μm and fixed in 4% formalin. Rat IgG2b anti-mouse anti MHC I-a/I-e (Biolegend) was used in combination with impress-AP (Vector Labs) and Hamster anti mouse CD11c (Biolegend) was used in combination with biotinylated secondary anti-hamster IgG (Vector Labs) and Vectastain Elite ABC-HRP kit (Vector Labs). We used VectorRed (Vector Labs) and SigmaFast DAB (Sigma) as Alkaline Phosphate and Peroxidase substrate. To assess placental morphology placentas were dissected at gd18.5, processed as described above and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Absolute and percentage volumes of the placental labyrinthine and junctional zones (Lz and Jz respectively) as described previously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Coan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sferruzzi-Perri et al., 2016</xref>) was determined by point counting using the Computer Assisted Stereological Toolbox (CAST v2.0; Olympus). To assess Lz composition and component volumes, placental sections were double-labelled with rabbit antibodies against cytokeratin (Thermo-Fisher Scientific 180059) and lectin (Vector Labs B-1205) to identify trophoblast and fetal capillaries respectively, and counterstained with haematoxylin and eosin. For lectin visualisation antigen retrieval with 10mM sodium citrate buffer was performed, endogenous peroxidases were quenched and samples were blocked using 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS and incubated overnight with lectin antibody (1:50 dilution in PBS) at 4°C. Streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase complex (Strep-HRP Rockland S000-03, 1:250 in PBS) was then applied and Lectin was detected by staining with diaminobenzidine (Sigma) in saturated ammonium nickel (II) sulfate solution. Cytokeratin staining was perfomed similarly with the following modifications. Cytokeratin antibody (1:100 in 10% goat serum and 1%BSA/PBS), with an additional 1h incubation step with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody at room temperature was performed before Strep-HRP was added, nickel in the chromogen was omitted. Sections were dehydrated in increasing ethanol concentration and mounted with DPX. Omission of the primary antibodies was used as the negative control. Point counting was used to evaluate the fetal capillary (FC), trophoblast and maternal blood space (MBS) volume densities within the Lz, which were multiplied by the estimated Lz volume to acquire estimated volumes of individual components. Twenty random fields of view (320 points) were scored per placenta. MBS and FC surface densities were determined by counting the number of intersecting points along cycloid arcs in random fields of view. Multiplying these values by the estimated Lz volume provided the absolute surface areas, which averaged gives the total surface area available for exchange. Harmonic barrier thickness was estimated by measuring the shortest distance between FC and the closest MBS, calculating the mean of the reciprocal of those measures and then correcting for the plane of sectioning by a factor of 0.85. A total of 200 measurements were made for each Lz. Theoretical diffusion capacity was calculated by dividing the total surface area for exchange by the barrier thickness and multiplying by Krogh’s oxygen diffusion constant. Specific diffusion capacity was estimated by dividing theoretical diffusion capacity by the fetal mass. FC length densities per section were determined using counting frames and then converted to FC length and diameter. For citrine (<italic>Il33</italic>) detection in gd9.5 uteri, tissues were fixed in phosphate-buffered 1% formaldehyde (methanol-free, Thermo Fischer Scientific), transferred to 30% sucrose, embedded in 15% sucrose + 7.5% porcine skin gelatin (Sigma) in PBS and flash-frozen in isopentane −80°C. 10 μm sections were mounted on onto Superfrost Plus slides (Thermo Scientific) blocked using 1% donkey serum (Jackson Immunoresearch) in 0.05% Triton-X in PBS and citrine was detected using polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Life Technologies) (5 μg/ml) and alexa Fluor 488-labeled polyclonal donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Life Technologies) (4 μg/ml).

Fetuses were selected at random from each litter euthanized on ice then washed and immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde 4°C for 24 hours and stored in PBS + 0.2% sodium azide. Prior to scanning, fetuses were incubated in hydrogel solution at 4°C for 3 days for monomer hybridization, degassed and heated at 37°C for 3 hours to induce hydrogel polymerisation. Hydrogel was then removed and fetuses were washed in 0.5M iodine solution, washed and mounted in 1% agarose and scanned using a <italic>Nikon XT 225 micro-CT</italic> (resolution varied between approximately 9-11μm). Image stacks were processed in Amira 6.3 (<italic>FEI</italic>) software. Brain volume was manually segmented through voxel intensity threshold selection to visualise organ boundaries. Brain volume segmentation included olfactory lobes, cortices, cerebellar and medullae (segmented at superior aspect of spinal cord). Femur length was measured directly from the tip of the greater trochanter to the articulating border of the medial condyle (ensuring the head of femur and the lateral condyle were approximately perpendicular). There was no statistical relationship between brain volume and resolution/storage length.</p>

<title>LPS injections in pregnant mice</title>
<p>Mice were mated and the day of plug was considered gd0.5. LPS was injected intraperitoneally at gd7.5 (0.02mg/g LPS <italic>E coli</italic> 055:B5 (Sigma) to induce ~50% embryo death. At gd9.5 uterine tissues were collected, and embryo death, identified as black or red and dysmorphic, was evaluated. Uteri were then processed for mRNA extraction and RT-qPCR or flow cytometry. Alternatively, dams were injected with LPS at gd8.5 and uteri and blood samples were collected at gd9.5. Tissues were homogenised in 150mM NaCl, 20mM Tris, 1mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2mM PMSF, phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), and cOmplete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche). Plasma was obtained from blood samples by centrifugation. These samples were assayed using Pro-inflammatory cytokine assay (Mesoscale) or processed for mRNA extraction and RT-qPCR or flow cytometry. Uterine tissues were dissected and processed to extract myeloid cells (as described).</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study describes the protective role of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in tissue physiology and contributes to immunity, inflammatory pathology, and metabolism in maintaining homeostasis during pregnancy. The authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that ILC2s have new roles distinct from parasite protection and allergy inducers. Uterine ILC2s are key immune cells during normal and complicated pregnancies.</p>

<p>In this paper, authors used IL-33KO and ILC2KO mice to generate evidence for pregnancy specific enrichment of ILC2s and their unique molecular signatures. They documented that uterine ILC2s are distinct from the ILC2s residing in lung and lymph nodes. They have provided solid evidence that although litter size did not change, but fetuses from ILC2KO mice showed growth restriction. In the absence of ILC2s, LPS injections lead to increased abortion rates and fetal loss suggesting the critical role of ILC2s in protection against infection induced pathology. Most of the results presented in the paper support the conclusion, but in some instances the evidence is indirect. Some clarifications on experimental interpretations are required as below.</p>
<p>• The immunohistology experiments revealed that IL-33 predominately co-localizes with ILC2 in the myometrium, but the staining appears to be diffused throughout the myometrium. It is difficult to pinpoint ILC2 specific IL-33 colocalization. Is the decidual expression of IL-33 largely restricted to ILC2s? Also, IL-33 is produced by a variety of other cell types including endothelial cells, which is difficult to ascertain from the images in Fig 1.</p>
<p>
• Authors report that ILC2s are responsible for fetal growth restriction (FGR) noted in the ILC2 KO mice. They attribute FGR to utero-placental abnormalities but the experimental evidence, including spiral arterial remodelling and glucose transporter gene expression are indirect. Is there any compensation from other cell types such as macrophages in the absence of ILC2s as they reported increased dendritic cells, neutrophils, and macrophages in ILC2KO mice. Clarify whether IL-33 levels were consistent between WT and ILC2KO mice. How do these other increased numbers of macrophages, DCs and neutrophils fit in the FGR context besides gene expression changes they captured in DCs and macrophages.</p>
<p>
• They captured spiral arterial wall to lumen ratio alterations in ILC2KO mice suggesting sub-optimal vascular changes in ILC2KO mice. They did not find any changes in the uNK cells or IFN-production between WT and ILC2KO. What would be the mechanistic link between ILC2 and spiral arterial vascular changes. They indirectly link it to the IL1B gene expression.</p>
<p>
• In the LPS induced abortion in ILC2 KO mice experiments, how do they reconcile the predominant role of macrophages and LPS induced TNF-a in the pathology? They did not find any differences in the gene expression in the LPS induced signature cytokine, TNF-a despite increased numbers of macrophages in ILC2 KO mice. Clarification is required on whether these inflammatory alterations that they captured directly linked to utero-placental insufficiency between WT and ILC2KO. The type 2 cytokines were barely detectable in ILC2KO mice, which likely predispose them for utero-placental alterations.</p>

<p>Balmas et al., continue the previous work from multiple groups that suggested the implication of uterine ILC2s and signals that activate them, i.e., IL-33/ST2 axis, in healthy and complicated pregnancies and move forward to understand further their role. The authors leverage available and appropriate tools to address more specifically the role of ILC2s during pregnancy and endotoxin-induced abortion, namely mouse models of selective ILC2 deficiency (Roraflox/floxIl7raCre/wt) and transcriptomic analysis of the immune response.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate, and therewith confirm findings by Bartemes et al. (2018), that ILC2 reside in the mouse uterus, depend on IL-33 and expand during pregnancy. Moreover, they show the Il33 expression by CD45- cells of the uterine stroma. What remains unclear is the kinetics of Il33 expression and ILC2 expansion upon gestation and whether the local ILC2 population expands or arrives from the periphery.</p>
<p>Lack of maternal ILC2, in a mouse genetic model, resulted, as expected, in the absence of uILC2 but also in lighter fetuses at term, similar to the phenotype observed in the absence of maternal IL-33. It would be interesting to understand whether the effect of the IL-33 signaling is a direct ILC2 mediated effect, as for example by using the ST2flox/flox mice. Do the fetuses catch up in weight with their WT controls during weaning time? Do they have any long-term cognitive/behavioral impairment?</p>
<p>
The authors showcase the impairment in the remodeling of uterine wall vessels in dams lacking ILC2. It remains to be verified whether this is dependent on IL-33 and whether it is a direct effect of ILC2 or ILC2-dependent infiltration of eosinophils. Further, the absence of ILC2 is accompanied by an increase in Il1b in the uterine tissue suggesting that uILC2 contribute to the uterine microenvironment.</p>
<p>The authors perform RNA sequencing analysis on the bulk samples of uterine ILC2, where uILC2 cluster separately from corresponding lung and LN cells and are featured with higher expression of typical ILC2 markers. Somewhat odd, the authors report on the Foxp3/FoxP3 expression among uILC2, however the staining is not very bright and a Treg control as well as biological negative control should be provided. Moreover, FoxP3 is also not expressed among intestinal ILC2 with regulatory function (Wang et al. 2017). I suggest this data panel to be re-evaluated. A scRNA-Seq analysis would probably be more comprehensive in this case, but might be beyond the scope of this publication.</p>
<p>Absence of uILC2 results in the increased numbers of DCs, macrophages and neutrophils in the uterus, an impact which is not visible in the spleen, which is why the authors argue that this is a uterus-restricted phenomenon, although perturbances in the large intestine and lungs could be expected. Moreover, it remains to be investigated whether these effects are restricted to mid-term pregnancy or preserved until term.</p>
<p>Upon establishing the role of uILC2 in maintaining healthy pregnancy, the authors demonstrate a role for uILC2 in endotoxin-mimicked bacterial infection and abortion. An impressive set of data demonstrate that dams that lack uILC2 have a significantly higher fetus resorption rate than WT dams upon LPS challenge. It remains to be understood whether this phenotype is also dependent on IL-33. Finally, mechanistically, using a somewhat reductionist in vitro model, the authors suggest a protective feedback mechanism between type 2-secreting uILC2 and IL-1b-expressing DCs. This is an interesting concept that still needs a formal confirmation in vivo. Are uILC2 also subjected to plasticity upon IL-1b treatment (Ohne et al. 2016)?</p>
<p>In conclusion, the authors provide a well-conceived study that will be useful for reproductive and tissue immunologists. The data are collected using validated models and methodology and analyzed in a solid manner and can be used as a starting point for further mechanistic studies, assessing the protective potential of uILC2 in pregnancy during infections.</p>

<p>The authors show that ILC2s seem to be important during pregnancy to achieve an optimal fetal growth. This is an important finding to the field and provides ILC2s with new roles distinct from parasite protection and allergy inducers. However, the fetal weight restriction phenotype does not seem very striking. Moreover, the mechanism by which ILC2s promote homeostasis in pregnancy are not well shown. The data shown in Figure 3 is overall a bit confusing and does not lead the reader to the conclusions stated in the text. Figure 4 conclusions are not very informative. The authors also show that ILC2s are protective to fetal loss during LPS infection. Again, the means by which ILC2s could be doing so are not well presented and the supporting data not fully convincing. Throughout the manuscript, the authors present quantitative data as fold change, expressing data in fold change is not as clear as showing actual numbers of cells for each group. Moreover, they should show the flow cytometry plots and gating strategy for all their FACS analysis.</p>
