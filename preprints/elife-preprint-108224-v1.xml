<title>Abstract</title><p>Genetic studies of human embryonic morphogenesis are constrained by ethical and practical challenges, restricting insights into developmental mechanisms and disorders. Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)–derived organoids provide a powerful alternative for the study of embryonic morphogenesis. However, screening for genetic drivers of morphogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> has been infeasible due to organoid variability and the high costs of performing scaled tissue-wide single-gene perturbations. By overcoming both these limitations, we developed a platform that integrates reproducible organoid morphogenesis with uniform single-gene perturbations, enabling high-throughput arrayed CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening in hPSC-derived organoids. To demonstrate the power of this platform, we screened 77 transcription factors in an organoid model of anterior neurulation to identify <italic>ZIC2</italic>, <italic>SOX11</italic>, and <italic>ZNF521</italic> as essential regulators of neural tube closure. We discovered that <italic>ZIC2</italic> and <italic>SOX11</italic> are required for closure, while <italic>ZNF521</italic> prevents ectopic closure points. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of perturbed organoids revealed co-regulated gene targets of <italic>ZIC2</italic> and <italic>SOX11</italic> and an opposing role for <italic>ZNF521</italic>, suggesting that these transcription factors jointly govern a gene regulatory program driving neural tube closure in the anterior forebrain region. Our single-gene perturbation platform enables high-throughput genetic screening of <italic>in vitro</italic> models of human embryonic morphogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pioneering genetic screens in model organisms—including notable work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> and zebrafish <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>—demonstrate that key regulators of embryonic morphology and tissue patterning are revealed by organism-wide gene perturbations. Performing analogous screens in human embryos is prohibited for ethical reasons, and screens in mammalian model organisms present significant challenges: generating clonal knockout lines in mice is expensive <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and direct translation to human biology is complicated by species-specific differences in gene regulation, developmental timing, and tissue organization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)–derived organoids offer an attractive alternative for modeling human embryonic morphogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic>. Advances in three-dimensional differentiation have enabled the generation of increasingly complex organoid models that recapitulate the development of different human tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. The growing reproducibility of these models following the incorporation of bioengineering methods <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> makes them ideally suited for genetic perturbation screens. Despite progress, it remains challenging to interrogate the effects of genes on morphogenesis at scale. High-throughput screens to understand gene function in organoids have relied on CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches in which organoids are transduced with a pooled lentiviral library, with each virus carrying guide RNAs targeting a distinct gene. The approach produces mosaic organoids where multiple genes are knocked down in distinct cell sub-populations within the same organoid <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. This degree of mosaicism makes it impossible to study tissue-wide morphogenesis, which occurs via the coordination of genes acting across many cells. Pooled screens are limited to single-cell genomic, epigenomic, or transcriptomic profiling as a readout of gene function, in contrast to morphological phenotypes assessed by classical screens in developmental biology.</p>
<p>The study of morphogenesis at scale <italic>in vitro</italic> requires the ability to knock out or knock down genes individually throughout entire organoids. This typically requires the generation of knockout or knockdown cell lines through clonal analysis, a process that is prohibitive for high-throughput applications due to the cost and labor involved in isolating and expanding correctly edited clones <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The ability to achieve homogeneous gene knockdown across a cell population in a non-clonal manner—using technologies such as CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)—could enable high-throughput morphological screens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Lentiviruses carrying CRISPRi guide RNAs offer a means to perform such non-clonal knockdowns, and if delivered with high efficiency, can eliminate the need for clonal purification and expansion. However, this strategy faces several challenges: current protocols to generate high-titer lentivirus relies on laborious and time-consuming concentration steps which are not amenable to high-throughput workflows <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, and it is difficult to achieve high-efficiency lentiviral transduction without associated cell death <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Overcoming these critical challenges would enable genetic perturbations at a scale not currently feasible in organoids or mammalian model systems, allowing systematic interrogation of the genes that drive human embryonic morphogenesis.</p>
<p>Here, by developing a method to generate and apply high-titer lentivirus directly to stem cells in parallelized small volumes, we established a high-throughput arrayed CRISPRi platform for uniform knockdown of individual genes across whole hPSC-derived organoids. To demonstrate the utility of this platform, we applied it to study anterior neurulation, a critical morphogenetic event in brain formation in which the flat anterior neural plate bends and fuses to form a closed neural tube <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Defects in anterior neural tube closure cause anencephaly, which is embryonic lethal. This lethality limits genetic linkage and association studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and makes anterior neurulation of critical importance to study <italic>in vitro</italic>. To systematically determine genes required for anterior neurulation, we established a robust <italic>in vitro</italic> hPSC-derived anterior neural tube organoid model and used our CRISPRi platform to screen 77 individual candidate genes encoding transcription factors for their contribution to neural tube morphogenesis. We found that <italic>ZIC2</italic> and <italic>SOX11</italic> are required for anterior neural tube closure and co-regulate a gene expression program in opposition to <italic>ZNF521</italic>, which is required to prevent ectopic closure points. These findings show the impact of scalable single-gene perturbations in identifying genes driving morphogenetic processes <italic>in vitro</italic> and have direct implications for understanding the genetic causes of congenital malformations.</p>

<title>A reproducible <italic>in vitro</italic> model of human anterior neurulation</title>
<p>We previously discovered that when spatially arranged human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived epiblast-like cysts are exposed to posteriorizing signals, they break symmetry and undergo patterning <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Building on this approach, we established an organoid model of human anterior neurulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Briefly, we seeded hPSCs onto a glass coverslip containing hexagonally arranged 250-micron-diameter micropatterns of extracellular matrix (Matrigel), including a central micropattern (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>), with 100-micron edge-to-edge spacing. After allowing hPSCs to form epithelial colonies on micropatterns, we embedded them in concentrated Matrigel, prompting hPSC colonies to fold into epithelial cysts with apicobasal polarity and single lumens. To induce anterior neural and surface ectoderm fates, we inhibited BMP, TGFβ, and WNT signaling for two days, then added recombinant human BMP4 for four days with continued TGFβ and WNT inhibition (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B-S1D</xref>, Methods) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Under these signaling conditions, the spatially arranged cysts differentiated into organoids with inward-facing neural ectoderm (NCAD+) and outward-facing (ECAD+, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Over the course of four days of BMP4 exposure, differentiating cysts displayed hallmarks of anterior primary neurulation, including thickening and elevation of the neural plate (Day 2), basal apposition of the neural and surface ectoderm (Day 3), and fusion of the neural folds at the midline to form a closed neural tube with overlying surface ectoderm (Day 4) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, 1C</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1E</xref>). In replicate experiments, all organoids displayed a closed neural lumen as assayed by a closed ring of apical NCAD on Day 4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1F</xref>, n=24). Furthermore, quantification of features including organoid size, lumen size, and ECAD/NCAD area ratio showed that our <italic>in vitro</italic> organoids were reproducible with respect to tissue patterning and morphogenesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, 1E</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1E</xref>, N=4 biological replicates, n=24 organoids).</p>

</fig>
<p>To characterize the cell types in our organoid model at the onset of neurulation, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) at Day 2 of BMP4 exposure, when the neural plate begins to elevate. To overcome limitations of existing computational methods in identifying cell types from scRNA-seq data, we applied our previously validated unsupervised dimensionality reduction method, sparse multimodal decomposition (SMD) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Using SMD, we identified a set of bimodally expressed genes that separated the cells into three cell types distributed along the mediolateral axis within the ectoderm: neural ectoderm, neural plate border, and surface ectoderm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, left). The three cell types showed a graded expression of <italic>SOX2</italic> in the medial-to-lateral direction: highest in the neural ectoderm, intermediate in the neural plate border, and lowest in the surface ectoderm, consistent with studies in model organisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Neural ectoderm cells expressed forebrain-associated transcription factors, including <italic>LHX2, HESX1, PAX6</italic>, <italic>SIX3</italic>, <italic>ZEB1</italic> and <italic>ZEB2</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Surface ectoderm cells expressed canonical transcription factors including <italic>TFAP2A</italic> and <italic>GATA3</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, the neural plate border population co-expressed neural ectoderm transcription factors <italic>PAX6</italic> and <italic>SIX3</italic> as well as surface ectoderm transcription factors <italic>TFAP2A</italic> and <italic>GATA3</italic>, along with <italic>DLX5</italic> and <italic>SIX1</italic>, which mark cranial placodes arising at the neural plate border <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Notably, all ectodermal cell types expressed <italic>OTX1</italic> and <italic>OTX2</italic> but not <italic>EN1</italic> or <italic>EN2</italic>, indicating forebrain rather than midbrain/hindbrain identities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Additionally, ventral markers <italic>NKX2</italic>-<italic>1</italic> and <italic>GSX2</italic> were absent, suggesting a dorsal identity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. We did not observe neural crest cells, marked by transcription factors <italic>SOX10</italic> and <italic>FOXD3</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. This is consistent with neural tube closure in the human embryo at the anterior forebrain level, where no neural crest cells are present <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. To compare our findings with <italic>in vivo</italic> gene expression patterns, we applied the same approach to published scRNA-seq data from 4-week-old human embryos at the neurula stage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Using the same SMD approach, we identified the same three ectodermal cell types <italic>in vivo</italic>, with gene expression patterns that matched those observed in our organoids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, right). We conclude that our organoid model consists of cell types involved in human anterior neurulation.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Identifying transcription factor candidates for regulation of anterior neurulation</title>
<p>Using our organoid model, we aimed to identify transcription factors driving anterior neurulation through a knockdown screen. Classical studies that physically disrupt the ectoderm during the neurula stages in vertebrates suggest that the neural ectoderm mechanically drives bending, folding, and closure of the neural plate, while the surface ectoderm is mechanically passive <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Therefore, we sought to identify transcription factors expressed within the neural ectoderm. We ordered ectoderm cells along a pseudo-mediolateral coordinate using a diffusion map on scRNA-seq data from Day 2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, left). We identified transcription factors expressed above a mean threshold across all cells and ranked them by the correlation of their expression with the mediolateral coordinate. This analysis revealed 20 transcription factors with highly specific expression in the neural plate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, right; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A, S2G, S2H</xref>).</p>

<p>Of these 20 factors, <italic>ZIC2</italic> has previously been shown to be required for anterior neural tube closure in the mouse embryo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Before proceeding with a comprehensive knockdown screen, we tested the role of <italic>ZIC2</italic> in regulating anterior neural tube closure in our organoid model. To knock down <italic>ZIC2</italic> using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), we constructed a dual-guide RNA lentiviral transfer plasmid consisting of the top two <italic>ZIC2-</italic>targeting guide RNA sequences based on a published CRISPRi database <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> and a control plasmid consisting of two non-targeting scramble guide RNA sequences. The guide RNA sequences on each plasmid were preceded by a mouse and human U6 promoter, respectively, and followed by a distinct direct capture sequence for single-cell RNA sequencing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Each plasmid also carried a constitutive promoter driving mCerulean (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>). This dual-guide RNA construct is hereafter referred to as a ‘guide’ for brevity. In parallel, we generated a CRISPRi hPSC line in the H1/WA01 background expressing dCas9-KRAB under a constitutive promoter and confirmed that the CRISPRi construct was functional in the pluripotent state using <italic>OCT4</italic>-targeting guides (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>). We transduced CRISPRi hPSCs with lentivirus carrying either a <italic>ZIC2-</italic>targeting guide or a control non-targeting scramble guide. We differentiated lentivirus-transduced CRISPRi hPSCs into organoids as before, with two days of TGFß/WNT/BMP inhibition followed by four days of BMP4 exposure. All organoids transduced with a <italic>ZIC2</italic>-targeting guide (n=6) failed to undergo neural tube closure and displayed a persistent U-shaped neural plate, while all organoids transduced with a control scramble guide (n=6) formed closed neural tubes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, our organoid model recapitulated neural tube defects observed in <italic>Zic2</italic>-null mice, suggesting that <italic>ZIC2</italic> may similarly regulate anterior neurulation in humans.</p>
<p>To identify the genes regulated by <italic>ZIC2</italic> during neurulation, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of Day 4 dCas9-KRAB organoids transduced with either the <italic>ZIC2</italic>-targeting guide or the control scramble guide. As before, we clustered cells into neural ectoderm, neural plate border, and surface ectoderm using SMD-derived marker genes from scramble control organoids (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref>). In neural ectoderm cells, <italic>ZIC2</italic> knockdown reduced <italic>ZIC2</italic> expression by 60%, confirming the efficacy of the guide (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The proportion of neural ectoderm cells declined, and the neural plate border population expanded, suggesting that <italic>ZIC2</italic> loss altered cell fate proportions (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2E</xref>). Notably, within the neural ectoderm, <italic>ZIC2</italic> knockdown led to differential downregulation of transcription factors including <italic>PAX2, HESX1, FEZF1, OTX2, PAX8, ZNF423,</italic> and <italic>MAF</italic> and upregulation of transcription factors <italic>TCF7L1, TOX, ZNF251,</italic> and <italic>SIX6</italic>, highlighting a potential gene regulatory network in the anterior neural plate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). We next examined regulatory regions upstream of genes strongly downregulated in Day 4 neural ectoderm cells upon <italic>ZIC2</italic> knockdown. Motif analysis revealed enrichment for binding sites associated with several transcription factor families, including ZNF, NR, SOX, and HES (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, Methods). Five transcription factors from these families (<italic>ZNF521, NR6A1, SOX2, SOX11,</italic> and <italic>HESX1</italic>) appeared among the 20 transcription factors chosen for our knockdown screen based on their specific expression in the neural plate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, 2E</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2H</xref>), further implicating them as candidates alongside ZIC2 in co-regulating anterior neural tube closure.</p>
<p>We next sought to knock down candidate transcription factors in a high-throughput screen to test their roles in regulating neurulation using our organoid model. To serve as a contrasting control set for our selection criterion, we selected an additional 58 transcription factors with medium to low neural specificity and a range of mean expression levels, giving us a total of 78 transcription factor candidates for our knockdown screen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2F</xref>).</p>

<title>High-titer lentivirus production in small volumes enables high-throughput arrayed genetic screens in micropatterned hPSCs</title>
<p>Previous genetic screens in organoids have used pooled perturbations targeting multiple genes per organoid, creating mosaic tissues in which different cells carry distinct genetic modifications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Although subsequent transcriptomic analyses in such studies revealed gene-specific effects on the transcriptional states of individual cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, top), this mosaic approach is ill-suited for studying morphogenesis, which is driven by coordinated changes in cellular behavior across a tissue. First, localized genetic perturbations cannot be reproducibly targeted to areas of morphological interest; second, even if the perturbation happens to localize to the region of interest, it typically is present in too few cells to influence overall tissue shape. To overcome these limitations, we developed a method to knock down single genes individually throughout entire organoids in an arrayed format, allowing us to test their roles in tissue morphogenesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, bottom).</p>

<p>To perform high-throughput arrayed knockdowns, we employed CRISPRi using a lentiviral library of dual-guide RNA constructs as above <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. To select guides against each target, we selected the top two targeting guides based on a published CRISPRi database <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. To enable an arrayed screen, we modified the cloning workflow to perform insert annealing, ligation, and transformation in parallel. Before ligation, we applied stringent gel purification following dephosphorylation of the double-digested backbone to minimize backbone contamination, which yielded a high fraction of correctly ligated plasmids (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>). As a result, we were able to directly perform minipreps from bulk-transformed bacteria cultures without colony picking, thus streamlining the cloning process. Using this protocol, we successfully generated a plasmid library of dual-guide RNA constructs targeting 77 (including <italic>ZIC2</italic>) out of 78 transcription factor candidates, plus a scramble control.</p>
<p>Achieving high-efficiency lentiviral transduction of cells requires high concentrations of lentivirus. Existing protocols to generate lentivirus, which rely on ultra-centrifugation, PEG-based concentrator, or syringe filtration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> are laborious and not amenable to high-throughput workflows. We thus developed an approach to enable efficient, single-gene knockdowns in organoids at high throughput. We first optimized 96-well plate virus production in HEK 293T cells by testing various transfection protocols, and we found that reducing media volumes during transfection and during viral production from HEK cells significantly increased viral titers (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B-C</xref>). We then compared hPSC transduction protocols on micropatterns. Standard protocols (Sigma Aldrich) recommend adding virus 24 hours after seeding and incubating the cells with virus overnight. Using the percentage of the micropattern showing mCerulean fluorescence 48 hours post-transduction (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3D</xref>) as a readout, we determined that virus treatment during cell seeding was far more efficient than virus treatment after seeding. We also found that one hour of virus treatment was sufficient to achieve high transduction efficiency. In contrast, 24 hours of high-titer virus treatment led to cell death (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>We hypothesized that enhanced transduction during cell seeding reflected increased exposure of the virus to the basolateral cell membrane of hPSCs. To test this, we transduced 3-day-old hPSC colonies with lentivirus after the formation of tight junctions and found that only colony edges were transduced. In contrast, transducing dissociated hPSCs during seeding led to uniform transduction (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2E</xref>). These results are consistent with previous studies showing that the lentiviral VSV-G envelope protein interacts with the mammalian LDL receptor (LDLR), which is localized to the basolateral membrane of various epithelial tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. This highlights the importance of performing viral transfection before the formation of tight junctions.</p>
<p>Our optimized protocol consistently achieved near-complete mCerulean expression of hPSCs on micropatterns. To determine whether mCerulean fluorescence coverage across a colony translated into efficiency of guide delivery at the level of individual cells, we cloned a transfer plasmid carrying a guide targeting the pluripotency factor OCT4 to measure knockdown in undifferentiated hPSCs. We found that 50 microliters of virus grown in a 96-well plate of HEK 293T cells, when mixed with 50 microliters of 150,000 CRISPRi hPSCs, was sufficient to deplete OCT4 in 95% of cells 48 hours post-transduction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The percentage of cells showing OCT4 knockdown was highly correlated with mCerulean fluorescence coverage of the micropatterns (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), confirming that mCerulean serves as a reliable live-cell reporter of transduction efficiency.</p>
<p>To perform arrayed knockdown of multiple genes in a single experiment, we needed to deliver distinct lentiviral plasmids, each carrying a different guide, to separate sets of micropatterned cells on the same coverslip. We therefore designed a PDMS stamp with 24 sets of circular micropattern features. Each set separated by the same center-to-center spacing of 9 mm matching the format of standard 96-well plates or multichannel pipette. We also created a removable PDMS well system that could partition the coverslip into 24 fluid-separated wells or be removed to create a single well (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). In parallel, we produced lentiviruses in small volumes in 96-well plates, with virus in each well carrying a unique guide (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). To seed hPSCs, we coated the entire PDMS stamp with Matrigel and transferred it onto a 50-by-75 mm glass coverslip. Following Matrigel transfer, we removed the stamp and replaced it with the PDMS well system. Using a multichannel pipette, we added a suspension of single hPSCs and lentivirus into each well (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, Methods). After 70 minutes of incubation, we thoroughly rinsed and removed unadhered cells and unfused virus. 48 hours later, we assessed mCerulean fluorescence coverage of micropatterns. Our protocol resulted in highly reproducible transduction of micropatterned hPSC colonies in an arrayed format, with a median transduction efficiency of 99% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). The PDMS well system prevented viral cross-contamination between neighboring wells, as seen by the less than 5% transduction of the untreated control well. Transduced hPSC colonies could then be differentiated into anterior neural tube organoids to model the effects of single-gene perturbations on neural tube morphogenesis.</p>

<title>A high-throughput genetic screen of anterior neurulation reveals three transcription factors necessary for proper neural tube closure</title>
<p>Using our method, we conducted a high-throughput arrayed CRISPRi knockdown screen of 77 transcription factors to evaluate their individual roles in anterior neurulation (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2E</xref>). We included <italic>ZIC2</italic> and a scramble control in this screen for methodological consistency with all other factors. Guide plasmids in our screen yielded a mean transduction efficiency of 93% (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A-B</xref>), slightly lower than the 99% we achieved with a clonal guide (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), perhaps due to mis-ligated products in the non-clonal plasmid population (Methods). After seeding and transducing hPSCs, we differentiated them into organoids using our protocol (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D</xref>). Organoids were fixed after four days of BMP4 exposure, stained for NCAD and ECAD, and screened for morphological defects using epifluorescence microscopy. Analysis of guide expression at the end of the differentiation time course, as measured by mCerulean, showed retention of lentiviral gene expression throughout the experiment (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4F</xref>).</p>
<p>We focused particularly on neural tube closure defects, as assessed by a lack of continuous NCAD staining enclosing the neural lumen. Lumen morphology was clear from epifluorescence microscopy for all candidates except <italic>RFX7</italic> and <italic>ZNF521</italic>, which required confocal microscopy for phenotypic categorization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4C</xref>). Most candidates had no closure defects (score = 0, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D</xref>). Knockdown of 24 transcription factors (<italic>HESX1, TGIF1, ZFHX4, MAFB, TSHXZ2, ZNF219, PAX3, ID3, PBX3, SP5, POU3F2, SSRP1, TLX2, VSX2, DNMT1, CSNRP3, TFDP2, DNMT3B, ZNF280, MSX1, SALL3, PLAGL1, SALL4, ARX</italic>) showed minor closure defects upon knockdown, where a fraction of organoids showed either a small opening in the neural plate or delayed neural tube closure compared to control organoids (score=1, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4E</xref>). For example, organoids with a <italic>HESX1</italic> knockdown showed a minor opening in the neural plate on Day 4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), which resolved after an additional day of differentiation in five out of six organoids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>Knockdown of three transcription factors (<italic>ZIC2</italic>, <italic>SOX11</italic>, and <italic>ZNF521</italic>) showed major closure defects upon knockdown (score=2) consistently across all organoids in three biological replicates consisting of 6 organoids each (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref>). Confocal microscopy of <italic>ZIC2</italic> and <italic>SOX11</italic> knockdown organoids showed that their neural plates were fully open, while confocal microscopy of <italic>ZNF521</italic> knockdown organoids showed multiple discontinuous regions of surface ectoderm on top of the neural ectoderm, which we interpreted as multiple points of closure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>To quantify the knockdown efficacy of CRISPRi guides in organoids, we performed scRNA-seq on Day 4 organoids with arrayed knockdowns of the transcription factors that showed a major phenotype (<italic>ZIC2, SOX11</italic> and <italic>ZNF521</italic>). To determine false negative rates or minor phenotypes as a result of poor knockdown efficacy, we also sequenced organoids corresponding to knockdowns of six transcription factors that did not show a closure defect (<italic>OTX2, PAX6, POU3F1, LHX2, TOX3</italic>, and <italic>GLI3</italic>) and two transcription factors that showed a minor defect (<italic>TGIF1</italic> and <italic>ZFHX4</italic>). Because each guide included a constant region tagged with a direct capture sequence readable by scRNA-seq <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, we could pool the arrayed samples prior to single-cell library preparation to reduce costs (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>).

<title>Deciphering the gene networks regulating anterior neurulation</title>
<p>Morphologically, <italic>ZIC2</italic> and <italic>SOX11</italic> knockdowns resulted in a persistently open neural plate, whereas <italic>ZNF521</italic> knockdown gave rise to multiple discrete closure points, suggesting opposing roles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-C</xref>). Phenotypically, these results suggest that <italic>ZIC2</italic> and <italic>SOX11</italic> promote neural tube closure, while <italic>ZNF521</italic> has an opposing role. To determine whether the phenotypic similarities and differences of <italic>ZIC2</italic>, <italic>SOX11</italic>, and <italic>ZNF521</italic> knockdowns are reflected in the gene regulatory functions of these factors, we analyzed single-cell gene expression data from perturbed organoids.</p>
<p>We analyzed scRNA-seq data from Day 4 organoids in which each of these three transcription factors were knocked down to evaluate changes in gene expression relative to control organoids. Hierarchical clustering of genes expressed in neural ectoderm from control organoids revealed nine modules of co-regulated genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). One module, consisting of <italic>ZIC2</italic> and several other neural transcription factors and markers, was significantly downregulated following <italic>SOX11</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5D</xref>), consistent with the enrichment of <italic>SOX</italic> family binding motifs at regulatory regions near <italic>ZIC2</italic>-regulated genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>We next examined genes that were significantly downregulated in the neural ectoderm in at least two of three knockdowns of <italic>ZIC2, SOX11</italic> and <italic>ZNF521,</italic> compared to the scramble control (Anderson-Darling test, p &lt; 0.05, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Of these genes, those affected by both <italic>SOX11</italic> and <italic>ZIC2</italic> knockdown showed larger fold decreases than all other pairs of knockdowns, as reflected by the relative number of genes in the lower left quadrants of fold change plots comparing knockdown pairs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, scatterplots). Many of these genes also ranked highly in their degree of downregulation when compared to all other genes upon <italic>SOX11</italic> or <italic>ZIC2</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). These observations suggested that SOX11 and ZIC2 jointly drive a gene regulatory program consisting of a shared set of genes, including <italic>PAX2, PTN, GNG4, HESX1, FRSS1L, CRABP1, SORBS2, TMEM163, PAX8,</italic> and <italic>NEGR1</italic> (from bottom left to top right in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).

Four of these genes, including neural tube literature candidates <italic>PAX2</italic> and <italic>CRABP1</italic>, were significantly downregulated upon both <italic>ZIC2</italic> and <italic>SOX11</italic> knockdown and significantly upregulated upon <italic>ZNF521</italic> knockdown (<italic>PAX2, CRABP1</italic>, <italic>TMEM163,</italic> and <italic>ARL4C</italic>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>We next asked whether we could phenocopy a neural tube closure defect by knocking down genes downstream of <italic>ZIC2</italic>, <italic>SOX11</italic> and <italic>ZNF521</italic>. We selected ten genes that were most co-downregulated by <italic>SOX11</italic> and <italic>ZIC2,</italic> including <italic>PAX2, PTN, GNG4, HESX1, FRSS1L, CRABP1, SORBS2, TMEM163, PAX8,</italic> and <italic>NEGR1</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). We also chose <italic>CRABP1, PAX2, TMEM163,</italic> and <italic>ARL4C,</italic> which were significantly downregulated upon <italic>SOX11</italic> and <italic>ZIC2</italic> knockdown and significantly upregulated upon <italic>ZNF521</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Apart from <italic>HESX1,</italic> which showed a minor closure defect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref>), there was no single gene in this set whose knockdown alone recapitulated the open neural plate phenotype observed upon <italic>ZIC2</italic> or <italic>SOX11</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5F</xref>). These findings argue that <italic>ZIC2</italic>, <italic>SOX11</italic>, and <italic>ZNF521</italic> do not act through a single dominant downstream effector and instead regulate a combination of genes to drive anterior neurulation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Perturbing the expression of genes individually and uniformly in hPSC-derived tissues is essential to determine their roles in morphogenesis during human embryonic development. The arrayed CRISPRi platform developed in this study allowed us to screen transcription factors in an hPSC-derived organoid model of anterior neurulation, revealing that three key transcription factors, <italic>ZIC2, SOX11</italic>, and <italic>ZNF521,</italic> act together to drive neurulation in the forebrain region. Knocking down these transcription factors shows opposing phenotypes, with <italic>ZIC2</italic> and <italic>SOX11</italic> knockdown resulting in an open neural plate and <italic>ZNF521</italic> knockdown leading to multiple points of neural tube closure. Our analyses of gene expression changes upon <italic>ZIC2</italic> and <italic>SOX11</italic> knockdown suggest that these two transcription factors regulate a shared set of gene targets. Consistent with the opposite phenotype of <italic>ZNF521</italic>, we find that <italic>ZNF521</italic> downregulates several of the gene targets upregulated by both <italic>ZIC2</italic> and <italic>SOX11</italic>. The set of these oppositely regulated factors include <italic>PAX2</italic> and <italic>CRABP1,</italic> which have been previously implicated in anterior neural tube defects in mice and humans, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that coordinated transcriptional regulation of downstream gene targets by <italic>ZIC2</italic>, <italic>SOX11</italic>, and <italic>ZNF521</italic> are necessary for successful anterior neurulation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). The role of <italic>ZIC2</italic> in neurulation has been well characterized <italic>in vivo</italic> in mouse <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> and genetic variants of <italic>SOX11</italic> in humans have been associated with midline defects, microcephaly and ocular malformations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. In mouse, <italic>SOX11</italic> deficiency leads to grossly normal neurulation in mice despite causing other broad morphological defects, suggesting possible species-specific differences in <italic>SOX11</italic>’s developmental roles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. As human anencephaly is embryonic lethal, genetic causes have only been obtained in rare cases with whole exome sequencing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. This raises the possibility that <italic>ZIC2</italic>, <italic>SOX11</italic>, and <italic>ZNF521</italic> also drive neurulation <italic>in vivo</italic>. In the future, it will be of interest to identify more genes with <italic>de novo</italic> mutations contributing to anencephaly in human embryos, as has recently been conducted for spina bifida <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The ability to perform single-gene perturbations in robust <italic>in vitro</italic> models of human development is essential for dissecting the mechanisms that drive human embryonic morphogenesis. Until now, this goal has been limited by variability in organoid morphogenesis and the lack of scalable methods for uniform single-gene perturbations. The platform we report here integrates a micropatterned hPSC-based protocol to generate reproducible organoids with uniform single-gene knockdown via lentivirus-mediated arrayed CRISPR interference to identify genes with roles in morphogenesis. Furthermore, the method reduces costs compared to clonal knockdown approaches, is scalable, and can be performed in an academic laboratory setting, enabling tissue-wide single-gene perturbations at a scale that has not been previously feasible either in organoids <italic>in vitro</italic> or in mammalian models <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our approach bridges a critical gap between the genetic study of traditional model organisms and human developmental biology, offering a path for new mechanistic insights and the discovery of therapeutic targets for neural tube defects and other congenital malformations.</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>The first limitation of this study is that inherent to any method that utilizes CRISPR: the efficacy of selected guides. Based on quantification of gene knockdown by scRNA-seq, we estimate that 87% of targeting guides were effective in our system. The second limitation is the assumption that the genes we discovered <italic>in vitro</italic> are relevant in humans <italic>in vivo</italic>. False positives or false negatives could arise in part due to the study of isolated tissues <italic>in vitro</italic> that lack surrounding cell types, which may either compensate for or trigger tissue-level defects. Given the increasing fidelity of organoid models in terms of their ability to recapitulate the complexity of fetal tissues, we believe that this limitation will be overcome in time. While <italic>in vitro</italic> systems are ultimately models, they serve as a complement to <italic>in vivo</italic> studies to increase our understanding of human development and disease, and they offer value in their amenability to high-throughput perturbations.</p>

<title>Cell lines</title>
<p>Neural tube organoid differentiation was optimized in an H1 OTX-YFP hESC line (made at and karyotyped by the Allen Institute). Knockdown experiments were conducted with an H1 DCX-YFP hESC line (made at and karyotyped by the Allen Institute) modified by inserting pAAVS1-NDi-CRISPRi into the AAVS1 locus. pAAVS1-NDi-CRISPRi (Gen1) was a gift from Bruce Conklin (Addgene plasmid #73497; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene:73497">http://n2t.net/addgene:73497</ext-link>; RRID:Addgene_73497). dCas9 integration was validated with genotyping and CRISPRi activity was validated with OCT4 knockdown. The H1 background line has XY chromosomes and was chosen because of our extensive experience in the lab with this line. We recognize the value of studying lines with other genotypes in order to learn sex-specific mechanisms of human development. As there is considerable line-to-line variability in stem cell models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, this work provides one benchmark against which to compare XX other XY lines. All research in this study falls under International Society for Stem Cell Research Category 1a.</p>
<p>hESCs were grown in 6-well culture dishes (CellTreat) pre-treated with diluted Matrigel hESC-qualified Matrix (Corning Cat No. 354277) according to manufacturer’s instructions and fed with mTeSR Plus (StemCell).</p>
<p>hESCs were maintained via colony-passage every four days with ReLeSR (StemCell) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Colonies were broken into clumps of 5-15 cells and diluted 1:30 into a new maintenance plate using wide-bore pipette tips. Cells were fed with fresh mTeSR Plus every two days. Cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination (Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit, ABM G238).</p>
<p>hESCs were expanded for experiments via single cell passage to ensure consistent cell density. 10cm culture dishes were pre-treated with Matrigel according to manufacturer’s instructions. Maintenance hESC wells were rinsed with PBS, treated with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies) for 5-10 minutes, spun down and aspirated, and rescued in mTeSR Plus with 10μM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632, Stemgent). 500,000 cells were added to a 10cm dish with 10mL of mTeSR Plus with 10μM Y-27632. After 24 hours, cells were switched to mTeSR Plus without Y27632. Cells were fed with fresh mTeSR Plus every day for optimal growth and expanded for a total of 4 days before experimental seeding.</p>
<p>Lentivirus was grown in Lenti-X 293T HEK cells (Takara Bio). HEK cells were grown in deep 10cm tissue culture dishes (Nunc) and fed with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Millipore) in DMEM/F12 (Thermo).

<title>Soft lithography and microcontact printing</title>
<p>Photomasks were designed in AutoCAD and submitted to Artnet Pro (formerly CAD/Art) for printing. For the neural tube model, circles were arranged in hexagons with with a diameter of 250 μm per circle and edge-to-edge circle spacing of 100 μm. For transduction efficiency optimization experiments, circles were arranged in 4×4 format with a diameter of 350 μm per circle and inter-circle spacing of 1000 μm. For 24-well format, 24 sets of hexagons or 4×4 grids were arranged with an inter-well spacing of 9 mm for compatibility with 96-well and multichannel pipette spacing.</p>
<p>Microcontact printing was performed as in Anand et al., 2023. Briefly, 50 μm thick 73 mm diameter dry photoresist films (ADEX, DJ Microlaminates) were laminated onto silicon wafers (University Wafers) using a SKY 335R6 laminator (SKY-DSB Co., Ltd) at a temperature of 65°C. Photomasks were placed on top of the photoresist under a long pass filter (PL-360LP, Omega) and then cured under a 365 nm UV lamp (Uvitron) for 16 seconds at of 25 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> intensity. Silicone and photoresist were developed in cyclohexanone (Sigma) for 5 minutes before rinsing with acetone and then isopropanol, then drying with a stream of compressed air. Resulting molds were baked on a glass dish on a Cimarec hot plate (Thermo) 150°C for 1 hour and then placed in a 10cm Petri dish and silanized with 50 µl of Trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane (Sigma) on a glass slide in a vacuum chamber overnight. PDMS (Ellsworth Adhesives) was mixed at a curing agent:base reagent ratio of 1:10 and vacuum-treated for 30 to 60 minutes to remove air bubbles. 20g to 40g of PDMS were poured into a Petri dish containing the silicone mold and the dish was baked in an oven (VWR, Sheldon Manufacturing) at 80°C for 2 hours. Stamps were cut out of the dish in a biosafety cabinet in the shape of their rectangular circumference and sterilized by UV treatment under a germicidal lamp for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Matrigel hESC-qualified Matrix (354277, Corning) was diluted at double the concentration recommended by manufacturer’s instructions in DMEM/F12 media. 5 mL of diluted Matrigel was added to each stamp and left to polymerize overnight at room temperature before seeding.</p>

<title>Neural tube organoid differentiation</title>
<p>For neural tube organoid protocol optimization, cells were seeded on glass coverslips as in Anand et al., 2023. Briefly, glass coverslips were cut to fit wells of a 6-well plate, sprayed with ethanol, and dried with compressed air in a biosafety cabinet. Matrigel-coated PDMS hexagon stamps were rinsed in distilled water, dried with compressed air, and applied to the center of the coverslip for several minutes in order for Matrigel transfer to occur. Gentle pressure was applied to the stamp to help with transfer. The stamp was then removed for seeding.</p>
<p>Expanded hESCs were rinsed with PBS and treated with Accutase for 15 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then collected, spun down for 3 minutes at 200rcf, aspirated, resuspended in at 3 million cells/mL in mTeSR Plus with 10μM Y27632. The well was filled with cells suspended at 1-2 million cells/mL and incubated for 1 hour in a tissue culture hood to form attachment to the Matrigel. Wells were then rinsed with DPBS (Lonza), the well system was removed, and the plate received one final rinse in DPBS before addition of fresh mTeSR Plus with 10μM Y27632. 24 hours post-seed, media was changed to mTeSR Plus without Y27632.</p>
<p>Neural tube differentiation was initiated at 48 hours post-seed (Day −2) in N2B27 media. Small molecule and signaling protein concentrations were optimized as described in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B-C</xref>. The optimized protocol was as follows: Ectodermal differentiation was initiated at Day −2 with N2B27 + 10 µM LDN + 5 µM SB + 1 µM IWP3 + 5% Matrigel by volume.

NEB Stable (NEB) bacteria were transformed with each plasmid in 96-well plates using heatshock for 30s at 42°C in a thermocycler. Bacteria were rescued in 1 ml SOC media (Thermo Fisher) and grown in 5 ml LB media (Thermo Fisher) with 100 µg/ml carbenicillin overnight at 30°C on a rotating roller drum before miniprep (Qiagen). For clonal plasmid preparation, 50 µl from 5 ml overnight cultures were plated uniformly on on LB + Carbenicillin plates (Teknova) using autoclaved glass beads, grown for 24-48h at 30C, and re-inoculated into overnight liquid culture prior to miniprep. Double digest assay was performed with DraIII-HF (NEB) and BamHI-HF (NEB).

<title>Microcontact printing and hPSC seeding in 24-well format</title>
<p>24-well systems were prepared as follows in a biosafety cabinet immediately before seeding: A 50mm by 75mm borosilicate glass coverslip (Brain Research Laboratories) was sprayed with ethanol, dried with compressed air, and placed in the lid of a deep 10cm tissue culture dish (Nunc). Matrigel-coated stamps were aspirated, rinsed in MilliQ water, dried with compressed air, and applied to the center of the coverslip for several minutes in order for Matrigel transfer to occur. Gentle pressure was applied to the stamp to help with transfer. The 10cm plate bottom was applied to hold the coverslip in place, and the plate was up to mark the corners of the stamp with pen on the bottom the plate. The plate was then returned to the biosafety cabinet, the plate bottom taken off, and the stamp removed carefully to keep the coverslip aligned with the markings. The 24-well PDMS was applied to the coverslip in alignment with the stamp markings and pressed forcefully to create a seal with the coverslip. A diamond-tip scribe (Techni-tool) was used to trim the lateral edges of the coverslip and the well system was then transferred to the plate bottom.</p>
<p>Seeding was performed in a BSL2+ biosafety cabinet. Expanded hESCs were rinsed with PBS and treated with Accutase for 15 minutes at room temperature. Cells were collected, spun down for 3 minutes at 200 x g, aspirated, resuspended in at 3 million cells/mL in mTeSR Plus with 10μM Y27632, and transferred to a pipetting reservoir. Using a multichannel pipette, 50 μL of cell suspension was added to 24 wells of a 96-well plate (CellTreat) for viral mixing. 50 μL of viral supernatant was added to each well and mixed gently before transfer of the full 100 μL to each well of the 24-well system for seeding.

Organoids were scraped off glass coverslips into a new 10cm dish, diluted in 5mL of PBS, collected, and spun down for 2 minutes at 200 x g. PBS was then aspirated until there was 0.5mL left in the tube, and cells were resuspended and transferred with a wide bore pipette into a fresh 10cm dish.

<p>Transduction efficiency analysis was performed on live epifluorescence microscopy of micropatterned stem cells, 48 hours after transduction and immediately before 3D cyst induction with Matrigel. Ilastik was trained to recognize the circular outline of each micropatterned colony in the phase channel and to return the center coordinates and diameters (d) of each colony. Circle parameters were then applied to the mCerulean channel in Python to extract mCerulean pixel values both from the colony and from a 2D background halo (d+10 to d+35 pixels). Colony pixels were categorized as mCerulean+ if they reached expression above the 95th percentile value in the background halo. Some micropatterns were located under the CO<sub>2</sub> adapter during live imaging and thus their transduction efficiency could not be measured.</p>
<p>For nuclear OCT4 knockdown analysis, nuclear centers were selected via DAPI stain in Fiji.

<title>Organoid morphology analysis</title>
<p>Organoid morphology analysis was performed on epifluorescence microscopy images of Day 4 organoids using the Ilastik software platform. User-generated labels and epifluorescence were used to distinguish neural tube tissue (NCAD-positive) and non-neural tissue (ECAD-positive) through machine-learning pattern-based pixel classification. Morphological characteristics were extracted from the segmented objects, including area measurements. For organoid size quantification, adjacent NCAD- and ECAD-positive regions were summed to determine total organoid area. For ECAD/NCAD area, the former areas were divided.</p>

<title>Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of Day 2 and Day 4 organoids and Week 4 human embryos</title>
<p>After sequencing and demultiplexing, FASTQ files were run through the 10X Cell Ranger Count pipeline to align reads to the GRCh38-2020 reference genome, make guide calls according to capture sequencing, and produce a cell by gene count matrix.</p>
<p>For Day 2 and 4 organoids and Week 4 embryos <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, gene expression was analyzed in Python with Scanpy (v1.10.2). Cells with fewer than 6,000 or more than 35,000 reads were excluded from analysis. All other cells were downsampled to 6,000 reads and analyzed with sparse multimodal decomposition (SMD, Melton &amp; Ramanathan, 2021) to find informative genes for clustering. Cells were then clustered using Scanpy’s Louvain or Leiden algorithm in the space of the top 100 to 250 SMD genes (excluding ribosomal, mitochondrial, and cell cycle factors) with a clustering resolution of 0.2. In the case of Week 4 embryos, two rounds of clustering were performed to first identify non-ectodermal cell types and re-cluster ectodermal cell types only. In all cases, clusters were identified using expression of canonical markers, including transcription factors. Cells assigned to neural plate, neural plate border, and surface ectoderm for future analysis. Raw reads of included cells were converted to transcripts per million for further analysis. For Day 4 organoids, guide calls and counts were merged with the cell by gene count matrix according to cell barcode in Python. Guide conditions were selected for analysis if at least ten cells were sequenced from that guide condition (12 out of 18 non-scramble guides met this criteria). Knockdown efficacy of each guide condition was measured against a scramble guide control condition using an Anderson Darling test (SciPy) with a significance cutoff of p&lt;0.05. Gene expression of neural genes in each selected guide condition was compared to scramble control. Genes were defined as differentially expressed if they passed an Anderson Darling with p&lt;0.05.</p>

<title>Motif enrichment analysis</title>
<p>Gene names that were strongly downregulated in <italic>ZIC2</italic>-perturbed organoids (log2(mean fold change relative to scramble control) &lt;-0.04) were bulk-converted to ENSEMBL IDs using g.Profiler. Genomic regions (10kb upstream of start site and 100bp regions downstream of start site) were extracted using the Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD). Regions were analyzed with MEME-SEA for enrichment of transcription factor motifs relative to scrambled sequences. Enrichment scores of transcription factor families with multiple enriched motifs were combined for a final family enrichment score.</p>

<p>This study is a <bold>fundamental</bold> advance in the field of developmental biology and transcriptional regulation that demonstrates the use of hPSC-derived organoids to generate reproducible organoids to study the mechanisms that drive neural tube closure. The work is <bold>exceptional</bold> in its development of tools to use CRISPR interference to screen for genes that regulate morphogenesis in human PSC organoids. The additional characterization of the role of specific transcription factors in neural tube formation is <bold>solid</bold>. The work provides both technical advances and new knowledge on human development through embryo models.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a wonderful and landmark study in the field of human embryo modeling. It uses patterned human gastruloids and conducts a functional screen on neural tube closure, and identifies positive and negative regulators, and defines the epistasis among them.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The above was achieved following optimization of the micro-pattern-based gastruloid protocol to achieve high efficiency, and then optimized to conduct and deliver CRISPRi without disrupting the protocol. This is a technical tour de force as well as one of the first studies to reveal new knowledge on human development through embryo models, which has not been done before.</p>
<p>The manuscript is very solid and well-written. The figures are clear, elegant, and meaningful. The conclusions are fully supported by the data shown. The methods are well-detailed, which is very important for such a study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This reviewer did not identify any meaningful, major, or minor caveats that need addressing or correcting.</p>
<p>A minor weakness is that one can never find out if the findings in human embryo models can be in vitro revalidated in humans in vivo. This is for obvious and justified ethical reasons. However, the authors acknowledge this point in the section of the manuscript detailing the limitations of their study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript is a technical report on a new model of early neurogenesis, coupled to a novel platform for genetic screens. The model is more faithful than others published to date, and the screening platform is an advance over existing ones in terms of speed and throughput.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>It is novel and useful.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The novelty of the results is limited in terms of biology, mainly a proof of concept of the platform and a very good demonstration of the hierarchical interactions of the top regulators of GRNs.</p>
<p>The value of the manuscript could be enhanced in two ways:</p>
<p>(1) by showing its versatility and transforming the level of neural tube to midbrain and hindbrain, and looking at the transcriptional hierarchies there.</p>
<p>(2) by relating the patterning of the organoids to the situation in vivo, in particular with the information in reference 49. The authors make a statement &quot;To compare our findings with in vivo gene expression patterns, we applied the same approach to published scRNA-seq data from 4-week-old human embryos at the neurula stage&quot; but it would be good to have a more nuanced reference: what stage, what genes are missing, what do they add to the information in that reference?</p>
