<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Stramenopiles form a clade of diverse eukaryotic organisms, including multicellular algae, the fish and plant pathogenic oomycetes, such as the potato blight <italic>Phytophthora,</italic> and the human intestinal protozoan <italic>Blastocystis</italic>. In most eukaryotes, glycolysis is a strictly cytosolic metabolic pathway that converts glucose to pyruvate, resulting in the production of NADH and ATP. In contrast, stramenopiles have a branched glycolysis in which the enzymes of the pay-off phase are located in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix. Here, we identify a mitochondrial carrier in <italic>Blastocystis</italic> that can transport glycolytic intermediates, such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the mitochondrial inner membrane, linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis. Comparative analyses with the phylogenetically-related human mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier (SLC25A11) and dicarboxylate carrier (SLC25A10) show that the glycolytic intermediate carrier has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate. <italic>Blastocystis</italic> lacks several key components of oxidative phosphorylation required for the generation of mitochondrial ATP, such as complexes III and IV, ATP synthase and ADP/ATP carriers. The presence of the glycolytic pay-off phase in the mitochondrial matrix generates ATP, which powers energy-requiring processes, such as macromolecular synthesis, as well as NADH, used by mitochondrial complex I to generate a proton motive force to drive the import of proteins and molecules. Given its unique substrate specificity and central role in carbon and energy metabolism, the carrier for glycolytic intermediates identified here represents a specific drug and pesticide target against stramenopile pathogens, which are of great economic importance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Glycolysis is a crucial metabolic pathway that most organisms use to obtain energy from the oxidation of sugars, which consists of ten enzymatic reactions in total, divided into two phases. The first ‘preparatory’ phase consists of five reactions, the products of which are the triose phosphates dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The second ‘pay-off’ phase leads to the production of ATP, NADH and pyruvate, which is transported into the mitochondrial matrix by the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bricker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Herzig et al., 2012</xref>). In most eukaryotes, glycolysis is a cytosolic process with the exception of trypanosomes, where it is localised in the glycosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Opperdoes and Borst, 1977</xref>). However, it was recently discovered that a large group of eukaryotes, the stramenopiles, have a branched glycolytic pathway in which the pay-off phase is duplicated and also localised in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abrahamian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bártulos et al., 2018</xref>). The stramenopiles are an extremely diverse eukaryotic group consisting mainly of protist algae, which are among the most important primary oxygen producers in the oceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Burki et al., 2020</xref>). The group also includes multicellular algae (kelps) and the economically-devastating oomycetes, such as <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jiang and Tyler, 2012</xref>), which causes potato blight, one of the major contributing factors of the Great Famine in Ireland in the late 19th century.</p>
<p>The human gut protozoan <italic>Blastocystis</italic> also belongs to the stramenopiles. Despite more than one billion infected individuals worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Andersen and Stensvold, 2016</xref>), the public health significance of <italic>Blastocystis</italic> is debated. <italic>Blastocystis</italic> is often linked to patients with diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Poirier et al., 2012</xref>), or inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dogruman-Al et al., 2009</xref>). However, it is also frequently found in healthy individuals, and a few microbiome studies associated <italic>Blastocystis</italic> with higher microbial diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Audebert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Stensvold et al., 2022</xref>). The controversy may arise from the extreme genetic diversity of <italic>Blastocystis</italic>, which is classified into over 40 subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Stensvold et al., 2023</xref>), and thus its influence on gut microbiota is likely to be subtype-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tito et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, <italic>Blastocystis</italic> ST7-B, which was used in this study, is most frequently associated with pathogenic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ajjampur et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Deng et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Stensvold et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yason et al., 2019</xref>) and was recently linked to a decreased microbial diversity in diarrheal patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Deng et al., 2022</xref>). The treatment of choice is metronidazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Stenzel and Boreham, 1996</xref>), but there have been reports of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Haresh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mirza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Moghaddam et al., 2005</xref>), highlighting the need for new therapeutic interventions.</p>
<p>Unlike other stramenopiles, <italic>Blastocystis</italic> has lost the cytosolic pay-off phase of glycolysis, consistent with the absence of a gene encoding a mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bártulos et al., 2018</xref>). The only exception is the last enzyme of the pathway, pyruvate kinase, which was also identified as a cytosolic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lantsman et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Blastocystis</italic> is an anaerobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zierdt, 1991</xref>) with highly divergent mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Stechmann et al., 2008</xref>). It has respiratory complexes I and II, but lacks the rest of the electron transport chain, as well as ATP synthase and mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gentekaki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Stechmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wawrzyniak et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Blastocystis</italic> relies mainly on glycolysis and fermentation for its metabolic energy requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Müller et al., 2012</xref>). The transport of glycolytic intermediates across the mitochondrial inner membrane is necessary for the completion of glycolysis and is critical for the survival of the parasite. Glycolytic enzymes are powerful drug targets in parasites that are strictly dependent on glycolysis for ATP production. The structural differences between host and parasitic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and triosephosphate isomerase in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> have been studied with the aim of inhibiting glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bruno et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Penna-Coutinho et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ravindra and Balaram, 2005</xref>). Similarly, inhibitors against phosphofructokinase in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> have a rapid effect on the parasite viability without inhibiting the host enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McNae et al., 2021</xref>). Understanding the unique aspects of parasite metabolism is crucial for the discovery of new drug targets.</p>
<p>It is clear that the branched stramenopile glycolysis needs to be linked by a specific transporter in the mitochondrial inner membrane, as the solute exchange between the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix is tightly controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kunji et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ruprecht and Kunji, 2020</xref>). The mitochondrial carrier family (SLC25) is the largest solute transporter family in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kunji et al., 2020</xref>). Its members facilitate the transport of nucleotides, amino acids, inorganic ions, keto acids, vitamins and other nutrients across the mitochondrial inner membrane. All SLC25 members have a three-fold pseudo-symmetric structure, evident at the sequence level by the presence of three conserved homologous repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Saraste and Walker, 1982</xref>) and specific motifs important for their transport mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ruprecht et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ruprecht and Kunji, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we report a stramenopile-specific group of transport proteins closely related to mitochondrial carboxylate carriers of the SLC25 family. We characterised one of these unique <italic>Blastocystis</italic> carriers, which has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate. Instead, this carrier can transport several glycolytic intermediates, including dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate, thus providing a previously undiscovered transport link between cytosolic and mitochondrial glycolysis. Since <italic>Blastocystis</italic> relies solely on mitochondrial glycolysis, the inhibition of this carrier might represent a promising way to treat this parasite.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>A group of mitochondrial carboxylate carriers that is unique to stramenopiles</title>
<p>The last enzyme of the cytosolic phase of glycolysis in <italic>Blastocystis</italic> is triosephosphate isomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bártulos et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate need to be transported into the mitochondrial matrix for the pay-off phase of glycolysis. Given the presence of mitochondrial glycolysis in stramenopiles, we searched for a transporter that is not only ubiquitous in stramenopiles, but also absent in other eukaryotes. As glycolysis in <italic>Blastocystis</italic> would be critically dependent on this transporter, we used this parasite as a model organism. We focused on mitochondrial carboxylate carriers because of their ability to transport phosphorylated three-carbon substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Castegna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fiermonte et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Palmieri et al., 1972</xref>) and compared the sequences of carboxylate carriers from all major eukaryotic supergroups. Our analyses revealed four well-defined groups of carriers: dicarboxylate carriers (DIC, SLC25A10), oxoglutarate/malate carriers (OGC, SLC25A11), di/tricarboxylate carriers (DTC), and a new stramenopile-specific group, the putative glycolytic intermediate carriers (GIC) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>). At least one copy of the putative GIC carrier was identified in each stramenopile species. In <italic>Blastocystis</italic> ST7-B, there are four copies of the putative GIC protein, but two of them are truncated and lack crucial mitochondrial carrier elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ruprecht et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ruprecht and Kunji, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">2021</xref>), possibly rendering these proteins non-functional (XP_012899519.1 has an N-terminal truncation; XP_012896318.1 has a C-terminal truncation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ruprecht and Kunji, 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>The unidentified <italic>Blastocystis</italic> carriers localise to mitochondria</title>
<p>Another important criterion is that the putative glycolytic intermediate carriers localise to mitochondria in <italic>Blastocystis</italic>. Specific (peptide) rabbit antibodies were raised against the two putative glycolytic intermediate carriers bGIC-1 and bGIC-2 as well as an ortholog of the <italic>Blastocystis</italic> oxoglutarate carrier bOGC (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). Mitochondria were visualized using antibodies raised against a triosephosphate isomerase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mitochondrial fusion protein (TPI-GAPDH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bártulos et al., 2018</xref>). Immunoconfocal microscopy clearly show that bOGC, bGIC-1 and bGIC-2 localise to mitochondria in <italic>Blastocystis</italic>, showing that they are potential candidates for the missing transport links (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Human and <italic>Blastocystis</italic> carriers purified from yeast mitochondria are folded</title>
<p>All three <italic>Blastocystis</italic> proteins were expressed in and purified from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> mitochondria using the detergent lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). They were compared to the human oxoglutarate carrier SLC25A11 (hOGC) and dicarboxylate carrier SLC25A10 (hDIC), prepared in the same way. Next, thermostability analysis was used to assess whether the purified proteins are correctly folded. Spectral properties of tryptophan/tyrosine residues change as their local environment changes during protein denaturation in a temperature ramp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alexander et al., 2014</xref>). The assay produces an apparent melting temperature (Tm) at which the rate of protein unfolding is the highest. All three proteins produced unfolding curves, showing that they are folded. The apparent melting temperatures for bOGC (52.6 ± 0.5 °C), bGIC-1 (60.7 ± 0.4 °C) and bGIC-2 (59.8 ± 0.4 °C) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref></bold>) are similar to those observed for hOGC (51.0 °C), hDIC (54.1 °C) and other mitochondrial carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Crichton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jaiquel Baron et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Majd et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<title>Two mitochondrial carriers of <italic>Blastocystis</italic> bind glycolytic intermediates</title>

This technique provides a simple, high-throughput method for screening libraries of compounds to identify potential protein binders that can then be confirmed in low-throughput transport assays with radiolabelled substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Majd et al., 2018</xref>). We used detergent-solubilized, purified protein to screen a library of 39 commercially available compounds, which included mono-, di- and tricarboxylates, acids, inorganic ions, and several glycolytic intermediates (with the exception of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and 2-phosphoglycerate, which were not available).</p>
<p>In order to quantify the binding effect of a compound, we calculated a thermostability shift (ΔTm) by subtracting the apparent melting temperature in the absence of a compound from that in its presence. A positive shift suggests that the compound is stabilizing, indicating a putative substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Majd et al., 2018</xref>). We first tested the library on purified hOGC (SLC25A11) and hDIC (SLC25A10). A range of compounds had stabilizing effects on hOGC in thermostability shift assays (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). Oxoglutarate (3.8 ± 0.4 °C), malate (3.6 ± 0.3 °C), maleate (3.1 ± 0.1 °C), succinate (1.9 ± 0.3 °C) and malonate (1.3 ± 0.2 °C) all produced positive shifts. For hDIC, larger shifts than for hOGC were observed for malate (4.8 ± 0.2 °C), maleate (8.0 ± 0.1 °C), succinate (3.0 ± 0.3 °C) and malonate (7.3 ± 0.1 °C) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>).

<p>The thermostability shifts for the <italic>Blastocystis</italic> ortholog bOGC were similar to those of hOGC (SLC25A11), although some compounds, most notably citrate and isocitrate, produced small stabilizations that were not observed for the human ortholog (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). A wider range of compounds caused an increase in stability of the two candidate carriers bGIC-1 and bGIC-2 compared to bOGC (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">E</xref></bold>).

<title>Human OGC and DIC have distinct and overlapping substrate specificities</title>
<p>In addition to the glycolytic intermediates that were the focus of this study, we selected all compounds that stabilized the proteins in thermostability assays and performed transport assays. To test whether a compound was transported, we loaded proteoliposomes with substrate by freeze-thaw-extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jaiquel Baron et al., 2021</xref>), and initiated exchange with the addition of radiolabelled [<sup>14</sup>C]-malate (hOGC and bOGC, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">E</xref></bold>) or [<sup>35</sup>S]-sulphate (hDIC). Only when the internalized compound is a transported substrate of the carrier will the uptake of radiolabelled substrate occur. For hOGC (SLC25A11), uptake was measured for oxoglutarate, oxaloacetate, malate, succinate, maleate, malonate, 2-oxoadipate (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold>). Surprisingly, a low uptake rate was measured for pyruvate, which did not induce a significant shift (0.1 ± 0.3 °C). Pyruvate is a small molecule and therefore probably does not introduce enough additional bonds to stabilize the protein. The substrate specificity of hOGC is similar to that of the rat and bovine oxoglutarate carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bisaccia et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fiermonte et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Palmieri et al., 1972</xref>). For hDIC (SLC25A10), uptake was observed for malate, succinate, maleate, malonate, sulphate, thiosulphate, phosphate and, to a lesser extent, oxalic acid and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>). This result is consistent with previous data that have shown that the rat dicarboxylate carrier also transports sulphate and thiosulphate in addition to dicarboxylates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Crompton et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Saris, 1980</xref>). Although we measured transport for dihydroxyacetone phosphate, we have not found any evidence for the presence of dihydroxyacetone phosphate inside mitochondria in the literature. It is possible that it is not transported under physiological conditions in competition with dicarboxylates or other substrates. The substrate specificity of <italic>Blastocystis</italic> OGC (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold>) is very similar to human OGC (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold>), consistent with their close phylogenetic relationship.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Glycolysis is a textbook example of a well-conserved cytosolic pathway. However, the discovery that glycolysis is branched and also mitochondrial in stramenopiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abrahamian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bártulos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nakayama et al., 2012</xref>) raises questions about how glycolytic intermediates are transported across the tightly controlled mitochondrial inner membrane. Here, we report the discovery and characterisation of a mitochondrial carrier protein unique to stramenopiles that transports the glycolytic intermediates dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate, providing the heretofore missing transport link.</p>
<p>Since mitochondrial glycolysis is found exclusively in stramenopiles, we searched for a transporter that is ubiquitous in these species, but not in other eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analyses identified a new class of mitochondrial carboxylate carriers in stramenopiles that are most closely related to plant di/tricarboxylate carriers (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>). The plant carriers catalyse the transport of tricarboxylates (citrate, isocitrate, and aconitate) in exchange for dicarboxylates (oxoglutarate, oxaloacetate, malate, maleate, succinate, and malonate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Picault et al., 2002</xref>) and are also present in Alveolata, Rhizaria, and Haptophyta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Toleco et al., 2020</xref>), which share a common evolutionary ancestor with stramenopiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Burki et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the glycolytic intermediate carrier of stramenopiles is probably derived from a common ancestor with di/tricarboxylate carriers and does not exist in any other eukaryote outside of the stramenopile clade.</p>
<p><italic>Blastocystis</italic> was used in this study as a stramenopile model organism, as it relies solely on glycolysis for its energy demands and does not have a second branch of glycolysis in the cytosol. We characterised human and <italic>Blastocystis</italic> carboxylate carriers and demonstrated that the stramenopile GIC proteins have a unique substrate specificity that is distinct from the human carriers (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></bold>). We also characterised the substrate specificity of <italic>Blastocystis</italic> OGC, which has the same specificity as human OGC (SLC25A11), and we demonstrated that it is unable to transport glycolytic intermediates and thus could not be the missing transport step in the branched glycolytic pathway.</p>
<p><italic>Blastocystis</italic> GIC-1 did not transport any of the tested substrates (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, C</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">E</xref></bold>), but it is expressed and localised to mitochondria (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>), demonstrating that it is not a pseudogene. We did not test radiolabelled glycolytic intermediates directly in transport, as phosphoenolpyruvate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate are not available, and radiolabelled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is prohibitively expensive. We cannot, therefore, exclude the possibility that GIC-1 catalyses glycolytic intermediate exchange, but not in hetero-exchange reactions with malate, phosphate and sulphate. It is more likely that bGIC-1 has lost its transport activity and could possibly fulfil a different role. For example, in <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>, a non-functional OGC-like carrier is incorporated into a respiratory supercomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast to bGIC-1, bGIC-2 transports several inorganic ions and glycolytic intermediates, including dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref></bold>), but not the canonical substrates of <italic>Blastocystis</italic> OGC, such as malate, maleate, malonate, and succinate. Most mitochondrial carriers operate as strict antiporters, where the chemical gradient of one substrate drives the uptake of the counter-substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ruprecht and Kunji, 2020</xref>). A mitochondrial phosphate carrier homolog was identified in the phylogenetic analysis of <italic>Blastocystis</italic> (<bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 1</bold>), which is driven by the proton motive force to maintain high concentrations of phosphate in the mitochondrial matrix, which in turn could drive the uptake of glycolytic intermediates. <italic>Blastocystis</italic> lacks many of the conserved carrier proteins found in the mitochondria of aerobes. In total, we have only identified 18 mitochondrial carriers in <italic>Blastocystis</italic> (<bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 1</bold>). However, we show that bGIC-2 seems to be able to compensate for the loss of some mitochondrial carriers, including the transport of inorganic ions in the absence of a DIC homolog. Additionally, the distantly related citrate carrier, which transports dicarboxylates, tricarboxylates and PEP, was also lost in <italic>Blastocystis</italic>, possibly due to an incomplete TCA cycle devoid of citrate synthase, aconitase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Stechmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zierdt et al., 1988</xref>). In <italic>Blastocystis</italic>, PEP can be synthesised from mitochondrial pyruvate via oxaloacetate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gentekaki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Stechmann et al., 2008</xref>), and here we show that PEP transport is catalysed by bGIC-2. When PEP is exported by bGIC-2, it could be converted into pyruvate and lactate by cytosolic pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lantsman et al., 2008</xref>), which would lead to the synthesis of ATP and the conversion of NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup> in the cytosol. This reaction may play a significant role in cytosolic ATP generation, as there is no mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier in <italic>Blastocystis</italic> for adenine nucleotide exchange (<bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 1</bold>). <italic>Blastocystis</italic> also contains a glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gentekaki et al., 2017</xref>), which oxidises NADH to convert glycerol-3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which in turn can be transported into mitochondria by bGIC-2 to generate ATP and reducing equivalents. In most other eukaryotes, cytosolic NADH is oxidised by the malate-aspartate shuttle, but this pathway requires an ortholog of the mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier, which could not be identified in <italic>Blastocystis</italic>, even though it might have a mitochondrial glutamate carrier (<bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 1</bold>).</p>
<p>What selective advantage could there be to have the pay-off phase of glycolysis in the mitochondrial matrix? <italic>Blastocystis</italic> is well adapted to an anoxic environment with its anaerobic metabolism but has a limited ability to detoxify oxygen. In its natural environment, <italic>Blastocystis</italic> likely uses protons as terminal electron acceptors by using pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, which would result in the production of hydrogen and a range of fermentative products, such as lactate, acetate, and propionate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gentekaki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lantsman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Stechmann et al., 2008</xref>). Under aerobic stress, such as in a dysbiotic gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Stensvold and van der Giezen, 2018</xref>), it possibly uses oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor by using alternative oxidase, which produces water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tsaousis et al., 2018</xref>). However, as a likely adaptation to the anoxic environment, <italic>Blastocystis</italic> has lost some of the canonical components of oxidative phosphorylation, including complexes III and IV of the respiratory chain, ATP-synthase and mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Stechmann et al., 2008</xref>). Consequently, it has lost its ability to synthesize mitochondrial ATP via this route. This role was taken over by transfer of the pay-off phase of glycolysis to the mitochondrial matrix in <italic>Blastocystis</italic>, which has several advantages. The degradation of one glucose molecule in the cytosol requires one ATP and one pyrophosphate molecule, but will generate four ATP molecules in the mitochondrial matrix, which can be used for ATP-requiring processes, such as protein import, mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription, and mitochondrial protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Denoeud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gentekaki et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, two NAD<sup>+</sup> molecules are reduced to NADH, which can be used by complex I to generate a proton motive force to drive the import of proteins and the uptake of ions and molecules into mitochondria, such as phosphate. Cytosolic ATP can be supplied either through the export of PEP by bGIC-2, as explained, or via a mitochondrial carrier that shares properties with the mitochondrial Mg-ATP/Pi carrier, which is generally used to equilibrate adenine nucleotide pools between the matrix and cytosol.</p>
<p>Our results show that the canonical metabolic pathways studied in common model organisms can be altered in non-model eukaryotic species (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></bold>). Moreover, the newly discovered glycolytic intermediates carrier demonstrates the plasticity of mitochondrial carriers in terms of their substrate specificity. Through the discovery of this carrier, we have linked the two halves of glycolysis and provided a potential target for specific treatment not only for <italic>Blastocystis</italic> but also for other stramenopile pathogens that threaten global food security.</p>

<p>Bioinformatics-based approaches were used to identify potential candidates for a glycolytic intermediate transporter. Any potential transporter should be present in all stramenopiles, but absent in other eukaryotes, and could plausibly transport phosphorylated three carbon substrates. Most of the transport proteins in mitochondria belong to the mitochondrial carrier family (SLC25) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kunji et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ruprecht and Kunji, 2020</xref>), and thus the initial search focused on them.</p>
<p>Mitochondrial carrier sequences were gathered using 53 human mitochondrial carriers as a BLAST query against the genomes of selected stramenopiles: <italic>Blastocystis</italic> ST7-B<italic>, Aureococcus anophagefferens, Ectocarpus sp.</italic>, <italic>Saprolegnia parasitica, Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic> and <italic>Phytopthora infestans</italic>. InterProScan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/search/sequence/">www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/search/sequence/</ext-link>) was then used to discard non-carrier hits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jones et al., 2014</xref>), and partial sequences were removed (sequences with fewer than three signature repeats or 250 amino acids). Reciprocal BLAST was then used to eliminate incorrectly assigned sequences. The stramenopile sequences were aligned to <italic>Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> carriers. To prepare the alignment for phylogenetic analysis, the structures of the ADP/ATP carrier (PDB: 1OKC and 6GCI) were used to identify and remove the hypervariable loop regions in each sequence.</p>
<p>IQ-TREE was used to calculate a phylogenetic tree using an LG + F + R9 model suggested by ModelFinder and branch supports were generated by ultrafast bootstrap with 1000 replicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hoang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Minh et al., 2020</xref>). A clade of stramenopile-specific transporters was identified as a sister group to the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> di/tricarboxylate carrier homologs (DTC) (<bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 1</bold>). Within this clade, all selected stramenopile species were represented at least once. Interestingly, <italic>Blastocystis,</italic> which has no homolog of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, and would have to rely solely on the import of glycolytic intermediates, has four copies of this carrier. Given that DTC substrates are three-carbon dicarboxylates and tricarboxylates, it is possible that a closely related carrier could transport phosphorylated three-carbon substrates.</p>
<p>To investigate whether this clade is not only present in stramenopiles, but also unique to them, BLAST searches were performed using the unique stramenopile sequences against genomes from an expanded range of eukaryotes using NCBI and EukProt databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Priyam et al., 2019</xref>). The collected sequences were screened to remove partial and duplicate sequences and sequences that shared contact points with carboxylate carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kunji and Robinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Robinson and Kunji, 2006</xref>) were selected. They were added to a multiple sequence alignment of the identified stramenopile carriers and other closely related transporters from the first tree. The maximum likelihood tree was generated by IQ-TREE with the LG + F + R7 model suggested by ModelFinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Minh et al., 2020</xref>). Branch supports were generated by ultrafast bootstrap with 1000 replicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hoang et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>To address the absence of GIC in other species and exclude the possibility of its presence outside of stramenopiles, we performed additional analyses. The stramenopile GIC sequences were blasted against NCBI datasets encompassing major eukaryotic groups, and the top hits were selected and aligned with GIC sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of this expanded dataset revealed that the non-stramenopile carriers are more closely related to other carboxylate carriers, indicating that even the carriers most similar to GIC do not fall within the GIC clade. These analyses confirmed that the putative GIC carriers are universal in stramenopiles and also unique to them.</p>

<title>Protein purification by nickel affinity chromatography</title>
<p>Protein was purified as described previously for the human mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jaiquel Baron et al., 2021</xref>). In total, 0.5 g of mitochondria were solubilized in 1.5% (w/v) lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol, protease inhibitor tablet (Roche), 20 mM imidazole, and 150 mM NaCl for one hour by rotation at 4 °C. The insoluble material was separated from the soluble fraction by centrifugation (200,000 <italic>g</italic>, 45 minutes, 4 °C). Nickel Sepharose slurry (0.5 mL resin; GE healthcare) was added to the soluble fraction; the mixture was stirred at 4 °C for one hour.

Hoechst 33342 (5 µg mL<sup>-1</sup>, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to stain DNA. All immunofluorescence assays were carried out in No. 1.5 high precision glass cover slips (Marienfeld) coated with 20 µg Cell-Tak (Corning). Cells were mounted using ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant (Molecular Probes) and cured overnight. Images were taken using a Leica SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with oil immersion objective lens (Leica Microsystems, HC PL APO CS2 100x/1.40 NA). Z-stacks were collected with a system-optimized sampling compliant to the Nyquest-Shannon sampling theorem and with LAS X LIGHTNING deconvolution-optimized settings (Leica Microsystems).

<title>Thermostability analysis</title>
<p>Thermal unfolding analyses were performed with dye-free differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF), which monitors the changes in the spectral properties of tryptophan and tyrosine residues due to changes in their environment caused by unfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alexander et al., 2014</xref>). The proteins have the following number of tryptophans: hOGC (two); hDIC (one); bOGC (five); bGIC-1 (five); bGIC-2 (four). Approximately 0.6 μg of protein and 10 mM substrate were added into a final volume of 10 μL purification buffer B, and the samples were loaded into nanoDSF-grade standard glass capillaries. The temperature was increased by 4 °C every minute from 25 to 95 °C, the intrinsic fluorescence was measured in a Prometheus NT.48 nanoDSF device, and the apparent melting temperature (Tm) was calculated with the PR.ThermControl software (NanoTemper Technologies).</p>

Lipids were re-hydrated in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The detergent pentaethylene glycol monodecyl ether (C<sub>10</sub>E<sub>5</sub>) was added to a final concentration of 2.5% (v/v), and the lipids were solubilized by vortexing and incubated on ice: the equivalent 30 μg protein was added per sample. The pentaethylene glycol monodecyl was removed by SM-2 bio-beads (Bio-Rad): five additions of bio-beads were made to the master mix every 20 minutes with inversion at 4 °C: four additions of 30 mg, and the final addition of 240 mg per sample. The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Bio-beads were removed by passage through empty micro-bio spin columns (Bio-Rad). The compound was internalized by freeze-thaw-extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jaiquel Baron et al., 2021</xref>). Compound, to a final concentration of 5 mM (malate and sulphate assays) or 10 mM (phosphate assays) was added, and the sample was subjected to three cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen for two minutes followed by thawing in a room temperature water bath for ten minutes. Proteoliposomes were subsequently extruded by 21 passages through a 0.4-μm filter (Millipore), and the external substrate was removed and exchanged into buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 and 50 mM NaCl) using a PD10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) according to manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>This study identifies a family of solute transports in the enteric protist, Blastocystis, that may mediate the transport of glycolytic intermediates across the mitochondrial membrane. The study builds on previous observations suggesting that Blastocystis (and other Stramenopiles) are unusual in having a compartmentalized glycolytic pathway with enzymes involved in upper and lower glycolysis being located in the cytosol and mitochondria, respectively. In this study, the authors identified two putative Stamenopile metabolite transporters that are related to plant di/tricarboxylic acid transporters that might mediate the transport of glycolytic intermediates across the mitochondrial membrane. These GIC-transporters were localized to the Blastocystis mitochondrion using specific rabbit antibodies and shown to bind several glycolytic intermediates (including GAP, DHAP and PEP) based on thermostability shift assays. Direct evidence for transport activity was obtained by reconstituting native proteins in proteoliposomes and measuring uptake of 14C-malate or 35S-sulphate against unlabelled substrates. This assay showed that GIC-2 transported DHAP, GAP and PEP. However, significant transport activity was not observed for bGIC-2. Overall, the study provides strong, but not conclusive evidence that bGIC-2 is involved in transporting glycolytic intermediates across the inner membrane of the mitochondria, while the function of GIC-1 remains unclear, despite exhibiting the same metabolite binding properties as bGIC-2 n thermostability assays.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the findings are of interest in the context of understanding the diversity of core metabolic pathways in evolutionarily diverse eukaryotes, as well as the process by which cytosolic glycolysis evolved in most eukaryotes. The experiments are carefully performed and clearly described.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness of the study is the lack of direct evidence that either bGIC-1 and/or bGIC2 are active in vivo. While it is appreciated that the genetic tools for disrupting GIC genes in Blastocystis are limited/lacking, are there opportunities to ectopically express or delete these genes in other genetically tractable Stamenopiles, such as Phaeodactylum triconuteum?</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that both bGIC-1 and bGIC-2 are targeted to the mitochondrion, based on immunofluorescence studies. However, the precise localization and topology of these carriers in the inner or outer membrane is not defined. The conclusions of the study would be strengthened if the authors could show that one/both transporters are present in the inner membrane using protease protection experiments following differential solubilization of the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes.</p>
<p>It is not clear why hetero-exchange reactions were not performed for bGIC-1 (only for bGIC-2).</p>
<p>In both their previous study (Bartulos et al (2018) and the current study, the authors have shown that Blastocystis express a TPI-GAPDH fusion protein which is located to the mitochondrion. The presence of the TPI domain in the mitochondrial matrix would obviate the need for bGIC-1/2 triose transporters and decrease their value as drug targets. It is noted that Blastocystis still retains some TPI activity in the cytosol, presumably due to expression of a second cytoplasmic isoform, which could account for the presence of the bGIC transporters. However, some discussion on the role of this mitochondrial TPI-GAPDG fusion protein in Blastocystis and other Stramenopiles would be useful.</p>
<p>The summary slide (Fig 7) in the revised manuscript no longer shows PEP being used as a countersolute for the import of G3P and DHAP. Although it complicates the story, the role of PEP as a counter solute should be shown for completeness and also to make sense of some of the statements in the discussion. In particular, as noted by the authors, mitochondrial PEP could be exported back to the cytsol and converted to pyruvate and/or lactate to generate ATP and NAD, although at the expense of ATP synthesis in the mitochondria.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors set out to identify transporters that must exist in Stramenophiles due to the fact that the second half of glycolysis appears to be conducted in the mitochondria. They hypothesize that a Stramenophile-specific clade of transporters related to the dicarboxylate carriers are likely the relevant family and then go on to test two proteins from Blastocystis due to the infectious disease relevance of this organism. They show rather convincingly that these two proteins are expressed and are localized to the mitochondria in the native organism. The purified proteins bind to glycolytic intermediates and one of them, GIC-2, transports several glycolytic intermediates in vitro. This is a very solid and well-executed study that clearly demonstrates that bCIC-2 can transport glycolytic intermediates.</p>
<p>(1) The major weakness is that the authors aren't able to show that this protein actually has this function in the native organism. This could be impossible due to the lack of genetic tools in Blastocystis, but it leaves us without absolute confidence that bGIC-2 is the important glycolytic intermediate mitochondrial transporter (or even that it has this function in vivo).</p>
<p>(2) My impression is that the authors under-emphasize the fact that the hDIC also binds (and is stabilized by) glycolytic intermediates (G3P and 3PG). In the opinion of this reviewer, this might change my interpretation about the uniqueness of the bGIC proteins. They act on additional glycolytic intermediates, but it's not unique.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Unlike most eukaryotes Blastocystis has a branched glycolysis pathway, which is split between the cytoplasm and the mitochondrial matrix. An outstanding question was how the glycolytic intermediates generated in the 'preparatory' phase' are transported into the mitochondrial matrix for the 'pay off' phase. Here, the authors use bioinformatic analysis to identify two candidate solute carrier genes, bGIC-1 and bGIC-2, and use biochemical and biophysical methods to characterise their substrate specificity and transport properties. The authors demonstrate that bGIC-2 can transport dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate, establishing this protein as the 'missing link' connecting the two split branches of glycolysis in this branch of single celled eukaryotes. The authors also present their data on bGIC-1, which suggests a role in anion transport and bOGC, which is a close functional homologue of the human oxoglutarate carrier (hOGC, SLC25A11) and human dicarboxylate carrier (hDIC, SLC25A10).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The results are presented in a clear and logical arrangement, which nicely leads the reader through the process of gene identification and subsequent ligand screening and functional reconstitution. The results are compelling and well supported - the thermal stabilisation data is supported by the exchange studies. Caveats, where apparent, are discussed and rational explanations given.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study does not contain any significant weaknesses in my view. I would like to see the authors include the initial rate plots used in the main figures (possibly as insets), so we can observe the data points used for these calculations. It would also have been interesting to include the AlphaFold models for bGIC-1 and bGIC-2 and a discussion/rationalisation for the substrate specificity discussed in the study.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study identifies a family of solute transports in the enteric protist, Blastocystis, that may mediate the transport of glycolytic intermediates across the mitochondrial membrane. The study builds on previous observations suggesting that Blastocystis (and other Stramenopiles) are unusual in having a compartmentalized glycolytic pathway with enzymes involved in upper and lower glycolysis being located in the cytosol and mitochondria, respectively. In this study, the authors identified two putative Stamenopile metabolite transporters that are related to plant di/tricarboxylic acid transporters that might mediate the transport of glycolytic intermediates across the mitochondrial membrane. These GIC-transporters were localized to the Blastocystis mitochondrion using specific rabbit antibodies and shown to bind several glycolytic intermediates (including GAP, DHAP, and PEP) based on thermostability shift assays. Direct evidence for transport activity was obtained by reconstituting native proteins in proteoliposomes and measuring the uptake of 14C-malate or 35S-sulphate against unlabelled substrates. This assay showed that GIC-2 transported DHAP, GAP, and PEP. However, significant transport activity was not observed for bGIC-2. Overall, the study provides strong, but not conclusive evidence that bGIC-1 is involved in transporting glycolytic intermediates across the inner membrane of the mitochondria, while the function of GIC-2 remains unclear, despite exhibiting the same metabolite binding properties as bGIC-2 in thermostability assays.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the findings are of interest in the context of understanding the diversity of core metabolic pathways in evolutionarily diverse eukaryotes, as well as the process by which cytosolic glycolysis evolved in most eukaryotes. The experiments are carefully performed and clearly described.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their constructive comments. We note that bGIC-2 is the identified glycolytic intermediate transporter, not bGIC-1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness of the study is the lack of direct evidence that either bGIC-1 and/or bGIC2 are active in vivo. While it is appreciated that the genetic tools for disrupting GIC genes in Blastocystis are limited/lacking, are there opportunities to ectopically express or delete these genes in other Stamenopiles, such as Phaeodactylum triconuteum, to demonstrate function in vivo?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here, we have identified a transport protein, unique to stramenopiles, which is present in mitochondria of Blastocystis and can bind and transport glycolytic intermediates. We agree that it would have been desirable to confirm that they function as glycolytic intermediate transporters in vivo. However, the reviewer is correct in saying that the genetic tools for disrupting GIC genes in Blastocystis in vivo are not available. While the reviewer mentions the possibility of performing these analyses in Phaeodactylum tricornutum, it is important to note that this species possesses aerobic mitochondria and that the pay-off phase of glycolysis is present in both the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol. Consequently, any data obtained from this species might not be conclusive and would also not be relevant to the glycolytic metabolism in Blastocystis, the subject of this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors demonstrate that both bGIC-1 and bGIC-2 are targeted to the mitochondrion, based on immunofluorescence studies. However, the precise localization and topology of these carriers in the inner or outer membrane are not defined. The conclusions of the study would be strengthened if the authors could show that one/both transporters are present in the inner membrane using protease protection experiments following differential solubilization of the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The protein is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, which are extremely hydrophobic membrane proteins. Those with an established transport function are known to localise consistently to the mitochondrial inner membrane, which is impermeable to charged molecules, whereas the outer membrane is porous through VDAC. Furthermore, when the carriers are overproduced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the protein is found in the enriched mitochondrial fraction, adding further support to the idea that they are localised to the inner membrane, as the outer membrane has a limited surface area.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is not clear why hetero-exchange reactions were not performed for bGIC-1 (only for bGIC-2).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, bGIC-1 did not display transport activity when tested in [14C]-malate/malate, [35S]-sulphate/sulphate or [33P]-phosphate/phosphate homo-exchange reactions, as shown in Figure 6 (Figure 5 in the revised manuscript). Phosphoenolpyruvate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate are not available in a radiolabelled form and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is prohibitively expensive, so we were unable to test glycolytic intermediates directly in homo-exchange reactions. Hetero-exchange reactions, as performed in Figure 5 (Figure 6 in the revised manuscript) for bGIC-2, are conclusive, as accumulation of the radio-labelled substrate inside the proteoliposomes can only occur, when the internal substrate is exported. It seems that Blastocystis has multiple copies, some of which are coding for dysfunctional carriers, being possible pseudo-genes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The summary slide depicted in Fig 7 is somewhat simplified and inaccurate. First, the authors show that TPI is located in the mitochondria in this study, while in the summary figure, TPI is shown to be present in both the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix. A cytosolic localization for TPI provides a functional rationale for having a triose-P carrier in the inner membrane - however, this is not supported by the data shown here. Second, if bGIC1/2 uses PEP as a counter ion to import GA3P and DHAP into the mitochondrion, as proposed in Fig 7, the lower glycolytic pathway would be effectively truncated at PEP, removing substrate for pyruvate kinase and formation of pyruvate/ATP. Third, the authors suggest that DHAP may have other functions in the mitochondria although these are not shown in the figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 7 presents a schematic comparison of the localisation of glycolysis in humans and Blastocystis, specifically focused on the transport steps of either pyruvate (humans) or glycolytic intermediates (Blastocystis) into the mitochondrial matrix. Most of the metabolism of Blastocystis has been inferred from the presence or absence of genes, encoding for particular enzymes, with the exception of the unusual glycolytic pathway. We feel that overcomplicating this schematic figure would detract from the main message of this analysis. Although the transport data show that PEP, another glycolytic intermediate, is transported, we agree with the reviewer that PEP export cannot be rationalised in the context of our current understanding of the metabolism, and we have changed the figure accordingly.</p>
<p>We have not suggested that DHAP has other functions in mitochondria; on line 230, we state that ‘we have not found any evidence for the presence of dihydroxyacetone phosphate inside mitochondria in the literature. It is possible that it is not transported under physiological conditions in competition with dicarboxylates or other substrates.’</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments on the manuscript, and their careful analyses of the presented data.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, genetic manipulation in Blastocystis is currently not feasible and thus we cannot conduct a comparative metabolic study with the appropriate controls. The gold standard for identification is to prove the function with purified protein directly, which we have done here by using binding studies and transport assays.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It's atypical that the figures and figure panels don't really follow the order of their citation in the text. It's not a big deal, but mildly annoying to have to skip around in the figures (e.g. Figure 3D-E are described in the same paragraph as Figure 5). In addition, to facilitate the flow and a proper understanding I would encourage a reordering between figures 5D and 6 since Figure 6 is needed to understand the results shown in panel 5D, which may lead to confusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and have reordered the figures, switching Figure 5 and 6, which makes the manuscript easier to follow.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) My impression is that the authors under-emphasize the fact that the hDIC also binds (and is stabilized by) glycolytic intermediates (G3P and 3PG).

</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct that hDIC is stabilized by both G3P and 3PG, but neither are transported, as shown in Figure 5B (Figure 6B in the revised manuscript). It is not uncommon for compounds to bind to some extend without being transported, as they share certain structural and chemical features with the substrates, which result in stabilisation in thermostability analyses. For example, GTP stabilises the ADP/ATP carrier in thermostability analyses to some extent (Majd et al, 2018), although it is not a transported substrate of the carrier (King et al, 2020). Although thermostability assays are very useful for screening of potential substrates, it is always necessary to carry out transport assays, which are the gold standard for transporter identification.</p>

<p>We have shown uptake curves in both Figure 3 and Figure 6 (Figure 5 in the revised manuscript) to provide the typical uptake curves that we record by our robot, and we also show how we calculate the initial rates. We feel that the inclusion of uptake curves for each compound for each carrier (96 uptake curves in total) would make figure 5 (Figure 6 in the revised manuscript) extremely complicated.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Whilst AlphaFold is an important step forward in the prediction of protein structures, it is not accurate enough at this time to be used for the rationalisation of the substrate specificity. For instance, there are the significant structural differences between the predicted AlphaFold structure of the human uncoupling protein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/P25874">https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/P25874</ext-link>), by and large based on the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier, and the experimentally determined structure, especially for the central cavity where the substrate recognition takes place (Jones et al, 2023; Kang &amp; Chen, 2023). More importantly, it is believed that the optimal binding of the substrate takes place in the occluded state (Klingenberg, 2007; Springett et al, 2017), for which we have no structure.</p>
