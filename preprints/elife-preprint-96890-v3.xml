<title>Abstract</title><p>As the global population ages, the prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders is fast increasing. This neurodegeneration as well as other CNS injuries cause permanent disabilities. Thus, generation of new neurons is the rosetta stone in contemporary neuroscience.</p>
<p>Glial cells support central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis through evolutionary conserved mechanisms. Upon damage, glial cells activate an immune and inflammatory response to clear the injury site from debris, and proliferate to restore cell number. This glial regenerative response (GRR) is mediated by the neuropil associated glia (NG) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, equivalent to vertebrate astrocytes, oligodendrocytes (OL) and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Here, we examine the contribution of NG lineages and the GRR in response to injury. The results indicate that NG exchanges identities between ensheathing glia (EG) and astrocyte like glia (ALG). Additionally, we found that NG cells undergo transdifferentiation to yield neurons. Moreover, this transdifferentiation increases in injury conditions. Thus, these data demonstrate that glial cells are able to generate new neurons through direct transdifferentiation. The present work makes a fundamental contribution to the CNS regeneration field and describes a new physiological mechanism to generate new neurons.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neuronal loss caused by injury or neurodegenerative diseases is irreversible in the Central Nervous System (CNS) of vertebrates. Spinal fractures represent 5-6% of all fractures, and spinal cord damage complicates 16-40% of spinal fractures causing significant impairment to patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ding et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, according to the United Nations, the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases will almost double in the next 20 years. Current therapeutic strategies aim to replace damaged or lost cells through dedifferentiation and transplantation or cell reprogramming of glial cells. Thus, understanding glial cell contribution after CNS damage is relevant to attain its functional recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Glial cells activate inflammatory and proliferative responses upon injury in a process known as Glial Regenerative Response (GRR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Losada-Perez, 2018</xref>). This response is described in multiple species of vertebrates and invertebrates, and the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are conserved from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to mice or humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chandra et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kato et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Losada-Perez, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Losada-Pérez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Purice et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Smith et al., 1987</xref>). Glial proliferation is a well-known cellular response upon CNS damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chandra et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kato et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Li and Hidalgo, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Purice et al., 2017</xref>) however it is not clear how this response contributes to CNS regeneration. In mammals, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs or NG2-glia) react giving rise to oligodendrocytes while in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> neuropil associated glia play that role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Losada-Pérez et al., 2021</xref>). Upon injury, mammalian OPCs can produce astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (OL) contributing to CNS repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Niu et al., 2021</xref>). GRR of neuropil glia (NPG) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva is modulated by a genetic network that controls the switch between quiescence, proliferation and differentiation. Although, whether these mechanisms operate in the mature differentiated adult brain is still unknown. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, NPG somata reside in the cortex/neuropil interface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). NPG includes two groups: Astrocyte-Like Glia (ALG), and Ensheathing Glia (EG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kremer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Losada-Perez, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Shweta et al., 2024</xref>). EG enwraps the neuropil, and bundles of axons within the neuropil that define different functional regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Losada-Perez, 2018</xref>). By contrast, ALG cells project to the neuropil forming a dense meshwork with the synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Losada-Perez, 2018</xref>), which suggests that ALG cells may play a significant role in maintaining the architecture and function of the neuropil. Larval ALG upregulates <italic>kon-tiki</italic> expression upon injury, a gene which is required for glial division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Losada-Perez et al., 2016</xref>). Besides, larval EG during metamorphosis can de-differentiate, proliferate and re-differentiate into adult ALG and EG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kato et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, NPG appear as good candidates to replace lost cells with functional ones.</p>

<title>Results</title>

<label>1.</label><title>Astrocyte-like glia proliferation in adult is increased upon crush injury</title>
<p>Glial cells play a crucial role in the regenerative processes of the nervous system by providing structural support, modulating inflammation, and facilitating tissue repair. They secrete molecular signals that influence neuronal survival, axonal regrowth, and synaptic remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gallo et al., 2014</xref>; Losada-Perez et al., 2021). These signals include cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix components, which coordinate the activation of repair pathways and the recruitment of immune cells to the injury site.</p>
<p>Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate glial cell behaviour is critical for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing functional recovery after nervous system injuries. Previously we described that glial cells proliferate in basal conditions and in response to crush injury in the adult fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Losada-Pérez et al., 2021</xref>) although we did not identify the glial subtype responsible for this response. Thus, we questioned if those dividing cells were of the NPG type, that is, Astrocyte-Like Glia (ALG), as previous works suggest in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Losada-Perez et al., 2016</xref>), or Ensheathing Glia (EG).</p>
<p>ALG identity is defined by the co-expression of <italic>repo</italic> and <italic>prospero</italic> transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Omoto et al., 2015</xref>). To determine if ALG cells divide upon injury, we caused a crush in the metathoracic neuromere of the adult ventral nerve cord (VNC, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Losada-Pérez et al., 2021</xref>) and performed EdU experiments combined with staining with anti-Repo (pan-glia marker) and anti-Prospero antibodies. The results show that ALG cells (Repo positive, Prospero positive) divide (EdU positive) after injury (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Besides, we also observed EdU+ Repo+ cells that were Pros negative. Therefore, this result indicates that glial cells, different from ALG, also undergo division.</p>
<p>There is no specific nuclear marker for EG cells, consequently, to determine if the other dividing cells were EG, we expressed the Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator (FLY-FUCCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Zielke et al., 2014</xref>)) under control of a specific driver for EG (R56F03-Gal4). This genetic tool allows the visualisation and monitorization of cell cycle-regulated proteins tagged with fluorescent markers, allowing to determine the cell cycle phase of individual cells based on their fluorescence. (see Materials and Methods). In parallel, to monitor cell cycle progression in ALG cells, we expressed FLY-FUCCI under control of the ALG specific driver alrm-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Altenhein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Beckervordersandforth et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>We quantified the number of ALG or EG cells in G2-M (i.e., GFP and RFP positive) in control and injured animals at 24h after injury. The data show that EG cells have a basal division rate which does not change in response to injury. In contrast, ALG cells have a higher division rate in basal conditions compared to EG, and this rate increases in response to injury (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-C</xref>’). This result indicates that adult ALG cells activate a proliferative response after injury, akin to the proliferative response in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Losada-Perez et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, the basal proliferation of EG explains the presence of Repo+EdU+Pros-cells.</p>
<p>To further confirm these results, we generated Twin-MARCM clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Yu et al., 2009</xref>) using specific drivers for EG (R65F03-Gal4) or ALG (alrm-Gal4). We combined the Twin-MARCM technique with tubGal80<sup>TS</sup> under temperature control (see Materials and Methods). This technique allowed the study of ALG or EG division selectively in adulthood (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of ALG MARCM clones indicate that ALG divides in normal conditions in the adult CNS. Since ALG cells are very heterogeneous in size and shape we were not able to determine the number of cells that composed each clone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>’). However, we quantified the number of individuals with clones. The results indicate that the percentage of samples with clones is significantly higher in injured animals compared to controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). To confirm that this division is not the result of residual development, we repeated the experiment with <italic>mature</italic> (seven-days-old) flies. In this case, the percentage of not-injured CNS with clones is lower compared with young flies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) indicating we were observing a developmental effect. However, in <italic>mature</italic> flies, the percentage of samples with clones is significantly higher in injured animals compared to not-injured controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) indicating that ALG divide upon damage after the developmental program is finished.</p>
<p>MARCM clones induction with the specific driver for EG did not generate any clone, neither in normal conditions nor after crush injury. MARCM technique generates clones in a stochastic manner, therefore the lack of MARCM clones does not indicate that EG never divides, instead, it indicates that this event is less frequent than ALG division. These results are consistent with the FLY-FUCCI results.</p>
<p>Altogether, the results indicate that there is a basal division rate of neuropil glia where EG divides less often than ALG. Also, ALG shows a proliferative response to crush injury. These findings go in line with previous reports indicating the proliferative response of glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Losada-Perez, 2018</xref>). Moreover, the results now describe proliferation of adult fully-differentiated glial cells and define a differential response of EG and ALG in basal conditions, and upon injury. OPCs carry the proliferative response upon injury in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Losada-Perez, 2018</xref>). Therefore, these results further support the homology between ALG and vertebrate OPC.</p>

<label>2.</label><title>Programmed cell death regulates ALG number after injury</title>
<p>The Twin-MARCM technique implies that the cell division includes homologous recombination. The first division would give rise to two daughter cells, one GFP positive and other RFP positive (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). These differentially marked daughter cells could further divide or not, yielding clones of different sizes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>’ and F). However, during ALG MARCM clone quantification we noticed that &gt;50% of clones were single-colour clones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 G-H</xref>). This means that after the first division, one of the daughter cells either dies or changes its identity (as we use the alrm-Gal4 ALG specific driver to express GFP or RFP). To determine if single colour clones could be explained by Programmed Cell Death (PCD) we inhibited it by co-expressing UAS-p35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hay et al., 1994</xref>), while inducing Twin-MARCM clones in injured animals. The results showed that p35 significantly reduced the number of single colour clones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). These results indicate that a portion of dividing ALG cells undergo PCD, reducing the final number of newly generated ALG after injury. This cellular behaviour is commonly observed during development, where cells are produced in excess and are eliminated by PCD later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fuchs and Steller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Gabilondo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Miguel-Aliaga and Thor, 2009</xref>). Now we describe how differentiated glial cells reproduce this proliferative response, and the elimination of cells by PCD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<label>3.</label><title>NP glia exchange identities between EG and ALG</title>
<p>Apoptosis inhibition significantly reduces ALG single-colour clones, but we could still observe them. This could be explained by the different effectiveness of the UAS-p35 to suppress apoptosis, but also by the existence of dedifferentiation or transdifferentiation processes. To test this hypothesis, we combined the G-TRACE tool, which allows the visualisation of historical and current Gal4 activation, with TubGal80ts to restrict the G-trace historical visualisation to adulthood.</p>
<p>We drove the expression of G-TRACE reporter with the specific drivers for ALG or EG and analysed the historical and current activation of ALG or EG drivers. The results show that in both ALG and EG experiments there were cells with historical driver activation but not current activation (GFP+RFP-) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-A</xref>’). Also, those cells have distinctive nuclear sizes and positions (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). We named the first type neuropil-like cells (NP-like, arrowheads <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), as they have similar nuclear shape and size to ALG and EG and they were found in the cortex-neuropil interface, where neuropil glia nuclei are usually positioned (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The second type of cells were found in the ventral cortex and presented larger nuclei compared to NP-like cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1 A-B</xref>), thus, given their position we named those cells as Ventral Cortex cells or VC cells (arrowheads <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>’).</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we asked if those cells that changed their fate still had a glial identity. To answer this question, we stained NP-like cells with the pan-glial marker Repo. The results indicate that NP-like cells are glia as they were Repo+ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> B-B’). To confirm this, we expressed G-TRACE under the control of <italic>Repo Gal4</italic> pan-glial driver and analysed the presence or absence of transformed cells. We identified GFP+RFP-cells localised in the ventral cortex with identical nuclear shape as the VC cells identified in previous experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), however, we could not find any NP-like cells. Thus, it seems that NP-like cells have glial identity while VC cells have not.</p>
<p>Next, we addressed if the NP-like glia fate change was triggered by injury. To that end we quantified the number of NP-like cells transformed from ALG or from EG, in not- injured and injured animals 6h and 24h after crush injury. The results show that the number of NP-like cells does not increase in response to injury no matter their initial identity, ALG or EG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> D). However, we found significant differences in the number of transformed cells that originated from ALG or EG. We observed that ALG to NP-like transformation is less frequent than EG to NP-like transformation (&lt;0.5% in ALG compared with &gt;10% in EG) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>The transformation of EG into ALG has been shown during metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kato et al., 2020</xref>), indicating the versatility of those cells. Thus, we use anti-prospero to determine if the NP-like cells originated from EG have ALG identity in this context. The images show that the NP-like cells originated from EG where pros+ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that EG transdifferentiate into ALG. Next, to determine if Prospero is required for EG to ALG transformation we quantified and compared the number of NP-like cells that arose from EG origin in controls and in individuals where <italic>pros</italic> was downregulated specifically in EG cells. The results showed a significant decrease in the number of NP- like cells upon pros knockdown in EG cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>pros</italic> downregulation in EG reduces inter-glia conversion. Thus, we can conclude that Prospero is required for the EG to ALG transformation in adult CNS.</p>

<p>This is the first report of EG to ALG transformation <italic>in vivo</italic> in adult flies. The functional implications of this process include CNS regeneration, cellular homeostasis and behavioural consequences including locomotion recovery, but probably also learning and memory. The concept of &quot;baseline&quot; plasticity in adult tissues suggests that even in the absence of injury or external stimuli, certain cell types may retain the ability to undergo phenotypic changes. In the context of glial cells, this plasticity could reflect an intrinsic readiness to adapt to the dynamic needs of the surrounding tissue, such as maintaining homeostasis, or supporting regeneration. This property of glial cells, might impact on compensatory mechanisms for neurodegenerative processes, tissue engineering and regenerative therapies that exploit endogenous repair mechanisms, and cellular adaptability in the nervous system to functional needs.</p>

<label>4.</label><title>NP-Glia transdifferentiate to neurons upon injury</title>
<p>Repo-GTRACE experiments demonstrated that VC cells are not glia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-C</xref>). To test if these new cells have a neuronal identity, we stained the VNCs with the pan- neuronal marker Elav. The analysis showed that these cells were Elav positive (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-A</xref>). This result indicates that glial cells can transdifferentiate into neurons under normal conditions. Next, we quantified the number of VC cells following injury. The results show that the number of VC cells is significantly higher in injured animals compared to non-injured controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Next, we analysed which NPG subpopulation (i.e., ALG or EG) were responsible for this increase of VC neurons. To eliminate any developmental effect, we analysed in mature flies (see M&amp;M) the possible trans differentiation from ALG or EG into VC in control and injured animals. The result showed that the new neurons originate from both transdifferentiated ALG and EG (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>So far, we have seen that ALG cells divide upon injury while EG do not. On the other hand, VC neurons increase out from ALG and EG types in response to injury. This could indicate that ALG divides prior to trans differentiation while EG transdifferentiate directly. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the number of ALG and EG cells in both injured animals and not-injured controls. We found a significant increase of ALG number in injured animals compared to controls in line with our previous results. Moreover, we found a significant decrease of EG in injured animals compared to not-injured controls supporting the direct transformation in response to injury (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, to determine the identity of trans differentiated neurons, we stained VC cells with different neuronal markers such GABA, ChaT or GluRIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boppana et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Katheder et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kolodziejczyk et al., 2008</xref>). The images showed that VC cells are negative for all markers(<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>), preventing definitive identification of their neuronal subtype. The absence of neuronal marker expression in VC cells suggests an immature cellular state. It is plausible that, given sufficient time and appropriate environmental cues, these cells might undergo further differentiation into mature neurons. Such maturation could enable their functional integration into existing neuronal networks, potentially contributing to nervous system regeneration. However, this hypothesis remains speculative and requires further investigation. Future studies should explore the conditions that promote VC cell maturation, including the influence of extracellular signals, transcriptional regulation, and synaptic connectivity. Understanding these processes could advance the development of regenerative therapies targeting neurodegenerative diseases or injuries.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results indicate that ALG and EG generate new neurons in response to injury through two different mechanisms. ALG divide and transdifferentiate while EG transdifferentiate directly. Thus, glial cells reveal as key contributors to newly generated glia and neurons during regeneration.</p>
<p>Many authors are exploring the potential of astrocytes to generate new neurons, however they are focused on artificial reprogramming or trans differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Talifu et al., 2022</xref>). This is the first description of this phenomenon observed <italic>in vivo in wild type animals</italic>. Therefore, these findings open a new approach to generate new neurons in a damaged CNS. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern this physiological glial behaviour would have an immeasurable value.</p>

In the experiments where we needed to temperature control Gal4 activation (i.e., UAS-GTRACE) we breed flies at 17°C, then we selected that emerged 24 to 48h before injury (for 1-day old flies) or that emerged 10 to 12 days (for mature flies) and then collocated at permissive temperature (i.e., 29° C, where Gal80 TS is inactive and the Gal4/UAS system is active).

<p>Using Twin-spot MARCM technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Yu et al., 2009</xref>) it is possible to detect cells dividing in a specific moment. When a cell divides, each of the two resulting cells is marked with GFP or RFP, always considering that the promoter directing this tool gets activated. This is possible because the genetic constructs used within this tool includes a flipase under the control of a heat shock promoter (HsFlp). This enzyme induces mitotic recombination of sequences situated between FRT (Flipase recognition target) sites. To induce flipase activation, flies were exposed to heat-shocks by introducing the vials in 37°C water baths for 60 minutes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Casas-Tinto et al., provide new insight into glial plasticity using a crush injury paradigm in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) of adult Drosophila. The authors find that both astrocyte-like glia (ALG) and ensheating glia (EG) divide under homeostatic conditions in the adult VNC and identify ALG as the glial population that specifically ramps up proliferation in response to injury, whereas the number of EGs decreases following the insult. Using lineage-tracing tools, the authors interestingly observe interconversion of glial subtypes, especially of EGs into ALGs, which occurs independent of injury and is dependent on the availability of the transcription factor Prospero in EGs, adding to the plasticity observed in the system. Finally, when tracing the progeny of glia, Casas-Tinto and colleagues detect cells of neuronal identity and provide evidence that such glia-derived neurogenesis is favored following ventral nerve cord injury, which puts forward a remarkable way in which glia can respond to neuronal damage.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study highlights a new facet of adult nervous system plasticity at the level of the ventral nerve cord, supporting the view that proliferative capacity is maintained in the mature CNS and stimulated upon injury.</p>
<p>The injury paradigm is well chosen, as the organization of the neuromeres allows specific targeting of one segment, compared to the remaining intact and with the potential to later link observed plasticity to behavior such as locomotion.</p>
<p>Numerous experiments have been carried out in 7-day old flies, showing that the observed plasticity is not due to residual developmental remodeling or a still immature VNC.</p>
<p>Different techniques are used to observe proliferation in the VNC.</p>
<p>By elegantly combining different methods, the authors show glial divisions including with mitotic-dependent tracing and find that the number of generated glia is refined by apoptosis later on.</p>
<p>The work identifies prospero in glia as important coordinator of glial cell fate, from development to the adult context, which draws further attention to the upstream regulatory mechanisms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors do not discuss their results on gliogenesis or neurogenesis in the adult VNC to previous findings made in the context of the injured adult brain.</p>
<p>The authors speculate about the role of glial inter-conversion for tissue homeostasis or regeneration, but no supportive evidence is cited or provided. Further experiments will be required to test the function of the described glial plasticity.</p>
<p>Elav+ cells originating from glia do not express markers for mature neurons at the analysed time-point. If they will eventually differentiate</p>
<p>
or what type of structure is formed by them will have to be followed up in future studies.</p>
<p>Context/Discussion</p>
<p>Highlighting some differences in the reactiveness of glia in the VNC compared to the brain could reveal important differences in repair strategies in different areas of the CNS.</p>

<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>In this work, the authors use a Drosophila adult ventral nerve cord injury model extending and confirming previous observations; this important study reveals key aspects of adult neural plasticity. Taking advantage of several genetic reporter and fate tracing tools, the authors provide solid evidence for different forms of glial plasticity, that are increased upon injury. The data on detected plasticity under physiologic conditions and especially the extent of cell divisions and cell fate changes upon injury would benefit from validation by additional markers. The experimental part would improve if strengthened and accompanied by a more comprehensive integration of results regarding glial reactivity in the adult CNS.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for your thoughtful comments and constructive feedback regarding our manuscript. We appreciate all the positive remarks on the significance of our findings on neural plasticity in this Drosophila adult ventral nerve cord injury model.</p>
<p>In response to your suggestion, we fully agree that the continuation of this project should address in detail cell fate changes with additional markers if available, or an “omic” approach such as scRNAseq. Unfortunately, these further experiments are beyond the scope of this paper to describe the <italic>in vivo</italic> phenomena of cell reprogramming, and the cellular events that take glial cells to convert into neurons or neuronal precursors.</p>
<p>Additionally, we agree that the experimental part can be further improved by providing a more comprehensive integration of our results with current knowledge on glial reactivity in the adult CNS. We will revise the manuscript accordingly to include a deeper discussion of the broader implications of our findings and their alignment with existing literature.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your valuable input, which will undoubtedly enhance the quality of our work. We look forward to submitting the revised manuscript for your consideration.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review)</bold>:</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Casas-Tinto et al. present convincing data that injury of the adult Drosophila CNS triggers transdifferentiation of glial cell and even the generation of neurons from glial cells. This observation opens up the possibility to get an handle on the molecular basis of neuronal and glial generation in the vertebrate CNS after traumatic injury caused by Stroke or Crush injury. The authors use an array of sophisticated tools to follow the development of glial cells at the injury site in very young and mature adults. The results in mature adults reveal a remarkable plasticity in the fly CNS and dispels the notion that repair after injury may be only possible in nerve cords which are still developing. The observation of so called VC cells which do not express the glial marker repo could point to the generation of neurons by former glial cells.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>The authors present an interesting story which is technically sound and could form the basis for an in depth analysis of the molecular mechanism driving repair after brain injury in Drosophila and vertebrates.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The evidence for transdifferentiation of glial cells is convincing. In addition, the injury to the adult CNS shows an inherent plasticity of the mature ventral nerve cord which is unexpected.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Traumatic brain injury in Drosophila has been previously reported to trigger mitosis of glial cells and generation of neural stem cells in the larval CNS and the adult brain hemispheres. Therefore this report adds to but does not significantly change our current understanding. The origin and identity of VC cells is still unclear. The authors show that VC cells are not GABA- or glutamergic. Yet, there are many other neurotransmitter or neuropetides. It would have been nice to see a staining with another general neuronal marker such as anti-Syt1 to confirm the neuronal identity of Syt1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments and positive feedback. We concur that previous studies have demonstrated glial cell proliferation in response to CNS injury. In contrast, our study focuses on glial transdifferentiation that emerges as a novel phenomenon, particularly in response to injury. We found that neuropile glia lose their glial identity and express the pan-neuronal marker Elav. To investigate the identity of these newly observed elav-positive cells, we employed anti-ChAT, antiGABA and anti-GluRIIA antibodies to determine the functional identity of these cells, besides we stained them with other neuronal markers such Enabled, Gigas or Dac (not shown); however, our attempts yielded limited success. To address this, we have now included a discussion section exploring the potential identity of these cells, considering the possibility that they may represent immature neurons.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for his/her comments and the positive analysis of this work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors observe consistent inter-conversion of EG to ALG glial subtypes that is further stimulated upon injury. The authors conclude that these findings have important consequences for CNS regeneration and potentially for memory and learning. However, it remains somewhat unclear how glial transformation could contribute to regeneration and functional recovery.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an ongoing question in the laboratory and in the field. We know that glial cells contribute to the regenerative program in the nervous system, and molecular signalling in glial cells is determinant for the functional recovery (Losada-Perez et al 2021). Therefore, we include this concept in the discussion as the evidence indicates that glial cells participate in these programs. However, further investigation is required to clarify and determine the mechanisms underlying this glial contribution. To determine if glial to neuron transformation contributes to functional recovery, we would need to compare the recovery of animals with new VC to animals without VC, however, the  molecular mechanism that produces this change of identity is still unknown, and therefore we are not able to generate injured flies with no new VC</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The signal of the Fucci cell cycle reporter seems more complex to interpret based on the panels provided compared to the other methods employed by the authors to assess cell divisions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that Fly Fucci is a genetic reporter that might be more complex to interpret than EdU staining or other markers. However, glial cells proliferation is a milestone of this manuscript, and we used different available tools to confirm our results. We have revised this specific section to ensure that the text is clear and straightforward.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Elav+ cells originating from glia do not express markers for mature neurons at the analysed time-point. If they will eventually differentiate or what type of structure is formed by them will have to be followed up in future studies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with the reviewer, and we will analyze later days to study neuronal fate and contribution to VNC function.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Context/Discussion</p>
<p>There is some lack of connecting or later comparing the observed forms of glial plasticity in the VNC with respect to plasticity described in the fly brain.</p>
<p>Highlighting some differences in the reactiveness of glia in the VNC compared to the brain could point to relevant differences in repair capacity in different areas of the CNS.</p>
<p>Based on the assays employed, the study points to a significant amount of glial &quot;identity&quot; changes or interconversions under homeostatic conditions. The potential significance of this rather unexpected &quot;baseline&quot; plasticity in adult tissues is not explicitly pointed out and could improve the understanding of the findings.</p>
<p>Some speculations if &quot;interconversion&quot; of glia is driven by the needs in the tissue could enrich the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for these suggestions. We have changed the discussion to introduce these concepts.</p>

<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>In the previous version of the manuscript, I had suggested several recommendations for the authors. Unfortunately, none of these were addressed in the author's revision.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for this error. We apologize but we never received these comments. We have now found them, and we have incorporated these comments in the new version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) Have you tried screening for other markers for the EdU+ Repo+ Pros- cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have identified these cells as glial cells (Repo +), and not astrocyte-like glia (pros-). But we have not further characterized  the identity of these cells. Our aim was to identify these proliferating glial cells as NPG (Neuropile glia), which are Astrocyte-Like Glia (ALG), as previous works suggest in larvae (Kato et al., 2020; Losada-Perez et al., 2016), or Ensheathing Glia (EG). To discard the ALG identity, we used prospero as the best marker. The results indicate that there are ALG among the proliferating population, but in addition, we also found pros- glial cells that were EdU positive. These cells are located in the interface between cortex and neuropile, where the neuropile glia position is described. The anti-pros staining indicated they were no ALG which suggest that they are EG.</p>
<p>There is no specific nuclear marker for EG cells, therefore we used FLY_FUCCI under the control of a EG specific promoter (R56F03-Gal4) to determine if the other dividing cells were EG. These results indicate that EG glia divide although their proliferation does not increase upon injury.</p>
<p>The R56F03 Gal4 construct is described as ensheathing glia specific by previous publications, including:</p>
<p>(1) Kremer M. C., Jung C., Batelli S., Rubin G. M. and Gaul U. (2017). The glia of the adult Drosophila nervous system. <italic>Glia</italic> 65, 606-638. 10.1002/glia.23115</p>

<p>To summarize, our results suggest that part of these proliferating glial cells are ALG and EG. Our results can not discard that a residual part of these proliferating cells are not AG nor EG.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) You mentioned that ALG are heterogenous in size and shape, does that mean that you may have different subpopulations of ALG? Would that also mean that only a portion of them responds to injury?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, as in Astrocytes in vertebrates this population is highly heterogeneous. Currently there are no molecular tools to specifically identify these subpopulations and characterize their distinct roles. However, emerging research suggests that differences in size, shape, and potentially molecular markers could correlate with functional diversity. This implies that certain subpopulations of ALG may be more specialized or primed to respond to injury, while others may play roles in homeostasis or other processes. Understanding this heterogeneity will require advanced techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, or live imaging to unravel how these subpopulations contribute to injury responses and overall tissue dynamics.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) You mentioned that NP-like cells have similar nuclear shape and size to ALG and EG, while Ventral cortex cells have larger nuclei. Can you please show a quantification of the NP-like cells and Ventral cortex cells size, and show a direct comparison with ALG and EG cells to support those claims (images, quantification and analysis)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added a new supplementary figure with a graph showing nuclei size differences between VC and NP-like cells, and a diagram showing VC cell localization. Images in figure 2A-A’ and 2B-B’ show both types of cells with the same scale, additionally, NPG cells are shown in red (current expression of the specific Gal4 line). A direct comparison between EG and NP-like glia can be observed in Figure 3 as well.</p>
<p>Besides of size and localization, we conclude  that VC and N-like cells present different molecular markers as VC are elav-positive and reponegative whereas NP-like cells are repo-positive elav-negative</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 2B, the repo expression is not very clear. I suggest using a different example to support the claim that NP cells are Repo+.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have changed the color of anti-elav staining to facilitate visualisation</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Again, in Figure 2C, you need quantification and analysis to support the claim that you used nuclear shape and size to identify VC vs. NP like cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Quantification in point 3, criteria in Figure S1</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) What is the identity of the newly formed neurons? Other than Elav, have you tried using other markers of neurons that are typically found in this area?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This question is of great interest and relevance. We have done great efforts to solve this open question and so far, our data suggest that these neurons might be in an immature state. In this last version of the manuscript, we included the results (Figure S1) with several different markers.</p>
<p>The molecular identity of these cell populations, glia and neurons, is currently under investigation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>(1) In the abstract, EG and ALG abbreviations are not introduced properly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for noticing this missing information, we have now included it in the abstract.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Please include a representation of the NPG somata location in Figure 1A.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included this information in the figure</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) A schematic showing the differences between ALG and EG cells would be helpful as well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included in the introduction references and reviews where other authors describe in detail the differences.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 1 E, G, H- please indicated the genotype of the fly used in the panel as well as the cell type studied.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The complete genotype is included in the corresponding figure legend. We have added a simplified genotype in the figure for clarity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Please show the genotype used for images in Figure 2: ALG or EG specific drivers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This information is included in the corresponding figure legend. We believe that it is better to keep the figure clean so we decided to keep the complete genotype, which is considerably long, only in the figure legend.</p>
