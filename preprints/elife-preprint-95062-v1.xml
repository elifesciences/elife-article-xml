<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP43) proteinopathy, characterized by the mislocalization and aggregation of TDP43, is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In this study, we describe the development of a new model of TDP43 proteinopathy using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. Utilizing a genome engineering approach, we induced the mislocalization of endogenous TDP43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm without mutating the TDP43 gene or using chemical stressors. Our model successfully recapitulates key early and late pathological features of TDP43 proteinopathy, including neuronal loss, reduced neurite complexity, and cytoplasmic accumulation and aggregation of TDP43. Concurrently, the loss of nuclear TDP43 leads to splicing defects, while its cytoplasmic gain adversely affects microRNA expression. Strikingly, our observations suggest that TDP43 is capable of sustaining its own mislocalization, thereby perpetuating and further aggravating the proteinopathy. This innovative model provides a valuable tool for the in-depth investigation of the consequences of TDP43 proteinopathy. It offers a clinically relevant platform that will accelerate identification of potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of TDP43-associated neurodegenerative diseases including sporadic ALS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the relentless degeneration of motor neurons (MNs) in both the brain and spinal cord (R. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brown and Al-Chalabi 2017</xref>). This degeneration precipitates a cascade of symptoms including muscle weakness, atrophy, and paralysis, eventually leading to respiratory failure and death typically within three to five years after the onset of symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hardiman et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>A hallmark of ALS pathology is the aberrant behaviour of the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (hereafter TDP43). In ALS patients, TDP43, which normally resides in the nucleus, becomes mislocalized, forming aggregates in the cytoplasm of neurons and glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Neumann et al. 2006</xref>). This phenomenon, termed TDP43 proteinopathy, is implicated in the majority of ALS cases and is considered a central player in the disease’s pathogenesis (S.-C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ling, Polymenidou, and Cleveland 2013</xref>). TDP43 proteinopathy is a common feature in multiple age-associated neurodegenerative diseases including ALS, Limbic-predominant age-related TDP43 encephalopathy (LATE), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (de Boer et al. 2020). TDP43 (encoded by <italic>TARDBP</italic>) is an RNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in RNA metabolism, encompassing RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Donde et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Polymenidou et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arnold 2012</xref>; J. P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ling et al. 2015</xref>), stabilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sidibé et al. 2021</xref>), and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nagano et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chu et al. 2019</xref>) thus ensuring proper neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gimenez et al. 2023</xref>). For example, recent studies have demonstrated cryptic exon (CE) inclusion triggered by loss of nuclear TDP43 (J. P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ling et al. 2015</xref>), especially in transcripts of important neuronal genes <italic>UNC13A</italic> (A.-L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brown et al. 2022</xref>; Ma et al. 2022) and <italic>STMN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Klim et al. 2019</xref>; Melamed et al. 2019). Additionally, TDP43 associates with the microRNA biogenesis machinery and affects microRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buratti et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kawahara and Mieda-Sato 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Paez-Colasante et al. 2020</xref>). Accordingly, widespread dysregulation of microRNA levels have been reported in spinal tissue obtained post-mortem from sporadic ALS cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Reichenstein et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Emde et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Figueroa-Romero et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gagliardi et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Current cellular models aimed at investigating TDP43 mislocalization involve mutating the TDP43 nuclear-localization signal, using mutant versions identified in familial ALS patients, or the use of pharmacological agents to induce stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barmada et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zuo et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ziff et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Walker et al. 2015</xref>). Despite the insights gained from these models, they harbour inherent limitations. Overexpression may not represent physiological conditions, TDP43 is found to be mutated in &lt;0.5% of all ALS cases, and pharmacological induction might induce events unrelated to the disease. Further, CEs identified in ALS/FTD cases are poorly conserved beyond primates, making it challenging to investigate the contribution of splicing defects to ALS pathophysiology using animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baughn et al. 2023</xref>). Human induced pluripotent technology (iPSCs) offers a powerful platform that addresses some of these issues with animal models enabling the development of human models of ALS <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Giacomelli et al. 2022</xref>). A recent study employed sporadic ALS spinal cord extracts to induce TDP43 proteinopathy in iPSC-derived MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Smethurst et al. 2020</xref>). However, the model’s utility is limited by the small percentage of neurons showing TDP43 pathology and the difficulty in producing spALS spinal extracts consistently and in large quantities.</p>
<p>In this study, we present an innovative human model of TDP43 proteinopathy that allows us to trigger cytoplasmic mislocalization of endogenous non-mutated TDP43 on demand in healthy control iPSC-MNs at scale (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>). This technological advancement offers an unprecedented level of insight into TDP43 proteinopathy and its role in ALS.</p>

<p>We fused green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the C-terminus of <italic>TARDBP</italic> in its endogenous locus in healthy control iPSCs using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) and selected iPSC clones with a homozygous knock-in (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). We initially ascertained that the integration of GFP did not adversely impact the differentiation of iPSCs into motor neurons (MNs). To this end, iPSCs engineered with TDP43-GFP were subjected to differentiation directed towards the MN lineage, employing a set of well-established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Namboori et al. 2021</xref>). Based on the expression of established MN markers – ISLET1 (ISL1) and neurofilament-M (NF-M) – we confirmed that the edited iPSCs (with GFP integration) efficiently differentiated into MNs (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>). Moreover, the TDP43-GFP knock-in MNs did not show significantly altered expression levels of <italic>TARDBP</italic>, <italic>UNC13A</italic> and <italic>STMN2</italic>, nor cause upregulation of cryptic transcripts in <italic>STMN2</italic> or <italic>UNC13A</italic> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1C</xref>). Overall, these results support the premise that the GFP knock-in had no detrimental effects on the iPSCs’ ability to differentiate into MNs or TDP43 function.</p>
<p>These engineered iPSCs, hereafter called TDP43-GFP iPSCs, were differentiated into MNs (called TDP43-GFP MNs) where ∼80% of the cells in culture immunostained positive for ISL1. We expressed an anti-GFP nanobody (12kDa) using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) in the TDP43-GFP MNs. Expression of the nanobody (deemed the control nanobody) did not affect TDP43 localization from the nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B</xref>). We engineered the nanobody with a nuclear export signal (NES). Expression of the NES-nanobody in the TDP43-GFP neurons caused relocation of the fusion protein to the cytoplasm with a concomitant loss in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B</xref>,C). We observed that TDP43 mislocalization leads to reduced dendrite complexity and neuronal soma swelling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2A,B</xref>) and an increase in cleaved caspase-3 activation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1E</xref>), which is an indicator of apoptosis. We confirmed that expression of the nanobodies in unedited iPSCs did not lead to apoptosis activation or dendrite defects, confirming that the observed phenotypes are due to TDP43 mislocalization (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2C</xref>). Mislocalization of TDP43 is commonly accompanied by cytoplasmic aggregation in tissue from patients with sporadic ALS. Accordingly, we observed TDP43 aggregates in the cytoplasm of homozygous TDP43-GFP MNs that varied in size and number across individual neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1F</xref>). Aggregation of TDP43 was accompanied by a reduction in detected protein levels in the soluble fraction of the lysate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1G</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Having demonstrated that our model can recapitulate cellular and biochemical features observed in sporadic ALS, we next explored the molecular consequences triggered by TDP43 proteinopathy. Previous studies have highlighted the prevalence of alternative splicing defects affecting transcripts expressed from <italic>UNC13A</italic> and <italic>STMN2</italic> in ALS (A.-L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brown et al. 2022</xref>; Ma et al. 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Klim et al. 2019</xref>; Melamed et al. 2019). These splicing defects are considered hallmarks in the progression of the disease. Given the significance of this phenomenon, we sought to ascertain if MNs expressing the NES nanobody exhibit these characteristic splicing defects. We performed RT-qPCR analysis on motor neurons that expressed the control or NES nanobody. The results strikingly mirrored the commonly observed ALS profile, showing inclusion of cryptic exons in both <italic>UNC13A</italic> and <italic>STMN2</italic> and a reduction in the abundance of canonical transcripts (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2E</xref>). This demonstrated that our model proficiently recapitulates the critical molecular features observed in sporadic ALS.</p>
<p>Next, we ventured to explore the molecular consequences triggered by TDP43 proteinopathy across the whole transcriptome. We performed transcriptomic analysis on day 40 TDP43-GFP MNs to assess changes in the gene expression profiles due to TDP43 mislocalization. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that the primary axis of variance (90%) is related to the expression of the control and NES nanobody while the much smaller 2<sup>nd</sup> PC component related to the two clones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>). Subsequently, we conducted a differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2 and visualised the results via a volcano plot. Our analysis revealed differential expression of hundreds of genes with a fold change of ≥ 2 and false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.01, suggesting a profound impact of TDP43 dysfunction on the transcriptome of MNs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the differentially expressed genes highlighted a significant enrichment of pathways related to synaptic dysfunction and cytoskeletal defects in axons and dendrites amongst downregulated genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2C</xref>). This finding is of considerable relevance to ALS pathogenesis, as neurons affected by ALS often exhibit impairments in these functions. In contrast, upregulated genes were enriched for GO terms related to RNA processing including the nonsense mediated decay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>Given that alternative splicing (AS) defects are a hallmark of sporadic ALS, we utilized Leafcutter (Y. I. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li et al. 2018</xref>) to analyze potential alternative splicing in MNs caused by TDP43 mislocalization. Our analysis identified alterations in the splicing of 231 genes, including <italic>UNC13A</italic> and <italic>STMN2</italic> (FDR &lt; 0.01). To gain functional insights into these splicing defects, we performed pathway enrichment analysis on affected genes, identifying a significant enrichment of terms related to synaptic development (FDR &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, to gain mechanistic understanding of the role of TDP43 in the observed splicing defects, we compared the splicing results with TDP43 eCLIP data generated in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Tam et al. 2019</xref>). Interestingly, only 35% of the splicing changes were proximal to a TDP43 binding site (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This suggests that the loss of TDP43 from the nucleus may be responsible for a subset of the observed splicing defects but not all. This indicates the possibility of additional indirect underlying mechanisms that may include dysregulation of other RBPs or epitranscriptomic modifications of the RNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">McMillan et al. 2023</xref>). To gain deeper insights into the observed splicing patterns due to TDP43 mislocalization, we employed the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing platform to generate RNA-seq data at the isoform level. Our investigation predominantly focused on <italic>STMN2</italic> due to its significance in ALS and a substantial number of reads (&gt;100) mapping to this gene. Employing our FICLE pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Leung et al. 2023</xref>), we identified a total of 476 isoforms related to <italic>STMN2</italic>. Out of these, 17 isoforms were congruent with the exonic structure of known reference isoforms. Notably, 40 isoforms, accounting for 8.4% of the total, were characterized by a cryptic exon (CE) starting at chr8:80529057 (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). These isoforms with the CE were exclusively expressed in TDP43-GFP MNs that expressed the NES nanobody. Furthermore, the ONT data revealed that <italic>STMN2</italic> isoforms exhibit variable CE lengths, with different CE lengths corresponding to widely varying expression levels of the parent isoform (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>). Importantly, the isoforms containing the CE were predominantly short, truncated, and predicted to be non-protein coding. Surprisingly, four of these CE-containing isoforms manifested a novel exon, 114 bp in length, positioned upstream of the CE (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). Our findings reveal a potentially significant variability in the splicing alterations induced by TDP43 proteinopathies, even within a single gene. This highlights the power of using long-read sequencing as a method for uncovering nuanced changes in splicing alterations in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>We compared our splicing results with publicly available transcriptomic data generated from cortical neuronal nuclei with or without TDP43 purified from ALS patient tissue post-mortem. At a stringent significant FDR threshold of 0.01, we detected 106 genes as alternatively spliced in nuclei that showed a loss of TDP43 using Leafcutter. Thirty-five out of these 106 genes were also detected in our iPSC model (overlap p-value = 5.2 x 10e-31) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2D</xref>), indicating strong concordance between the iPSC model and patient data, despite the differences in sample origin and neuronal subtype. Importantly, 34 of these genes displayed an identical splicing event. To evaluate whether the observed splicing changes were due to nuclear loss of TDP43, we compared our splicing results with transcriptomic data generated in iPSC-derived MNs after TDP43 knockdown (KD) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2E</xref>). Strikingly, almost 60% of the genes that displayed splicing defects due to a global loss of TDP43 also displayed splicing changes in our mislocalization model (overlap p-value = 1.6 x 10e-40). However, 172 genes that displayed splicing changes due to TDP43 mislocalization were not affected by TDP43 KD. This indicates that nuclear loss of TDP43 alone cannot entirely explain the widespread defects in AS.</p>
<p>To generate a robust list of AS events resulting from TDP43 pathology, we set a stringent p-value threshold of 10e-4 and only retained those genes that were identified in our RNA-seq results and those obtained from ALS/FTD post-mortem tissue. Our analysis identified 12 genes, including <italic>STMN2</italic> and <italic>UNC13A</italic>, that we further investigated using RT-qPCR. This confirmed AS events in all the genes identified, where 10/12 genes displayed a decrease in expression of their canonical transcript levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2F</xref>). Further, most of these genes also displayed AS changes due to TDP43 KD in iPSC-MNs, although the extent of these changes for a subset of the genes tested was less dramatic (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
<p>A key drawback with earlier TDP43 models was the inability to characterize early changes after TDP43 mislocalization in neurons. To enable inducible control of TDP43 cytoplasmic localization in our model, we expressed the nanobody under a doxycycline-inducible promoter, and the entire circuit was knocked into the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus in the homozygous TDP43-GFP iPSCs. We called these iPSCs TDP43-GFP-CTRL or TDP43-GFP-NES iPSCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3A</xref>). We first confirmed that we could induce TDP43 mislocalization in the TDP43-GFP-CTRL/NES iPSC-derived MNs using doxycycline (Dox). Dox (1 µg/ml) triggered significant TDP43 mislocalization in the TDP43-GFP-NES MNs, while the TDP43-GFP-CTRL MNs, and the TDP43-GFP-NES MNs without Dox, maintained nuclear TDP43 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3B</xref>). Notably, 48 hours of doxycycline treatment was sufficient to cause mislocalization (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7A</xref>).</p>

<p>To detect early changes in expression and splicing post TDP43 mislocalization, we harvested neurons for RT-qPCR 48 hours after the addition of Dox at day 20 of the differentiation process. The expression levels and splicing patterns for nine out of the previous 12 genes were compared with control cultures that were continuously treated with Dox until day 40 (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7B,C</xref>). Strikingly, all nine genes including <italic>UNC13A</italic> and <italic>STMN2</italic> displayed AS events as early as 48 hours post-TDP43 mislocalization. This suggests that dysfunctional AS could be one of the incipient molecular events in ALS pathogenesis due to TDP43 mislocalization.</p>
<p>A significant area of research in the field of ALS involves pinpointing the upstream triggers responsible for causing the mislocalization of TDP43. The underlying premise of these investigations is that eliminating the trigger may potentially reverse the mislocalization of TDP43. However, it remains to be confirmed whether this hypothesis holds true. We wanted to ascertain whether TDP43, once mislocalized, self-perpetuates in its mislocalized state even after the initial trigger has been removed. We induced TDP43 mislocalization by applying doxycycline to TDP43-GFP-NES iPSC-derived MNs at day 20. Subsequently, doxycycline treatment was withdrawn after three days (day 23) and neurons were harvested 7 (day 30) and 14 days (day 37) after Dox-withdrawal. As a benchmark for successful induction, neuronal cultures were continuously subjected to doxycycline treatment (Constant Dox). Conversely, neurons that were never exposed to doxycycline (No Dox) were used as controls to display nuclear TDP43. We evaluated TDP43 localization using immunofluorescence microscopy and in parallel assessed nanobody transcript levels using RT-qPCR.</p>
<p>In alignment with our expectations, the Constant Dox samples exhibited significant TDP43 mislocalization at both time points, verifying the efficacy of doxycycline in this respect. In contrast, TDP43 was found exclusively in the nucleus of our No Dox control samples, reiterating the specificity of doxycycline-induced TDP43 mislocalization. Interestingly, we observed persistent TDP43 mislocalization in a subset of neurons even after 14 days of doxycycline withdrawal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref>), despite near-undetectable levels of nanobody expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3D</xref>). This was accompanied by the CE inclusion in <italic>STMN2</italic> with concomitant decrease in its canonical transcript level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3E</xref>). Approximately 50% of neurons, however, showed partial recovery of TDP43 into the nucleus. This data indicates that removal of the initial trigger is insufficient to completely reverse TDP43 once it has been mislocalized. Previous studies have indicated that mutant mislocalized TDP43 can further trap normal forms of the protein, establishing a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Winton et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gasset-Rosa et al. 2019</xref>). However, these studies were performed by exogenous expression of TDP43 to non-physiological levels. To ascertain whether non-mutated endogenous TDP43 was capable of initiating such a feedback, we deployed our heterozygous TDP-GFP iPSC lines and differentiated these into MNs. Expression of the nanobody mislocalized the TDP43-GFP fusion protein as expected. Strikingly, we observed a significant reduction of the untagged TDP43 protein within the nucleus, with a corresponding increase in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3F</xref>). In a subset of the heterozygous TDP43-GFP neurons, we observed near total loss of nuclear TDP43. To rule out any homozygous TDP43-GFP cell contamination in the heterozygous clones, we screened 30 randomly selected clones from our heterozygous pool. All of these clearly showed heterozygous GFP knock-in. These results validate our hypothesis that once mislocalized, cytoplasmic TDP43 can sustain a positive feedback that further traps additional TDP43 protein. These observations carry substantial implications for our understanding of TDP43 pathology in ALS. From a therapeutic perspective, this indicates that rectifying the cause of the mislocalization may not be adequate to reverse the ensuing pathology. This understanding underscores the need for therapeutic strategies that can effectively disrupt the sustained loop of TDP43 mislocalization, beyond addressing the initial trigger as well as targeting the downstream consequences due to the mislocalization.</p>
<p>Finally, since TDP43 is involved in microRNA biogenesis, we sought to analyse changes in the microRNA profiles associated with TDP43 mislocalization. For this purpose, we carried out small RNA sequencing on day 40 MNs after triggering TDP43 mislocalization at day 20 by the addition of doxycycline. Our analysis revealed a striking alteration in the landscape of microRNA expression as a result of TDP43 mislocalization. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated distinct separation of the control and mislocalized samples (PC1 77%), emphasising the profound impact of TDP43 mislocalization on microRNA profile (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8A</xref>).</p>
<p>Around 150 microRNAs were found to be significantly altered (FDR &lt; 0.01 and fold change ≥ 1.5) upon TDP43 mislocalization. Our data captured downregulation of the microRNAs miR-218, and miR-9, which have previously been shown to be downregulated in ALS MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Reichenstein et al. 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhang et al. 2013</xref>). Interestingly, these changes were not unidirectional; almost equal numbers of microRNAs were upregulated or downregulated (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8B</xref>). The results of this study indicate that TDP43 mislocalization leads to global dysregulation of microRNA expression in iPSC-derived MNs. However, it is noteworthy that our observations contrast with those found in postmortem tissue studies, where all differentially expressed microRNAs were reported to be downregulated. This divergence in findings may suggest that the uniform downregulation observed in postmortem tissues could be attributed to changes that are triggered by end-stage dying neurons, which might not represent the whole spectrum of molecular alterations especially early in the disease progression.</p>
<p>We wanted to evaluate whether alterations in microRNA expression profiles induced by TDP43 mislocalization are congruent with the changes caused by TDP43 knockdown. For this investigation, small RNA sequencing was utilized to assess microRNA expression in motor neurons (MNs) at day 30 following the knockdown of TDP43 using shRNAs. Again, principal component analysis revealed a distinct separation between all control and TDP43 knockdown samples, indicating a clear impact of TDP43 knockdown on microRNA expression profiles (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8C</xref>). However, a striking contrast was observed in the number of microRNAs affected by TDP43 knockdown as compared to TDP43 mislocalization. Specifically, in the case of TDP43 knockdown, only one microRNA (miR-1249-3p) exhibited a significant change (FDR &lt; 0.01 and a fold change of 1.5). This is in stark contrast to the observations made when TDP43 was mislocalized, where over 150 microRNAs displayed altered expression. To avoid setting thresholds in our comparisons, we first ranked the microRNAs impacted by TDP43 knockdown based on their fold changes. Subsequently, we utilized gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to determine if the microRNAs disrupted by TDP43 mislocalization significantly coincided with our knockdown data. We observed a substantial overlap between microRNAs that were downregulated due to TDP43 mislocalization and those downregulated following TDP43 knockdown (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8E</xref>). However, we did not observe a significant overlap for microRNAs that were upregulated in both scenarios.</p>
<p>This disparity holds significant implications. Firstly, it suggests that mislocalized TDP43 selectively affects the expression of a subset of microRNAs. Secondly, these observations underscore that the nuclear loss and cytoplasmic gain of TDP43 induce distinct molecular alterations within motor neurons that converge to hasten neuronal dysfunction and demise.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In summary, our unique iPSC model of TDP43 proteinopathy offers an unprecedented access to investigate cellular and molecular events in human neurons in a temporal fashion downstream of TDP43 mislocalization. This model faithfully captures the neuronal loss and cytoplasmic accumulation characteristic of TDP43 proteinopathies. Beyond neurons, our model paves the way for inquiries into the roles of non-neuronal cells, such as oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, which also exhibit TDP43 proteinopathy, in contributing to neuronal dysfunction in a cell non-autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barton et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">James et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Smethurst et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Licht-Murava et al. 2023</xref>). We expect this model to not only enhance our understanding of ALS but also other TDP43 proteinopathies and accelerate efforts into developing therapies against these devastating neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Motor neurons were generated from iPSCs as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Namboori et al. 2021</xref>). Briefly, iPSCs were plated onto matrigel and differentiated by treatment with neuronal differentiation media (DMEM/F12:Neurobasal in a 1:1 ratio, HEPES 10 mM, N2 supplement 1%, B27 supplement 1%, L-glutamine 1%, ascorbic acid 5 µM) supplemented with SB431542 (40 µM), CHIR9921 (3 µM) and LDN98312 (0.2 µM) from day 0 until day 4. Cells were caudalized by treatment with 0.1 µM retinoic acid starting at day 2 and ventralized with 1 µM purmorphamine starting at day 4 and continued till day 10. At day 8, progenitors were replated onto poly-D-lysine/laminin coated wells and differentiated with 10 µM DAPT for 3 days. Non-mitotic cells were removed with a pulse of 10 µg/ml mitomycin-C for 1 hour at day 14. Motor neurons were subsequently maintained in N2B27 media supplemented with 10 ng/ml BDNF and GDNF, with half media changes occurring twice per week.</p>
<p>TDP43-GFP mislocalization was induced via transduction with AAVs expressing anti-GFP nanobodies. In our TDP43-GFP-NES/ CTRL cell line, TDP43-GFP mislocalisation was achieved via addition of 1 µg/mL doxycycline, which was replenished every 48 hours.</p>

<p>Summary: Nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic mislocalization/aggregation of the DNA and RNA binding protein TDP-43 are pathological hallmarks of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Prior work has demonstrated that depletion of TDP-43 from the nucleus leads to alterations in transcription and splicing. Conversely, cytoplasmic mislocalization/aggregation can contribute to toxicity by impairing mRNA transport and translation as well as miRNA dysregulation. However, to date, models of TDP-43 proteinopathy rely on artificial knockdown- or overexpression-based systems to evaluate either nuclear loss or cytoplasmic gain of function events independently. Few model systems authentically reproduce both nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic miscloalization/aggreagtion events. In this manuscript, the authors generate novel iPSC-based reagents to manipulate the localization of endogenous TDP-43. This is a valuable resource for the field to study pathological consequences of TDP-43 proteinopathy in a more endogenous and authentic setting. However, in the current manuscript, there are a number of weaknesses that should be addressed to further validate the ability of this model to replicate human disease pathology and demonstrate utility for future studies.</p>
<p>Strengths: The primary strength of this paper is the development of a novel in vitro tool.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: There are a number of weaknesses detailed below that should be addressed to thoroughly validate these new reagents as more authentic models of TDP-43 proteinopathy and demonstrate their utility for future investigations.</p>
<p>(1) The authors should include images of their engineered TDP-43-GFP iPSC line to demonstrate TDP-43 localization without the addition of any nanobodies (perhaps immediately prior to addition of nanobodies). Additionally, it is unclear whether simply adding a GFP tag to endogenous TDP-43 impact its normal function (nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, regulation of transcription and splicing, mRNA transport etc).</p>
<p>(2) Can the authors explain why there is a significant discrepancy in time points selected for nanobody transduction and immunostaining or cell lysis throughout Figure 1 and 2? This makes interpretation and overall assessment of the model challenging.</p>
<p>(3) The authors should further characterize their TDP-43 puncta. TDP-43 immunostaining is typically punctate so it is unclear if the puncta observed are physiologic or pathologic based on the analyses carried out in the current version of this manuscript. Additionally, do these puncta co-localize with stress granule markers or RNA transport granule markers? Are these puncta phosphorylated (which may be more reminiscent of end-stage pathologic observations in humans)?</p>
<p>(4) The authors should include multiple time points in their evaluation of TDP-43 loss of function events and aggregation. Does loss of function get worse over time? Is there a time course by which RNA misprocessing events emerge or does everything happen all at once? Does aggregation get worse over time? Do these neurons die at any point as a result of TDP-43 proteinopathy?</p>
<p>(5) Can the authors please comment on whether or not their model is &quot;tunable&quot;? In real human disease, not every neuron displays complete nuclear depletion of TDP-43. Instead there is often a gradient of neurons with differing magnitudes of nuclear TDP-43 loss. Additionally, very few neurons (5-10%) harbor cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates at end-stage disease. These are all important considerations when developing a novel authentic and endogenous model of TDP-43 proteinopathy which the current manuscript fails to address.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
TDP-43 mislocalization occurs in nearly all of ALS, roughly half of FTD, and as a co-pathology in roughly half of AD cases. Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mechanisms associated with this mislocalization likely contribute to disease pathogeneisis.</p>
<p>Here, the authors describe a new method to induce TDP-43 mislocalization in cellular models. They endogenously-tagged TDP-43 with a C-terminal GFP tag in human iPSCs. They then expressed an intrabody - fused with a nuclear export signal (NES) - that targeted GFP to the cytosol. Expression of this intrabody-NES in human iPSC-derived neurons induced nuclear depletion of homozygous TDP-43-GFP, caused its mislocalization to the cytosol, and at least in some cells appeared to cause cytosolic aggregates. This mislocalization was accompanied by induction of cryptic exons in well characterized transcripts known to be regulated by TDP-43, a hallmark of functional TDP-43 loss and consistent with pathological nuclear TDP-43 depletion. Interestingly, in heterozygous TDP-43-GFP neurons, expression of intrabody-NES appeared to also induce the mislocalization of untagged TDP-43 in roughly half of the neurons, suggesting that this system can also be used to study effects on untagged endogenous TDP-43 as well as TDP-43-GFP fusion protein.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
A clearer understanding of how TDP-43 mislocalization alters cellular function, as well as pathways that mitigate clearance of TDP-43 aggregates, is critical. But modeling TDP-43 mislocalization in disease-relevant cellular systems has proven to be challenging. High levels of overexpression of TDP-43 lacking an NES can drive endogenous TDP-43 mislocalization, but such overexpression has direct and artificial consequences on certain cellular features (e.g. altered exon skipping) not seen in diseased patients. Toxic small molecules such as MG132 and arsenite can induce TDP-43 mislocalization, but co-induce myriad additional cellular dysfunctions unrelated to TDP-43 or ALS. TDP-43 binding oligonucleotides can cause cytosolic mislocalization as well. Each system has pros and cons, and additional ways to induce TDP-43 mislocalization would be useful for the field. The method described in this manuscript could provide researchers with a powerful way to study the combined biology of cytosolic TDP-43 mislocalization and nuclear TDP-43 depletion, with additional temporal control that is lacking in current method. Indeed, the authors see some evidence of differences in RNA splicing caused by pure TDP-43 depletion versus their induced mislocalization model. Finally, their method may be especially useful in determining how TDP-43 aggregates are cleared by cells, potentially revealing new biological pathways that could be therapeutically targeted.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The method and supporting data have limitations in its current form, outlined below, and in its current form the findings are rather preliminary.</p>
<p>• Tagging of TDP-43 with a bulky GFP tag may alter its normal physiological functions, for example phase separation properties and functions within complex ribonucleoprotein complexes. In addition, alternative isoforms of TDP-43 (e.g. &quot;short&quot; TDP-43, would not be GFP tagged and therefore these species would not be directly manipulatable or visualizable with the tools currently employed in the manuscript.</p>
<p>
• The data regarding potential mislocalization of endogenous TDP-43 in the heterozygous TDP-43-GFP lines is especially intriguing and important, yet very little characterization was done. Does untagged TDP-43 co-aggregate with the tagged TDP-43? Is localization of TDP-43 immunostaining the same as the GFP signal in these cells?</p>
<p>
• The experiments in which dox was used to induce the nanobody-NES, then dox withdrawn to study potential longer-lasting or self-perpetuating inductions of aggregation is potentially interesting. However, the nanobody was only measured at the RNA level. We know that protein half lives can be very long in neurons, and therefore residual nanobody could be present at these delayed time points. The key measurement to make would be at the protein level of the nanobody if any conclusions are be made from this experiment.</p>
<p>
• Potential differences in splicing and microRNAs between TDP-43 knockdown and TDP-43 mislocalization are potentially interesting. However, different patterns of dysregulated RNA splicing can occur at different levels of TDP-knockdown, thus it is difficult to asses whether the changes observed in this paper are due to mislocalization per se, or rather just reflect differences in nuclear TDP-43 abundance.</p>
