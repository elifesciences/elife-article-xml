<title>Abstract</title><p>Cartwheel interneurons of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) potently suppress multisensory signals that converge with primary auditory afferent input, and thus regulate auditory processing. Noradrenergic fibers from locus coeruleus project to the DCN, and α2-adrenergic receptors inhibit spontaneous spike activity but simultaneously enhance synaptic strength in cartwheel cells, a dual effect leading to enhanced signal- to-noise for inhibition. However, the ionic mechanism of this striking modulation is unknown. We generated a glycinergic neuron-specific knockout of the Na<sup>+</sup> leak channel NALCN, and found that its presence was required for spontaneous firing in cartwheel cells. Activation of α2-adrenergic receptors inhibited both NALCN and spike generation, and this modulation was absent in the NALCN knockout. Moreover, α2-dependent enhancement of synaptic strength was also absent in the knockout. GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors mediated inhibition through NALCN as well, acting on the same population of channels as α2 receptors, suggesting close apposition of both receptor subtypes with NALCN. Thus, multiple neuromodulatory systems determine the impact of synaptic inhibition by suppressing the excitatory leak channel, NALCN.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The dorsal division of the mammalian cochlear nucleus (DCN) is a cerebellum-like structure in which principal cells integrate multimodal activity with primary auditory afferents, and these converging signals are thought to contribute to sound localization and sensitivity to sounds of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">May, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Oertel and Young, 2004</xref>). Cartwheel cells (CWC) are cerebellar Purkinje cell homologs that potently control this convergence by gating the multimodal signals to postsynaptic fusiform principal cells. CWCs also receive inputs from various neuromodulatory systems, including noradrenaline (NA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Trussell, 2019</xref>). We showed previously that agonists of α2 noradrenergic receptors simultaneously halts spontaneous spike activity and enhances the strength of inhibitory signals to fusiform cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kuo and Trussell, 2011</xref>). The mechanism for this paradoxical action depends on the effect of spontaneous activity on synaptic strength: by reducing ongoing presynaptic firing, recovery from synaptic depression ensues and allows CWCs to mediate stronger postsynaptic signals in the fusiform cells. A related mechanism was later identified in the action of oxytocin in hippocampal interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Owen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tirko et al., 2018</xref>). However, the mechanism by which α2 noradrenergic receptors controlled such activity remained obscure. The most obvious candidate ion channel that could mediate such inhibition is the GIRK channel (G -protein-gated inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Luscher et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arima et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li and van den Pol, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Philippart and Khaliq, 2018</xref>), however attempts in our laboratory to implicate this channel failed.</p>
<p>The Na<sup>+</sup> leak channel NALCN functions as a complex of 4 proteins: NALCN, FAM151a, UNC79 and UNC80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ren, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cochet-Bissuel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kschonsak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Xie et al., 2020</xref>). This channel complex (here termed simply NALCN) contributes to the depolarizing drive for spontaneous firing in a wide variety of neurons, and functions in sensory, motor and circadian pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nash et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lu and Feng, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Xie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lutas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shi et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, mutations in the NALCN subunit or its associated proteins are linked to a variety of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Al-Sayed et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cochet-Bissuel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bramswig et al., 2018</xref>). A hallmark of this channel is its inhibition by extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>; reduction of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhances the current, permitting a ready assessment of NALCN’s presence in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ren, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Philippart and Khaliq, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chua et al., 2020</xref>). Recently it was shown that neurons of the substantia nigra express NALCN, and that both dopamine and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors strongly downregulated NALCN activity in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lutas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Philippart and Khaliq, 2018</xref>). As global knockouts of NALCN die at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lu et al., 2007</xref>), we generated a knockout mouse line specific to glycinergic neurons in order to test the role of this channel in auditory interneurons. We found that CWCs expressed functional NALCN, and its loss in NALCN knockouts led to cessation of spontaneous firing. Outward currents and inhibition of firing mediated by NA was eliminated in the knockouts; since NALCN generates inward excitatory currents, NA must act by inhibition of NALCN. Similar results were obtained for the GABA<sub>B</sub> agonist baclofen. Thus, NALCN serves multiple roles in auditory function, setting the pace of neuronal firing while also mediating electrical inhibition by multiple neuromodulators and enhancement of synaptic strength.</p>

<title>NALCN and modulation of spike generation</title>
<p>In order to assess the role of NALCN in modulation of spontaneous firing of CWCs, we generated an NALCN knockout mouse by crossing a floxed NALCN mouse line B6(Cg)-<italic>Nalcn<sup>tm1c(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></italic>/DrenJ with a GlyT2-cre line, thus deleting NALCN from glycinergic neurons (Methods). NALCN<bold><sup>−/−</sup></bold> mice were slightly smaller than wildtype mice (weight ratio, 4:3) but had normal hearing, as assessed by auditory brainstem responses (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplemental 1</xref>), and the morphology of their CWCs was characteristic of those of wildtype mice (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplemental 2</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bender and Trussell, 2009</xref>)). ‘Wildtype’ mice used here were either C57/BL6 or GlyT2-EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zeilhofer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kuo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ngodup et al., 2020</xref>) in which GFP is expressed in glycinergic neurons. CWC were recorded using cell-attached mode to monitor baseline spontaneous firing and the inhibition of firing by NA. Except as noted below, all recordings were made in physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (1.2 mM). In confirmation of previous studies in wildtype mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kim and Trussell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kuo and Trussell, 2011</xref>) 71% of CWC exhibited spontaneous firing (mean firing rate, 17.74 ± 2.31 Hz) and bath application of 10 μM NA completely and reversibly eliminated such firing in every case (N = 8, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A &amp; B</xref>). However, in experiments on NALCN KO mice, CWC showed no spontaneous firing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C &amp; D</xref>; N = 6; difference from wildtype type, p &lt; 0.0005), and thus NA had no additional effects on spontaneous firing (mean firing rate, KO = 0 ± 0 Hz, NA = 0; N = 6). Thus, NALCN likely provides a tonic inward current necessary to drive spontaneous firing in CWC. These effects were not accompanied by changes in membrane input resistance (WT: 135.34±21.53 MΩ (n=18) vs KO: 132.19±16.11 MΩ (n=15), p=0.46, t-test).</p>

</fig>
<p>Although NALCN supports spontaneous firing, it was not clear whether the effect of NA is mediated through NALCN or some other channel. To explore this problem, we first examined evoked firing in CWC and the effects of NALCN and NA. CWC were recorded in current-clamp mode, and a family of negative and positive, 600-ms current pulses were delivered in 25-pA steps (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A1</xref>). In response to positive pulses, CWCs fire mixtures of simple (single) spikes and complex spikes, the latter containing Na<bold><sup>+</sup></bold> spike clusters driven by a Ca<bold><sup>2+</sup></bold>-dependent current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kim and Trussell, 2007</xref>). The timing of spikes during each current pulse was used to generate raster plots of firing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A2</xref>), and the number of spikes at each current step was used to plot a frequency vs current intensity curve (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). In the same set of cells, we then applied NA and repeated the current steps (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B &amp; E</xref>). NA hyperpolarized the resting potential by −1.90 ± 0.24 mV and increased the current level required to initiate firing (rheobase, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>), indicating that NA reduced excitability. However, we also observed a suppression of the peak firing rate in NA; similar rundown of peak firing rate could be observed without change in rheobase as a result of whole-cell recording over this time period (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kim and Trussell, 2007</xref>), and thus frequency-intensity plots were normalized to peak intensity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). This manipulation revealed a clear shift to the right in the onset of firing (i.e., toward higher intensity) as a result of NA. Rheobase was defined as the current intensity at which spiking was 20% of maximum. Using this criterion, NA generated a significant increase in rheobase in response to current pulses (Ctrl, rheobase = 91.40 ± 11.35 pA, NA, 168.59 ± 14.89 pA, p = 0.0011 (t-test)). Control experiments established that wash-in of NA with the α2 blocker idazoxan did not lead to a change in rheobase (Ctrl, rheobase = 95.11 ± 16.86 pA, NA + idazoxan, 105.88 ± 21.89 pA, N = 9, p = 0.38 (t-test)), showing that the shift in rheobase was a genuine effect of α2 receptors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I, J</xref>). This protocol was then applied to NALCN KO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C, D, G &amp; H</xref>). Although CWCs showed no spontaneous firing, they were able to respond to current steps with mixtures of simple and complex spikes, and peak firing rates did not differ from wildtypes (rheobase, Ctrl, 91.40 ± 11.35 pA; KO, 120.81 ± 17.53 mV, N = 11, p = 0.08 (t-test)). However, unlike wildtype mice, the NALCN KO mice showed no significant shift in rheobase with NA (KO, rheobase = 120.81 ± 17.53 pA, NA, 158.0 ± 12.16 pA, n = 11, p = 0.064 (t-test) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In order to test whether the effects of NA on rheobase and evoked spiking is primarily due to the small hyperpolarization induced by NA, we mimicked this effect of NA by injecting current to CWC to hyperpolarize the membrane by the same amount as induced by NA (approximately 2 mV), and then repeated the current injection protocol (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>). Under these conditions, we were able to replicate the effects of NA on CWC rheobase and evoked firing (rheobase Ctrl = 70.88 ± 7.68 pA, hyperpolarized = 125 ± 12.90 pA, N = 6, p = 0.0009). We then compared the ratio of the changes in rheobase in NA with respect to control under different conditions, also comparing to the relative effects of current injection. These comparisons confirmed that NA shifts rheobase dependent upon NALCN, and that this effect is likely caused by membrane potential hyperpolarization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref>: Ctrl = 1.90 ± 0.11, KO = 1.25 ± 0.05, Idazoxan = 1.03 ± 0.11, hyperpolarized = 1.94 ± 0.16, p &lt; 0.0001, non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis; post hoc Dunn’s test, Ctrl vs KO p = 0.0086, Ctrl vs idazoxan p = 0.0007, KO vs hyperpolarized p = 0.02, idazoxan vs hyperpolarized p = 0.0028).</p>

<title>Outward response generated by suppression of NALCN</title>
<p>As cessation of spontaneous activity and elevation of rheobase by NA is likely associated with an outward, inhibitory current, we performed voltage-clamp experiments to determine the magnitude of that current in wildtype and KO mice, and its pharmacological sensitivity. Using a patch-pipette fill containing high K<sup>+</sup> (Methods), cells were held at −65 mV and a 5-ms puff of NA was applied near the soma using a pressure-ejection pipette. Under these conditions, a slowly rising outward current was observed that decayed over a time course of 10-15 seconds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). As G-protein coupled inward rectifier channels (GIRK) are known to mediate α2 receptor effects in some brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Williams et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aghajanian and Wang, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arima et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li and van den Pol, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nimitvilai et al., 2017</xref>), we tested the role of GIRK channels using the GIRK blocker Ba<sup>2+</sup>. However, BaCl<sub>2</sub> (100 μM) had no significant effect on the amplitude of the NA-evoked current (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A, C</xref>) (Ctrl = 15.44 ± 1.66 pA; BaCl<bold><sub>2</sub></bold> = 12.86 ± 1.44, N = 6, p = 0.133). When this experiment was repeated in NALCN KO mice, the NA-evoked current was only 12.5% of that observed in wildtype mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B &amp; C</xref>). Although the amplitude of the NA-evoked current in the knockout was only a few pA, bath application of BaCl<sub>2</sub> nevertheless produced a statistically significant block of this small residual current, essentially eliminating all response to NA (KO = 1.93 ± 0.83 pA, BaCl<bold><sub>2</sub></bold> = 0.56 ± 0.4 pA, n = 8, p = 0.05) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Thus, the outward response to NA was only minimally due to activation of K<sup>+</sup> current but rather was mediated largely by inhibition of a tonic inward current generated by NALCN. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Philippart and Khaliq (2018)</xref> observed that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors suppressed NALCN current in substantia nigra, and so we asked whether these receptors might have a similar action in CWCs. In K<sup>+</sup> filled cells, puffs of the GABA<sub>B</sub> agonist baclofen generated outward currents similar to those observed with NA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A &amp; C</xref>).

Recording in voltage clamp with the cocktail of intracellular and extracellular channel and receptor blockers described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Philippart and Khaliq, 2018</xref> (see methods, and note that GIRK channels are also blocked here), an inward current of −107.61 ± 10.80 pA (N = 18) developed over several minutes upon shifting bath Ca<sup>2+</sup> from 2 mM to 0.1 mM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A &amp; B</xref>).

<p>Since both NA and baclofen inhibit NALCN in CWC, we asked whether these two receptors act on independent or overlapping populations of NALCN channels. In these experiments, one set of control recordings assessed the magnitude of block by NA of low-Ca<sup>2+-</sup>evoked inward current. Interleaved with these recordings were experiments in which baclofen was applied to reduce the NALCN current, and then NA subsequently applied in the continued presence of baclofen (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-C</xref>). If the two agonists act on independent populations of NALCN channels, NA should suppress inward current similar to that seen in control experiments. However, as shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, NA had virtually no blocking action of inward current following application of baclofen (0.1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> = −164.28 ± 20.50 pA, baclofen = −53.33 ± 14.73 pA.

We also compared with percentage block of 0.1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> current in baclofen, or NA alone, compared to the block of current by NA in a background of baclofen. Baclofen completely occluded the response to subsequent application of NA (percent block: baclofen 70.61 ± 7.18, NA 56.18 ± 9.5, additional block 4.35 ± 3.25, n = 9, F <sub>(2,24)</sub> = 23.83, p &lt; 0.0001, one-way ANOVA; post hoc Tukey’s test, baclofen vs NA p = 0.34, baclofen vs addition p &lt; 0.0001, NA vs addition p &lt; 0.0001).

<title>Noradrenergic effect not mediated by control of cAMP levels</title>
<p>The α2 receptor is a Gi/o GPCR and thus it is possible that inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and thus reduction of cAMP levels might mediate the action of NA on NALCN. To test this idea, CWCs were recorded in the same solutions used in the previous section, in order to block K<sup>+</sup> channels and other non-NALCN contributions to current. Then NA (100 μM) was puffed onto the recorded neuron, which suppresses NALCN and generates a net outward current. After recording control responses, 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP was washed into the bath, and NA responses again recorded. The average response amplitudes were 23.9±3.5 pA in control and 27.8±5.7 pA in 8-Br-cAMP (n=7 cells, p=0.1147, paired t-test). On the assumption that 8-Br-cAMP would effectively saturate cAMP actions in the neurons, the absence of an effect on the NA response suggests that inhibition cAMP production does not mediate NA action on NALCN, pointing to the possibility of direct effect of G-proteins on the channel.</p>

We tested more directly the effect of NA on synaptic inhibition and the role of NALCN by electrically evoking IPSCs while recording from CWC. Bipolar stimulation electrodes were positioned in the DCN molecular layer in order to stimulate CWC axons. The resulting glycinergic IPSCs were significantly enhanced upon bath application of 10 µM NA (Ctrl = −1.37 ± 0.31 nA, NA = −1.82 ± 0.43 nA, % change = 32.99 % (increase), N = 8, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A &amp; B</xref>). This average increase ranged widely from 2% to 81%, suggesting some cells received glycinergic input from CWC that were not spontaneously active and therefore not affected by NA. The experiment was repeated on NALCN KO mice, there was no significant increase in IPSC amplitude (KO = −2.17± 0.54 nA, NA = −2.08 ± 0.55 nA, % change = 3.77% (decrease), N = 10, p = 0.0011; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8 B &amp; C</xref>).

<title>Mechanism of adrenergic modulation</title>
<p>The primary effect of noradrenergic modulation of the CWC is to enhance the strength of inhibitory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kuo and Trussell, 2011</xref>). Modulation by NA acts simultaneously on all the CWC neurons synapses by impacting spike generation and thereby the degree of frequency-dependent synaptic depression. We show here that NALCN is the ion channel that mediates this effect on firing. α2 receptors are known to mediate inhibition of firing through enhancement of K<sup>+</sup> channel activity, and GIRK channels play a prominent role in these effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Williams et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aghajanian and Wang, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arima et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li and van den Pol, 2005</xref>). However, in CWC, almost none of the effect of NA was blocked by the K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker Ba<sup>2+</sup>. Indeed, since in NALCN KOs the NA-induced effects on spiking, outward currents or block of inward currents were all eliminated, it is almost certain that NALCN and not K<sup>+</sup> channels play the key role in noradrenergic modulation in CWC. A caveat is that we only examined ionic currents and voltage changes measurable with a somatic electrode. NA effects in distal dendrites may have been undetectable at the soma.</p>
<p>Several intriguing aspects of NA action are revealed in this work when considered together with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kuo and Trussell, 2011</xref>). First, the action NA on feedforward inhibition is apparently quite specific to NALCN. No effect of NA was observed on parallel fiber EPSCs in CWC or CWC IPSCs in fusiform cells recorded during paired voltage-clamp recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kuo and Trussell, 2011</xref>). This suggests that the mechanism for control of inhibitory strength is optimized to act globally on the CWC’s synapses by controlling spontaneous firing. Presumably, α2 receptors are localized in such a way to affect membrane potential and rheobase at the soma and/or at the axon initial segment, although localization studies will be required to address this uncertainty. Despite the DCN’s dense innervation from noradrenergic fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kromer and Moore, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Klepper and Herbert, 1991</xref>), we do not know the morphology of noradrenergic synapses in the DCN. However, if NA release is through “volume transmission”, it may be that noradrenergic modulation acts on groups of CWCs and all their synapses. Second, although CWC have GIRK channels, and α2 activate GIRK channels in some other neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arima et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Paladini and Williams, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li and van den Pol, 2005</xref>), the CWC has selected for a mechanism in which an inhibitory action is associated with a decrease in a tonic membrane conductance. The effect on membrane potential of this decrease in conductance is small, ∼2 mV. Yet, we show that that shift alone is sufficient to profoundly inhibit spontaneous firing and thereby increase the strength of inhibitory synapses. Interestingly, an inverse mechanism of modulation was described in hippocampus, in which oxytocin increases spontaneous firing of interneurons and thus decreases inhibitory synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Owen et al., 2013</xref>). In this case oxytocin acts by decrease of a resting inhibitory conductance mediated by Kv7 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tirko et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, modulation by inhibitory or excitatory conductance decrease provides a means for global control of inhibitory synaptic strength in the CNS.</p>

<title>Convergence of GABAergic and adrenergic systems</title>
<p>Unlike α2 receptors, the actions of GABA<bold><sub>B</sub></bold> receptors were more complex, as GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors both inhibited NALCN and activated GIRK channels, as previously observed in substantia nigra neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Philippart and Khaliq, 2018</xref>). Comparisons of the magnitude of NA action in control recordings and in a background of baclofen indicated that the two modulators acted on a common population of NALCN channels. While activation of α2 receptors may lead to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dohlman, et al. 1987</xref>), we did not observe an effect of 8-Br-cAMP on NA responses, arguing against a role for cAMP. If gating of the channels proceeds directly by membrane-delimited actions of G-proteins, it is likely that a pool of GABA<bold><sub>B</sub></bold> and α2 receptors are in relatively close apposition to one another and to NALCN. However, unlike GABA<bold><sub>B</sub></bold> receptors, α2 receptors did not appreciably activate GIRK channels. Altogether, these results suggest two distinct pools of GABA<bold><sub>B</sub></bold> receptors in the somatodendritic membrane: one associated with GIRK and one with NALCN. In addition, a third pool is localized in CWC nerve terminals. There, baclofen suppresses release of action potential-independent exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Apostolides and Trussell, 2013</xref>), suggesting modulation by GABA<bold><sub>B</sub></bold> receptors of Ca<bold><sup>2+</sup></bold> channels or exocytic proteins. Regarding the somatodendritic populations, immunolocalization with electron microscopy indicated that GABAB1 subunits are concentrated at the base of dendritic spines of CWC, rather than associated with GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lujan et al., 2004</xref>), with the suggestion that they respond to “spillover” of GABA. It remains unclear which ion channel this particular dendritic GABA<bold><sub>B</sub></bold> population modulates.</p>

<title>Auditory processing</title>
<p>The DCN is the site of diverse forms of neuromodulation mediated by G-protein coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Trussell and Oertel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Trussell, 2019</xref>), in which transmitters act at presynaptic membrane to regulate exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tang and Trussell, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">2017</xref>), at the axon initial segment to control spike pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bender et al., 2010</xref>), at somatodendritic membrane to boost firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tang and Trussell, 2017</xref>), or at dendritic spines to control postsynaptic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">He et al., 2014</xref>). By restricting α2 modulation to the spike-generation mechanism and not presynaptic release zones, the transmitter is able to enhance IPSC amplitude while simultaneously reducing background inhibitory “noise”, thus enhancing the salience of a given interneuron’s impact. CWC are activated by parallel fibers conveying multisensory input to DCN fusiform cells. If, consistent with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berridge and Waterhouse, 2003</xref>), NA is released during brain states associated with wakefulness, this enhanced signal-to-noise mediated by NA would serve to more precisely sculpt the output of DCN based on such multisensory signals. Moreover, since individual CWC-fusiform synaptic pairs apparently receive excitatory input from different populations of parallel fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Roberts and Trussell, 2010</xref>), such enhanced inhibition might serve a more precise computational role that a standard feedforward inhibitory mechanism. NALCN therefore appears to play a potent role in selective sensory filtering during heightened states of vigilance.</p>

In most experiments, internal recording solution contained in (mM) 113 K gluconate, 2.75 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.75 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1 EGTA, 14 Tris<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 0.3 Tris-GTP, 9 HEPES with pH adjusted to 7.25 with KOH, mOsm adjusted to 290 with sucrose (E<sub>Cl</sub>, −84 mV). For voltage clamp to isolate NALCN current, internal solution contained in (mM) 87 CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 18 CsCl, 5 CsF, 10 TEA-Cl, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 5 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na<sub>2</sub>-GTP, 13 di-Na phosphocreatine, 2 QX-314 (pH 7.25, 295 mOsm). For a few voltage-clamp experiments, we used an internal solution containing (in mM) 103 CsCl, 10 TEA-Cl, 2.75 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 9 HEPES, 0.1 EGTA, 0.3 Tris-GTP, 14 Tris<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 3.5 QX-314 (pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH). Puff application of agonists and antagonists was delivered through a picospritzer (Picospritzer III; Toohey Company, Fairfield, NJ), at 7-10 psi, with borosilicate glass capillaries. NA or Baclofen applications were at 100 µM and 5-10 ms in duration. The puff pipette was placed around 100 µm from the soma of the recorded cell to avoid mechanical disturbance.</p>
<p>Cell-attached (voltage-clamp) recordings were made using normal extracellular solution. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier and pCLAMP 10 software (Molecular Devices; Sunnyvale, CA). Signals were digitized at 20–40 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz by Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices). In voltage clamp, cells were held at −65 mV, with access resistance 5-30 MΩ compensated to 40– 60%. In current clamp with control solutions, the resting membrane potential was maintained at −60 to −70 mV with bias current. To isolate NALCN currents, synaptic blockers, NBQX (10 µM), MK-801 (10 µM), SR-95531 (10 µM) or picrotoxin (100 µM), strychnine (0.5 µM), apamin (100 nM), and BaCl<sub>2</sub> (200 µM) were added to the bath solution. In those experiments, shifts in Ca<sup>2+</sup> from 2 mM to 0.1 mM were accompanied by a shift in Mg<sup>2+</sup> from 1 mM to 3 mM. To record evoked IPSCs, CWCs were stimulated with brief voltage pulses (100 µs) using a stimulus isolation unit (Iso-Flex; A.M.P.I, Jerusalem, Israel) via a glass microelectrode placed in the molecular layer of the DCN.</p>

<title>Pharmacology</title>
<p>All drugs in the slice experiments were bath applied. Receptor antagonists used in this study included: NBQX (AMPA receptors; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), MK-801 (NMDA receptors; Sigma-Aldrich), SR-95531 (GABA<sub>A</sub>R; Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK), strychnine (glycine receptors; Sigma-Aldrich).</p>

<title>ABRs</title>
<p>Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were acquired from C57B6/J and NALCN KO mice between P40-50. Mice were anesthetized with a dose of 80 mg/kg ketamine:16 mg/kg xylazine. ABRs were recorded differentially with electrodes at the vertex and pinna with ground at the base of the tail. Tone pips (5 msec, 0.5 msec rise/fall with 4-msec steady-state plateau) were generated digitally with a PXI-4461 card (National Instruments, Austin, TX), amplified (SA1; Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL) and delivered using a compact, close-field sound system consisting of two CUI earphones and an electric microphone (FG-23329-P07; Knowles, Itasca, IL) coupled to a probe tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Buran, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hancock K et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Buran et al., 2020</xref>). Tone levels were incremented in 5-dB steps from 0 to 90-dB SPL. ABRs were recorded in a sound-proof booth using a Grass P511 amplifier and digitized using a National Instruments PXI 4661 card. ABR threshold was obtained for each animal. ABR peaks and thresholds were identified by visual inspection of the waveforms in a custom-written analysis program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Buran, 2015</xref>). Body temperature was maintained between 36 and 37°C using a homeothermic blanket (Harvard Apparatus, Cambridge, MA).</p>

<p>This study uses electrophysiological techniques in vitro to address the role of the Na+ leak channel NALCN in various physiological functions in cartwheel interneurons of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. Comparing wild type and glycinergic neuron-specific knockout mice for NALCN, the authors show that these channels 1) are required for spontaneous firing, 2) are modulated by noradrenaline (NA, via alpha2 receptors) and GABA (through GABAB receptors), 3) how the modulation by NA enhances IPSCs in these neurons.</p>
<p>This work builds on previous results from the Trussell's lab in terms of the physiology of cartwheel cells, and from other labs in terms of the role of NALCN channels, that have been characterized in more and more brain areas somewhat recently; for this reason, this study could be of interest for researchers that work in other preparations as well. The general conclusions are strongly supported by results that are clearly and elegantly presented.</p>
<p>In this revised submission, the authors addressed all my questions. This is very interesting work that could be of interest for researchers working in other brain areas as well.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting paper with several important findings related to the working mechanism of the cartwheel cells (CWC) in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). These cells generate spontaneous firing that is inhibited by the activation of α2-adrenergic receptors, which also enhances the synaptic strength in the cells, but the mechanisms underlying the spontaneous firing and the dual regulation by α2-adrenergic receptor activation have remained elusive. By recording these cells with the NALCN sodium-leak channel conditionally knocked, the authors discovered that both the spontaneous firing and the regulation by noradrenaline (NA) require NALCN. Mechanistically, the authors found that activation of the adrenergic receptor or GABAB receptor inhibits NALCN. Interestingly, these receptor activations also suppress the low [Ca2+] &quot;activation&quot; of NALCN currents, suggesting crosstalk between the pathways. The finding of such dominant contribution of the NALCN conductance to the regulation of firing by NA is somewhat surprising considering that NA is known to regulate K+ conductances in many other neurons.</p>
<p>The studies reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying well known regulations of the neuronal processes in the auditory pathway. The results will be important to the understanding of auditory information processing in particular, and, more generally, to the understanding of the regulation of inhibitory neurons and ion channels. The results are convincing and are clearly presented.</p>
<p>In this revision, the authors have satisfactorily addressed all my previous comments.</p>

<p>The study by Ngodup and colleagues describes the contribution of sodium leak NALCN conductance on the effects of noradrenaline on cartwheel interneurons of the DCN. The manuscript is very well-written and the experiments are well-controlled. The scope of the study is of high biological relevance and recapitulates a primary finding of the Khaliq lab (Philippart et al., eLife, 2018) in ventral midbrain dopamine neurons, that Gi/o-coupled receptors inhibit NALCN current to reduce neuronal excitability. Together these studies provide unequivocable evidence for NALCN as a downstream target of these receptors.</p>
<p>In re-review of this study, the authors have addressed the concerns sufficiently. This is a very nice study.</p>

<p>This work builds on previous results from the Trussell's lab in terms of the physiology of cartwheel cells, and from other labs in terms of the role of NALCN channels, that have been characterized in more and more brain areas somewhat recently; for this reason, this study could be of interest for researchers that work in other preparations as well. The general conclusions are strongly supported by results that are clearly and elegantly presented.</p>
<p>I have a few comments that, in my opinion, might help clarify some aspects of the manuscript.</p>
<p>1. It is mentioned throughout the manuscript, including the abstract, that the results suggest a closed apposition of NALCN channels and alpha2 and GABAB receptors. From what I understand, this conclusion comes from the fact that GABAB receptors activate GIRK channels through a membrane-delimited mechanism. Is it possible that these receptors converge on other effectors, for example adenylate cyclase (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6374141/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6374141/</ext-link>).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now tested the role of adenylyl cyclase modulation in the control of NALCN, by saturating the cells with a cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMP and found no effect on the NA response.  These data are included in the paper. While further experiments are necessary, these results argue in favor of a direct gating by G-proteins.</p>

<p>1. In Figure 2G, the neurons from NALCN KO mice appear to reach a significantly higher frequency than those from WT (figure 2E, 110 vs. 70 spikes/s). Was this higher frequency a feature of all experiments? The results mention a rundown of peak firing rate due to whole-cell dialysis, but, from what I understand, the control conditions should be similar for all experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The peak firing rates in control solutions for WT and KO CWC are not statistically different.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Also in Figure 2, the firing patterns for neurons from WT and NALCN KO mice appear to be quite different, with spikes appearing to be generated during the hyperpolarization of the bursts in the second half of the current step for WT neurons but always during the depolarization in KO neurons. Was this always the case? If so, could NALCN channels be involved in this type of firing? Along these lines, it would be interesting to show an example of a firing pattern of neurons from WT mice in the presence of NA, which inhibits NALCN channels.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The specific pattern of spikes in CWC is quite variable from trial-to-trial or cell-to-cell, as it is dependent on multiple CaV and calcium dependent K channels subtypes, and is not dependent on the genotypes used here.  The primary effects observed in the KO are in background firing and sensitivity to NA, both reflected alterations in rheobase.  The firing pattern example requested was shown in the raster plot of fig 2B2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. It might be interesting to discuss how the hyperpolarization induced by the activation of GIRK channels and inhibition of NALCN channels could have different consequences due to their opposite effect on the input resistance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We considered this as a point of discussion, but decided that making sense of it would depend on assumptions about the location of the channels (dendritic vs somatic, distance to AIS) that we do not have data for.  For example, a dendritic increase in resistance through NALCN block, leading to a hyperpolarization of the soma, might have actions similar to a somatic hyperpolarizing conductance increase by GIRK, as far as the voltage at the AIS is concerned.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This is a very interesting paper with several important findings related to the working mechanism of the cartwheel cells (CWC) in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). These cells generate spontaneous firing that is inhibited by the activation of α2-adrenergic receptors, which also enhances the synaptic strength in the cells, but the mechanisms underlying the spontaneous firing and the dual regulation by α2-adrenergic receptor activation have remained elusive. By recording these cells with the NALCN sodium-leak channel conditionally knocked, the authors discovered that both the spontaneous firing and the regulation by noradrenaline (NA) require NALCN. Mechanistically, the authors found that activation of the adrenergic receptor or GABAB receptor inhibits NALCN. Interestingly, these receptor activations also suppress the low [Ca2+] &quot;activation&quot; of NALCN currents, suggesting crosstalk between the pathways. The finding of such dominant contribution of the NALCN conductance to the regulation of firing by NA is somewhat surprising considering that NA is known to regulate K+ conductances in many other neurons.</p>
<p>The studies reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying well known regulations of the neuronal processes in the auditory pathway. The results will be important to the understanding of auditory information processing in particular, and, more generally, to the understanding of the regulation of inhibitory neurons and ion channels. The results are convincing and are clearly presented.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The study by Ngodup and colleagues describes the contribution of sodium leak NALCN conductance on the effects of noradrenaline on cartwheel interneurons of the DCN. The manuscript is very well-written and the experiments are well-controlled. The scope of the study is of high biological relevance and recapitulates a primary finding of the Khaliq lab (Philippart et al., eLife, 2018) in ventral midbrain dopamine neurons, that Gi/o-coupled receptors inhibit NALCN current to reduce neuronal excitability. Together these studies provide unequivocable evidence for NALCN as a downstream target of these receptors. There are no major concerns. I have only minor suggestions:</p>
<p>Minor</p>
<p>1. As introduced in the introduction, NALCN is inhibited by extracellular calcium which has led to some discourse of the relevance of NALCN when recorded in 0.1 mM calcium. A strength of this study is the effect of NA on NALCN is recorded in physiological levels of calcium (1.2 mM). I suggest including the concentration of extracellular calcium in the aCSF in the Results section instead of relying on the reader to look to the Methods.</p>

<p>1. It would be interesting to include the basal membrane properties of the KO compared to wildtype, including membrane resistance and resting membrane potential. From the example recording in Figure 2, one might think that the KOs have lower membrane resistance, so it is interesting that the 2 mV hyperpolarization produced similar effects on rheobase. In addition, from the example in Figure 2G, it appears that NA has an effect on firing frequency with large current injection in the KO. Is this true in grouped data and if so, is there any speculation into how this occurs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included in the text a comparison of the input resistance in WT and KO.  These were not different.  This should not be too surprising given the wide range of values between animals, and the necessity to compare populations.  Measurements of resting potential are complicated by the fact that CWC are normally spontaneously active.
As was discussed in the text, peak firing frequency declined with time during recording in both control and KO, necessitating normalization as shown in Fig 2E-H.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Please expand on the rationale for why GABAB and alpha2 must be physically close to NALCN. To my knowledge, the mechanism by which these receptors inhibit NALCN is not known. Must it be membrane-delimited?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Given the known membrane delimited modulation of GIRK by GABAB, and that alpha2 and GABAB receptors appear to share the same population of NALCN channels, and that alpha2 receptors do not appear to target GIRK channels, we felt the simplest explanation would be coupling through G-proteins, with spatial segregation of different receptor/channel pools providing the means for separating GIRK and NALCN effects.  Given that the alpha2 receptor is a Gi/o GPCR, we have now included in the revision new experiments using 8-Br-cAMP, as discussed above.  These showed no effect on the NA response, consistent with a direct effect membrane delimited of G-proteins.  We acknowledge however that further experiments are warranted.</p>

<p>1. I suggest labeling the voltage traces in Figure 2 with WT and KO for easier comprehension; in addition, I suggest adding the average data to the plots in Figure 2, as in Figure 2-supplementary Figure 1 panel F.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added the figure labels as requested.  We chose not to add the average data as we noticed that averaging the full FI plots led to a smearing of the curves and a distortion in the apparent rheobase.  Thus, we instead measured the rheobase for individual cells and report their average.</p>

<p>I only have several minor comments.</p>
<p>1. The total lack of spontaneous firing in CWCs in the NALCN KO (Fig. 1) is interesting and provides an opportunity to probe the in vivo function of such spontaneous firing. Besides being a little smaller, do the mutant mice have any sign of abnormality in sound signal processing?</p>

<p>1. page 7, &quot;Outward current generated by suppression of NALCN&quot;: it might be better to state as &quot;Outward response generated by suppression of NALCN&quot;, as the authors correctly pointed out that the NA-induced apparently outward current response is largely a result of an inhibition of NALCN-mediated inward Na+ current. One way to clarify this might be to record at the Nernst potential of K+ to isolate the contribution of Na+ currents (unclear if K+- or Cs+-based pipette was used in the experiment in Fig 3).</p>

<p>1. The labeling of some of the bar graphs can be made more clear. For example, in Fig. 2K, the right two columns should be labeled as WT as well. Fig. 3C &amp; Fig. 4C, the left two columns should be labeled as WT and the right two as KO.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figs. 5-7: The suppression of low extracellular [Ca2+]-induced NALCN-dependent current by NA and baclofen is very interesting. As the tonic inhibition of NALCN by extracellular Ca2+ is likely through a Ca2+-sensing GPCR (CaSR) and G-proteins (lowering [Ca2+] releases the inhibition and generates inward current) (Lu et al. 2010), the action of NA and baclofen may all converge onto the same G-protein dependent pathway of the Ca2+-sensing receptor. I'd include this in the discussion to provide a potential mechanistic explanation of the interesting observation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is indeed an interesting idea.  We prefer not to discuss here, as 1) the source of Ca2+ sensitivity of the channel seems to be controversial (Chua et al 2020), and 2) the effect of Ca2+ reduction is enormously slower than the effect of the modulators (Fig 5-7), implying distinct mechanisms.</p>

<p>Thank you for catching this mistake.  The formula used to calculate % change was in error.  We have corrected all the data analysis in the figure, which fortunately did not change the conclusion. Regarding the axis, note that the measurement was % change, not ratio of drug vs control.</p>
