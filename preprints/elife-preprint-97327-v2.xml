<title><bold>A</bold>bstract</title><p>Distant metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with breast cancer. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to breast cancer metastasis. Regulator of G protein-signaling (RGS) proteins modulate metastasis in various cancers. This study identified a novel role for RGS10 in EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. RGS10 protein levels were significantly lower in breast cancer tissues compared to normal breast tissues, and deficiency in RGS10 protein predicted a worse prognosis in patients with breast cancer. RGS10 protein levels were lower in the highly aggressive cell line MDA-MB-231 than in the poorly aggressive, less invasive cell lines MCF7 and SKBR3. Silencing RGS10 in SKBR3 cells enhanced EMT and caused SKBR3 cell migration and invasion. The ability of RGS10 to suppress EMT and metastasis in breast cancer was dependent on lipocalin-2 and miR-539-5p. These findings identify RGS10 as a tumor suppressor, prognostic biomarker, and potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Globally, in 2020, an estimated 2.3 million new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed, and there were approximately 685,000 deaths from the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sung et al., 2021</xref>). The majority of breast cancer mortality is due to distant metastasis, with 5-year survival estimated at 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">American Cancer Society, 2023</xref>). There is a critical need to identify early breast cancer metastasis using prognostic biomarkers to ensure patients receive effective anticancer therapies in a timely manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Miglietta et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a critical role in tumor progression and metastatic invasion in breast cancer. EMT describes the process by which epithelial cells lose their epithelial characteristics and cell-cell contact and increase their invasive potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Singh and Chakrabarti, 2019</xref>). EMT is characterized by a loss of epithelial cell markers, such as cytokeratins and E-cadherin, followed by an upregulation in the expression of mesenchymal cell markers, such as N-cadherin and vimentin. EMT is regulated at different levels by factors involved in cell signaling, transcriptional control, and epigenetic and post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lai et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Biomarkers of EMT may predict early breast cancer metastasis and facilitate clinical decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). The regulator of G protein signaling 10 (RGS10) belongs to the superfamily of RGS proteins that bind and deactivate heterotrimeric G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Almutairi et al., 2020</xref>). RGS proteins are important mediators of essential cellular processes and may be tumor initiators or tumor suppressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2023</xref>). The canonical function of RGS proteins is to act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), accelerate GTP hydrolysis on G-protein alpha subunits, and terminate signaling pathways downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hunt et al., 1996</xref>). RGS proteins can have noncanonical GAP-independent functions, including the suppression of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)-induced EMT in non-small cell lung cancer by RGS6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wang et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>RGS10 is a critical regulator of cell survival, polarization, adhesion, chemotaxis, and differentiation that exhibits tumor-suppressing effects in ovarian and colorectal cancer. In ovarian cancer cells, RGS10 suppression increases proliferation by phosphorylation of mTOR, 4E-BP1, p70S6K and rProtein-S6, including in the presence of chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Altman et al., 2015</xref>), loss of RGS10 expression contributes to the development of chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cacan et al., 2014</xref>), and modulating RGS10 expression can alter sensitivity to paclitaxel, cisplatin, and vincristine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cacan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hooks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hooks and Murph, 2015</xref>). In ovarian tumors, transcription of RGS10 is regulated by DNA methylation and histone deacetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>). In colorectal cancer, RGS10 expression is suppressed, and inhibition of DNA methylation may contribute to improved prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Caldiran and Cacan, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In breast cancer, RGS10 is downregulated in heavily metastatic human breast cancer cell populations compared to weakly metastatic human breast cancer cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Montel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Steeg, 2005</xref>). The mechanisms underlying the metastasis-suppressing function of RGS10 in breast cancer remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the function of RGS10 in breast cancer, specifically in breast cancer metastasis. The objectives were to 1) characterize the expression of RGS10 in freshly resected breast cancer and adjacent normal breast tissues; 2) determine the prognostic significance of RGS10 expression in patients with breast cancer; and 3) explore the role of RGS10 and upstream effectors in tumor progression and metastasis in breast cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Clinical specimens</title>
<p>This study included an additional 153 patients with histologically confirmed invasive ductal breast carcinoma who received treatment at the Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from April 2006 to April 2008. Patients had: 1) undergone surgery with no distant metastases at the time of the operation; 2) received standard adjuvant therapy after surgery; 3) ≥10 axillary lymph nodes dissected and examined pathologically after surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coates et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gradishar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wolff et al., 2013</xref>); and 4) ≥10 years of follow-up as outpatients or by telephone interviews.</p>
<p>Twenty paired breast cancer and normal adjacent tissues were obtained from patients undergoing surgical resection at Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University to evaluate the status of RGS10. Clinical specimens from 133 patients were used to assess the effect of RGS10 on prognosis. The clinicopathological characteristics of these 153 patients are shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Breast cancer cells and culture</title>
<p>Human breast cancer cell lines SKBR3, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The identity of cell lines had been authenticated by using STR profiling and with no contamination in the mycoplasma test. SKBR3 cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5A (modified) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. MCF7 cells were cultured in DMEM high glucose (Invitrogen) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in Leibovitz’s L-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C without CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Transfection</title>
<p>SKBR3 cells were transfected with short hairpin (sh)RNAs specifically targeting RGS10 (Syngentech Biotechnology, Beijing, China). shRNA sequences were: shRNA-RGS10-161, 5′-GCCTCAAGAGCACAGCCAAAT-3′; shRNA-RGS10-321, 5′-GGAGATCTACATGACCTTTCT-3′; a n d shRNA-RGS10-506, 5′-GCACCCTCTGATGTTCCAGAA-3′. The shRNA-negative control (NC) sequence was 5′-AAACGTGACACGTTCGGAGAA-3′. As transfection efficiencies of shRNA-RGS10-161 and shRNA-RGS10-506 were better than shRNA-RGS10-321, shRNA-RGS10-161 and shRNA-RGS10-506 were used for subsequent experiments.</p>
<p>A miR-539-5p mimic, miR-539-5p inhibitor, and corresponding NC were designed and synthesized by GenePharma Biotechnology (Shanghai, China). The sequences of miRNA were: miR-539-5p mimic, 5′-GGAGAAAUUAUCCUUGGUGUGU-3′; miR-539-5p mimic NC,5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′; miR-539-5p inhibitor,5′-ACACACCAAGGAUAAUUUCUCC-3′; miR-539-5p inhibitor NC 5′-CAGUACUUUUGUGUAGUACAA′. SKBR3 cells were transfected with the miR-539-5p mimic or NC. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with the miR-539-5p inhibitor or NC.</p>
<p>Lipofectamine 3000 (L3000015, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Invitrogen, USA) was used for cell transfection.</p>

<title>Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated from breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines using Triquick reagent (Solarbio Life Science, Beijing, China) and reverse-transcribed using a cDNA synthesis kit (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan). RT-qPCR was conducted using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (TaKaRa) on a Real-time PCR System. Primers were: RGS10 forward, 5′-CACGACAGCGATGGCAGTTCC-3′; RGS10 reverse, 5′-CTTTTCACGCCTTCTGGGTCTTCC-3′; GAPDH forward, 5′-CCTTCCGTGTCCCCACT-3′; and GAPDH reverse, 5′-GCCTGCTTCACCACCTTC-3′. Thermocycling conditions were 95°C for 30 s, 40 cycles of 95°C for 3 s, and 60°C for 30 s. Relative mRNA levels were calculated using the comparative threshold (Cq) cycle method (2<sup>-ΔΔCt</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adnan et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>cDNA synthesis in SKBR3 cells transfected with the miR-539-5p mimic or NC and MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with the miR-539-5p inhibitor or NC was conducted using a miRNA First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit that adopted A-tailing (B532461, Sangon Biotech). qPCR was performed using a miRNA qPCR kit (B532461, Sangon Biotech). Relative miR-539-5p level was normalized to U6 as the internal control. Primers were as follows: miR-539-5p forward, 5′-CGCTGCATGGAGAAATTATCCT-3′; miR-539-5p reverse, 5′-CAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGT-3′; U6 forward, 5′-GCTCGCTTCGGCAGCACATATAC-3′, and U6 reverse 5′-CGAATTTGCGTGTCATCCTTGCG-3′. Thermocycling conditions were 95°C for 30 s, 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, and 60°C for 30 s. Relative mRNA levels were calculated using the 2<sup>-ΔΔCt</sup> method.</p>

<title>Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) analysis</title>
<p>Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 5000 cells per well. After 0, 24, 48, and 72 h, CCK-8 (Cofitt Life Science Biotechnology) solution was added to each well, and cells were incubated for 3 h. Optical density was measured at 450 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). Experiments were performed in triplicate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>Colony formation assay</title>
<p>SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231 cells were trypsinized and plated on 6-well plates at a density of 1000 cells per well. When visible colonies were formed, the cells were fixed with methyl alcohol and stained with crystal violet. The plates were photographed, and the number of colonies was counted using ImageJ software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2i">
<title>Cell invasion and migration assay</title>
<p>For cell invasion, 20,000 cells in 0.2 mL serum-free culture medium were placed in the upper chamber of a Transwell chamber that had been precoated with Matrigel matrix. The lower chamber was filled with 1 mL culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum as the chemoattractant. After culturing at 37°C for 24 h, cells that had migrated to the lower surface through the membrane were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Fixed cells were stained with crystal violet.</p>
<p>Detection of cell migration was similar to cell invasion, except the upper chamber of the Transwell chamber was not precoated with Matrigel.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2j">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Surgically resected tissues were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned into 6-μm-thick slices. Sections were deparaffinized with xylene, rehydrated in a series of graded ethanols, and rinsed in Tris-buffered saline. Sections were incubated with a primary antibody anti-RGS10 (1:50; Abcam, Cambridge, MA; ab154172), anti-lipocalin-2 (LCN2) (1:500, ABclonal, #A2092), anti-E-cadherin (1:500, Proteintech, #20874-1-AP), anti-vimentin (1:200, HUABIO, #EM0401), anti-snail (1:100, ABclonal, # A5243), at 4°C overnight, incubated with a secondary antibody (Zhong Shan Jin Qiao Biotechnology Co., Beijing, China) at room temperature for approximately 45 min, and protein was visualized with a diaminobenzidine staining kit (Zhong Shan Jin Qiao Biotechnology Co.).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2k">

<p>To determine the role of RGS10 in breast cancer, we analyzed RGS10 mRNA levels in normal tissues (n = 31) from the Genotype-Tissue Expression dataset, which showed RGS10 mRNA levels were high in normal breast, blood, colon, and small intestine tissues and low in normal heart, liver, and pancreas tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).

<p>To investigate the biological role and clinical and prognostic significance of RGS10 in breast cancer tissues, we used survival analyses. In breast cancer samples from the Kaplan–Meier plotter database, high RGS10 mRNA level was associated with significantly improved DFS (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0066; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) and OS (<italic>P</italic> = 0.027; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In surgically resected breast cancer tissues (n=133), RGS10 protein expression level detected by immunohistochemistry (representative images shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>) was positively correlated with breast cancer subtype (<italic>P</italic> = 0.043), distant metastasis (<italic>P</italic> = 0.008), and survival status (<italic>P</italic> = 0.024). There were no correlations with age, comorbid disease, histological grade, tumor size, number of positive axillary lymph nodes, number of pregnancies, number of births, age at first pregnancy, menopausal status, estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, or Ki67 status (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In these patients, a high RGS10 protein expression level was associated with a longer DFS (<italic>P =</italic> 0.003, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>) and OS (<italic>P</italic> = 0.022, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Clinicopathological characteristics associated with DFS and OS were identified with Cox regression analyses. On multivariate regression analysis, histological grade and RGS10 protein expression were independent predictors of DFS (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). On univariate regression analysis, age, histological grade, and RGS10 protein expression were independent predictors of OS (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Distant metastasis is a main cause of death in patients with breast cancer. Identification of prognostic biomarkers for early distant metastasis may inform clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize the role of RGS10 as a tumor suppressor and biomarker of EMT in breast cancer. RGS10 was expressed at lower levels in breast cancer tissues than in adjacent normal breast tissues. RGS10 expression was associated with molecular subtype of breast cancer, distant metastasis, and survival status. Patients with high compared to low RGS10 mRNA expression in breast cancer tissues had improved DFS and OS. RGS10 protein levels were lower in the highly aggressive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 compared to the poorly aggressive and less invasive breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and SKBR3. RGS10 reduced breast cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and migration by inhibiting EMT via a novel mechanism dependent on LCN2 and miR-539-5p.</p>
<p>EMT is involved in normal development and morphogenic processes, including embryogenesis and tissue regeneration. Pathological EMT promotes invasion and metastasis in tumors through intracellular signaling, transcription factors, miRNAs, and epigenetic and posttranslational regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Huang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lamouille et al., 2014</xref>). Signaling pathways such as TGF-β, Wnt, Notch, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT contribute to EMT, often with cross-talk at various levels and feedback activation/repression mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Deshmukh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Huang et al., 2022</xref>). Transcription factors such as snail, slug, ZEBl/ZEB2, and Twist1/Twist2 induce EMT by acting on the E-box sequence of the CDH1 promoter. Noncoding miRNAs regulate EMT by selectively targeting mRNAs of cell receptors, signaling pathways, the cell cycle, or cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Górecki and Rak, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Huang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, alter the expression of EMT transcription factors involved in the molecular pathways of metabolism, transcription, differentiation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Górecki and Rak, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study identifies RGS10 as an important mediator of EMT in breast cancer. Previous studies have demonstrated links between several RGS proteins and various cancers, with RGS proteins acting as tumor initiators or suppressors depending on the RGS protein and type of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2023</xref>). RGS10 is the smallest protein of the RGS D/12 subfamily, which functions as GAPs for the Gi family Gα subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Almutairi et al., 2020</xref>). RGS10 has been linked to a poor prognosis in patients with laryngeal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Yin et al., 2013</xref>), liver cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wen et al., 2015</xref>), and childhood acute myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chaudhury et al., 2018</xref>). RGS10 may represent a biomarker of clinical staging for ovarian cancer and is one of five signature genes involved in the occurrence and development of ovarian cancer. This five-gene signature (RGS11, RGS10, RGS13, RGS4, and RGS3) is overexpressed in ovarian cancer and involved in extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, the TGF-β signaling pathway, the Wnt signaling pathway, and the chemokine signaling pathway. These pathways mediate the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ovarian cancer cells; in particular, TGF-β signaling plays an important role in EMT in ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The novel action of RGS10 in EMT in breast cancer appears to be dependent on LNC2, also known as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, siderocalin, uterocalin, and oncogene 24p3. LNC2 is a secreted glycoprotein of the adipokine superfamily. LCN2 expression levels are particularly high in breast, pancreatic, ovarian, colorectal, thyroid, and bile duct cancer tissues and tumor cell lines. Previous studies show LCN2 can promote tumorigenesis by increasing invasion, metastasis, and proliferation while decreasing apoptosis, possibly because LCN2 can facilitate iron intake to cancer cells and form a heterodimer with matrix metalloproteinase-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Santiago-Sánchez et al., 2020</xref>). In breast cancer, LCN2 can promote progression by inducing EMT through the estrogen receptor alpha/Slug axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Morales-Valencia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yang et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The regulation of EMT in breast cancer by RGS10 may rely on upstream regulation by miR-539-5p. miRNAs play a critical role in the cellular processes of breast cancer, including EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). Previous reports indicate that miR-539 expression is downregulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guo et al., 2018</xref>), and miR-539 acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guo et al., 2018</xref>), specificity protein 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2020</xref>), or laminin subunit alpha 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2020</xref>) expression. In patients with breast cancer, decreased expression of miR-539 was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis. In breast cancer cells, overexpression of miR-539 inhibited the proliferation and promoted apoptosis of breast cancer cells, suppressed EMT, and sensitized cells to cisplatin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2020</xref>). Further studies are required to fully elucidate miRNA regulation of the gene expression networks that are essential to EMT in breast cancer.</p>
<p>Inflammation promotes EMT in tumors, and EMT induces the production of proinflammatory factors by cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Suarez-Carmona et al., 2017</xref>). The present study showed that RGS10 expression in SKBR3 cells was associated with the inflammatory response. Previous reports show that RGS10 regulates cellular physiology and fundamental signaling pathways in microglia, macrophages, and T-lymphocytes. In microglia and ovarian cancer cells, RGS10 regulates inflammatory signaling by a G protein-independent mechanism, linking RGS10 to the inflammatory signaling mediators tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and cyclooxygenase-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alqinyah et al., 2018</xref>). In macrophages, RGS10 regulates activation and polarization by suppressing the production of the inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dean and Hooks, 2020</xref>). These findings suggest a potential role for RGS10 in the development of an inflamed and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which may have important implications for the progression in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Suarez-Carmona et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study had some limitations. First, this was a retrospective study with a small sample size. Thus, the conclusions should be confirmed in meta-analyses or large randomized controlled trials. Second, the mechanism by which the miR-539-5p/RGS10/LCN2 axis may be related to outcomes in patients with breast cancer remains to be elucidated. Biochemical characterization of the molecular mechanisms of RGS10 in breast cancer should provide additional insight into the potential of RGS10 as a biomarker of EMT, metastasis, and prognosis in breast cancer and the role of RGS10 as a therapeutic target.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the results of this study show that RGS10 expression is related to survival outcomes in patients with breast cancer. RGS10 protein levels were lower in the highly aggressive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 compared to the poorly aggressive and less invasive breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and SKBR3. Silencing RGS10 expression effectively increased the proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and migration ability of SKBR3 cells. The miR-539-5p/RGS10/LCN2 pathway was identified as an important regulatory axis of EMT in breast cancer. These data demonstrate that RGS10 may play a tumor suppressor role and be considered a biomarker of EMT and prognosis in breast cancer.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> paper first demonstrated that RGS10 was identified as a biomarker to evaluate the prognosis of breast cancer. To prevent the loss of RGS10 theoretically provide a new strategy for the treatment of breast cancer. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is <bold>solid</bold>, although inclusion of a larger number of patient samples and an animal model would have strengthened the study. The work will be of interest to clinicians working on breast cancer.</p>

<p>The paper has shown the expression of RGS10 is related to the molecular subtype, distant metastasis, and survival status of breast cancer. The study utilizes bioinformatic analyses, human tissue samples, and in vitro and in vivo experiments which strengthen the data. RGS10 was validated to inhibit EMT through a novel mechanism dependent on LCN2 and miR-539-5p, thereby reducing cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and migration. The study elaborated on the function of RGS10 in influencing the prognosis and biological behavior which could be considered as a potential drug target in breast cancer.</p>

<p>Liu et al., by focusing on the regulation of G protein-signaling 10 (RGS10), reported that RGS10 expression was significantly lower in patients with breast cancer, compared with normal adjacent tissue. Genetic inhibition of RGS10 caused epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, respectively. These results suggest an inhibitory role of RGS10 in tumor metastasis. Furthermore, bioinformatic analyses determined signaling cascades for RGS10-mediated breast cancer distant metastasis. More importantly, both in vitro and in vivo studies evidenced that alteration of RGS10 expression by modulating its upstream regulator miR-539-5p affects breast cancer metastasis. Altogether, these findings provide insight into the pathogenesis of breast tumors and hence identify potential therapeutic targets in breast cancer.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this study are mostly well supported by data.</p>

<p>Distant metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with breast cancer. In this manuscript, Liu et al. show that RGS10 deficiency elicits distant metastasis via epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer. As a prognostic indicator of breast cancer, RGS10 regulates the progress of breast cancer and affects tumor phenotypes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transformation, invasion, and migration. The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This study presents a valuable finding on the mechanism to promote distant metastasis in breast cancer. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is convincing. The work will be of interest to medical biologists working on breast cancer.</p>
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The paper has shown the expression of RGS10 is related to the molecular subtype, distant metastasis, and survival status of breast cancer. The study utilizes bioinformatic analyses, human tissue samples, and in vitro and in vivo experiments which strengthen the data. RGS10 was validated to inhibit EMT through a novel mechanism dependent on LCN2 and miR-539-5p, thereby reducing cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and migration. The study elaborated the function of RGS10 in influencing the prognosis and biological behavior which could be considered as a potential drug target in breast cancer.</p>
<p>Weakness</p>
<p>The mechanism by which the miR-539-5p/RGS10/LCN2 axis may be related to the prognosis of cancer patients still needs to be elucidated. In addition, the sample size used is relatively limited. Especially, if further exploration of the related pathways and mechanisms of LCN2 can be carried out by using organoid models, as well as the potential of RGS10 as a biomarker for further clinical translation to verify its therapeutic target effect, which will make the data more convincing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: Thank you for your comments and suggestions. In future research, we will utilize large clinical cohorts and organoid models to further explore relevant research mechanisms.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Liu et al., by focusing on the regulation of G protein-signaling 10 (RGS10), reported that RGS10 expression was significantly lower in patients with breast cancer, compared with normal adjacent tissue. Genetic inhibition of RGS10 caused epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, respectively. These results suggest an inhibitory role of RGS10 in tumor metastasis. Furthermore, bioinformatic analyses determined signaling cascades for RGS10-mediated breast cancer distant metastasis. More importantly, both in vitro and in vivo studies evidenced that alteration of RGS10 expression by modulating its upstream regulator miR-539-5p affects breast cancer metastasis. Altogether, these findings provide insight into the pathogenesis of breast tumors and hence identify potential therapeutic targets in breast cancer.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this study are mostly well supported by data. However, there is a weakness in the study that needs to be clarified.</p>
<p>In Figure 2A, although some references supported that SKBR3 and MCF-7 possess poorly aggressive and less invasive abilities, examining only RGS10 expression in those cells, it could not be concluded that 'RGS10 acts as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer'. It would be better to introduce a horizontal comparison of the invasive ability of these 3 types of cells using an invasion assay.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: Thank you for your comments and suggestions. MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, and MCF-7 originate from triple-negative breast cancer (high invasiveness), Her-2 receptor overexpression (relatively weak invasiveness), and luminal type breast cancer (relatively weak invasiveness) separately. Previous studies have demonstrated the invasive ability of these 3 types of cells. (PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34390568">34390568</ext-link>)</p>

<p>Distant metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with breast cancer. In this manuscript, Liu et al. show that RGS10 deficiency elicits distant metastasis via epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer. As a prognostic indicator of breast cancer, RGS10 regulates the progress of breast cancer and affects tumor phenotypes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transformation, invasion, and migration. The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some analyses need to be clarified.</p>
<p>(1) Because diverse biomarkers have been identified for EMT, it is recommended to declare the advantages of using RGS10 as an EMT marker.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: Thank you for your comments. The dysregulation of RGS protein expression has been observed to be associated with various types of cancer. (PMID: 26293348). Previous studies have shown that RGS10 knocking down can lead to chemotherapy resistance of ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel, cisplatin, and vincristine. In colorectal tumors, the transcription of RGS10 is regulated by DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. As a key regulatory factor in the G protein signaling pathway, RGS 10 is involved in tumor development including survival, polarization, adhesion, chemotaxis, and differentiation, these hints suggest RGS10 might be a marker for EMT in breast cancer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors utilized databases to study the upstream regulatory mechanisms of RSG10. It is recommended to clarify why the authors focused on miRNAs rather than other epigenetic modifications.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: Thank you for your comments. miRNAs are short-chain non-coding RNA molecules that bind to the target mRNA's 3 'untranslated region (3'UTR) to cause mRNA degradation or translation inhibition, thus regulating gene expression in cells. These small molecules play a crucial role in regulating the expression of cancer-related genes and can act as tumor promoters or tumor suppressors. To further improve the molecular mechanism of malignant biological behavior of breast cancer cells with RGS10, we verified that miR-539-5p might be the upstream regulation target of RGS10 through bioinformatics prediction and in-vitro experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The role of miR-539-5p in breast cancer has been described in previous studies. Hence, it is recommended to provide detailed elaboration on how miR-539-5p regulates the expression of RSG10.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: Thank you for your comments. To verify the effect of miRNA-539-5p regulating the expression of RSG10, we transfected miR-539-5p mimic, miR-539-5p mimic NC, miR-539-5p inhibitor, miR-539-5p inhibitor NC in SKBR3 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells respectively, and verified the expression of RGS10 through RT-qPCR and Western blot experiments. The results showed that compared with the transfected miR-539-5p mimic NC or wild-type SKBR3 cells, RGS10 m RNA and protein levels were significantly reduced. On the contrary, after MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with miR-539-5p inhibitor to inhibit the expression of miR-539-5p, RGS10 mRNA and protein levels in MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly increased (Fig. 3.4A-C, Fig. 3.5A-C). This indicates that miR-539-5p can target and regulate RGS10.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) To enhance the clarity and interpretability of the Western blot results, it would be advisable to mark the specific kilodalton (kDa) values of the proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: Thank you for your comments and suggestions. We have corrected to mark the specific kilodalton (kDa) values of the proteins in WB.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The function of RGS10 in breast cancer was identified in the paper. However, some major issues in this paper need to be specified:</p>
<p>(1) From reading the introduction section and its references, RGS proteins participate in multiple essential cellular processes and may be tumor initiators or suppressors (Li et al., 2023). This article focuses on the significance of RGS10 in breast cancer, it is recommended to show how the function of RGS10 exhibits therapeutic significance in other types of cancer.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: Thanks for your comments and suggestions on our findings. The dysregulation of RGS protein expression has been observed to be associated with various types of cancer. Especially in ovarian cancer cells. (PMID: 26293348). It has been found that the RGS10 expression is lower than that of normal ovarian cells. (PMID: 21044322). In addition, it has been found that knocking down RGS10 can enhance the vitality of ovarian cancer cells and promote chemoresistance by activating the Rheb GTP/mTOR signaling pathway. (PMID: 26319900). A study suggests that RGS10 mediates inflammation signaling regulation in SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells with high expression of TNF and COX-2 after RGS10 knockdown. In colorectal tumors, RGS10 transcription is regulated by DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. (PMID: 35810565). RGS10 expression also are associated with poor prognosis in laryngeal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pediatric acute myeloid leukemia. (PMID: 32776811, PMID: 26516143, PMID: 30538250)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors characterize RGS10 protein expression in the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MCF7, and SKBR3 in vitro Figure 2A. However, more information would strengthen the data - e.g. information on the expression of RGS10 protein and the survival in public databases, as well as the correlation between RGS10 and Her-2 expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: Thanks for your comments. we have checked the correlation of RGS10 expression and survival rate of Her-2 positive breast cancer patients in a public database. Although there is no significant difference in the “p” value, however, RGS10 high-expression patients have a favorable prognosis tendency than RGS10 low-expression patients after the 100th month.</p>

<p>(3) Regarding the current situation of clinical trials in the RGS family, the potential to develop RGS 10 for clinic translation is a driving factor for EMT.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: Thank you for your comments. The RGS (G protein signal transduction regulator) gene family provides an important &quot;braking&quot; function for the cell receptor family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR). GPCR controls hundreds of important functions in systemic cells and is the largest class of drug targets, with over one-third of FDA approved drugs treating diseases by binding to GPCR and altering its activity. When GPCRs are activated by hormones or neurotransmitters, they initiate signaling cascades within host cells through signal-carrying proteins called G proteins. The function of the RGS protein is to inactivate the G protein, thereby shutting down this signaling cascade reaction, which limits G protein signal transduction and allows cells to reset and receive new incoming signals. If it were not for it, the signals triggered by GPCR would inappropriately remain on, and the signal transduction would experience dysfunction (PMID: 33007266). The potential to develop RGS10 as a driving factor of EMT is meaningful for clinic translation.</p>

<p>(4) In Figure 3A, the paper showed that differential gene expression revealed 70 genes were significantly upregulated in RGS10-depleted SKBR3 cells, The authors didn't show any data on the expression of other EMT-related proteins in pathway analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: Thank you for your comments. The enrichment analysis of RNA sequencing in RGS10-depleted SKBR3 cells suggests that high correlation factors that are associated with EMT, such as TAGLN, TNFSF10, NDUFA4L2, CCN5, PHGDH, ST3GAL5, ANG, and LCN2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In Figure 3B, the paper focuses on LCN2 in pathway analysis, however, the author did not elaborate on the significance of LCN2-related pathways in EMT.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: Thank you for your comments. Some studies have the significance of LCN2-related pathways in EMT. It was confirmed that LCN2 upregulation triggered by PTEN insufficiency induces EMT to promote migration and invasion in MCF7 cells (PMID: 27466505). The activation of STAT3 contributes to an increase in LCN2 expression, which activates ERK pathway-dependent EMT, thus promoting lung metastasis in MDA-MB-231 cells in breast cancer (PMID: 33473115). The silencing of LCN2 reduced the ability of migration and invasion of SUM149 cells and the proportion of tumor stem cells, suggesting that LCN2 may mediate the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells by regulating the stemness of breast cancer cells. The biological effects of LCN2 small molecule inhibitors ZINC00640089 and ZINC00784494 targeting IBC cells have been confirmed. The siRNA-mediated silencing of LCN2 in IBC cells significantly reduces cell proliferation, viability, migration, and invasion. (PMID: 34445288).</p>
