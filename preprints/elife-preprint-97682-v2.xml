<title>Abstract</title><p>UTRs contain crucial regulatory elements for RNA stability, translation and localization, so their integrity is indispensable for gene expression. Approximately 3.7% of genetic variants associated with diseases occur in UTRs, yet a comprehensive understanding of UTR variant functions remains limited due to inefficient experimental and computational assessment methods. To systematically evaluate the effects of UTR variants on RNA stability, we established a massively parallel reporter assay on 6,555 UTR variants reported in human disease databases. We examined the RNA degradation patterns mediated by the UTR library in two cell lines, and then applied LASSO regression to model the influential regulators of RNA stability. We found that UA dinucleotides and UA-rich motifs are the most prominent destabilizing element. Gain of UA dinucleotide outlined mutant UTRs with reduced stability. Studies on endogenous transcripts indicate that high UA-dinucleotide ratios in UTRs promote RNA degradation. Conversely, elevated GC content and protein binding on UA dinucleotides protect high-UA RNA from degradation. Further analysis reveals polarized roles of UA- dinucleotide-binding proteins in RNA protection and degradation. Furthermore, the UA- dinucleotide ratio of both UTRs is a common characteristic of genes in innate immune response pathways, implying a coordinated stability regulation through UTRs at the transcriptomic level. We also demonstrate that stability-altering UTRs are associated with changes in biobank-based health indices, underscoring the importance of precise UTR regulation for wellness. Our study highlights the importance of RNA stability regulation through UTR primary sequences, paving the way for further exploration of their implications in gene networks and precision medicine.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>Untranslated regions of RNAs are indispensable for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression</title>
<p>A mature RNA consists of three regions - a 5’ untranslated region (5’ UTR), the protein coding region, and a 3’ untranslated region (3’ UTR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mignone et al., 2002</xref>). UTRs are indispensable for gene expression. For most mRNAs of higher eukaryotes, the 5’ UTR is essential for ribosome entry and the 3’ UTR is responsible for polyadenylation to stabilize the RNA and enhance its translation efficiency. The average length of the 5’ and 3’ UTRs in human is ∼210 nucleotides (nt) and ∼1030 nt, respectively, with mean 3’ UTR length being more diverse among species and higher eukaryotes hosting longer 3’ UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pesole et al., 2001</xref>). These structural differences among species are consistent with genomic complexity and more complex post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. The UTRs contain <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements that contribute to post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression, such as via protein translation control, subcellular mRNA localization, and mRNA stability upon interactions with <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors such as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barrett et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1b">
<title>UTRs control RNA stability</title>
<p>RNA stability regulation serves as an mRNA quality control mechanism (e.g., nonsense- mediated mRNA decay) to gate protein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Schoenberg &amp; Maquat, 2012</xref>). Decades of research have shown that the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements in UTRs affect mRNA stability. These sequence elements control mRNA integrity and can trigger mRNA degradation pathways by interacting with RBPs or small regulatory RNAs such as miRNAs and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Garneau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mitchell &amp; Tollervey, 2001</xref>). For instance, the miRNA- Argonaute complex recruits the CCR4-NOT (Carbon Catabolite Repression—Negative On TATA-less) complex to initiate deadenylation and decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Huntzinger &amp; Izaurralde, 2011</xref>). Another example is AU-rich elements (AREs, sequence elements rich in adenosine and uridine) present in the 3’ UTRs of many mRNAs that provide binding sites for ARE-binding proteins that trigger the RNA degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Garneau et al., 2007</xref>). Many ARE-binding proteins have been characterized to date that are involved in stability regulation of ARE-hosting mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barreau et al., 2005</xref>), including Tristetrapolin (TTP), Butyrate Response Factor 1 (BRF1), Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) D (also known as AU-Rich Element- Binding Protein 1, AUF1), and KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP), all of which destabilize mRNA, unlike ELAV Like RNA Binding Protein 1 (ELAVL1, also known as HuR) that stabilizes it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Schoenberg &amp; Maquat, 2012</xref>). This regulatory mechanism necessitates physical access to the sequence elements, so structural contexts are critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Paschoud et al., 2006</xref>). Complex secondary structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes (RG4s) and pseudoknots may also play a role in stability regulation. RG4s are enriched in UTRs where they regulate many post- transcriptional regulatory processes, including RNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dumas et al., 2021</xref>), though the detailed mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Although 3’ UTR-mediated regulation gains more attention, 5’ UTRs may also contribute to mRNA stability regulation. For instance, upstream open reading frames (uORF) in 5’ UTRs can facilitate RNA decay in a translation- dependent manner, and RG4s in 5’ UTRs reduce RNA stability in a ribosome-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jia et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s1c">
<title>Multiplexed reporter assays to elucidate UTR stability control</title>
<p>Efforts have been made to elucidate RNA stability regulation on a genome-wide scale to understand its general regulatory mechanisms. However, due to the complexity of post- transcriptional regulation, features inferred from endogenous steady-state RNA levels can be obscured by other dominant factors. For instance, studies examining cellular RNA degradation alongside transcriptional inhibition have shown that coding region length and ribosome occupancy are key determinants of RNA stability (Benjamin Neymotin, 2015). Additionally, RNA stability inferred from steady-state RNA concentrations normalized against transcription rates has indicated that splice junction density is a major factor promoting RNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agarwal &amp; Kelley, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Blumberg et al., 2021</xref>). Nonetheless, these studies have not systematically decoded the influence of primary sequences on RNA stability regulation. Therefore, efforts have been made to establish massively parallel reporter assays for bulk- synthesized UTRs to unveil their governance of RNA regulation in various species. Bidirectional promoters driving a control transcript and a green fluorescence protein (GFP) hosting various test UTRs were first used to evaluate the effect of the UTRs on fluorescence signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Oikonomou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sample et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Slutskin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wissink et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, various UTRs have been inserted into plasmids prior to cellular expression, and then the DNA and RNA levels of each construct have been compared to infer the effect of the UTRs on RNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Griesemer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Litterman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Siegel et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, because the steady-state level is a result of production and decay, these approaches cannot differentiate the effect of the UTRs on transcription, stability and, in some cases, even protein production, greatly limiting scientific interpretation. Injections or transfections of <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed RNAs have been used to study RNA stability. These studies have identified AREs and miRNA-binding sites as destabilizing elements and U-rich sequences as stabilizing elements in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rabani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Vejnar et al., 2019</xref>). Similar studies in human cell lines have shown that RG4 structures and A-rich sequences in 5’ UTRs promote RNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jia et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s1d">
<title>UTR mutations and disease</title>
<p>UTR sequence variation affects mRNA stability, translation and localization. RNA dysregulation arising from mutations in UTRs significantly and negatively affects gene regulation, which can promote phenotypical and even pathological change. According to the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog, genome-wide association studies up to 2018 had uncovered that ∼3.7% of disease risk/quantitative trait-associated genetic variants are located in UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">MacArthur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Steri et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, certain studies have provided evidence that alterations to even a single nucleotide in a UTR can impact mRNA translation or transcript half-life in disease contexts. For example, a single nucleotide substitution of the 36<sup>th</sup> position in the 5’ UTR of <italic>transforming growth factor-β3</italic> (<italic>TGFβ3</italic>; OMIM# 190230) or its 1723<sup>th</sup> 3’ UTR position is associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Beffagna et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, point mutation of the <italic>GFPT1</italic> 3’ UTR results in congenital myasthenic syndrome. GFPT1 (Glutamine-Fructose-6-Phosphate Transaminase 1) is the rate-limiting enzyme for hexosamine biosynthesis, and mutation of its 3’ UTR results in a 90% reduction in protein production, potentially due to gain of a miRNA binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dusl et al., 2015</xref>). Collectively, these studies support that the precise RNA regulation exerted by UTRs plays a critical role in controlling gene expression, with UTR mutations potentially eliciting divergent phenotypes and even severe disease.</p>
<p>Despite their disease relevance, a comprehensive overview of the pathogenic effects of UTR mutations is still lacking. The medical genetics community has earnestly advocated for consideration of “UTR variants in genetic diagnostic procedures” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dusl et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, the impact of 5’ and 3’ UTR sequence variations on RNA stability regulation remains unclear. While there have been efforts to examine how 3’ UTR variants affect steady- state RNA levels, systematic assessments of the explicit effects of disease-relevant variants in both UTRs on stability regulation are still absent. To examine potentially pathogenic UTR mutations and their links to RNA stability, we developed a massively parallel reporter assay in which human 5’/3’ UTRs with disease-relevant mutations were generated <italic>in vitro</italic>, ligated with the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) coding region, and then directly transfected into human cell lines to assess their decay patterns by next-generation sequencing. Taking redundancy and interdependency of regulatory features into consideration, our approach identified that UA dinucleotides are the most influential destabilizing sequence element for RNA stability. Moreover, we found that joint regulation by 5’ and 3’ UTRs shapes the expression kinetics of functional gene groups. Our study unveils RNA stability determinants and delineates the importance of precise UTR control in maintaining harmonious genetic networks for human health.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) for RNA stability</title>
<p>Our above-described genome-wide analysis prompted the hypothesis that UTR variants that disrupt critical RNA regulatory elements may be linked to pathogenicity. Since one of the major roles of UTRs is to control RNA stability, we hypothesized that disease-relevant UTR variants may alter RNA stability. Therefore, we designed 6,555 pairs of 155-nt UTR fragments centering on the variant collected from the HGMD and ClinVar disease databases, and performed time-course assays to examine the relative stability. First, we fused UTRs to the EGFP coding regions, transcribed them <italic>in vitro</italic>, and then transfected them into human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) or neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y), considering pervasive neurological diseases in the mutation collection. Then, we monitored the relative abundance of the reference (ref) and mutant (mt) alleles by amplicon sequencing over a time course (30, 75, 120 min for HEK293T; 20, 40, 60 min for SH-SY5Y) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Primers targeting common reporter regions were utilized for the retrieval of UTR sequences at each time point. We estimated the decay constant and half-life (t1/2) of each UTR according to its relative abundance over time (see Methods). We defined stability-altering variants as those for which the decay constants significantly changed relative to their ref counterparts, as determined by weighted linear regression (see Methods). We observed that variants in both 5’ and 3’ UTRs significantly altered RNA half-life, with slightly more variants having a negative impact on RNA stability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B&amp;C</xref>; <xref rid="tables1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table S1</xref>).</p>

<p>Our results from three independent experiments are highly consistent, with a Spearman’s correlation coefficient &gt; 0.93 (Supplemental Fig. S1A,B). From among 3,700 pairs of valid comparisons, 40 (1.1%) and 839 (22.8%) variants displayed significantly altered stability compared to their ref counterparts in HEK293T and SH-SY5Y cells, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B&amp;C</xref>). Thus, we observed a significant effect of UTR variation on RNA stability, but their regulatory impact was strikingly divergent between the two tested cell lines. We attribute this divergence to potential differences in translation capacity, as well as variations in the composition and concentration of RNA-binding proteins and RNases between the two cell lines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Impact of bi-functional AREs on RNA stability</title>
<p>AREs are well-recognized regulatory motifs controlling RNA stability. Accordingly, we examined if the regulatory effect of AREs could be captured by our MPRA approach. Multiple approaches have revealed AREs as exerting a destabilizing effect on RNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barreau et al., 2005</xref>). However, ARE motifs and ARE-binding proteins are diverse, so the impact of binding may vary considerably. Therefore, we examined the effect of AREs on RNA stability of the ref alleles according to specific sequence content. Based on the definition of AREsite2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nibiru.tbi.univie.ac.at/AREsite2">http://nibiru.tbi.univie.ac.at/AREsite2</ext-link>), we categorized AREs as either WUUUW or its longer derivatives, UUUGUUU or AWUAAA (W:A/G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fallmann et al., 2016</xref>). We observed that AREs in either the 5’ or 3’ UTRs generally destabilized RNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>; Supplemental Fig. S2; Table S2). More specifically, AUUUA/AUUA-containing AREs are associated with RNA destabilization when present in either UTR type, whereas in SH-SY5Y cells, extremely U-dominant AREs (U8- 10A1-2) stabilized it (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), similar to the stabilizing effect of U-stretches described for zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rabani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Vejnar et al., 2019</xref>). These results suggest that although mostly destabilizing, AREs can play dual roles in regulating RNA stability by recruiting binding proteins of diverse functions.</p>

<title>Modeling the impact of UTR-mediated regulation on RNA stability</title>
<p>Given our discovery that the effect of AREs is heavily dependent on sequence content, we decided to further explore the effects of other sequence elements, i.e., beyond known regulatory motifs, in more detail. Since most reported RBP motifs are 6-mers, we initiated a search for novel motifs by analyzing the presence of all 7-mers in our massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) library, correlating their occurrence with mRNA half-life. For those with significant stabilizing or destabilizing effects, we clustered similar ones into motifs (Supplemental Fig. S3). The motifs suggest a G-rich stabilizing profile and an A-rich destabilizing profile, with the latter being more pronounced for the 3’ UTR. Next, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the contextual effect of each sequence element, we took advantage of LASSO regression, which minimizes coefficients of explanatory factors to select the most influential factors. We considered as many factors as possible to explain the half-life of our ref UTR libraries, including primary sequences, RBP binding sites (ATtRACT database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Giudice et al., 2016</xref>)), miRNA seed sites, secondary structures, and folding energy. Furthermore, to avoid collinearity confounding our model, e.g., the effects of very similar factors (such as ‘AA’ and ‘AAA’ sequences), we clustered the factors according to their properties, and then only one representative factor from within a cluster (i.e., the one with the highest correlation to half-life within a cluster) was subjected to LASSO regression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, Supplemental Fig. S4, Table S3 and Methods). LASSO regression renders as zero the coefficients of factors with minimal explanatory power (see Methods for details). Overall, we started with 1,231 (5’ UTR) or 1,475 (3’ UTR) factors, but only 5-19 factors were selected ultimately for each trained model (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-E</xref>; Supplemental Table S4). The selected explanatory factors all represent small kmer motifs (k=2 to 3) and RBP binding motifs. Unexpectedly, we identified some unique regulatory factors in each cell line, indicating that RNA decay pathways are typically shared but can be strongly influenced by the cellular environment. Overall, motifs that are at least two nucleotides long proved critical for RNA stability, supporting the sequence specificity of the decay process.</p>

<p>In both of the cell lines we tested, GU-rich sequences in 5’ UTRs stabilized RNAs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B,D</xref>). In contrast, CA- and UG-repeat sequences—potential binding sites for Insulin Like Growth Factor 2 mRNA Binding Protein 3 (IGF2BP3) and CUGBP Elav-Like Family Member 1 (CELF1)—in 3’ UTRs proved the most destabilizing factors in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Moreover, we noticed that for both UTRs, UA dinucleotides and other UA-rich sequences—such as WWWWWW (W=A/U; a potential binding motif of Peptidylprolyl Isomerase E (PPIE)), AUUUA (a potential binding motif of ELAV Like RNA Binding Protein 1 (ELAVL1)), and UUUAUA (a potential binding motif of hnRNPA1)—are strongly destabilizing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3B-E</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A,C</xref>). UA dinucleotides and WWWWWW belong to the same cluster, but they were respectively selected for LASSO regression in the two cell lines because they displayed the highest explanatory power (largest coefficient by univariate regression) for RNA half-life in each cell line (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B,D</xref>). Most prominently, UA dinucleotides in both UTRs overwhelmed other factors in robustly destabilizing RNAs in SH-SY5Y cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D,E</xref>). Therefore, UA dinucleotides seem to be a universal destabilizing motif, so we investigated how UA dinucleotides regulate RNA stability in further detail.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>UA dinucleotides and UA-rich motifs are the most common and effective RNA destabilizing factor</title>
<p>UA dinucleotides proved to be the strongest stability determinant for both UTR types in SH- SY5Y cells. UA dinucleotides alone present a negative correlation with RNA stability, with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of -0.287 for 5’ UTRs and -0.377 for 3’ UTRs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,C</xref>). UA- rich motifs (in the same cluster as UA dinucleotides) behave similarly to UA dinucleotides in regulating RNA stability, whereas GC-rich motifs have the opposite effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,D</xref>; Supplemental Fig. S5A,B). Within the same cluster, UA dinucleotides and the WWWWWW motif were the strongest RNA stability regulators in each cell line (Supplemental Table S3). Given the strong destabilizing effect of factors in the UA-associated cluster for both UTR types and both cell lines, we further analyzed their commonalities. An UpSet analysis revealed that all features contributing to RNA stability across four experimental groups (HEK293T 5’ UTRs, HEK293T 3’ UTRs, SH-SY5Y 5’ UTRs, SH-SY5Y 3’ UTRs) occur in the UA dinucleotide/WWWWWW cluster (Supplemental Fig. S5C), indicating a universal destabilizing effect of UA-rich sequences. Next, to examine if there is a region-specific effect of UA and closely-related AU dinucleotides, we used a sliding window to establish the localization- associated relationship between the UA/AU dinucleotide ratio and RNA half-life. Correlation coefficients between UA/AU dinucleotide ratios and UTR stability were calculated for each window, and we assumed that regions displaying a strong correlation between UA/AU dinucleotide ratios and stability rank hosted UA/AU dinucleotides that control RNA stability (Supplemental Fig. S5D). We found that UA/AU dinucleotides in the UTRs of SH-SY5Y cells were generally strongly correlated with RNA stability, but only weakly associated with RNA stability in HEK293T cells (apart from a relatively strong correlation at the ends of 3’ UTRs, implying a protective role against exonuclease digestion) (Supplemental Fig. S5E). Together, these results support that UA dinucleotides are a common and prominent RNA destabilizing motif.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we examined the effect of mutating the most effective destabilizing UA dinucleotide (resulting in dinucleotide gain or loss) in terms of altering RNA stability. We found a clear propensity for 3’ UTRs with stability loss to accumulate gain of UA dinucleotide mutations, compared to stabilizing or non-significant mutations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). To further validate the impact of UA dinucleotides, we curated a subset of oligo pairs from a 5’ UTR random library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jia et al., 2020</xref>) with the sole difference being the presence of one additional UA dinucleotide, resulting in a discrepancy of one UA dinucleotide between them. This selection allowed us to investigate whether these variations influenced RNA half-lives. We defined significant pairs as those with half-life differences greater than or equal to a 1.5-fold change. Notably, the acquisition of an additional UA dinucleotide resulted in the destabilization of RNAs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>, Left: 0 to 1 UA dinucleotide; Right: 1 to 2 UA dinucleotides). Moreover, to explore the influence of the UA-destabilizing effect on endogenous mRNA stability, we assessed the UA- dinucleotide ratio in relation to RNA half-life of HEK293 and human erythroleukemia K562 cells. While exon junction density and transcript length have been suggested as major determinants of RNA half-life <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agarwal &amp; Kelley, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Blumberg et al., 2021</xref>), our findings indicate that elevated UA-dinucleotide ratios in both UTRs significantly promote RNA decay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref> and Supplemental Fig. S5F). This effect is specific, as such ratios in the coding region are inconsequential. Thus, we have identified UA dinucleotides as being the strongest RNA destabilizing feature in UTRs, with their mutational addition proving the most prevalent cause of reduced RNA stability.</p>

<title>Intrinsic features of UTRs determine RNA stability</title>
<p>Apart from their shared regulatory mechanisms, our MPRA revealed distinct UTR behaviors. Despite undergoing exactly the same procedure, library RNAs in SH-SY5Y cells degraded much faster than those in HEK293T cells (Supplemental Fig. S1D). Distinct RNA stability control in neuronal cells by GC content of transcripts has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Guvenek et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, cell-specific contexts, such as expression of RBPs and miRNAs, may have intensified the discrepancy in stability control between the two cell lines. Moreover, for mutant UTRs that significantly destabilized or stabilized RNAs, we found that their ref counterparts are with significantly longer or shorter RNA half-life, respectively (Supplemental Fig. S6A). This intrinsic difference in effects on RNA stability for ref UTRs was observed for both cell lines and it was amplified in their mutant counterparts (Supplemental Fig. S6B,C). A motif analysis revealed that ref UTRs whose mutant counterparts significantly altered RNA stability tended to harbor more NOVA1 (NOVA Alternative Splicing Regulator 1) and PPIE binding sites, but fewer FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) binding sites (Supplemental Fig. S6D). These observations indicate that intrinsic properties of the UTRs where mutations occur greatly influence the mutational effect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>GC content RBP- and ribosome-binding hinders the destabilizing effect of UA dinucleotides</title>
<p>Many previous studies have reported GC content to be a major RNA stability determinant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Courel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Litterman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). A univariate regression analysis on our UTR libraries revealed that both GC content and UA dinucleotides are strongly associated with RNA half-life, with the 3’ UTR library from SH-SY5Y cells displaying the strongest association. However, overall, UA dinucleotides are more strongly correlated with RNA half-life than GC content (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,D</xref>; Supplemental Fig. S7A). We reasoned that GC content and UA dinucleotides may represent confounding factors in our models. Therefore, to further dissect their respective contributions to RNA stability, we examined their relationship by regressing both factors as well as their interaction term against RNA half-life (t1/2 ∼ UA-diNT% + GC% + UA-diNT% × GC%). For both 5’ UTRs and 3’ UTRs, we observed that UA dinucleotides exhibited a stronger association (i.e., smaller <italic>p</italic> values) with RNA half-life than GC content. Indeed, the link between GC content and RNA half-life became non- significant when we also accounted for UA dinucleotides (Supplemental Fig. S7A). Moreover, the interaction term (UA-diNT% × GC%) proved significant for three out of four experimental groups (SH-SY5Y 5’ UTR: <italic>p</italic> = 0.18, 3’ UTR: <italic>p</italic> = 0.00047, HEK293T 5’ UTR: <italic>p</italic> = 0.0062, 3’ UTR: <italic>p</italic> = 1.2e-7), supporting that GC content influences the effect of UA dinucleotides. To further explore this interaction, we stratified degrees of GC content and examined their effects on UA dinucleotides. Notably, despite a somewhat anti-correlation between UA dinucleotides and GC content, they do not simply oppose each other. Substantial counts of UA dinucleotides are observed in regions characterized by high GC content. We found that UA dinucleotides strongly destabilized RNA in the context of low GC content (bottom 50%), but their effects were neutralized somewhat under scenarios of high GC content (top 50%) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The GC protective effect also supports the observation that change of UA dinucleotides in high GC-content 5’ UTR did not always translate into a change of stability (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Conversely, the protective effect of GC content was remarkably strong for high UA-dinucleotide ratios but was barely detectable for low UA-dinucleotide ratios (Supplemental Fig. S7B). Thus, the RNA destabilizing effect is most pronounced under conditions of a low UA-dinucleotide ratio and low GC content (Supplemental Fig. S7C). Moreover, the stabilizing or destabilizing effects of UA deletion or addition, respectively, were only observed for low GC content, further supporting that high GC content hinders the destabilizing effect of UA dinucleotides (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, Supplemental Fig. S7D).</p>

</fig>
<p>To corroborate the interplay between the UA-dinucleotide ratio and GC content, we investigated their combined impact on RNA stability using a fixed-length 5’ UTR random library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jia et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings reveal a negative association between the UA-dinucleotide count within the library and RNA half-life, with this effect being attenuated under conditions of high GC content (top 50%) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). As another layer of validation, we further explored their relative contributions to mRNA enrichment in P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Courel et al., 2019</xref>). P-bodies are membraneless granules for RNA storage and turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Beadle et al., 2023</xref>). We uncovered a positive correlation between UA dinucleotides and RNA P-body localization, especially for those occurring in 3’ UTRs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). For both UTR types, we observed a greater UA dinucleotide-stabilizing effect in P-bodies when GC content is low (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), consistent with our MPRA dataset.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the protective effect of GC content arises from extensive intramolecular interactions that shield UA dinucleotides from being recognized by nucleases, though other physical hindrances may also diminish the destabilizing effect of UA dinucleotides. Therefore, we examined the influence of RBP binding on the destabilizing effect of UA dinucleotides. In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5F and G</xref>, we calculated the number of RBP species binding to UA dinucleotides using both experimental data (enhanced crosslinking immunoprecipitation or eCLIP) and predicted RBP-binding motifs (ATtRACT). We then organized our MPRA-derived results based on whether they exhibited a high (top 50%) or low (bottom 50%) number of RBP binding partners per UA dinucleotide. In doing so, we revealed that the RNA group with multiple binding partners indeed displayed longer half-life compared to the group with few binding partners. This result proved consistent for both UTR types and based on experimental (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>) or predicted (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>) RBP binding data. To further validate the RBP protective effect against UA- destabilization, we selected four 3’ UTRs (APC, WDR35, SH3TC2 and MTR) with a UA- dinucleotide ratio greater than 90% quantile and assessed their RNA stability by transcription inhibition with actinomycin D (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H,I</xref>). Half-life obtained by the actinomycin D treatment were highly correlated with the MPRA result (ρ = 0.8) in accordance with numbers of RBP binding sites per UA dinucleotide. Together, the results argue a protective role of RBP binding on UA dinucleotides.</p>
<p>In acknowledgment of the dual potential of RBPs to either promote or inhibit RNA degradation, we conducted a detailed analysis of the impact of each RBP’s binding on RNA stability. By correlating the binding of UA dinucleotide-binding proteins with RNA half-life, we identified UA-binding RBPs that play roles in either safeguarding or promoting RNA degradation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>; Supplemental Fig. S7E; Supplemental Table S5). Notably, the protective UA-containing motifs were found to be U-rich, reinforcing the observation that U-stretch sequences may enhance RNA stability. Thus, we have identified interplay between GC content, RBP-binding and the destabilizing effect on RNAs of UA dinucleotides. The fact that these regulatory factors may control RNA stability via synergistic or antagonistic mechanisms emphasizes the need to consider all contributory factors simultaneously, as achieved by our modeling approach, to gain a complete overview of the regulatory network (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

<title>UA-dinucleotide ratio of UTRs reflects functional enrichment</title>
<p>Since we identified the UA dinucleotides of UTRs as a major stability determinant, we argued that if UA dinucleotides do indeed represent a functional motif regulating RNA stability, then this property could be a proxy of expression dynamics for classifying genes into functional groups. Therefore, we calculated the average UA-dinucleotide ratio of each gene and compared this distribution within a given GO term against the entire genome background. We found that the 5’ UTRs of genes responsible for regulating appetite, apoptosis and synaptic signaling display the highest UA-dinucleotide ratios and those involved in glutathione metabolism exhibit the lowest (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>; Supplemental Table S6). In terms of 3’ UTRs, genes linked to integrin activation, the interleukin-mediated pathway and B-cell differentiation have the highest UA-dinucleotide ratios (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). To investigate how UA dinucleotide localization contributes to biological functions, we utilized a sliding window approach to identify UTR regions with UA dinucleotides above or below genomic background levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C,D</xref>). UA dinucleotide in each 10-nt window with 1-nt step was calculated and normalized to the UTR length (Methods). For 5’ UTRs, we found that synaptic signaling and striated muscle contraction pathways represent the functional groups with genes having most UA dinucleotide-enriched windows, whereas genes responsible for regulating cell proliferation had most UA dinucleotides-depleted windows (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). For 3’ UTRs, RNA translation and immune-related functions proved to be the GO terms with most UA dinucleotide-enriched windows (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Since 5’ and 3’ UTRs may synergistically regulate gene expression, we examined genes for which the UA-dinucleotide ratio in both UTRs significantly differed from the genomic background, which revealed that the UA-dinucleotide ratio in both UTRs was consistently either above or below background values (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E,F</xref>). Plotting these positive or negative effects two-dimensionally, we observed that the gene groups mostly lie in the first and third quadrants, which we interpret as indicative of a synergistic stabilizing or destabilizing effect of both UTRs. Notably, the gene groups in the first quadrant, reflecting UA-dinucleotide ratios in both UTRs being above background levels, are all related to the immune response. It is also noteworthy that the high UA-dinucleotide ratio of genes regulating appetite, synaptic signaling and the immune response reflects the transient expression nature of these gene groups, further supporting that UA dinucleotides exert a destabilizing effect on RNA. Together, this genome-wide analysis indicates that the UA-dinucleotide ratio of UTRs reflects global regulation of gene expression dynamics.</p>

<title>UTR variants associated with disease</title>
<p>The results from our MPRA stability assay and the genome-wide functional classification support the hypothesis that UTR-mediated RNA stability and gene expression may be disrupted by SNPs within the UTRs.

<p>Since dysregulated RNA stability is known to contribute to cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Perron et al., 2022</xref>), we first investigated UTR mutations in samples taken from cancer patients (Harmonized Cancer Datasets: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/</ext-link>). We identified several SNPs in UTRs that correlated with aberrant RNA expression and/or protein expression (Supplemental Table S7). Interestingly, two 3’ UTR mutations that resulted in aberrant expression of both RNA and proteins (<italic>DDP4</italic> [Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4] and CASP7 [Caspase 7], respectively) were A/T deletions in TA-rich sequences with increased RNA and protein expression levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A,B</xref>), in agreement with our findings that UA-rich sequences are the most influential stability determinants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, to establish a correlation between UTR variants and health outcomes, we examined if stability-altering UTR variations identified in our MPRA experiments are associated with abnormal physiological/pathological presentations among the Taiwanese community (Taiwan Biobank (TWB) data).

The most significant association was detected for the 3’ UTR of APOC3 (apolipoprotein C3 c.*40G&gt;C) and blood triglyceride levels (<italic>p</italic> = 3.5 × 10<sup>−74</sup> as determined by linear regression) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C,D</xref>), total cholesterol (<italic>p</italic> = 7.6 × 10<sup>−12</sup>) and self-reported hyperlipidemia (<italic>p</italic> = 0.00038) (Supplemental Table S8). APOC3 is involved in metabolizing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and its mutation has been associated with low plasma triglyceride levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Boren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Goyal et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings provide compelling evidence that regulation of RNA turnover by UTRs controls metabolic equilibrium, which can be perturbed by SNPs within the UTRs. Overall, we have demonstrated that pathogenic UTR variants are enriched in critical regulatory regions and may elicit disease.</p>

<title>Small kmers in UTRs determine RNA stability</title>
<p>The function of UTRs in regulating RNA stability has long been recognized. However, very few reports have systematically addressed the functional impact of genetic variations in UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Griesemer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sample et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, UTR variants are typically classified as being benign or of unknown functions, without experimental support. To methodically dissect the impact of such UTR variants, we have established an MPRA to test the effect of disease- related UTR variants on RNA stability. Unlike previous assays that measure the RNA:DNA ratio or protein output to infer RNA stability, our assay directly measures RNA survival and thereby circumvents confounding effects on transcription and/or protein production. However, while our approach effectively assesses the stability of synthesized RNA in human cells, it may not fully capture the decay dynamics of nuclear-synthesized RNA, which can be influenced by endogenous modifications and <italic>trans</italic>-acting RNA binding factors.</p>
<p>From among almost 1,500 potential stability regulators, we applied LASSO regression to select 5-19 independent factors that best explained RNA half-life. The major destabilizing factors proved to be UA dinucleotides, as well as WWWWWW (W:A/U) and AUUUA (ELAV1 binding site) motifs, all highlighting the importance of UA-rich sequences in UTRs for RNA stability (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Among these destabilizing factors, UA dinucleotides were best correlated with RNA half- life (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-D</xref>). The UA-dinucleotide ratio rather than GC content or folding energy explained our RNA stability data better, implying that specific sequence recognition by <italic>trans</italic> factors and not simply regulation according to structuredness is the underlying control mechanism. Similarly, MPRA on 3’ UTR variants identified mono- or di-nucleotide composition as primary factors controlling RNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Griesemer et al., 2021</xref>). This di-nucleotide specificity may partially be attributed to the sequence preference of a human ribonuclease superfamily in which eight catalytically-active RNases (numbered 1-8) all share homology with bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A. RNase A cleaves 3’-5’ phosphodiester bonds with a specificity for pyrimidines (U/C) at the main anchoring site and purines (A/G) at the secondary site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sorrentino, 2010</xref>). Kinetic analysis has revealed a &gt;100-fold preference for UpA than UpG substrates for the human RNase A family (RNase 1-7, RNase 8 was not studied in this report) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Prats-Ejarque et al., 2019</xref>), consistent with our finding that UA dinucleotides represent the most destabilizing sequence motifs. While most of the studies on RNA degradation mechanism concerned deadenylation and decapping followed by exonuclease digestion, the contribution of endonucleases on overall RNA degradation might be underestimated. It was reported that transcript and UTR length is negatively correlated with RNA stability (Benjamin Neymotin, 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Blumberg et al., 2021</xref>), implying that increased RNA mass could be susceptible to endonuclease attack. Thus, our findings and those of others demonstrate that specific sequence recognition, especially di-nucleotide composition, determines RNA stability.</p>

<title>Interplay of GC content, RBP binding and UA dinucleotides for RNA stability</title>
<p>Although it was intuitive to infer a negative correlation between UA dinucleotides and GC content, the best-known stability regulator, we found that UA dinucleotides cannot simply be viewed as an inverse proxy for GC content. Instead, the UA-dinucleotide ratio more adequately explained our RNA stability data, and the protective effect of GC content on stability was almost abolished in the context of a low UA-dinucleotide ratio (Supplemental Fig. S7). Consequently, UA dinucleotides destabilize RNA more robustly under conditions of low GC content (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>; Supplemental Fig. S7). This reciprocal interaction was also apparent in independent RNA stability assays and P-body transcriptomic analysis that inferred RNA degradation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-E</xref>). Thus, the effect of GC content was also impacted by the sequence context, potentially explaining discrepancies among previous reports on the effects of GC content on RNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Courel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Griesemer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Litterman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, although RBPs do not always protect RNA from degradation, with their effect on RNA stability depending on the factors recruited (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>), the destabilizing effect of UA dinucleotides is generally hampered by RBP binding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F,G</xref>). We reason that, similar to structural hindrance, recognition of UA dinucleotides can be blocked by the physical occupancy of RBPs, resulting in an overall protective effect of RBPs against UA dinucleotide-mediated degradation that may overwhelm the destabilizing effect of a subset of ARE-binding proteins.</p>

<title>UTR variants linked to RNA stability and population health</title>
<p>We identified many crucial regulatory features in 5’ UTRs. Thus, our results evidence that 5’ UTRs are an indispensable region for controlling RNA stability. Our MPRA data revealed that more 5’ UTR variants than those in 3’ UTRs caused stability changes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Moreover, we found that stability-altering variants of both UTR types are associated with skewed biomarker or disease accessions in the TWB. Although we did not intend to dissect translation-dependent or -independent decay pathways in our system, it demonstrated the critical contribution of both UTR types to regulating RNA stability. Significantly, our presentation of UA dinucleotide enrichment or depletion in the UTRs of functional gene groups indicates that both UTR types may jointly regulate RNA stability to achieve kinetic control of a functional pathway (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E,F</xref>). At the sequence level, our results indicate that mutational gain of UA dinucleotides is linked to diminished RNA half-life (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). This simple rule can be adopted as a primary screening for UTR mutation-mediated pathologies and a principle for sequence design of synthetic RNA to be expressed in human cells. Further validation of the sequence effects can be undertaken in pertinent cell or tissue types. Collectively, our findings have uncovered the RNA stability regulation exerted by the sequence composition of UTRs, revealed health-related UTR variants, and provided a foundation for precise diagnosis of non-coding genetic variants.</p>

<title>Feature selection</title>
<p>A LASSO model was utilized to perform feature selection. Features with a high proportion of 0 (≥ 90%) were excluded to ensure the robustness of the selection model. In addition, to avoid multicollinearity caused by similar features that perturb feature selection, all features were clustered using single-linkage hierarchical clustering with the distance metric defined as one minus the absolute value of the Spearman correlation coefficient. We cut the tree at a specific height, and the feature that had the greatest influence on RNA stability, which was examined using a simple linear regression model, was selected to be the representative of each cluster. Then we calculated the variance inflation factor (VIF) value of the representative features. The VIFs were obtained by the following linear model and equations:

<p>SH-SY5Y cells were seeded approximately 4x10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in 12-well plates before the day of the transfection. The cells were transfected with 800 ng pEGFP-3’ UTR plasmids by using Viromer® ONE RED (Lipocalyx GmbH). 24 hr post-transfection, the cells per 12-well were equally divided into 3 wells in 24-well plate. After 16-hour incubation, cells were treated with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) and were harvested by TRIzol at the respective time points (0, 2, 4 hours after stopping the transcription). The RNA was purified by the Direct-zol™ RNA Microprep kits (Zymo Research). Equal amount of the total RNA for each sample were reverse transcribed using SuperScript<sup>TM</sup> IV (ThermoFisher) with random hexamer. Real-time PCR was performed with FastSYBR Green Plus Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and QuantStudio™ 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Relative mRNA abundance in different time points were normalized to time points 0 hr (2<sup>-(△Ct –△Ct0)</sup>) for each pEGFP-3’ UTR.</p>

<title>Construction of UTR-library DNA Templates</title>
<p>UTR-library DNA templates were assembled by overlap extension PCR with Herculase II Fusion Enzyme (Agilent Technologies). Initially, the oligonucleotide library sequences (CustomArray, Inc. USA) were double-strandized and amplified by PCR. After subjected to PCR clean-up (Qiagen), the UTR-library amplicons were then appended with EGFP CDS and CMV promoter sequence (derived from EGFP-N1 vector) sequentially through overlapping PCR. Eventually, the assembled full-length DNA templates (CMVP-5’ UTR-EGFP or CMVP-EGFP-3’ UTR) were subjected to PCR clean-up again for the following transfection.</p>

<title>UA-ratio analysis for GO annotation</title>
<p>GO annotations were downloaded from QuickGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Binns et al., 2009</xref>) and Ensembl BioMart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kinsella et al., 2011</xref>). Full Human genome sequence and transcript annotation were from R Bioconductor package BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38 v.1.4.4 (UCSC version hg38, based on GRCh38.p13) and TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene v.3.15.0 . UTR length &lt; 10 nucleotides were removed from analysis.</p>
<p>UA-dinucleotide ratio in each UTR sequence was calculated by (UA count ÷ (sequence length - 1)). For every GO annotation containing &gt; 20 qualified transcripts, UA-ratio of those transcripts were compared with all transcripts by Fisher-Pitman permutation test (R coin package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hothorn et al., 2008</xref>)). Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.01 was defined as significant enrichment/depletion.</p>
<p>For the sliding UA-dinucleotide ratio, UA-ratio of the most 5’ 10-nt window was first calculated and the window was slid by 1 nt in each movement to the 3’end for each transcript. Then each UTR was normalized to length by splitting sliding UA-ratio to 100 fragments and the mean sliding UA-dinucleotide ratio in each fragment was calculated. Finally calculate the mean ratio in each fragment across all transcripts within a GO term was calculated to represent the sliding UA-dinucleotide ratio.</p>

<title>TCGA Data</title>
<p>TCGA data were downloaded by R/Bioconductor package TCGABiolinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Colaprico et al., 2016</xref>) with the following query code:</p>
<p>RNA-seq: GDCquery(TCGA-id, data.category = “Transcriptome Profiling”, experimental.strategy = “RNA-Seq”, data.type = “Gene Expression Quantification”,workflow.type = “STAR - Counts”) Protein: GDCquery(project = TCGA-id, data.type = “Protein expression quantification”, legacy = TRUE, data.category = “Protein expression”, platform = “MDA_RPPA_Core”)</p>

<title>The Taiwan Biobank Data, TWB</title>
<p>In order to identify the association between RNA stability altering variants and common chronic diseases and biochemical indices, the genotyping and phenotypic data of 68,978 Taiwanese people were obtained from the TWB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biobank.org.tw/">https://www.biobank.org.tw/</ext-link>). The information on the diseases was self-reported and collected through questionnaires. Each participant was genotyped on the Affymetrix Axiom genome-wide TWB 2.0 array containing 752,921 SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) probes. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Academia Sinica.</p>
<p>We conducted statistical analyses to assess the association of 21 variants significantly affecting RNA stability with 23 reported traits and the levels of 24 biochemical indices. Before carrying out association tests, the quality control for genotyping data was performed as described previously to ensure its reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chiang et al., 2022</xref>). Linear regression and logistic regression were performed to examine the association between each SNP and continuous biochemical index and dichotomous trait, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression followed by a likelihood ratio test was used to determine p-values for biochemical indices containing more than two levels and was fitted by R package nnet (v 7.3-17). All SNPs were tested as co-dominant genetic models. The square root of age, gender, dwelling place and the batch of array were included in the regression models to adjust for potential confounding effects. The first ten principal components were also included as covariates in all regression models to control the population stratification.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study combines massively parallel reporter assays and regression analysis to identify sequence features in untranslated regions contributing to the stability of in vitro transcribed mRNA delivered to cells. The strength of evidence presented is <bold>solid</bold>, although some points about half-life measurements and the relevance of identified sequence features to native transcript stability will inform future discussion surrounding the present study. Taken together, the work will be of interest to a broad swath of colleagues studying post-transcriptional gene regulation and especially to those using massively parallel reporter assays.</p>

<p>In the manuscript by Su et al., the authors present a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) measuring the stability of in vitro transcribed mRNAs carrying wild-type or mutant 5' or 3' UTRs transfected into two different human cell lines. The goal presented at the beginning of the manuscript was to screen for effects of disease-associated point mutations on the stability of the reporter RNAs carrying partial human 5' or 3' UTRs. However, the majority of the manuscript is dedicated to identifying sequence components underlying the differential stability of reporter constructs. This analysis showed that UA dinucleotides are the most predictive feature of RNA stability in both cell lines and both UTRs.</p>
<p>The effect of AU rich elements (AREs) on RNA stability is well established in multiple systems, and the present study confirms this general trend, but points out variability in the consequence of seemingly similar motifs on RNA stability. For example, the authors report that a long stretch of Us has extreme opposite effects on RNA stability depending on whether it is preceded by an A (strongly destabilizing) or followed by an A (strongly stabilizing). While the authors interpretation of a context-dependence of the effect is certainly well-founded, it seems counterintuitive that the preceding or following A would be the (only) determining factor. This points to a generally reductionist approach taken by the authors in the analysis of the data and in their attempt to dissect the contribution of &quot;AU rich sequences&quot; to RNA stability, with a general tendency to reduce the size and complexity of the features (e.g. to dinucleotides). While this certainly increases the statistical power of the analysis due to the number of occurrences of these motifs, it limits the interpretability of the results. How do UA dinucleotides per se contribute to destabilizing the RNA, both in 5' and 3' UTRs, but (according to limited data presented) not in coding sequences? What is the mechanism? RBPs binding to UA dinucleotide containing sequences are suggested to &quot;mask&quot; the destabilizing effect, thereby leading to a more stable RNA. Gain of UA dinucleotides is reported to have a destabilizing effect, but again no hypothesis is provided as to the underlying molecular mechanism. In addition to reducing the motif length to dinucleotides, the notion of &quot;context dependence&quot; is used in a very narrow sense.</p>
<p>The present MPRA measures the effect of UTR sequences in one specific reporter context and using one experimental approach (following the decay of in vitro transcribed and transfected RNAs). While this method certainly has its merits compared to other approaches, it also comes with some caveats: RNA is delivered naked, without bound RBPs and no nuclear history, e.g. of splicing (no EJCs), editing and modifications. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether UA dinucleotide frequency is a substantial factor in determining the half-lives of endogenous mRNAs.</p>
<p>The authors conclude their study with a meta-analysis of genes with increased UA dinucleotides in 5' and 3'UTRs, showing that specific functional groups are overrepresented among these genes. In addition, they provide evidence for an effect of disease-associated UTR mutations on endogenous RNA stability. While these elements link back to the original motivation of the study (screening for effects of point mutations in 5' and 3' UTRs), they provide only a limited amount of additional insights.</p>
<p>In summary, this manuscript presents an interesting addition to the long-standing attempts at dissecting the sequence basis of RNA stability in human cells. The analysis is in general comprehensive and sound; however, it remains unclear to what extent the findings can be generalized beyond the method and the experimental system used here.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>Parts of my original comments have been adequately addressed by the reviewers.</p>
<p>
After reading the revised manuscript and the rebuttal, my main concern is related to the figure comparing the half-lives as measured in the two different cell lines that was included in the response to reviewer 2, but not in the revised manuscript. The complete lack of correlation between the half-lives of the 3'UTR library measured in the two cell lines is concerning. While variability and cell type-specific effects can be expected, some principles should be the same (such as the effect of UA dinucleotides that the authors report), leading to at least some correlation.</p>
<p>
In addition, it is unclear to me why the half-lives measured for the two libraries in HEK cells are shifted (median ln(t 1/2)=6-7 for the 5'UTR library and ln(t 1/2)=4-4.5 for the 3'UTR library), but not in SH.</p>
<p>I feel that this figure contains important information that should be included in the final manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary of goals:</p>
<p>Untranslated regions are key cis-regulatory elements that control mRNA stability, translation, and translocation. Through interactions with small RNAs and RNA binding proteins, UTRs form complex transcriptional circuitry that allows cells to fine-tune gene expression. Functional annotation of UTR variants has been very limited, and improvements could offer insights into disease relevant regulatory mechanisms. The goals were to advance our understanding of the determinants of UTR regulatory elements and characterize the effects of a set of &quot;disease-relevant&quot; UTR variants.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of a massively parallel reporter assay allowed for analysis of a substantial set (6,555 pairs) of 5' and 3' UTR fragments compiled from known disease associated variants. Two cell types were used.</p>
<p>The findings confirm previous work about the importance of AREs, which helps show validity and adds some detailed comparisons of specific AU-rich motif effects in these two cell types.</p>
<p>Using a Lasso regression, TA-dinucleotide content is identified as a strong regulator of RNA stability in a context dependent manner based on GC content and presence of RNA binding protein binding motifs. The findings have potential importance, drawing attention to a UTR feature that is not well characterized.</p>
<p>The use of complementary datasets, including from half-life analyses of RNAs and from random sequence library MRPA's, is a useful addition and supports several important findings. The finding the TA dinucleotides have explanatory power separate from (and in some cases interacting with) GC content is valuable.</p>
<p>The functional enrichment analysis suggests some new ideas about how UTRs may contribute to regulation of certain classes of genes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In this section, original reviewer comments about the initial submission and the responses of the authors are listed together with new reviewer responses to the authors:</p>
<p>Reviewer original comment 1: It is difficult to understand how the calculations for half-life were performed. The sequencing approach measures the relative frequency of each sequence at each time point (less stable sequences become relatively less frequent after time 0, whereas more stable sequences become relatively more frequent after time 0). Since there is no discussion of whether the abundance of the transfected RNA population is referenced to some external standard (e.g., housekeeping RNAs), it is not clear how absolute (rather than relative) half-lives were determined.</p>
<p>Author response: [The authors showed the equations used to calculate half lives based on read counts.] They stated that &quot;The absolute abundance was not required for the half-life calculation.&quot;</p>
<p>Reviewer response to authors: The methods section states that DESeq2 was used to normalize read counts. DESeq2 normalization assumes that levels of most RNAs are not different between samples. That assumption is not valid here, since RNAs in the library are introduced into cells at time 0 and all RNAs decrease over time. If DESeq2 is applied without modification to normalize across timepoints, normalized reads from less stable RNAs will decrease over time (as expected) but normalized reads from more stable RNAs will increase. Can the authors please clarify in the methods how the read counts were normalized to account for this issue?</p>
<p>Reviewer original comment 2: Fig. S1A and B are used to assess reproducibility. They show that read counts at a given time point correlate well across replicate experiments. However, this is not a good way to assess reproducibility or accuracy of the measurements of t1/2 are. (The major source of variability in read counts in these plots - especially at early time points - is likely starting abundance of each RNA sequence, not stability.) This creates concerns about how well the method is measuring t1/2. Also creating concern is the observation that many RNAs are associated with half-lives that are much longer than the time points analyzed in the study. For example, based upon Figure S1 and Table S1 correctly, the median t1/2 for the 5' UTR library in HEK cells appears to be &gt;700 minutes. Given that RNA was collected at 30, 75, and 120 minutes, accurate measurements of RNAs with such long half lives would seem to be very difficult.</p>
<p>Author response: ... The calculation of the half-life involves first determining the decay constant 𝜆, which represents a constant rate of decay. Since 𝜆 is a constant, it is possible to accurately calculate it without needing data over the entire decay range. Our experimental design considers this by selecting appropriate time points to ensure a reliable estimation of 𝜆, and thus, the half-life. To determine the most suitable time points, we conducted preliminary experiments using RT-PCR. These experiments indicated that 30, 75, and 120 minutes provided an effective range for capturing the decay dynamics of the transcripts.</p>
<p>Reviewer response to author comments: Based on Fig. S1D, for 3' UTRs in both cell types and for 5' UTRs in SH-SY5Y cells, median t1/2 is in the range of ~30 to 90 minutes (corresponding to ln t1/2 = 3.5 to 4.5). Measuring RNAs at 30, 75, and 120 minutes would therefore be a good choice for these cases, However, median t1/2 in HEK cells appears to be ~600 minutes (corresponding to ln t1/2 ~6.4) for HEK cells. For t1/2 of 600 minutes, RNA levels at the final time point (120 minutes) would be 90% of the those at the first time point (30 minutes), which illustrates why the method would need to be able to reliably capture very small changes in RNA abundance to accurately measure t1/2 for transcripts with half-lives much longer than 120 minutes. As suggested in our original review, this concern could be addressed by showing the correlation of half-lives across replicates for the 5' and 3' UTR libraries in both cell types. Alternatively, the authors could show other measures of reproducibility for the half-life measurements across replicates. This requires no additional experimentation and can be done using the data from replicate runs shown in Fig. S1A and B. We remain concerned that for sequences with very long half-lives, extrapolating the half-life from small changes between 30 and 120 minutes will lead to imprecise measurements.</p>
<p>Reviewer original comment 3: There is no direct comparison of t1/2 between the two cell types studied for the full set of sequences studied. This would be helpful in understanding whether the regulatory effects of UTRs are generally similar across cell lines (as has been shown in some previous studies) or whether there are fundamental differences. The distribution of t1/2's is clearly quite different in the two cell lines, but it is important to know if this reflects generally slow RNA turnover in HEK cells or whether there are a large number of sequence-specific effects on stability between cell lines. A related issue is that it is not clear whether the relatively small number of significant variant effects detected in HEK cells versus SH-SY5Y cells is attributable to real biological differences between cell types or to technical issues (many fewer read counts and much longer half lives in HEK cells).</p>
<p>Author response: For both cell lines, we selected oligonucleotides with R2 &gt; 0.5 and mean squared error (MSE) &lt; 1 for analysis when estimating half-life (λ) by linear regression. This selection criterion was implemented to minimize the effect of experimental noise. After quality control, we selected common UTRs and compared the RNA half-lives of the two cell lines using a scatter plot. The figure below shows that RNA half-lives are quite different between the cell lines, with a moderate similarity observed in the 5' UTRs (R = 0.21), while the correlation in the 3' UTRs is non-significant. Despite the low correlation of mRNA half-life between the two cell lines, UA-dinucleotide and UA-rich sequences consistently emerge as the most significant destabilizing features, suggesting a shared regulatory mechanism across diverse cellular environments.</p>
<p>Reviewer response to author comments: We appreciate that the authors shared this additional analysis of the data. We believe that this is an important finding and that the additional figure showing correlations of half-lives across cell types should be included in the manuscript or supplement. Discussion of this result in the manuscript would also be useful for readers. This result is surprising to us since we would have expected that widely expressed RNA-binding proteins would have led to more similar effects between the two cell types, as previously found using other approaches (e.g., studies of 3' UTR effects in MPRAs). It would also be appropriate to discuss that differences seen between the two cell types indicate that caution is warranted when trying to generalize the results of this study to other cell types.</p>
<p>Reviewer original comment 4 has been addressed adequately in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Appraisal and impact:</p>
<p>Reviewer original comment 1: The work adds to existing studies that previously identified sequence features, including AREs and other RNA binding protein motifs, that regulate stability and puts a new emphasis on the role of &quot;TA&quot; (better &quot;UA&quot;) dinucleotides. It is not clear how potential problems with the RNA stability measurements discussed above might influence the overall conclusions, which may limit the impact unless these can be addressed.</p>
<p>It is difficult to understand whether the importance of TA dinucleotides is best explained by their occurrence in a related set of longer RBP binding motifs (see Fig 5J, these motifs may be encompassed by the &quot;WWWWWW cluster&quot;) or whether some other explanation applies. Further discussion of this would be helpful. Does the LASSO method tend to collapse a more diverse set of longer motifs that are each relatively rare compared to the dinucleotide? It remains unclear whether TA dinucleotides are associated with less stability independent of the presence of the known larger WWWWWWW motif. As noted above, the importance of TA dinucleotides in the HEK experiments appears to be less than is implied in the text.</p>
<p>Author response: To ensure the representativeness of the features entered into the LASSO model, we pre-selected those with an occurrence greater than 10% among all UTRs. There is no evidence to support a preference for dinucleotides by LASSO. To address whether the destabilizing effect of UA dinucleotides is part of the broader WWWWWW motif, we divided UA dinucleotides into two groups: those within the WWWWWW motif and those outside of it. Specifically, we divided UTRs into two categories: 'at least one UA within a WWWWWW motif' and 'no UA within a WWWWWW motif,' and visualized the results using a boxplot. As shown in [figures provided to the reviewers], the destabilizing trend still remains for UA dinucleotides outside of the WWWWWW motif, although the effect appears to be more pronounced when UA is within the WWWWWW motif. This suggests that while UA dinucleotides have a destabilizing effect independently, their impact is amplified when they are part of the broader WWWWWW motif.</p>
<p>Reviewer response to authors: These are useful additional analyses, and we suggest that the additional figure and discussion should be included in the manuscript/supplement so that readers can benefit from them.</p>
<p>Reviewer original comment 2: The inclusion of more than a single cell type is an acknowledgement of the importance of evaluating cell type-specific effects. The work suggests a number of cell type-specific differences, but due to technical issues (especially with the HEK data, as outlined above) and the use of only two cell lines, it is difficult to understand cell type effects from the work.</p>
<p>The inclusion of both 3' and 5' UTR sequences distinguishes this work from most prior studies in the field. Contrasting the effects of these regions on stability is of interest, although the role of these UTRs (especially the 5' UTR) in translational regulation is not assessed here.</p>
<p>Author response: We examined the role of UTR and UTR variants in translation regulation using polysome profiling. By both univariate analysis and an elastic regression model, we identified motifs of short repeated sequences, including SRSF2 binding sites, as mutation hotspots that lead to aberrant translation. Furthermore, these polysome-shifting mutations had a considerable impact on RNA secondary structures, particularly in upstream AUG-containing 5' UTRs. Integrating these features, our model achieved high accuracy (AUROC &gt; 0.8) in predicting polysome-shifting mutations in the test dataset. Additionally, metagene analysis indicated that pathogenic variants were enriched at the upstream open reading frame (uORF) translation start site, suggesting changes in uORF usage underlie the translation deficiencies caused by these mutations. Illustrating this, we demonstrated that a pathogenic mutation in the IRF6 5' UTR suppresses translation of the primary open reading frame by creating a uORF. Remarkably, site-directed ADAR editing of the mutant mRNA rescued this translation deficiency. Because the regulation of translation and stability does not converge, we illustrate these two mechanisms in two separate manuscripts (this one and doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.11.589132).</p>
<p>Reviewer response to authors: This is useful context. No further comment.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript titled &quot;Multiplexed Assays of Human Disease‐relevant Mutations Reveal UTR Dinucleotide Composition as a Major Determinant of RNA Stability&quot; the authors aim to investigate the effect of sequence variations in 3'UTR and 5'UTRs on the stability of mRNAs in two different human cell lines.</p>
<p>To do so, the authors use a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA). They transfect cells with a set of mRNA reporters that contain sequence variants in their 3' or 5' UTRs, which were previously reported in human diseases. They follow their clearance from cells over time relative to the matching non-variant sequence. To analyze their results, they define a set of factors (RBP and miRNA binding sites, sequence features, secondary structure etc.) and test their association with differences in mRNA stability. For features with a significant association, they use clustering to select a subset of factors for LASSO regression and identify factors that affect mRNA stability.</p>
<p>
They conclude that the TA dinucleotide content of UTRs is the strongest destabilizing sequence feature. Within that context, elevated GC content and protein binding can protect susceptible mRNAs from degradation. They also show that TA dinucleotide content of UTRs affects native mRNA stability and that it is associated with specific functional groups. Finally, they link disease associated sequence variants with differences in mRNA stability of reporters.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This work introduces a different MPRA approach to analyze the effect of genetic variants. While previous works in tissue culture use DNA transfections that require normalization for transcription efficiency, here the mRNA is directly introduced into cells at fixed amounts, allowing a more direct view of the mRNA regulation.</p>
<p>(2) The authors also introduce a unique analysis approach, which takes into account multiple factors that might affect mRNA stability. This approach allows them to identify general sequence features that affect mRNA stability beyond specific genetic variants, and reach important insights on mRNA stability regulation. Indeed, while the conclusions to genetic variants identified in this work are interesting, the main strength of the work involves general effect of sequence features rather than specific variants.</p>
<p>(3) The authors provide adequate support for their claims and validate their analysis using both their reporter data and native genes. For the main feature identified, TA di-nucleotides, they perform follow-up experiments with modified reporters that further strengthen their claims, and also validate the effect on native cellular transcripts (beyond reporters), demonstrating its validity also within native scenarios.</p>
<p>(4) The work provides a broad analysis of mRNA stability, across two mRNA regulatory segments (3'UTR and 5'UTR) and is performed in two separate cell-types. Comparison between two different cell-types is adequate, and the results demonstrate, as expected, the dependence of mRNA stability on the cellular context. Analysis of 3'UTR and 5'UTR regulatory effects also shows interesting differences and similarities between these two regulatory regions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In their revised manuscripts, the authors successfully address many of the weaknesses raised in the original review, including the effect of possible confounding effects, and additional methodology details. Notably, two of the issues raised in the original report, have only been partially addressed in the revision.</p>
<p>(1) The analysis and regression models built in this work are not thoroughly investigated relative to native genes within cells.</p>
<p>
While using MPRAs indeed allows to isolate regulatory effects that are less influential in-vivo, the resulting effects still provide some regulatory function in-vivo. The goal of such an analysis would not be to demonstrate the predictive power of the models, or to make any claims regarding using these models to fully explain or predict the stability of native transcripts. Clearly, additional more prominent factors could function in controlling endogenous RNA stability.</p>
<p>
Instead, the goal of such an investigation is to simply assess the fraction of in-vivo regulation that the factors identified in this work contribute in native contexts, and what is the relative contribution of the phenomena captured by the well-controlled MPRA study.</p>
<p>
This reviewer believes that even if the effects identified by the current MPRA study only contribute a small fraction of in-vivo variation, an analysis that aim to estimate what this fraction is, will be very relevant to this study for several reasons. First, in order to appreciate the results of this study within their in-vivo context. Second, in light of the questions raised as motivation for this study, and particularly the need to identify the effect of disease-associated 3'UTR variants, which clearly have an in-vivo effect.</p>
<p>(2) Methodology validation can be performed with simulated data (generated in-silico by the authors) to provide an independent support for the ability of the current methodology to correctly extract regulatory effects from the data.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In the manuscript by Su et al., the authors present a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) measuring the stability of in vitro transcribed mRNAs carrying wild-type or mutant 5' or 3' UTRs transfected into two different human cell lines. The goal presented at the beginning of the manuscript was to screen for effects of disease-associated point mutations on the stability of the reporter RNAs carrying partial human 5' or 3' UTRs. However, the majority of the manuscript is dedicated to identifying sequence components underlying the differential stability of reporter constructs. This shows that TA dinucleotides are the most predictive feature of RNA stability in both cell lines and both UTRs.</p>
<p>The effect of AU rich elements (AREs) on RNA stability is well established in multiple systems, and the present study confirms this general trend but points out variability in the consequence of seemingly similar motifs on RNA stability. For example, the authors report that a long stretch of Us has extreme opposite effects on RNA stability depending on whether it is preceded by an A (strongly destabilizing) or followed by an A (strongly stabilizing). While the authors interpretation of a context- dependence of the effect is certainly well-founded, it seems counterintuitive that the preceding or following A would be the (only) determining factor. This points to a generally reductionist approach taken by the authors in the analysis of the data and in their attempt to dissect the contribution of &quot;AU rich sequences&quot; to RNA stability, with a general tendency to reduce the size and complexity of the features (e.g. to dinucleotides). While this certainly increases the statistical power of the analysis due to the number of occurrences of these motifs, it limits the interpretability of the results. How do TA dinucleotides per se contribute to destabilizing the RNA, both in 5' and 3' UTRs, but (according to limited data presented) not in coding sequences? What is the mechanism? RBPs binding to TA dinucleotide containing sequences are suggested to &quot;mask&quot; the destabilizing effect, thereby leading to a more stable RNA. Gain of TA dinucleotides is reported to have a destabilizing effect, but again no hypothesis is provided as to the underlying molecular mechanism. In addition to reducing the motif length to dinucleotides, the notion of &quot;context dependence&quot; is used in a very narrow sense; especially when focusing on simple and short motifs, a more extensive analysis of the interdependence of these features (beyond the existing analysis of the relationship between TA- diNTs and GC content) could potentially reveal more of the context dependence underlying the seemingly opposite behavior of very similar motifs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(We have used UA instead of TA, as per the reviewer's suggestion)</p>
<p>The contribution of coding region sequence to RNA stability has been extensively discussed (For example: doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2022.03.032; doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-02251-5; doi.org/10.15252/embr.201948220; doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228730; doi.org/10.7554/eLife.45396). While UA content at the third codon position (wobble position) has been implicated as a pro-degradation signal, codon optimality has emerged as the most prominent determinant for RNA stability. This indicates that the role of coding regions in RNA stability differs from that of UTRs due to the involvement of translation elongation. We did not intend to suggest that UA-dinucleotides in UTRs and coding regions have the same effect.</p>
<p>To ensure the representativeness of the features entered into the LASSO model, we pre-selected those with an occurrence greater than 10% among all UTRs. As a result, while motifs with very low occurrences were excluded from the analysis, there is no evidence to indicate a preference for dinucleotides by the LASSO model.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that UA-dinucleotide may recruit endonucleases RNase A family, whose catalytic pockets exhibit a strong bias for UA dinucleotide (doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2010.04.018). Structures or protein bindings that block this recognition might stabilize RNAs. To gain further insight into the motif interactions, we investigated the interactions between UA and other 15 dinucleotides through more detailed analyses. We conducted a linear regression analysis investigating interactions between UA and the other 15 dinucleotides. The formula used below includes UA:</p>
<p><inline-formula id="sa4equ1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-97682-sa4-equ1.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>, where all 𝛽 terms represent the regression coefficients, and <inline-formula id="sa4equ2"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-97682-sa4-equ2.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula id="sa4equ3"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-97682-sa4-equ3.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>, and <sup>th</sup> UTR, respectively, and 𝜖<sub>i</sub> denotes the error term. For each dinucleotide, we tested the significance of 𝛽<inline-formula id="sa4equ4"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-97682-sa4-equ4.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> represent the number of UA dinucleotides, the number of other dinucleotides (other than UA), and the GC content of the i<italic><sub>UAxGC%</sub></italic> and 𝛽<italic><sub>UAxDiNT</sub></italic>, and compared their p-values using a quantile-quantile (QQ) plot. Author response image 1 shows that the interaction effect of UA dinucleotides with GC% is much more significant than interactions with the other 15 dinucleotides, as indicated by the inflated QQ plot of p-values. This suggests that GC content is a more critical contextual factor influencing UA dinucleotides' impact on RNA stability.</p>

<p>The present MPRAs measures the effect of UTR sequences in one specific reporter context and using one experimental approach (following the decay of in vitro transcribed and transfected RNAs). While this approach certainly has its merits compared to other approaches, it also comes with some caveats: RNA is delivered naked, without bound RBPs and no nuclear history, e.g. of splicing (no EJCs), editing and modifications. One way to assess the generalizability of the results as well as the context dependence of the effects is to perform the same analysis on existing datasets of RNA stability measurements obtained through other methods (e.g. transcription inhibition). Are TA dinucleotides universally the most predictive feature of RNA half-lives?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our system studies the stability control of RNA synthesized in vitro and delivered into human cells. While we did not intend to generalize our conclusions to endogenous RNAs, our approach contributes to the understanding of in vitro synthesized RNA used for cellular expression, such as in vaccines. It is known that endogenous RNAs undergo very different regulation. The most prominent factors controlling endogenous RNA stability are the density of splice junctions and the length of UTRs (doi.org/10.1186/s13059-022-02811-x; doi.org/10.1186/s12915-021-00949-x). To decipher the sequence regulation, these factors are controlled in our experiments. Therefore, we do not expect the dinucleotide features found by our approach to be generalized as the most predictive feature of RNA half-life in vivo.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors conclude their study with a meta-analysis of genes with increased TA dinucleotides in 5' and 3'UTRs, showing that specific functional groups are overrepresented among these genes. In addition, they provide evidence for an effect of disease-associated UTR mutations on endogenous RNA stability. While these elements link back to the original motivation of the study (screening for effects of point mutations in 5' and 3' UTRs), they provide only a limited amount of additional insights.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We utilized the Taiwan Biobank to investigate whether mutations significantly affecting RNA stability also impact human biochemical measurements. Our findings indicate that these mutations indeed have a significant effect on various biochemical indices. This highlights the importance of our study, as it bridges basic science with potential applications in precision medicine. By linking specific UTR mutations with measurable changes in biochemical indices, our research underscores the potential for these findings to inform targeted medical interventions in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In summary, this manuscript presents an interesting addition to the long-standing attempts at dissecting the sequence basis of RNA stability in human cells. The analysis is in general very comprehensive and sound; however, at times the goal of the authors to find novelty and specificity in the data overshadows some analyses. One example is the case where the authors try to show that TA-dinucleotides and GC content are decoupled and not merely two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>They claim that the effect of TA dinucleotides is different between high- and low-GC content contexts but do not control for the fact that low GC-content regions naturally will contain more TA dinucleotides and therefore the effect sizes and the resulting correlation between TA-diNT rate and stability will be stronger (Fig. 5A). A more thorough analysis and greater caution in some of the claims could further improve the credibility of the conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Low GC content implies a higher UA content but does not directly equate to a high UA-dinucleotide ratio. For instance, the sequence AUUGAACCUU has a lower GC content (0.3) compared to UAUAGGCCGC (0.6), yet it also has a lower UA-dinucleotide ratio (0 vs. 0.22). To address this concern more rigorously, we performed a stratified analysis based on UA-diNT rate. As shown in our Fig. S7C, even after stratifying by UA- dinucleotide ratio (upper panel high UA- dinucleotide ratio / lower panel low UA- dinucleotide ratio), we still observe that the destabilizing effect of UA is stronger in the low GC content group.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary of goals:</p>
<p>Untranslated regions are key cis-regulatory elements that control mRNA stability, translation, and translocation. Through interactions with small RNAs and RNA binding proteins, UTRs form complex transcriptional circuitry that allows cells to fine-tune gene expression. Functional annotation of UTR variants has been very limited, and improvements could offer insights into disease relevant regulatory mechanisms. The goals were to advance our understanding of the determinants of UTR regulatory elements and characterize the effects of a set of &quot;disease-relevant&quot; UTR variants.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of a massively parallel reporter assay allowed for analysis of a substantial set (6,555 pairs) of 5' and 3' UTR fragments compiled from known disease associated variants. Two cell types were used.</p>
<p>The findings confirm previous work about the importance of AREs, which helps show validity and adds some detailed comparisons of specific AU-rich motif effects in these two cell types.</p>
<p>Using a Lasso regression, TA-dinucleotide content is identified as a strong regulator of RNA stability in a context dependent manner based on GC content and presence of RNA binding protein binding motifs. The findings have potential importance, drawing attention to a UTR feature that is not well characterized.</p>
<p>The use of complementary datasets, including from half-life analyses of RNAs and from random sequence library MRPA's, is a useful addition and supports several important findings. The finding the TA dinucleotides have explanatory power separate from (and in some cases interacting with) GC content is valuable.</p>
<p>The functional enrichment analysis suggests some new ideas about how UTRs may contribute to regulation of certain classes of genes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is difficult to understand how the calculations for half-life were performed. The sequencing approach measures the relative frequency of each sequence at each time point (less stable sequences become relatively less frequent after time 0, whereas more stable sequences become relatively more frequent after time 0). Since there is no discussion of whether the abundance of the transfected RNA population is referenced to some external standard (e.g., housekeeping RNAs), it is not clear how absolute (rather than relative) half-lives were determined.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We estimated decay constant λ and half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) by the following equations:</p>
<disp-formula id="sa4equ5">
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-97682-sa4-equ5.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>where <italic>C</italic><sub>i(t)</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>i(t=0)</sub> are read count values of the ith replicate at time points 𝑡 and 0 (see also Methods). The absolute abundance was not required for the half-life calculation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Fig. S1A and B are used to assess reproducibility. They show that read counts at a given time point correlate well across replicate experiments. However, this is not a good way to assess reproducibility or accuracy of the measurements of t1/2 are. (The major source of variability in read counts in these plots - especially at early time points - is likely the starting abundance of each RNA sequence, not stability.) This creates concerns about how well the method is measuring t1/2. Also creating concern is the observation that many RNAs are associated with half-lives that are much longer than the time points analyzed in the study. For example, based upon Figure S1 and Table S1 correctly, the median t1/2 for the 5' UTR library in HEK cells appears to be &gt;700 minutes. Given that RNA was collected at 30, 75, and 120 minutes, accurate measurements of RNAs with such long half lives would seem to be very difficult.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We estimated the half-life based on the following equations:</p>
<disp-formula id="sa4equ6">
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-97682-sa4-equ6.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>where <italic>C</italic><sub>i(t)</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>i(t=0)</sub> are read count values of the ith replicate at time points 𝑡 and 0 (see also Methods). The calculation of the half-life involves first determining the decay constant 𝜆, which represents a constant rate of decay. Since 𝜆 is a constant, it is possible to accurately calculate it without needing data over the entire decay range. Our experimental design considers this by selecting appropriate time points to ensure a reliable estimation of 𝜆, and thus, the half-life. To determine the most suitable time points, we conducted preliminary experiments using RT-PCR.</p>
<p>These experiments indicated that 30, 75, and 120 minutes provided an effective range for capturing the decay dynamics of the transcripts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There is no direct comparison of t1/2 between the two cell types studied for the full set of sequences studied. This would be helpful in understanding whether the regulatory effects of UTRs are generally similar across cell lines (as has been shown in some previous studies) or whether there are fundamental differences. The distribution of t1/2's is clearly quite different in the two cell lines, but it is important to know if this reflects generally slow RNA turnover in HEK cells or whether there are a large number of sequence-specific effects on stability between cell lines. A related issue is that it is not clear whether the relatively small number of significant variant effects detected in HEK cells versus SH-SY5Y cells is attributable to real biological differences between cell types or to technical issues (many fewer read counts and much longer half lives in HEK cells).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For both cell lines, we selected oligonucleotides with R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.5 and mean squared error (MSE) &lt; 1 for analysis when estimating half-life (λ) by linear regression. This selection criterion was implemented to minimize the effect of experimental noise. After quality control, we selected common UTRs and compared the RNA half-lives of the two cell lines using a scatter plot. Author response image 2 shows that RNA half-lives are quite different between the cell lines, with a moderate similarity observed in the 5' UTRs (R = 0.21), while the correlation in the 3' UTRs is non-significant.</p>

</fig>
<p>Despite the low correlation of mRNA half-life between the two cell lines, UA-dinucleotide and UA-rich sequences consistently emerge as the most significant destabilizing features, suggesting a shared regulatory mechanism across diverse cellular environments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The general assertion is made in many places that TA dinucleotides are the most prominent destabilizing element in UTRs (e.g., in the title, the abstract, Fig. 4 legend, and on p. 12). This appears to be true for only one of the two cell lines tested based on Fig. 3.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>UA-dinucleotides and other UA-rich sequences exhibit similar effects on RNA stability, as illustrated in Fig. S5A-C. In two cell lines, UA-dinucleotide and WWWWWW sequences were representatives of the same stability-affecting cluster. While the impact of UA-dinucleotides can be generalized, we have rephrased some statements for clarification to avoid any potential misunderstanding. For examples:</p>
<p>Abstract: “...We found that UA dinucleotides and UA-rich motifs are the most prominent destabilizing element.“</p>
<p>p.10: “UA dinucleotides and UA-rich motifs are the most common and effective RNA destabilizing factor”</p>
<p>Figure 4: “The UTR UA dinucleotides and UA-rich motifs are the most common and influential RNA destabilizing factor.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Appraisal and impact:</p>
<p>The work adds to existing studies that previously identified sequence features, including AREs and other RNA binding protein motifs, that regulate stability and puts a new emphasis on the role of &quot;TA&quot; (better &quot;UA&quot;) dinucleotides. It is not clear how potential problems with the RNA stability measurements discussed above might influence the overall conclusions, which may limit the impact unless these can be addressed.</p>
<p>It is difficult to understand whether the importance of TA dinucleotides is best explained by their occurrence in a related set of longer RBP binding motifs (see Fig 5J, these motifs may be encompassed by the &quot;WWWWWW cluster&quot;) or whether some other explanation applies. Further discussion of this would be helpful. Does the LASSO method tend to collapse a more diverse set of longer motifs that are each relatively rare compared to the dinucleotide? It remains unclear whether TA dinucleotides are associated with less stability independent of the presence of the known larger WWWWWWW motif. As noted above, the importance of TA dinucleotides in the HEK experiments appears to be less than is implied in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To ensure the representativeness of the features entered into the LASSO model, we pre-selected those with an occurrence greater than 10% among all UTRs. There is no evidence to support a preference for dinucleotides by LASSO. To address whether the destabilizing effect of UA dinucleotides is part of the broader WWWWWW motif, we divided UA dinucleotides into two groups: those within the WWWWWW motif and those outside of it. Specifically, we divided UTRs into two categories: 'at least one UA within a WWWWWW motif' and 'no UA within a WWWWWW motif,' and visualized the results using a boxplot. As shown in Author response image 3, the destabilizing trend still remains for UA dinucleotides outside of the WWWWWW motif, although the effect appears to be more pronounced when UA is within the WWWWWW motif. This suggests that while UA dinucleotides have a destabilizing effect independently, their impact is amplified when they are part of the broader WWWWWW motif.</p>

<p>The inclusion of more than a single cell type is an acknowledgement of the importance of evaluating cell type-specific effects. The work suggests a number of cell type-specific differences, but due to technical issues (especially with the HEK data, as outlined above) and the use of only two cell lines, it is difficult to understand cell type effects from the work.</p>
<p>The inclusion of both 3' and 5' UTR sequences distinguishes this work from most prior studies in the field. Contrasting the effects of these regions on stability is of interest, although the role of these UTRs (especially the 5' UTR) in translational regulation is not assessed here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We examined the role of UTR and UTR variants in translation regulation using polysome profiling. By both univariate analysis and an elastic regression model, we identified motifs of short repeated sequences, including SRSF2 binding sites, as mutation hotspots that lead to aberrant translation. Furthermore, these polysome-shifting mutations had a considerable impact on RNA secondary structures, particularly in upstream AUG-containing 5’ UTRs. Integrating these features, our model achieved high accuracy (AUROC &gt; 0.8) in predicting polysome-shifting mutations in the test dataset. Additionally, metagene analysis indicated that pathogenic variants were enriched at the upstream open reading frame (uORF) translation start site, suggesting changes in uORF usage underlie the translation deficiencies caused by these mutations. Illustrating this, we demonstrated that a pathogenic mutation in the IRF6 5’ UTR suppresses translation of the primary open reading frame by creating a uORF. Remarkably, site-directed ADAR editing of the mutant mRNA rescued this translation deficiency. Because the regulation of translation and stability does not converge, we illustrate these two mechanisms in two separate manuscripts (this one and doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.11.589132).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript titled &quot;Multiplexed Assays of Human Disease‐relevant Mutations Reveal UTR</p>
<p>Dinucleotide Composition as a Major Determinant of RNA Stability&quot; the authors aim to investigate the effect of sequence variations in 3'UTR and 5'UTRs on the stability of mRNAs in two different human cell lines.</p>
<p>To do so, the authors use a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA). They transfect cells with a set of mRNA reporters that contain sequence variants in their 3' or 5' UTRs, which were previously reported in human diseases. They follow their clearance from cells over time relative to the matching non-variant sequence. To analyze their results, they define a set of factors (RBP and miRNA binding sites, sequence features, secondary structure etc.) and test their association with differences in mRNA stability. For features with a significant association, they use clustering to select a subset of factors for LASSO regression and identify factors that affect mRNA stability.</p>
<p>They conclude that the TA dinucleotide content of UTRs is the strongest destabilizing sequence feature. Within that context, elevated GC content and protein binding can protect susceptible mRNAs from degradation. They also show that TA dinucleotide content of UTRs affects native mRNA stability, and that it is associated with specific functional groups. Finally, they link disease associated sequence variants with differences in mRNA stability of reporters.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work introduces a different MPRA approach to analyze the effect of genetic variants. While previous works in tissue culture use DNA transfections that require normalization for transcription efficiency, here the mRNA is directly introduced into cells at fixed amounts, allowing a more direct view of the mRNA regulation.</p>
<p>The authors also introduce a unique analysis approach, which takes into account multiple factors that might affect mRNA stability. This approach allows them to identify general sequence features that affect mRNA stability beyond specific genetic variants, and reach important insights on mRNA stability regulation. Indeed, while the conclusions to genetic variants identified in this work are interesting, the main strength of the work involve general effect of sequence features rather than specific variants.</p>
<p>The authors provide adequate supports for their claims, and validate their analysis using both their reporter data and native genes. For the main feature identified, TA di-nucleotides, they perform follow-up experiments with modified reporters that further strengthen their claims, and also validate the effect on native cellular transcripts (beyond reporters), demonstrating its validity also within native scenarios.</p>
<p>The work provides a broad analysis of mRNA stability, across two mRNA regulatory segments (3'UTR and 5'UTR) and is performed in two separate cell-types. Comparison between two different cell-types is adequate, and the results demonstrate, as expected, the dependence of mRNA stability on the cellular context. Analysis of 3'UTR and 5'UTR regulatory effects also shows interesting differences and similarities between these two regulatory regions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors fail to acknowledge several possible confounding factors of their MPRA approach in the discussion.</p>
<p>First, while transfection of mRNA directly into cells allows to avoid the need to normalize for differences in transcription, the introduction of naked mRNA molecules is different than native cellular mRNAs and could introduce biases due to differences in mRNA modifications, protein associations etc. that may occur co-transcriptionally.</p>
<p>Second, along those lines, the authors also use in-vitro polyadenylation. The length of the polyA tail of the transfected transcripts could potentially be very different than that of native mRNAs and also affect stability.</p>

<p>The transcripts used in our study were polyadenylated in vitro with approximately 100 nucleotides</p>
<p>(Fig. S1C), similar to the polyA tail lengths typically observed in vivo (dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2014.02.007).  Additionally, these transcripts were capped to emulate essential mRNA characteristics and to minimize immune responses in recipient cells. This design allows us to study RNA decay for in vitro-synthesized RNA delivered into human cells, akin to RNA vaccines, but it does not necessarily extend to endogenous RNAs. As mentioned, endogenous RNAs undergo nuclear processing and are decorated by numerous trans factors, resulting in distinct regulatory mechanisms. We therefore provided a more discussion on these differences and their implications in the revised manuscript: “However, while our approach effectively assesses the stability of synthesized RNA in human cells, it may not fully capture the decay dynamics of nuclear-synthesized RNA, which can be influenced by endogenous modifications and trans-acting RNA binding factors.

<p>(2) The analysis approach used in this work for identifying regulatory features in UTRs was not previously used.

<p>In our study, we employed the calculation of the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) as a basis for selecting variables. This well-established method is widely used to detect variables with high collinearity, thus ensuring the robustness and reliability of our analysis. By identifying and excluding highly collinear variables, we aimed to minimize multicollinearity and improve the accuracy of our regression models. For more detailed information on the use of VIF in regression analysis, please refer to Akinwande, M., Dikko, H., and Samson, A. (2015). Variance Inflation Factor: As a Condition for the Inclusion of Suppressor Variable(s) in Regression Analysis. Open Journal of Statistics, 5, 754-767. doi: 10.4236/ojs.2015.57075. We have included the method details in the revised manuscript (p. 28) :”… to avoid multicollinearity caused by similar features that perturb feature selection, all features were clustered using single-linkage hierarchical clustering with the distance metric defined as one minus the absolute value of the Spearman correlation coefficient. We cut the tree at a specific height, and the feature that had the greatest influence on RNA stability, which was examined using a simple linear regression model, was selected to be the representative of each cluster. Then we calculated the variance inflation factor (VIF) value of the representative features. The VIFs were obtained by the following linear model and equations:</p>

<p>For example, the choice to use 7-mer sequences within the factors set is not explained, particularly when almost all motifs that are eventually identified (Figure 3B-E) are shorter.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The known RBP motifs are primarily 6-mer. To explore the possibility of discovering novel motifs that could significantly impact our model, we started with 7-mer sequences. However, our analysis revealed that including these additional variables did not improve the explanatory power of the model; instead, it reduced it. Consequently, our final model focuses on motifs shorter than 7-mer. We explained the motif selections in the revised manuscript (p. 9): “Given our discovery that the effect of AREs is heavily dependent on sequence content, we decided to further explore the effects of other sequence elements, i.e., beyond known regulatory motifs, in more detail. Since most reported RBP motifs are 6-mers, we initiated a search for novel motifs by analyzing the presence of all 7-mers in our massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) library, correlating their occurrence with mRNA half-life.”</p>

<p>(3) The analysis and regression models built in this work are not thoroughly investigated relative to native genes within cells.

</disp-quote>
<p>Our system studies the stability control of RNA synthesized in vitro and delivered into human cells. While we validated the UTR UA-dinucleotide effect in vivo, we did not intend to conclude that this is the most influential regulation for endogenous RNAs. It is known that endogenous RNAs undergo very different regulation. The most prominent factors controlling endogenous RNA stability are the density of splice junctions and the length of UTRs (doi.org/10.1186/s13059-022-02811-x; doi.org/10.1186/s12915-021-00949-x). To decipher the sequence regulation, we controlled for these factors in our experiments. Therefore, we acknowledge that several endogenous features, which were excluded by our approach, may serve as predictive features of RNA half-life in vivo.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for pointing this out. To determine if considering different contextual effects within each feature cluster would enhance model performance, we modified our feature selection by choosing both the feature with the largest positive and the largest negative effect on RNA half-life in Step III of Figure 3A. We then split the data into a 2:1 training and testing set and repeated this process 100 times. Model performance was evaluated using mean average error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and adjusted R-squared. From Author response image 4, we observed no significant improvement in model performance using this new approach. Notably, in the SH-SY5Y 5' UTR model, our original method even outperformed the modified one, with statistically lower MAE and RMSE and a higher adjusted R-squared. Therefore, we believe our current approach remains appropriate.</p>

<p>In the introduction, it is stated that traditional MPRAs &quot;cannot differentiate the effect of the UTRs on transcription, stability and, in some cases, even protein production, greatly limiting scientific interpretation.&quot; This is confusing, since these assays can and have been used in association with both RNA decay measurements and measurements of reporter protein levels that allow assessment of effects on stability and protein production (including in the cited references).</p>

<p>We reason that the RNA steady-state level (e.g., sequencing the overall RNA normalized to DNA) or protein steady-state level (e.g., detecting the fluorescence signal) does not precisely reveal the decay kinetics of the RNA. Steady-state level is a result of production and decay, both of which UTRs contribute to. Similarly, the protein level is not a perfect estimate of the RNA decay.</p>

<p>The analyses in Fig. 2 are interpreted as demonstrating that AREs destabilize RNAs. These analyses are examining associations, so it would be more appropriate to say that AREs are associated with destabilization (since it is formally possible that other sequences that are present in these UTR fragment cause destabilization). A similar issue arises on p. 10: &quot;TA dinucleotides alone can negatively regulate RNA stability, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of ‐0.287 for 5' UTRs and ‐0.377 for 3' UTRs (Fig. 4A,C).&quot; This is an association and does not establish causation.

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I have 3 points that I think could improve science and its presentation within the manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) Most importantly, how well do LASSO regression models predict the stability of native transcripts? Such analysis can also be useful for comparison between two different cell-types. How well does the regression model learned (on reporters) within one cell-type predict mRNA stability (of reporters and native genes) in this cell-type and in the other cell-type? Similarly, models can also help to analyze the effects of 5'UTR and 3'UTR sequences on mRNA stability. In particular, how well does the regression model of each separate regulatory sequence (3'UTR or 5'UTR) is able to predict the stability of native genes in the cell? Can the predictions be improved by combining both 3'UTR and 5'UTR sequence features within the regression models?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The decay model for native transcripts has been established in prior research (doi.org/10.1186/s13059-022-02811-x; doi.org/10.1186/s12915-021-00949-x), which indicates that exon junction density and transcript length are the primary determinants of RNA stability. Based on these findings, we designed the MPRA with fixed length and without splicing to focus on the contribution of primary sequences. We validated the destabilizing effect of UA dinucleotide on endogenous RNAs (Fig. 4G and Supplemental Fig. S5F) but do not recommend using our model to fully explain or predict the stability of native transcripts.</p>
<p>To assess the model's cross-cell type predictive performance for RNA half-life, we employed the Regression Error Characteristic (REC) curve (Bi &amp; Bennett, 2003). Similar to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the REC curve illustrates the trade-off between error tolerance and accuracy, with better performance indicated by curves trending toward the upper left. We also computed the Area Over the Curve (AOC) as a performance metric, where lower values indicate better predictive ability. From Author response image 5, the REC curves reveal that cross-cell type prediction performance is suboptimal. The y-axis represents prediction accuracy, while the x-axis denotes error tolerance for the natural logarithm of RNA half-life (ln(<italic>𝑡<sub>1/2</sub></italic>), in minutes).</p>

<p>In response to the suggestion of combining 5' and 3' UTR sequence features in the regression model, we believe this approach may not be ideal. As shown in Figure S1D, the distribution of RNA half-lives between 5' and 3' UTRs is significantly different, reflecting their distinct regulatory roles. Additionally, the base composition differs, with 5' UTRs having a higher GC content compared to 3' UTRs. Combining these datasets would likely make the origin of the sequence (5' or 3' UTR) the most predictive feature, thereby reducing the model's interpretability. Furthermore, our MPRA results, derived from separate 5’ or 3’ UTR library, do not support a combined model, further suggesting this approach may not be suitable with our data.</p>

<p>The conclusions regarding genetic variants are interesting, yet the main strength of the work involves identifying general sequence features that affect mRNA stability rather than specific variants. I wonder if the authors have considered to shift the focus of the motivation part to reflect that?</p>

<p>We appreciated the reviewer’s suggestion. We have revised the abstract and introductions to emphasize the general UTR regulation. Here is the revised abstract:</p>
<p>UTRs contain crucial regulatory elements for RNA stability, translation and localization, so their integrity is indispensable for gene expression. Approximately 3.7% of genetic variants associated with diseases occur in UTRs, yet a comprehensive understanding of UTR variant functions remains limited due to inefficient experimental and computational assessment methods. To systematically evaluate the effects of UTR variants on RNA stability, we established a massively parallel reporter assay on 6,555 UTR variants reported in human disease databases. We examined the RNA degradation patterns mediated by the UTR library in two cell lines, and then applied LASSO regression to model the influential regulators of RNA stability. We found that UA dinucleotides and UA-rich motifs are the most prominent destabilizing element. Gain of UA dinucleotide outlined mutant UTRs with reduced stability. Studies on endogenous transcripts indicate that high UA-dinucleotide ratios in UTRs promote RNA degradation. Conversely, elevated GC content and protein binding on UA dinucleotides protect high-UA RNA from degradation. Further analysis reveals polarized roles of UA-dinucleotide-binding proteins in RNA protection and degradation. Furthermore, the UA-dinucleotide ratio of both UTRs is a common characteristic of genes in innate immune response pathways, implying a coordinated stability regulation through UTRs at the transcriptomic level. We also demonstrate that stability-altering UTRs are associated with changes in biobank-based health indices, underscoring the importance of precise UTR regulation for wellness. Our study highlights the importance of RNA stability regulation through UTR primary sequences, paving the way for further exploration of their implications in gene networks and precision medicine.</p>

<p>Plots presenting correlations (e.g., Figure 4A, 4C) are more informative when plotted as density plots (i.e., using colorscale to show density of the dots at each part of the plot).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer's insightful suggestion regarding the use of density plots for presenting correlations. We have modified Figures 4A and 4C in the revised manuscript to implement density plotting. The updated figures now utilize a colorscale that highlights areas of high and low data density.</p>
