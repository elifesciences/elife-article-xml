<title>Abstract</title><p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity (OB) are associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and increased fracture risk. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies showed that inflammation induces bone erosion and inhibits bone formation by increasing Wnt canonical pathway inhibitors. However, the impact of inflammation on Wnt pathway regulation and bone quality in T2D and OB remains unclear. To this end, we studied 63 postmenopausal women (age &gt;65 years) undergoing hip replacement for osteoarthritis. Among these women, 19 had T2D and OB (HbA1c 6.8±0.79%; BMI 29.9±5.2 kg/m2), 17 had OB but they were normoglycemic (BMI 32.5±5.4 kg/m2), and 27 served as controls (BMI 23.1±5.5 kg/m2). Serum inflammatory cytokines by automated immunoassay (ELLA), revealed higher TNF-α (p=0.0084) and lower adiponectin (p=0.0402) in T2D, and higher IL-6 (p=0.0003) levels in OB vs controls. Gene expression analysis of trabecular bone showed increased TNF-α (p=0.0019) and SFRP5 (p=0.0084) in T2D vs controls. IL-10 was lower in both T2D (p=0.0285), and OB (p=0.0324), while adiponectin (ADIPOQ) was only lower in T2D (p=0.0041) vs controls. Interestingly, the Wnt inhibitor SOST was higher in T2D (p&lt;0.0001) and OB (p&lt;0.0001) vs controls. Conversely, WNT10B mRNA levels were lower in T2D (p=0.0071) and in OB (p=0.0196) vs controls, while LEF-1 were only lower in T2D (p=0.0009). WNT5A (p=0.0025) and GSK3β (p=0.0003) mRNA levels were higher only T2D vs controls. Importantly, TNF-α mRNA levels positively correlated with SOST (r=0.5121, p=0.0002), WNT5A (r=0.3227, p=0.0396) and GSK3β (r=0.3789, p=0.0146) mRNA levels, but negatively correlated with WNT10B (r=0.3844, p=0.0188) and LEF-1(r=-0.3310, p=0.0322) mRNA levels. Conversely, IL-10 was negatively correlated with SOST mRNA levels (r=0.3100, p=0.0457). ADIPOQ was negatively correlated with SOST (r=-0.3864, p=0.0105) and WNT5A (r=-0.3025, p=0.0515) mRNA levels. Moreover, SFRP5 was negatively correlated with LEF-1 mRNA levels (r=0.3991, p=0.0131). Finally, serum levels of TNF-α (r=-0.3473, p=0.0352) and IL-6 (r=-0.3777, p=0.0302) negatively correlated with Young’s Modulus, an index of bone strength. These findings suggest that increased inflammation in bone of subjects with T2D and obesity is negatively associated with Wnt pathway and bone strength, shedding light on pathophysiology of bone impairment in T2D and obesity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity (OB) are metabolic diseases characterized by systemic chronic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. In particular, serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α are higher in T2D and OB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. This chronic inflammatory state contributes to tissue inflammation in insulin target tissues, and it is associated to long-term complications, including bone fragility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Subjects with T2D or OB have an increased risk for fractures despite normal or higher bone mineral density (BMD), suggesting a bone quality impairment. Furthermore, subjects with elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines have been linked to an increased risk of fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. However, data on the direct effect of inflammation on bone fragility in subjects with T2D or OB are lacking. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies showed that IL-6 is mainly involved in promoting osteoclastogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Moreover, IL-6 contributed to bone loss <italic>in vitro</italic>, affecting bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMCs) differentiation and cellular senescence in a model of high fat diet-induced obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. On the other hand, blocking TNF-α in bone-lining forming cells increased cell number and promoted bone formation in a model of T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Consistently, Sun M. et al. demonstrated that subjects with T2D and fractures had higher TNF-α levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Previous data showed that TNF-α promoted bone erosion and inhibited bone formation by increasing the main inhibitors of Wnt canonical pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Wnt pathway is one of the main regulators of bone metabolism. We previously showed that canonical Wnt pathway is downregulated in T2D, and it is associated with reduced bone formation markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] and reduced bone strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that increased inflammation may affect bone quality by Wnt canonical pathway in bone of postmenopausal women with T2D or obesity. Results confirmed that subjects with T2D and OB have increased bone inflammation associated with Wnt beta/catenin pathway downregulation and reduced bone strength.</p>

<title>Subject characteristics</title>
<p>Clinical characteristics of study subjects are reported in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Age and Menopausal age were not different between groups while BMI was higher in T2D and OB compared to controls (T2D: 29.98±5.77 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; OB: 32.84±2.94 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; CTRL: 23.11±2.24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, p&lt;0.0001). As expected, fasting glucose was significantly higher in T2D compared to either OB or controls [T2D: 121.8±20.59 mg/dl; OB: 101.7±10.88 mg/dl; CTRL: 94.98±8.45 mg/dl, p&lt;0.0001). T2D subjects had a mean HbA1c of 6.87±0.79% and a mean disease duration of 13.75±9.54 years. Diabetes medications included monotherapy with metformin (n=15) and combination therapy with metformin plus insulin and glinide (n=3). There were no differences in serum calcium, eGFR (CKD-EPI equation) and serum blood urea nitrogen, as well as in cholesterol values and triglycerides.</p>

<title>Adipose tissue composition and bone mass</title>
<p>All the parameters related to adipose tissue composition and bone mass are reported in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Trunk total mass was significantly higher in subjects with obesity (p&lt;0.0001) and T2D (p=0.001) compared to controls. Also, trunk fat mass was higher in OB (p=0.003) and T2D (p=0.016) compared to controls. Consistently, percent trunk fat was higher in subjects with obesity (p=0.001) and T2D (p=0.030) as compared to control subjects. Analysis of fat distribution highlighted that OB, but not T2D, had both a higher percentage of android fat (p&lt;0.0001) and of gynoid fat (p=0.022) as compared to controls. Finally, levels of VAT mass and VAT volume were significantly greater in subjects with obesity (p&lt;0.0001, respectively) and T2D (p=0.0002, respectively) compared to controls.</p>

<p>Total body bone mineral density (BMD) and T-score were not different between groups. Lumbar bone mineral density was higher in OB compared to controls (p=0.004) but not in T2D compared to controls. Lumbar T-score was also increased only in OB compared to controls (p=0.003). Femoral BMD was increased not only in OB (p=0.0005) but also in T2D (p= 0.016) compared to controls. In line, femoral T-score was higher in OB (p&lt;0.0001) and T2D (p=0.006) compared to controls.</p>

<title>Bone microarchitecture and strength</title>
<p>Microarchitecture parameters by μCT on trabecular core samples are reported in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. T2D, OB and control subjects had similar trabecular indices, including bone volume density (BV/TV), connectivity density, trabecular thickness, trabecular number, trabecular separation, tissue mineral density and volumetric BMD. Biomechanic analysis (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>) showed a reduced Young’s modulus in T2D compared to OB (p=0.0395) but not to control subjects, and a trend of reduction of Yield strength in T2D compared to OB (p=0.0552).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we showed increased circulating and bone inflammation in postmenopausal women with T2D and obesity. Specifically, we found increased TNF-α mRNA levels in bone of subjects with T2D while the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was decreased in both subjects with T2D and obesity. Importantly, increased mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines were associated with downregulation of Wnt pathway related genes. Moreover, serum TNF-α was increased in T2D compared to the other groups and it was negatively associated with bone strength.</p>
<p>The increased TNF-α serum levels in subjects with T2D observed in our study are consistent with the study of Sum et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] that reported increased TNF-α and other chemokines in T2D patients with bone fracture. There are evidence showing that inflammation may affect bone health. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies showed that TNF-α is involved in the regulation of bone resorption in inflammatory conditions either directly or by increasing RANKL and M-CSF expressions by osteoblasts, stromal cells and even osteocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Moreover, blocking TNF-α in bone-lining forming cells increased cell number and enhanced bone formation in a model of T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. In line, we found that both serum and bone TNF-α were increased in T2D, but not in subjects with obesity. Interestingly, serum TNF-α was negatively correlated with Young’s Modulus, suggesting that increased TNF-α reduces bone strength in subjects with T2D.</p>
<p>Although we confirmed that circulating IL-6 was higher in subject with obesity and it was positively correlated with VAT, we found no difference of IL-6 gene expression levels in bone tissue of either T2D or subjects with obesity. There is only evidence that IL-6 contributed to bone loss <italic>in vitro</italic>, affecting BMCs differentiation and cellular senescence in a model of high fat diet-induced obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. However, there is no data supporting the effect of inflammation in bone of subjects with obesity. In line with IL-6, gene expression of pro-inflammatory IL-8 was not altered either in bone of subjects with T2D or obesity. There is no evidence about IL-8 role in bone of either T2D or obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>On the other hand, we found that the anti-inflammatory IL-10 mRNA levels were decreased in subjects with T2D and obesity. Previous data showed that serum levels of IL-10 were substantially lower in osteoporosis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] and in T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] than in healthy individuals, although to our knowledge, the role of IL-10 on bone of T2D or obesity has not been studied. As expected, both serum and mRNA bone adiponectin levels were lower in T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies indicated that adiponectin promoted osteoblastogenesis, whilst simultaneously inhibiting osteoclastogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] and adiponectin knockout mice have increased bone mass and osteoblast numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Moreover, serum adiponectin in postmenopausal women was found inversely associated with bone mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. However, there are no data about adiponectin in bone of subjects with T2D or obesity. We also showed that subjects with T2D had increased SFRP5 bone mRNA levels compared to controls. Data reported that SFRP5, a negative regulator of Wnt canonical signaling pathway, was overexpressed in osteoporosis and was also associated to downregulated bone formation markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Our data are in line with these findings, supporting that T2D is characterized by low bone formation and downregulated Wnt canonical signaling.</p>
<p>Previous studies showed that inflammation may downregulate Wnt signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], the main regulator of bone metabolism. Consistent with our previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], we observed that the expression of the Wnt inhibitor SOST was not only higher in bone of T2D but also in subjects with obesity compared to controls. Even though sclerostin is increased during weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], there are other data showing that serum sclerostin was negatively associated to insulin sensitivity in women with obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Conversely, our data showed that SOST mRNA levels were positively correlated with fasting blood glucose in subjects with obesity suggesting that glucose impairment may be a determinant for higher sclerostin levels. Consistent with increased SOST mRNA levels and in line with our previous findings on Wnt signaling regulation in bone of T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], the expression of the Wnt ligand WNT10B and the transcription factor LEF-1 were downregulated in both subjects with T2D and obesity. Also, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showed that TNF-α induced the phosphorylation of GSK3β, the deactivated form of GSK3β, which increased nuclear β-catenin and Lef-1 resulting in downregulated Wnt signaling and reduced bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].Our data confirmed that GSK3βB is increased in subjects with T2D. This is in line with our previous findings in which GSK3β was associated with reduced bone formation and strength in T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is shown that Wnt5a promotes inflammation and insulin resistance in adipose tissue of human and animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] and high circulating levels of Wnt5a are detected in subjects with T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Other studies showed that Wnt5a inhibits Wnt3a protein by downregulating beta/catenin-induced reporter gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. In line, we observed that gene expression of WNT5A was increased in bone of T2D. This study has some limitations. It is a cross-sectional design with a relatively small number of enrolled subjects.</p>
<p>The main strength of the study is that we investigated for the first time the effect of inflammation on human bone samples measuring several pro and anti-inflammatory genes. Moreover, we found the association between inflammation and bone strength by the regulation of Wnt signaling pathway in subjects with T2D and obesity compared to a control population.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study showed that there is increased inflammation in bone of subjects with T2D and obesity and it is associated with the downregulation of Wnt signaling and reduced bone strength. These results shed light on the pathophysiology of bone impairment in T2D and obesity and may help understanding the mechanisms of bone fragility in metabolic diseases.</p>

<p>This is a <bold>convincing</bold> paper that addresses topics <bold>important</bold> in our understanding of how inflammatory markers are modulated in both obesity and type 2 diabetes and their effects on Wnt signaling mediators in human bone. There are changes in bone at the tissue level in these 2 common metabolic disorders that ultimately lead to compromised bone strength. These data will be critical to our understanding of the pathophysiology of skeletal fragility in obesity and diabetes.</p>

<p>This is a well-done clinical study which provides new information on the effects of metabolic disturbances in the human skeleton. 63 postmenopausal women undergoing hip arthroplasty, consisting of T2D with obesity; obesity alone; and neither T2D nor obesity were studied. Most of the findings relate to T2D. Increased serum TNF-α was found in T2D, as well as increased bone gene expression of TNF- α, which was associated with reduced expression of Wnt pathway genes. mRNA levels of certain of the cytokines correlated with Wnt signaling components. In addition, the increased serum TNF- α in T2D was associated with reduced Young's modulus, a measure of bone strength. A strength of this paper is that it provides information in an area that is not well-understood. However, there are a number of concerns that warrant direct addressing.</p>
<p>(1) Can the authors speculate why the changes in cytokines and Wnt expression do not impact bone microarchitecture?</p>
<p>(2) The authors state that they are showing an association between inflammation and bone strength via the regulation of Wnt signaling. However they have only shown here that serum cytokines correlate with bone strength. It is true that the authors have previously shown that Wnt signaling correlated with bone strength. But here it would be useful to show if bone strength is also correlated with inflammatory genes.</p>
<p>(3) AGEs increase inflammation (by binding to RAGE which triggers an inflammatory cascade). AGEs might also increase SOST. From their previous work, it seems that the authors have bone AGE measures on these patients and they have shown their relationship with SOST. Do the increased AGEs relate to inflammation as measured by serum and bone expression?</p>
<p>(4) Were bone turnover markers done to show how the inflammation and Wnt findings relate to bone resorption and formation?</p>
<p>(5) RNA integrity values should be reported to confirm that the RNA has not degraded.</p>
<p>(6) The discussion of adiponectin could be clearer (studies are cited that show both positive and negative effects). Please clarify that adiponectin effects on bone are complex and what they are.</p>
<p>(7) Were patients excluded for prior as well as current antiresorptive medication use?</p>
<p>(8) Fig 4A. correlation between SOST mRNA and TNF-a mRNA seems to be driven by 1 outlier. Does the relationship persist if it is removed?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Chronic inflammation of the bone microenvironment conferred by T2DM and obesity may inhibit bone formation and bone strength by decreasing the ratio of Wnt ligands/Wnt inhibitors.</p>
<p>The authors studied 63 postmenopausal women (age &gt;65 years) undergoing hip replacement for osteoarthritis. These were grouped into T2DM and obesity, obesity only, and normal subjects. A set of inflammatory markers was measured in the serum and gene expression of members of the Wnt system in the bone tissue. Bone samples were assessed by micro-CT.</p>
<p>While TNF-α serum levels were higher in T2DM, IL-6 levels were higher in obesity as compared to control. In the bone compartment the most consistent finding was decreased mRNA levels for WNt10b and increased sclerostin mRNA levels, translating into a suppressed Wnt-to-Wnt inhibitor ratio, which was associated with low bone strength.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study includes clinically well-characterized subjects of three defined subgroups. The analyses were comprehensive.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Including data or information on the Wnt inhibitor Dkk1 would be instructive. Analysis were limited to mRNA studies. Validation of protein levels would be supportive (although technically challenging).</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors examine circulating and bone parameters in patients with T2DM or obesity vs control subjects. Based on their findings they conclude that increased inflammation in bone of subjects with T2DM and obesity is negatively correlated with Wnt pathway signaling and bone strength.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a well done clinical study that provides further insights into the pathogenesis of bone loss associated with T2DM. However, there are a number of issues that the authors should address:</p>
<p>(1) The major conceptual problem is that the alterations in circulating and bone factors they observed would predominantly affect bone turnover and thus, bone mass. But bone mass is preserved in T2DM (as their own data show). They postulate that their findings lead to impaired bone quality, but it is not clear how this would occur. For example, the impairment in bone quality could be due to the accumulation of AGEs in bone in T2DM, and the correlations observed be true but unrelated. Along these lines, were serum or bone AGEs measured - and if not, is it possible for the authors to do so? At the least, this issue should be fully addressed in the Discussion if the authors are unable to provide additional data to address this.</p>
<p>(2) The T2DM patients were extremely well controlled. This may have limited some of the differences between groups. Was it not possible to select a group of less well-controlled patients - that is more the norm? This may also explain why the biomechanical indices in Table 3 were only marginally different in the T2DM vs the other groups. This point should also be addressed.</p>
<p>(3) The authors found some interesting differences in bone sclerostin levels. Were circulating sclerostin levels measured? This data would be of interest and should be provided.</p>
<p>(4) Fig 4A - the correlation between TNFa and SOST seems to be driven by one highly influential point. What happens if this point is removed? Is this point a formal statistical outlier? Please check this.</p>
