<title>Abstract</title><p>Monitoring GABAergic inhibition in the nervous system has been enabled by development of an intensiometric molecular sensor that directly detects GABA. However, the first generation iGABASnFR exhibits low signal-to-noise and suboptimal kinetics, making in vivo experiments challenging. To improve sensor performance, we targeted several sites in the protein for near-saturation mutagenesis and evaluated the resulting sensor variants in a high throughput screening system using evoked synaptic release in primary cultured neurons. This identified a sensor variant, iGABASnFR2, with 4.2-fold improved sensitivity and 20% faster kinetics, and binding affinity that remained in a range sensitive to changes in GABA concentration at synapses. We also identified sensors with an inverted response, decreasing fluorescence intensity upon GABA binding. We termed the best such negative-going sensor iGABASnFR2n, which can be used to corroborate observations with the positive-going sensor. These improvements yielded a qualitative enhancement of in vivo performance when compared directly to the original sensor. iGABASnFR2 enabled the first measurements of direction-selective GABA release in the retina. In vivo imaging in somatosensory cortex revealed that iGABASnFR2 can report volume-transmitted GABA release following whisker stimulation. Overall, the improved sensitivity and kinetics of iGABASnFR2 make it a more effective tool for imaging GABAergic transmission in intact neural circuits.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genetically encoded neurotransmitter sensors have significantly advanced neuroscience by enabling direct, real-time monitoring of neurotransmitter dynamics. These tools have facilitated the study of synaptic transmission, input-output relationships within individual neurons, and large-scale network activity. Among these, genetically encoded sensors for GABA are particularly desirable due to the inherent challenges of detecting inhibitory signaling. GABAergic neurotransmission plays a crucial role in shaping neural circuit dynamics and maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition across the brain. Disruptions in GABAergic signaling have been implicated in neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism, highlighting the importance of developing sensitive tools to study inhibitory transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sohal &amp; Rubenstein 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there are other techniques to measure GABA levels in the brain, they are limited in their sensitivity and/or spatiotemporal resolution. Microdialysis allows direct, quantitative measurement of extracellular GABA, even in human patients, but its temporal resolution is restricted to the scale of minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">van der Zeyden et al. 2008</xref>). Electrophysiological approaches, while offering high sensitivity and temporal precision, do not scale to large neuronal populations and cannot independently distinguish GABAergic signaling from other hyperpolarizing currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Macdonald &amp; Olsen 1994</xref>). These limitations underscore the need for improved genetically encoded fluorescent sensors capable of resolving GABA dynamics with greater sensitivity, specificity, and temporal resolution.</p>
<p>We previously developed an intensity-based <underline>GABA S</underline>e<underline>n</underline>sing <underline>F</underline>luorescent <underline>R</underline>eporter, iGABASnFR, that increases fluorescence in the presence of GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Marvin et al. 2019</xref>), from here on referred to as iGABASnFR1. Like many sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Marvin et al. 2011</xref>), this design used a periplasmic binding protein from bacteria as the ligand binding domain, in this case Pf622 from the bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>. A circularly permuted superfolder GFP (cpSFGFP) was then inserted at a site that supports fluorescence changes associated with GABA binding, and the protein was given trafficking sequences to localize it to the membrane. While this sensor enabled optical monitoring of GABAergic activity, its sensitivity and dynamic range remained limited compared to extensively optimized sensors like jGCaMP and iGluSnFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhang et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aggarwal et al. 2023</xref>). In neuronal culture, the original iGABASnFR1 exhibited a half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of ∼30 µM and maximal ΔF/F of ∼0.6. A binding pocket mutation (F102G) increased the maximal ΔF/F of the sensor but at the cost of an increased EC<sub>50</sub> and poor membrane localization. As such, the overall performance of iGABASnFR1 was not well-suited for high-resolution, photon-limited imaging applications.</p>
<p>To address these limitations, we used site-directed mutagenesis to engineer two next-generation GABA sensors, iGABASnFR2 and iGABASnFR2n. These sensors exhibit improved sensitivities and affinities for GABA, with positive- and negative-going fluorescence responses, respectively. Here, we describe the development and characterization of these enhanced GABA sensors and demonstrate their application in imaging inhibitory neurotransmission.</p>

<title>Screening for improved variants</title>
<p>The original iGABASnFR1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, top) was engineered to increase fluorescence in the presence of GABA, and express robustly in mammalian neurons, making it a valuable addition to the suite of biosensors available to study the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Marvin et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Looger &amp; Griesbeck 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dong et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Yang et al. 2024</xref>). However, iGABASnFR1 is a first-generation sensor, with low sensitivity in vivo, particularly in comparison to other sensors such as jGCaMP and iGluSnFR, which have been subjected to multiple generations of engineering. Consequently, we applied the same screening pipeline used to optimize jGCaMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wardill et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhang et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dana et al. 2016</xref>) to the task of improving iGABASnFR performance. This pipeline uses field stimulation to evoke activity of cultured primary neurons expressing different sensor variants. Stimulation elicits synaptic release, allowing us to screen for improved sensor performance by measuring response amplitude and kinetics (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), in an experimental setting that approximates in vivo conditions.</p>

</fig>
<p>Sensor variants were derived by near-saturation mutagenesis of selected sites within the protein, and performance evaluated in a first round of screening. To select improved variants, we jointly optimized for both the ΔF/F of the sensor and its expression levels. Screening for expression was necessary because in our previous effort to engineer iGABASnFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Marvin et al. 2019</xref>), we discovered several mutations, most notably, F102G, that increased the maximal ΔF/F but exhibited expression problems in neurons, with low baseline fluorescence and intracellular aggregates. We quantified the expression levels of different variants by counting the total number of pixels in a well that showed a significant increase in fluorescence during the field stimulation period. These pixels were classified as responsive pixels.</p>
<p>To guide our site-selection efforts, we used the unliganded crystal structure of a preliminary version of iGABASnFR <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6dgv">https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6dgv</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Marvin et al. 2019</xref>), a strategy that worked well for optimizing GCaMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akerboom et al. 2009</xref>). Specifically, we identified 39 sites to target: 14 near the GABA binding site, 6 at or around the protein hinge area, 10 on the cpSFGFP and 9 at the interface between the two ligand-binding and cpGFP domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, bottom).</p>
<p>In the first round of screening, these 39 sites were targeted for mutagenesis, generating 9±5 substitutions at each site (range: 1 to 19) for a total of 3947 variants. Sensor variants were arrayed in 96-well plates, with each plate containing 4 replicate wells of the same variant, and 8 replicate wells of the original iGABASnFR, which served as part of our quality control measures. Each well received 1, 10 and 40 field stimulation pulses separated by 12 ms, and we calculated responses by averaging fluorescence changes over all the responsive pixels in each well. We found 93 mutants with ΔF/F significantly higher than in-plate iGABASnFR1 controls and 22 of those also had a higher fraction of responsive pixels than iGABASnFR, indicating improved expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Interestingly, at least 20 sequence-confirmed mutations, located in 5 different positions - R168<sub>Pf</sub>, D276<sub>Pf</sub>, T203<sub>gfp</sub>, V150<sub>gfp</sub> and V272<sub>Pf</sub> - inverted the response of the sensor, making it decrease in fluorescence with field stimulation (number refers to location in the protein domain denoted by subscript, either cpSFGFP or the ligand binding Pf622). However, none of the inverted sensors exhibited |ΔF/F| greater than that of iGABASnFR. Among them, the R168<sub>gfp</sub>P mutant was the most promising, with relatively high ΔF/F (0.6x of iGABASnFR) and expression (2x responsive pixels of iGABASnFR; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>
<p>Although we found many marginally improved variants in the first round of screening, there was no clear winner that could be considered to be a major improvement over iGABASnFR. The most sensitive positive-going mutant in the screen was the previously known mutation F102<sub>Pf</sub>G (ΔF/F 2.5x of iGABASnFR) which was confirmed to have poor expression (0.3x responsive pixels of iGABASnFR). Similarly, the top-expressing mutant in the screen (L178<sub>gfp</sub>Y; 14.8x responsive pixels of iGABASnFR) had only a modest ΔF/F (1.1x of iGABASnFR). Therefore, in the first round of screening, we succeeded in improving ΔF/F and expression separately but not jointly.</p>

<title>Enhancing performance with combinations of single site mutants</title>
<p>We hypothesized that we could generate variants with both improved sensitivity and expression by combining mutations that conveyed each property separately. To test this, the mutations S99<sub>Pf</sub>→A/G/C, F102<sub>Pf</sub>→G/Y, F104<sub>Pf</sub>→Y/H, R168<sub>gfp</sub>→P, L178<sub>gfp</sub>→R/S, and K253<sub>Pf</sub>→I/Y (labeled in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> as plus signs) were chosen based on their performance in the first round and combined to create 635 double mutants, which were then screened in a second round. A large percentage of these mutants (49%) did not pass quality control to be considered for further analysis. The majority of these mutants had poor expression, no detectable response to field stimulation, or both. Of the remaining mutants, 52 exhibited improved expression and ΔF/F over iGABASnFR. More importantly, 27 mutants exhibited ΔF/F higher than F102<sub>Pf</sub>G and expression better than iGABASnFR, suggesting that our hypothesis was correct and the beneficial properties of the mutants could be additive. Interestingly, many of the mutations that improved ΔF/F and expression in positive-going sensors, did the same in negative-going sensors.</p>
<p>Of these variants, the best combination of dynamic range and expression was the mutant iGABASnFR.S99<sub>Pf</sub>A.F102<sub>Pf</sub>Y.F104<sub>Pf</sub>Y.L178<sub>gfp</sub>S, (hereafter iGABASnFR2). The best variant with inverted signal, iGABASnFR.S99<sub>Pf</sub>A.F104<sub>Pf</sub>H.R168<sub>gfp</sub>P was designated iGABASnFR2n (for <underline>n</underline>egative-going). When we quantified rise time, peak ΔF/F and signal-to-noise, iGABASnFR2 performance was broadly superior to the original across all field stimulation conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). For 10 action potentials (APs), iGABASnFR2 exhibited a peak ΔF/F 4.2-fold greater than iGABASnFR1 (iGABASnFR2 0.80 ± 0.12; iGABASnFR1 0.19 ± 0.02; p = 6.41e-28 Tukey’s HSD post hoc test following one-way ANOVA), and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 3-fold higher (iGABASnFR2 70.5 ± 10.7; iGABASnFR1 23.6 ± 5.7; p = 6.37e-23). Rise times were slightly faster (iGABASnFR2 38 ± 10 ms; iGABASnFR1 47 ± 21 ms; p = 0.13). The negative-going iGABASnFR2n exhibited slightly reduced performance relative to iGABASnFR2, but still achieved a 3.2-fold greater peak ΔF/F (iGABASnFR2n 0.61 ± 0.12; iGABASnFR1 0.19 ± 0.02; p = 2.50e-19), and 30% higher SNR compared to iGABASnFR1 (iGABASnFR2n 30.2 ± 10.0; iGABASnFR1 23.6 ± 5.7; p = 0.06). However, its kinetics were slower, with a rise time of 71 ± 10 ms. These measures clearly indicate that this next generation of GABASnFRs exhibit broadly improved performance in detecting GABA dynamics during synaptic release.</p>

<title>Structure of the iGABASnFR2-GABA complex</title>
<p>To gain some insight into the structure-function relationship of this sensor, we solved the crystal structure of iGABASnFR2 in complex with GABA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). To examine the conformational changes that accompany GABA binding, we compared this new liganded structure with the apo-form of a precursor of the original iGABASnFR (PDB ID 6DGV). Superimposing the structures, using cpGFP as a reference, revealed that the two lobes of the Venus flytrap domain in Pf622 shift closer together to secure GABA in the binding pocket (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). This conformational change resembles those seen in other bacterial periplasmic amino acid-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Quiocho &amp; Ledvina 1996</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The hinge region of Pf622, which connects the two lobes, likely plays a key role in allosteric modulation of ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Telmer &amp; Shilton 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Marvin &amp; Hellinga 2001</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Marvin et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Planamente et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Planamente et al. 2010</xref>). Within that hinge region, the F101L mutation, introduced in the original iGABASnFR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Marvin et al. 2019</xref>), increased binding affinity 10-fold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Also in the hinge region, residue S99 forms hydrogen bonds with the OD2 atom of D59 and NE2 atom of Q17, while the S99A mutation in iGABASnFR2 abolishes these interactions, potentially making the hinge region more flexible.</p>
<p>The GABA binding site itself is defined by the side chains of W9, T13, F100, Y102, W202, R205, D228, and Y264 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). In iGABASnFR2, two mutations near the ligand binding site enhance interactions: F102Y forms a hydrogen bond via its hydroxyl group with D228, which, in turn, makes a hydrogen bond with the GABA amino group. And F104Y, while farther from the binding site, helps position W202 to interact with GABA through van der Waals forces. These likely contribute to the increased affinity for GABA we describe below.</p>
<p>Mutations at the interface between the ligand-binding domain and cpGFP modulate ligand-binding-induced fluorescence changes in many sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akerboom et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhang et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ding et al. 2014</xref>). In iGABASnFR2, the L178<sub>gfp</sub>S mutation at this interface is likely involved in a hydrogen-bonding network with nearby hydrophilic residues, enhancing the GABA-induced fluorescence change (Supplementary Fig. 1B). The N260A mutation in iGABASnFR1 eliminates side chain hydrogen bonding, removes a cryptic N-linked glycosylation site (N-X-S/T), and enhances protein expression. Another critical mutation, F145<sub>gfp</sub>W, introduced in the original iGABASnFR1 to improve ΔF/F0, interacts directly with the hydroxyl group in the chromophore and surrounding residues.</p>
<p>Interestingly, although the Venus flytrap domain undergoes significant conformational changes upon GABA binding, cpGFP and its flanking linkers (along with up to four adjacent residues) do not show notable conformational changes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). The structural difference between the unliganded and liganded forms shows a root mean square deviation of only 0.25 Å. This finding contrasts with observations in GCaMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhang et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akerboom et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Akerboom et al. 2012</xref>), where calcium binding to calmodulin induces substantial conformational changes at the interface, contributing to the large change in fluorescence with this sensor. These differences suggest a potential strategy to further enhance the performance of iGABASnFR2.</p>

<title>Biochemical Characterization</title>
<p>For <italic>in vivo</italic> applications, the effectiveness of the sensor depends on both its affinity for GABA, as well as the kinetics of GABA binding. Sensor affinity should not be so high that it is saturated by tonic levels of GABA in the brain, but should of course be in a range sensitive to the changes in concentration achieved during synaptic release. In mammals, extrasynaptic GABA concentrations lie in the low micromolar range (0.2–2.5 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Roth &amp; Draguhn 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Glykys &amp; Mody 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lerma et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Tossman et al. 1986</xref>), while synaptically released GABA can transiently reach low millimolar concentrations (∼1.5–3 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Roth &amp; Draguhn 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mozrzymas et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barberis et al. 2004</xref>). The half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of iGABASnFR1 when it is expressed on the surface of neurons is 30 μM, so increasing sensor affinity could potentially lead to improved performance <italic>in vivo</italic> without contaminating signal from tonic GABA levels. However, kinetics are also important - the rapid changes in GABA concentration during synaptic release mean that sensor kinetics have to be fast enough to detect the change before GABA concentrations drop back down due to re-uptake and diffusion.</p>
<p>We first determined sensor affinities by titrating GABA concentration while monitoring fluorescence of purified protein. Somewhat surprisingly, purified iGABASnFR2 showed a smaller dynamic range than iGABASnFR1, although its affinity was higher (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>; max dF/F0 iGABASnFR2: 0.45, iGABASnFR1: 1.82; EC<sub>50</sub> iGABASnFR2 = 1.1 μM, iGABASnFR1 = 5.7 μM).</p>

<p>It also displayed high selectivity for GABA over structurally related compounds (<xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 – figure supplement 1</xref>), none of which interfered with GABA binding (<xref rid="figs4_2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 – figure supplement 2</xref>). Previous work with iGluSnFR showed that titrations with purified protein can exhibit different affinity values than when expressed on the membrane of cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aggarwal et al. 2023</xref>). The origins of this discrepancy are not clear, however on-cell titrations are closer to the operating environment of the sensor and are likely the more accurate predictor of <italic>in vivo</italic> performance. We found that on cells the half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of iGABASnFR2 was 6.4 ± 0.21 μM, a 7-fold higher affinity than iGABASnFR1 and 22-fold higher than iGABASnFR.F102<sub>Pf</sub>G (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). So the improved performance we observed likely stems, in part, from this increased on-cell affinity, which nevertheless remains above background levels of GABA measured in the mammalian brain.</p>
<p>We examined sensor kinetics to step changes in GABA concentration using stopped-flow measurements. Relative to iGABASnFR1, the observed reaction rate constants were far greater for both iGABASnFR2 and iGABASnFR2n (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). iGABASnFR1 exhibits biphasic kinetics, with a relatively fast initial change compounded with a much longer phase before sensor saturation is reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Marvin et al. 2019</xref>). In contrast, both iGABASnFR2 and iGABASnFR2n kinetics were accurately captured by fitting with a single exponential function, indicating a less complex relationship between ligand binding and changes in fluorescence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Although significantly faster than the first version, the kinetics of iGABASnFR2 and 2n are still slower than iGluSnFR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aggarwal et al. 2023</xref>), suggesting further improvements in sensor performance would be possible if kinetics could be accelerated.</p>
<p>The 1p and 2p spectra of all sensors were similar (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4e,f</xref>), as were their apparent pKa values (<xref rid="figs4_3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 - fig. supp. 3</xref>); additional biophysical properties are reported in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Overall, both kinetic and thermodynamic observations suggest that iGABASnFR2 and 2n offer a major improvement in sensing GABA over the previously available sensor.

<title>Evaluating Sensor Performance in Intact Retina</title>
<p>To evaluate indicator performance in an intact neural circuit, we examined synaptic transmission in the retina. GABAergic inhibition is believed to play a pivotal role in generating direction- selective responses to motion in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Briggman et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yonehara et al. 2011</xref>). Direction-selectivity is thought to originate in starburst amacrine cells (SACs), which extend radially symmetric dendrites from a centrally located soma. Inputs to SACs are sprinkled across the entire dendritic arbor, while the outputs are confined to varicosities located near the dendritic tips.</p>
<p>Motion-selectivity is proposed to arise from differential GABA release. Specifically, the hypothesis is that GABA release is stronger when a visual stimulus moves so that excitation sweeps down the dendritic branch from root to tip (centrifugal motion) rather than when it sweeps from tip to root (centripetal motion) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). The resulting direction-selective inhibition is relayed to direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) through asymmetric synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Briggman et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yonehara et al. 2011</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). By inhibiting DSGC responses to motion in the null direction, SAC inputs ensure that DSGC output is highly selective for motion in the preferred direction, which is subsequently transmitted to the brain.</p>

<p>Notably, the evidence for this centrifugal selectivity has been obtained by electrophysiological membrane potential recording and two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging from starburst cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Euler et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Vaney et al. 2012</xref>). Direct evidence for direction-selective GABA release has been lacking, and imaging GABA release from the starburst cell dendrites would provide important confirmation of the origin of retinal direction selectivity.</p>
<p>We virally transfected starburst amacrine cells with iGABASnFR1 or iGABASnFR2, using a Cre-Lox system for cellular specificity. 6-8 weeks after injection, we dissected retinae and performed two-photon imaging, analyzing activity within small fields of view expected to contain multiple release sites on the amacrine cell dendrites.</p>
<p>We first tested whether we could detect responses to light flashes with a 500 μm spot that covered the entire field of view. iGABASnFR1 showed weak but measurable signals to this full-field stimulation, although detecting responses on single trials was challenging. However, when presented with moving dots, the weak signal made it very difficult to detect direction selectivity, even after trial-averaging. By contrast, iGABASnFR2 responses to static flashes were large enough to be detected on single trials, and robust direction-selectivity of GABA release was readily observed in response to motion stimuli.</p>
<p>We quantified the quality of the signals by computing two measures: 1) response amplitude index (RAI), which denotes the light-evoked response strength and 2) response reliability, which reflects trial-to-trial variance (Methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baden et al. 2016</xref>). Overall, both the response amplitudes and the reliability of the responses were significantly higher with iGABASnFR2 than with iGABASnFR1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i,j</xref>). In particular, response reliability was much improved in iGABASnFR2 (mean ± SD iGABASnFR2: 0.66 ± 0.14; iGABASnFR: 0.41 ± 0.11), indicating that this sensor reveals activity that previously would have been below detection threshold.</p>
<p>We also examined the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the responses to motion, comparing response amplitude to the variance of signals at baseline. Compared with iGABASnFR1 signals, iGABASnFR2 signals had significantly higher SNR with both larger signals and lower variance of the baseline (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5k,l</xref>). The improved SNR and higher response reliability across trials resulted in stable motion responses with lower circular variance (CV; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5m</xref>), yielding better direction selectivity measurements overall. Overall, the improved performance of iGABASnFR2 not only enabled us to detect more responses but also provided a more accurate measure of GABA release evoked by visual motion, directly demonstrating that starburst cells release GABA in a direction-selective manner.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Sensor Performance at Individual Cell Axons and in vivo</title>
<p>As a first step toward in vivo application, we tested whether iGABASnFR could detect GABA release from single interneuron activation in brain slices. We expressed either iGABASnFR1 or iGABASnFR2 in hippocampal neurons, using viral delivery in mice to obtain acute slices (viral titre 0.1E10), or by biolistic transfection in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (see Methods). We performed simultaneous two-photon imaging and whole cell recordings of individual interneurons, using an intracellular dye to trace their axons and identify presumptive presynaptic boutons. Once individual boutons were identified, we triggered brief bursts of action potentials and monitored iGABASnFR signals using a rapid spiral (“Tornado”) scanning approach previously developed for imaging glutamate sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jensen et al. 2019</xref>). In interneurons expressing iGABASnFR1, we were unable to detect any spike-evoked fluorescence signals, despite conducting 15 trials per cell across five separate experiments (example in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). In contrast, iGABASnFR2-expressing cells consistently displayed evoked signals at individual axonal boutons (although obtaining a signal-to-noise ratio &gt;3 might require 5-10 trial averaging; example in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We next sought to detect GABA release signals in vivo. In vivo imaging of GABA transients poses additional challenges due to overlapping biological and instrumental noise sources, making detection at single boutons more difficult than in quiescent brain slices. However, GABA released from interneuron bursts can diffuse tens of microns from its release sites, generating extracellular “volume-transmitted” signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Oláh et al. 2009</xref>). These GABA waves have previously been detected with iGABASnFR2 in brain slices during highly synchronized, pathological network discharges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Magloire et al. 2023</xref>). Here we tested whether iGABASnFR2 could resolve volume-transmitted GABA release in response to physiological sensory stimulation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>We focused our imaging on areas of thalamocortical input in the barrel cortex L1-L3, and applied rhythmic whisker stimulation (RWS), a paradigm known to evoke reliable Ca²⁺ signals in thalamocortical axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Petreanu et al. 2012</xref>), also shown in our own prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Henneberger et al. 2020</xref>). Following expression of AAV9-hSyn-iGABASnFR2 in cortical neurons, a brief RWS protocol (four 20 Hz air puffs over 200 ms) consistently triggered robust fluorescence increases across a ∼150 µm-wide area in the barrel cortex layers L2-L3 (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>, or L1-L2 layers, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> – Figure Supplement 1). Fluorescence changes were clearly visible across sensor-expressing neuronal processes, consistent with the interpretation that these are volume transmitted signals generated by interneurons. Based on prior calibration of iGABASnFR2 in brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Magloire et al. 2023</xref>), the observed ΔF/F₀ corresponds to a transient extracellular GABA concentration increase of approximately 2–2.5 µM at peak.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we report an improved GABASnFR, developed using a high throughput mutagenesis and screening pipeline that has previously been used to optimize calcium indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wardill et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dana et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhang et al. 2023</xref>). Despite the fact that only 20% of primary cultured neurons are expected to be inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wonders &amp; Anderson 2006</xref>), this pipeline was still capable of identifying improved sensor variants. iGABASnFR2 has a 7-fold increase in affinity for GABA, as well as a 20% increase in kinetics compared to the first-generation sensor. Importantly, sensor affinity remains in a range where it is not likely to be saturated by tonic levels of GABA. Additionally, the improved kinetics make it more likely the sensor can capture the rapid changes in GABA concentration that occur at the synaptic cleft as GABA is released and rapidly reuptaken.</p>
<p>The throughput of the screening platform made it possible to target 39 different sites in the protein for saturation mutagenesis. Such an extensive screen was important to get enough coverage that many sites with relatively small improvements could be combined to derive an overall more effective sensor. Of the 39 sites targeted, we found 12 mutations across 6 sites that contributed to improved sensor performance or expression. However, no single mutation produced an especially large improvement in performance. It was particularly challenging to identify single site variants with both strong expression and high signal-to-noise. Fortunately, many of the single site mutations interacted additively when combined. However, it was also the case that many double mutant combinations failed to pass our basic quality control standards, which may indicate that the combinations resulted in a failed, non-fluorescent sensor. Whether higher-order combinations can realistically yield sensors with improved performance remains an open question—functional variants may prove even more rare when more mutations are combined, and/or the increase in performance may come in smaller increments as higher order combinations are produced.</p>
<p>No single mutation produced an especially large improvement in performance. Identifying singlesite variants with both strong expression and high signal-to-noise was particularly challenging. Many of the single-site mutations interacted additively when combined. Still, numerous double mutant combinations failed to pass basic quality control standards, possibly indicating that the combinations produced non-functional, non-fluorescent sensors. Whether higher-order combinations can realistically yield sensors with improved performance remains an open question—functional variants may become even rarer as more mutations are added, and any performance gains may diminish with each additional layer of complexity.</p>
<p>The extensive screening also enabled the serendipitous discovery of negative-going sensors. Of course positive- and negative-going variants cannot be combined in a single experiment because they are the same color. However, in experiments where precisely timed GABA release is expected, replicating an observation with sensors of different polarities could increase confidence in a result, especially given that signal-to-noise remains below that of other sensors such as GCaMP and iGluSnFR.</p>
<p>There are several promising avenues that could be taken to further optimize iGABASnFR. First, although several sites contributed small improvements in sensor performance, we did not attempt to go much beyond two-site combinations in this study, so higher order combinations are one straightforward route to further optimization. Second, sensor expression is evidently an aspect which could be improved. We attempted to capture this in our screening criteria by measuring the fraction of responsive pixels for each variant. However this partly conflates the amplitude of the sensor’s signal with its expression level, and a more direct measure of expression would be preferable. Thirdly, trafficking the sensor efficiently to the membrane is likely another point of improvement. In work with iGluSnFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aggarwal et al. 2023</xref>) and eLACCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Nasu et al. 2023</xref>), a panel of different transmembrane anchors were evaluated for sensor localization, and some were found to be more effective than the PDGFR domain that anchors iGABASnFR2. Finally, the high throughput of our screening pipeline may provide sufficient training data that machine learning approaches used to further optimize jGCaMP8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wait et al. 2024</xref>) can be applied to iGABASnFR.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the improvements we identified resulted in a qualitative advance in the ability to detect inhibition in the retina. While the first-generation sensor showed some signal, direction-selective inhibition was reliably detectable on single trials only with iGABASnFR2. This sensor has also been used to detect inhibitory transmission during epileptiform activity in hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Magloire et al. 2023</xref>). These are strong signals, but we showed that iGABASnFR2 is sensitive enough to detect GABA release triggered by activation of single neurons in brain slices—a critical benchmark for in vivo applicability. In intact animals, the sensor reported GABA release in somatosensory cortex in response to physiological sensory stimulation. These signals reflect relatively slow volume-transmitted extracellular GABA &quot;waves&quot; that result from spatiotemporal summation and dissipation of multiple GABA hotspots generated by rapid GABA release at individual synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Oláh et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boddum et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sylantyev et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pavlov et al. 2014</xref>). Although we did not distinguish synaptic from extrasynaptic GABA in this study, further improvements in kinetics and signal-to-noise may be needed to reliably resolve synaptic events and broaden the utility of the sensor for more demanding in vivo applications. Even in its current form, however, iGABASnFR2 is well suited for contexts where GABA signals are spatially integrated or temporally averaged, such as photometry or strong population-level activity. Given the longstanding difficulty of directly visualizing inhibitory signaling in the brain, we anticipate that these improved sensors will serve as valuable tools for the neuroscience community.</p>

<title>Mutagenesis</title>
<p>Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using overlapping PCR amplicons with degenerate oligonucleotide primers (NNS). A single-site NNS library (n=96) was created for each amino acid residue of interest and cloned using Gibson assembly. Subsequently, top single-site variants (12 mutations across 6 AA sites) were assembled using overlapping amplicons to achieve all possible combinations of mutations (n= 635 sequence verified variants). For neuronal screening, iGABASnFR variants were cloned into an expression vector containing the CAG promoter, the variant of interest, and finally a woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE).</p>

<title>Neuronal cell culture</title>
<p>The primary rat culture procedure was performed largely as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dana et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wardill et al. 2013</xref>). Briefly, neonatal rat pups (Charles River Laboratory) were euthanized and neocortices were dissociated and processed to form a cell pellet. Cells were resuspended and transfected by combining 5x10<sup>5</sup> viable cells with 400 ng plasmid DNA and nucleofection solution in a 25 µL electroporation cuvette (Lonza). Electroporation of iGABASnFR mutants was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Typically, 8 wells in a 96-well plate were electroporated with iGABASnFR1 control, and 18 different mutants were electroporated into 4 wells each for a total of 80 wells. The first and last columns of the plate were not used because pilot experiments indicated that cells grown in these wells exhibited poor health.</p>

<sec id="s4a3">
<title>Field stimulation assay</title>
<p>The field stimulation assay was adapted from our existing GECI screening pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dana et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dana et al. 2019</xref>). Neurons were plated onto poly-D-lysine-coated, 96-well, glass bottom plates (MatTek) at ∼1x10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in 100 µL of a 1:4 mixture of NbActiv4 (BrainBits) and plating medium (28 mM glucose, 2.4 mM NaHCO3, 100 µg/mL transferrin, 25 µg/mL insulin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 10 µg/mL streptomycin, 10% FBS in MEM), and placed in an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. On the following day, 190 µL of NbActiv4 medium was added to each well, and incubation continued for a total of 12-15 days.</p>
<p>For imaging, neuronal culture growth medium was exchanged three times with imaging buffer (145 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2) and imaged in 75 µL of imaging buffer and drugs (10 µM CNQX, 10 µM (R)-CPP, 10 µM gabazine, 1 mM (S)-MCPG, Tocris). Fluorescence time-lapse images were collected on an Olympus IX81 microscope using a 10x 0.4 NA objective (UPlanSApo, Olympus) and an ET-GFP filter cube (Chroma #49002). Illumination was provided by a 470 nm LED (Cairn Research) and fluorescence was collected by an EMCCD camera (Ixon Ultra DU897, Andor) with 256 x 256 pixel frames taken at 50 Hz, with 2x binning, over a 0.8 mm x 0.8 mm FOV. A custom platinum electrode was lowered into each well via a linear actuator and neurons were stimulated (1, 10, 40 pulses at 83 Hz, 40 V, 1 ms pulse duration; S-48, Grass Instruments) as time-lapse imaging was performed.</p>
<p>The time-lapse images were analyzed to quantify the responses of the mutants to electrical stimulation. Photobleaching was corrected by fitting a single exponential to the beginning and end of the recording (avoiding the response window). For each pixel in the movie, a Mann-Whitney U test was performed between 1.5 sec preceding the field stimulation and 0.4 sec afterwards. Pixels with a <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01 for any of those tests were considered to be responsive. The number of responsive pixels was used as a proxy for sensor expression. In the screening phase, measurements of sensitivity (ΔF/F) and kinetics were performed on pooled responsive pixels from each plate, and wells with &lt; 4 responsive pixels were discarded. To account for batch variability, the response of each variant was normalized to the in-plate iGABASnFR1 control.</p>
<p>Quality control on every plate was performed initially by evaluating culture conditions and manually examining images from each well. General criteria for retesting were: aberrantly low expression, significant clumps of unhealthy cells or sparse cell distribution, out-of-range media pH, or data acquisition failures in the automated steps for focusing and field stimulus delivery. Individual variants with fewer than three replicates meeting quality criteria were flagged for retesting. If control iGABASnFR1 wells were flagged, the entire plate was rejected for potential systemic issues and all variants were retested. Overall, 54 plates did not pass this initial quality control step, and were re-screened. Subsequently, all variants with &lt; 1,800 responsive pixels per plate (representing 0.6% of all pixels) were eliminated from analysis.</p>

<title>Crystal structure determination</title>
<p>All crystallization trials were carried out at room temperature using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method.

GABA was perfused into each well using a custom 3D-printed part that held an inlet and outlet perfusion tube. The inlet tube was connected to a 4-channel gravity perfusion system (VC3, ALA Scientific), and the outlet tube was connected to a vacuum trap.

Stereotactic coordinates were 2.5 mm of the anteroposterior distance from bregma to lambda and 2.5 mm lateral to the midline. Pressure injections of the sensor (totalling 0.1E10 genomic copies in a volume not exceeding 200 nL) were stereotactically guided to a depth of 2.6 mm ventral from the cortical surface, at a rate of approximately 1 nL sec-1.

Tornado scans of 1.5 micron diameter were set over the pre-synaptic bouton and scanned at a rate of 500Hz with a train of action potentials initiated by brief positive voltage steps.

Perioperative multimodal analgesia utilized buprenorphine (60 μg kg-1, s.c.) and lidocaine (2.5%) topically applied to the surgical site; ocular ointment (Lacri-lube, Allergan, UK) was applied to prevent corneal drying. Anesthesia was induced with 5% isoflurane and maintained at 1.5–2.5%. After shaving, the scalp was disinfected with three washes of chlorhexidine, and the mouse was secured in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, USA). Adequate anesthesia was confirmed by loss of pedal reflexes, and body temperature was maintained at ∼37 °C using a feedback-controlled heating system.</p>
<p>A midline incision was made and overlying soft tissue resected to expose the skull. A small craniotomy (∼1 mm diameter) was drilled using a high-speed dental drill at coordinates targeting either the somatosensory cortex (AP: −1.5 mm, ML: −3.0 mm relative to bregma) or hippocampus (AP: −1.9 mm, ML: −1.4 mm, DV: −1.35 mm). AAV9-hSyn-GABASnFR2 was injected via a Hamilton syringe stereotactically positioned 1 mm below the cortical surface. Injections (300– 500 nL total volume) were delivered at ∼20 nL/min using a microinjection pump in three steps, retracting the needle by 150–200 μm after each step. After completion, the needle was left in place for ∼5 min before withdrawal. The wound was sutured, and animals received meloxicam (1 mg/kg) and 0.5 mL saline. Recovery took place in a heated chamber, with postoperative monitoring until full wound healing (typically 2–4 days).</p>

<title>Cranial window implantation</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized and positioned in a stereotaxic frame as described for the viral transduction procedure. Once stabilized under general anesthesia (isoflurane, maintained at 1.5– 2%), a large portion of the scalp was removed to expose the right frontal and parietal skull bones, along with the medial regions of the left frontal and parietal bones. The right temporalis muscle was reflected laterally to expose the squamous suture, to facilitate cement bonding during fixation of the cranial window implant. The exposed skull surface was coated with Vetbond (3M, USA), and a custom-designed headplate was mounted over the S1BF using dental cement (SuperBond, Sun Medical Co. Ltd., Japan).</p>
<p>After the bonding agents had fully cured, the animal was transferred to a custom-built head fixation setup. A 3 mm craniotomy was made over the right somatosensory cortex, centered over the S1BF injection site, using a high-speed hand drill. After sufficiently thinning the skull, prior to removal of the skull flap, the surface was superfused with warmed aCSF (in mM: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO₃, 1.25 Na₂HPO₄, 10 glucose, 2 CaCl₂, 2 MgSO₄ saturated with 95% O₂ / 5% CO₂ pH 7.4). The skull flap was removed using fine-tipped forceps (11252-40, Fine Science Tools,</p>
<p>Germany). Immediately after opening, the brain was superfused with sterile saline. The durotomy was performed using 26G needles with hand-made curved tips (modified by tapping against a hard surface), ensuring the pia mater remained intact.</p>
<p>A custom-prepared cranial window—a double-glass assembly consisting of a 34 mm diameter round coverglass bonded beneath a 4 mm diameter round coverglass (Harvard Apparatus UK), affixed with UV-curable optical adhesive (NOA61, ThorLabs Inc., NJ, USA)—was placed over the exposed cortex. Slight downward pressure was applied to the coverslip using a stereotactically guided wooden spatula to prevent excessive force to the open brain surface, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Henneberger et al. 2020</xref>). Superfusion was stopped, and excess aCSF was carefully absorbed with a sterile surgical sponge, ensuring no fluid remained beneath the cranial window. The coverslip was secured with dental cement. After completing the surgery, the anaesthesia regime was switched from inhalation to i.p. injection, using a mixture of fentanyl (0.03 mg/kg), midazolam (3 mg/kg), and medetomidine (0.3 mg/kg), for subsequent imaging in the anaesthetised animal.</p>

<title>Multiplexed Two-Photon imaging in vivo</title>
<p>The animal was transferred to the Femtosmart imaging system (Femtonics, Budapest), integrated with electrophysiology and connected to a tunable femtosecond pulsed laser (Insight X3, Spectra-Physics/Newport) for multiplexed two-photon excitation (2PE) imaging. Under anesthesia, the animal was secured on a custom-built stage via the implanted headplate, beneath an XLPlan N 25× water-immersion objective (NA 1.05) and illuminated with a green lamp.</p>
<p>2PE imaging was performed at 910 nm, optimized for the sensor. Imaging was conducted in cortical layers 1 and 2/3 at depths ranging from 50 to 300 μm, adjusting laser intensity to minimize photobleaching (&lt;15 mW). Once a suitable region was identified, data were acquired using either Tornado (spiral) linescan mode (0.5–1 kHz) or resonant frame scan mode. Frame scan time series were typically recorded as 512 × 50 × 317 pixels at 200–300 Hz for 5 s. Recordings were acquired using MESc v3.5.7 (Femtonics) and exported as t-stacks for further processing in ImageJ. In Tornado scan mode, circular fields of view (50–150 μm in diameter) were selected to encompass iGABASnFR2-positive cells. Given that GABA released from brief interneuronal bursts is expected to diffuse across extracellular distances on the order of 10 µm, we opted to image relatively broad imaging fields of view (50–150 μm) rather than targeting individual presynaptic boutons.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Kolb and Hasseman et al. introduces a significantly improved GABA sensor, building on the pioneering work of the Janelia team. Given GABA's role as the main inhibitory neurotransmitter and the historical lack of effective optical tools for real-time in vivo GABA dynamics, this development is particularly impactful. The new sensor boasts an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and appropriate kinetics for detecting GABA dynamics in both in vitro and in vivo settings. The study is well-presented, with convincing and high-quality data, making this tool a valuable asset for future research into GABAergic signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The core strength of this work lies in its significant advancement of GABA sensing technology. The authors have successfully developed a sensor with higher SNR and suitable kinetics, enabling the detection of GABA dynamics both in vitro and in vivo. This addresses a critical gap in neuroscience research, offering a much-needed optical tool for understanding the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter. The clear representation of the work and the convincing, high-quality data further bolster the manuscript's strengths, indicating the sensor's reliability and potential utility. We anticipate this tool will be invaluable for further investigation of GABAergic signaling.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite the notable progress, a key limitation is that the current generation of GABA sensors, including the one presented here, still exhibits inferior performance compared to state-of-the-art glutamate sensors. While this work is a substantial leap forward, it highlights that further improvements in GABA sensors would still be highly beneficial for the field to match the capabilities seen with glutamate sensors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript presents the development and characterization of iGABASnFR2, a genetically encoded GABA sensor with markedly improved performance over its predecessor, iGABASnFR1. The study is comprehensive and methodologically rigorous, integrating high-throughput mutagenesis, functional screening, structural analysis, biophysical characterization, and in vivo validation. iGABASnFR2 represents a significant advancement in GABA sensor engineering and application in imaging GABA transmission in slice and in vivo. This is a timely and technically strong contribution to the molecular toolkit for neuroscience.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors apply a well-established sensor optimization pipeline and iterative engineering strategy from single-site to combinatorial mutants to engineer iGABASnFR2. The development of both positive and negative going variants (iGABASnFR2 and iGABASnFR2n) offers experimental flexibility. The structure and interpretation of the key mutations provide insights into the working mechanism of the sensor, which also suggest optimization strategies. Although individual improvements in intrinsic properties are incremental, their combined effect yields clear functional gains, enabling detection of direction-selective GABA release in the retina and volume-transmitted GABA signaling in somatosensory cortex, which were challenging or missed using iGABASnFR1.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>With minor revisions and clarifications, especially regarding membrane trafficking, this manuscript will be a valuable resource for probing inhibitory transmission.</p>
