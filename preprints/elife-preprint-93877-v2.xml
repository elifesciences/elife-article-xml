<title>Abstract</title><p>Apicomplexan parasites balance proliferation, persistence, and spread in their metazoan hosts. AGC kinases, such as PKG, PKA, and the PDK1 ortholog SPARK, integrate environmental signals to toggle parasites between replicative and motile life stages. Recent studies have cataloged pathways downstream of apicomplexan PKG and PKA; however, less is known about the global integration of AGC kinase signaling cascades. Here, conditional genetics coupled to unbiased proteomics demonstrates that SPARK complexes with an elongin-like protein to regulate the stability of PKA and PKG in the model apicomplexan <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>. Defects attributed to SPARK depletion develop after PKG and PKA are down-regulated. Parasites lacking SPARK differentiate into the chronic form of infection, which may arise from reduced activity of a coccidian-specific PKA ortholog. This work delineates the signaling topology of AGC kinases that together control transitions within the asexual cycle of this important family of parasites.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Apicomplexans parasitize a majority of warm-blooded species, including an estimated quarter of the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Jones et al., 2014</xref>). Central to parasite success is the ability to transition between different life cycle stages to balance proliferation and transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Lourido, 2019</xref>). The acute phase of infection by <italic>T. gondii,</italic> a model apicomplexan, induces the pathology of disease. Parasites invade host cells, establish an intracellular niche that subverts innate immune responses, replicate, and exit the host via lysis to establish new sites of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Blader et al., 2015</xref>). These pathogens adapt to the inverted ion and nutrient gradients within and without the host cell in minutes. Such rapid changes in cellular state depend on signal transduction in <italic>T. gondii</italic> and related apicomplexans. Second messenger cascades within the parasite cytoplasm are especially well-suited to rapidly transduce and amplify signals from a changing environment. Accordingly, apicomplexans—and <italic>T. gondii</italic> in particular—have a complete repertoire of second messenger signaling components, from kinases to cyclases and phosphodiesterases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Brown et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Pace et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The roles of second messenger kinases—collectively referred to as AGC kinases for the founding members protein kinases A, G, and C—in apicomplexan life cycles have been elaborated in candidate-by-candidate approaches. cGMP-dependent protein kinase (or protein kinase G, PKG) is necessary for the secretion of parasite-specific adhesins and perforins, enabling efficient escape and invasion of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Brown et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Wiersma et al., 2004</xref>). In apicomplexan cells, PKG operates upstream of calcium release and thus potentiates an orthogonal second messenger signaling network. Consequently, PKG inhibitors have been pursued as anti-parasitic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Donald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Sidik et al., 2016b</xref>). Another cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase, PKA, similarly promotes parasite spread during infection; in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. merozoites, PKA function enables parasite invasion of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Flueck et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Patel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Wilde et al., 2019</xref>), and in <italic>T. gondii</italic> balanced PKA C1 function is required to ensure that parasites do not exit the host cell prematurely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Uboldi et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>T. gondii</italic> has an additional ortholog of the PKA catalytic subunit, PKA C3, which maintains parasites in the acute phase of the infection and reduces conversion to a slowly proliferating, chronic infection termed the bradyzoite stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sugi et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Several recent studies have sought to characterize the downstream targets of second messenger kinases in apicomplexans, including PKA, PKG, and calcium-dependent protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Balestra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Brochet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Herneisen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Nofal et al., 2022</xref>). The second messenger networks in these parasites are intricately interwoven, with documented crosstalk between parasite cAMP, cGMP, and calcium signaling cascades. Comparatively little work has addressed upstream signal integration in apicomplexans. In metazoans, growth factor kinases such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) prime numerous AGC kinases for further second messenger-based activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Mora et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>We recently identified the <italic>S</italic>tore <italic>P</italic>otentiating/<italic>A</italic>ctivating <italic>R</italic>egulatory <italic>K</italic>inase (SPARK), an apicomplexan ortholog of metazoan PDK1, as a fitness-conferring candidate in pooled screens of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> kinome. Parasites depleted of SPARK for multiple replication cycles failed to enter and exit host cells upon stimulation with zaprinast, a chemical that elevates cGMP in parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). The <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> ortholog of SPARK has been implicated in invasion and proliferation through the regulation of the PKA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hitz et al., 2021</xref>). Although parasites with disrupted SPARK alleles were characterized phenotypically, evidence for the PDK1 activity of SPARK was indirect. Here, we map the topology of the signaling network regulated by SPARK in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. SPARK complexes with an elongin-like protein we name SPARKEL. Phenotypic and proteomic experiments show that SPARK dysregulation lessens PKA C1, PKG, and PKA C3 function. Phenotypes attributed to SPARK depletion—reduced invasion, host cell lysis, calcium signaling, and increased differentiation—can be explained by the attenuated activities of SPARK’s client kinases. The proper functioning of SPARK thus ensures that <italic>T. gondii</italic> progresses through the acute stage of its infection cycle.</p>

<title>SPARK complexes with an elongin-like protein, SPARKEL</title>
<p>To identify proteins interacting with SPARK, we immunopurified the mNG epitope of the previously described SPARK-mNG-AID strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Smith et al., 2022</xref>) with anti-mNG nanobodies and quantified protein abundance using label-free quantitative proteomics (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <bold>Supplementary File 1</bold>). The immunoprecipitation (IP) successfully enriched SPARK as well as a hypothetical protein, TGGT1_291010. IPs with lysates of parasites expressing SPARK-mNG lacking AID demonstrated that the interaction was not due to the presence of the degron; TGGT1_291010 was once again highly enriched (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), along with a putative AGC kinase (TGGT1_205550). The AGC kinase is restricted to coccidians but is dispensable during acute <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Sidik et al., 2016a</xref>); we therefore focused our efforts on the hypothetical protein, which contributes to parasite fitness.</p>

<p>TGGT1_291010 is a 23 kDa protein with a C-terminal SKP1/BTB/POZ domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This domain shares homology with that seen in metazoan Elongin C. For this reason, we named the gene TGGT1_291010 “SPARK Elongin-Like protein” (SPARKEL, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). SPARKEL homologs are found in the free-living alveolates <italic>Vitrella brassicaformis</italic> and <italic>Chromera velia</italic> but are absent in Aconoidasida (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that the gene was present in the ancestor of apicomplexans but was selectively lost in some lineages. The function of proteins with Elongin C-like domains has not been widely investigated in unicellular eukaryotes.</p>

<p>Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry of SPARKEL enriched SPARK (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <bold>Supplementary File 1</bold>) and several putative components of daughter cell replication, including TGGT1_212770 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Dos Santos Pacheco et al., 2021</xref>), BCC10, and EFPP/BCC5. To confirm that SPARKEL and SPARK interact <italic>in situ</italic>, we introduced a C-terminal TurboID fusion at the SPARKEL endogenous locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). These transgenic parasites were treated with biotin while intracellular, and biotinylated proteins were enriched from lysates via streptavidin affinity purification. As a control, we conducted a parallel experiment with transgenic parasites expressing TurboID fused to a cytosolic mNG fluorophore. SPARK and the AGC kinase TGGT1_205550 were highly enriched in the SPARKEL proximity labeling experiment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <bold>Supplementary File 2</bold>). A proximity labeling experiment with parasites expressing TurboID at the N terminus of SPARKEL similarly enriched SPARK and TGGT1_205550 (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <bold>Supplementary File 2</bold>). Thus, the interactions between SPARK, SPARKEL, and TGGT1_205550 were consistently observed across a variety of approaches.</p>
<p>Endogenous tagging of SPARK and SPARKEL in the same parasite strain revealed punctate cytosolic staining for each protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>); however, the low expression level of SPARKEL precluded robust colocalization. Nevertheless, strong mass spectrometry evidence for the physical interaction between SPARK and SPARKEL motivated further analysis of their functional relationship.</p>

<title>SPARK and SPARKEL depletion phenocopy at multiple steps in the lytic cycle</title>
<p>To determine the regulatory interaction between SPARK and SPARKEL, we first generated a SPARKEL conditional knockdown allele by inserting V5, HaloTag, mini auxin-inducible degron (mAID), and Ty epitopes at the endogenous SPARKEL C terminus. In this strain, we tagged SPARK with a C-terminal V5-mCherry-HA. Parasites treated with auxin (indole-3-acetic acid; IAA) to deplete SPARKEL failed to form plaques in host cell monolayers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). As indicated by immunoblot, IAA treatment led to a reduction in detectable SPARKEL signal within one hour, as well as co-depletion of SPARK on a similar time scale (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We next generated a strain expressing SPARK-V5-mAID-HA. Similarly, SPARK levels were reduced within one hour of IAA addition (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), as reported for a similar strain previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). In this genetic background, we tagged SPARKEL endogenously with a C-terminal V5-mNG-Ty. IAA treatment reduced SPARK levels and led to a reduction in SPARKEL abundance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these results suggest that conditional knockdown via the AID system leads to co-depletion of SPARK and SPARKEL. However, SPARK and SPARKEL abundances are low and approach the limit of detection. We could only detect each protein by the V5 epitope. Although our experiments included single-tagged controls, we cannot formally eliminate the possibility that SPARK-AID yields degradation products that run at the expected molecular weight of SPARKEL. More sensitive methods, such as targeted mass spectrometry, may be required to measure the absolute abundance and stoichiometries of SPARK and SPARKEL.</p>

<p>To assess the impact of complex knockdown on parasite replication and transitions between intracellular and extracellular environments, we treated SPARKEL-AID and SPARK-AID parasites with IAA, and performed replication, invasion, and egress assays. SPARKEL-AID parasites exhibited normal replication kinetics after 24 h of IAA treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Invasion and egress efficiency of the AID-tagged strains were reduced after parasites were treated with IAA for 24 h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>), as previously reported for SPARK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). Intracellular calcium measurements of GCaMP-expressing parasites revealed a similar trend, with SPARKEL- and SPARK-depleted cells exhibiting reduced calcium mobilization after 24 h of IAA treatment when stimulated with zaprinast, a compound that stimulates calcium release from parasite intracellular stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Brown et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Sidik et al., 2016b</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G–H</xref>, and <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<title>SPARK and SPARKEL depletion phenotypes develop over time</title>
<p>SPARK was previously identified in a genetic screen that distinguished acute and delayed death phenotypes in a pooled population of parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). As parasites with conditional SPARK alleles were assessed only in the context of delayed death phenotypes—<italic>i.e</italic>., after an entire lytic cycle with IAA treatment—we characterized the ability of SPARK- and SPARKEL-AID parasites to invade and egress after 3 h of IAA, which is shorter than the <italic>T. gondii</italic> cell cycle. In marked contrast to the 24-hour treatment regime, SPARKEL- and SPARK-AID parasites exhibited no deficits in invasion, egress, or calcium mobilization after 3 h of depletion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E–J</xref>). Thus, in all assays performed, mutants lacking SPARK and SPARKEL are phenotypically identical, likely due to reciprocal co-depletion, but such phenotypes develop over time.</p>

Initially, we performed a quantitative proteomics experiment following 24 h of SPARK depletion—the previously described depletion window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). Extended SPARK depletion led to down-regulation of PKG and both the catalytic and regulatory subunits of PKA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

<p>To determine the critical window of SPARK and SPARKEL function, we performed quantitative proteomics with tandem mass tag multiplexing that included samples with 0, 3, 8, and 24 h of SPARK or SPARKEL depletion harvested 32 h post-infection. The experiments included internal TIR1 parental strain controls to account for possible basal downregulation arising from the degron (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We detected 3,333 and 3,880 proteins with quantification values in the SPARK and SPARKEL depletion time courses, respectively (<bold>Supplementary File 3</bold>). PKA C1, PKA R, and PKG protein abundances only began to drop after 8 h of IAA treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Globally, these kinase subunits were the most down-regulated proteins following 24 h of either SPARK or SPARKEL depletion (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Bradyzoite proteins up-regulated upon SPARK depletion primarily increased between 8 and 24 h of IAA treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>); the same proteins increased in abundance with 24 h of SPARKEL depletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). We were unable to measure SPARK or SPARKEL abundances in either proteome. Nevertheless, depletion of the SPARK-SPARKEL complex consistently leads to up-regulation of proteins associated with the bradyzoite stage of development, as well as down-regulation of PKG and the PKA C1 complex.</p>

<title>A depletion phosphoproteome implicates SPARK in the signaling, gene regulation, and metabolic states of the lytic cycle</title>
<p>To determine SPARK-dependent phosphoregulation, we enriched and analyzed phosphopeptides from the depletion proteome. We identified 18,518 phosphopeptides with quantification values, of which 8,867 were measured with more than one peptide-spectrum match (PSM). Principal component analysis (PCA) separated the SPARK-AID samples treated for 24 h with IAA from all other samples, while closely clustering biological replicates (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Despite the low abundance of SPARK and SPARKEL, individual phosphopeptides were detected for each protein. Likely due to basal degradation, the abundance of the SPARK phosphopeptide was ten-fold lower in SPARK-AID samples compared to the TIR1 control such that further depletion could not be measured (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The SPARKEL phosphopeptide abundance was also reduced relative to the TIR1 control sample; however, it decreased further between 3 and 8 h of IAA treatment (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because no other SPARKEL phosphopeptides were detected, it is not possible to determine whether this decrease is phosphosite-specific or due to a general decrease in SPARKEL protein abundance.</p>
<p>SPARK-regulated phosphopeptides may manifest in a strain-dependent or IAA-dependent manner. To account for basal downregulation, we ranked phosphopeptides by their log<sub>2</sub>-ratios of altered abundances in the SPARK-AID strain relative to the TIR1 parental strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). When a cutoff of 3.5 modified Z-scores was used, 91 phosphopeptides (44 with &gt;1 PSMs) and 69 phosphopeptides (19 with &gt;1 PSMs) were down- or up-regulated, respectively. The aforementioned phosphosite belonging to SPARK was the most strongly down-regulated phosphopeptide by this metric. One phosphopeptide belonging to a phosphatidylinositol 3- and 4-kinase (PI3,4K) was also strongly down-regulated (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); however, the protein abundance of this enzyme was not quantified. To identify phosphopeptides most altered by IAA treatment, and hence SPARK depletion, we summed and ranked phosphopeptides by log<sub>2</sub>-ratios of abundances in the SPARK-AID strain relative to the untreated samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). By this metric, 138 phosphopeptides (51 with &gt;1 PSMs) and 93 phosphopeptides (36 with &gt;1 PSMs) were down- or up-regulated by more than 3.5 modified Z-scores, respectively. Phosphoproteins belonging to this category are discussed below.</p>
<p>To uncover the molecular pathways regulated by SPARK, we performed enrichment analysis of the phosphopeptides exhibiting the highest degree of altered abundance upon SPARK depletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Changes in SPARK function likely alter post-translational modification (PTM) cascades both directly and indirectly. SPARK depletion reduced the abundance of phosphopeptides belonging to cyclic nucleotide-regulated kinases, which was in part driven by a reduction in kinase abundance. SPARK depletion also coincided with a reduction in phosphosites on several phosphatases (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), including BCC6, PPM1, and an uncharacterized dual-specificity phosphatase. By contrast, phosphorylation of other kinases and phosphatases increased upon SPARK depletion, which may arise as an indirect consequence of SPARK function. Upregulated phosphosites were found on pyruvate dehydrogenase and STE kinase, CDPK3, cyclin2-related protein, and the kinases TGGT1_204280 and TGGT1_239885; as well as the protein phosphatases PPM2B, calcineurin, and EFPP. Phosphosites belonging to proteins involved in ubiquitin transfer and hydrolysis also increased in abundance upon SPARK depletion. Examples of this class included UBP1, USP39, an RBR E3 ligase, CCR4-NOT subunit, and UBR box E3 ligase. To a lesser degree, phosphosites on ubiquitin ligases were also down-regulated following SPARK depletion—for example, a HECT E3 and a putative E2 enzyme. Thus, SPARK function has broad implications for PTM cascades.</p>
<p>Additional functional categories enriched for SPARK-dependent regulation included nucleic acid–binding proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A number of down-regulated phosphosites belong to proteins involved in DNA accessibility and transcription—for example, TFIIS, SET1, NOC3p, and <italic>Tg</italic>SRCAP. RNA modification enzymes also exhibited phosphoregulation, such as two PUS proteins, PRP8, SLU7, a FHA protein, three KH proteins, and a DCP2 homolog. Other regulated phosphoproteins may function in mRNA cap or untranslated region (UTR) binding, such as <italic>Tg</italic>PUF1, a MIF4G protein, CBP80, eIF3, and GCN1. Some of these proteins have been linked to expression changes during stage conversion, with PUF1 and SRCAP levels having been noted to increase during stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Joyce et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Sullivan et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, CBP80, eIF3, and the KH protein TGGT1_216670 co-purified with the Alba complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Gissot et al., 2013</xref>), which has been implicated in bradyzoite differentiation. Regulation of these proteins thus may be linked to the elevated expression of bradyzoite-stage proteins upon SPARK depletion.</p>
<p>Several putative transporters also exhibited decreased phosphopeptide abundance upon SPARK knockdown (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Some of these phosphoproteins channel inorganic cations, such as <italic>Tg</italic>ZnT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Chasen et al., 2019</xref>). Others likely transport small organic molecules—for example, a nucleoside and two ABC transporters. In aggregate, these analyses implicate SPARK in numerous cellular processes, including signaling, gene regulation, and metabolic exchange.</p>

<title>Clustering of phosphopeptide kinetics identifies seven response signatures</title>
<p>We sought to resolve the SPARK phosphoproteome into kinetically distinct clusters. Gaussian mixture-model algorithms heuristically clustered phosphopeptides identified by more than one PSM into seven classes on the basis of their response signatures following SPARK depletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Two phosphopeptides in Cluster 1 were distinguished by their rapid and sustained depletion and corresponded to CBP80 and eIF3, both of which function in translation. The second cluster of phosphopeptides was largely down-regulated by 3 h of IAA treatment and lacked dynamics following this window. PKA and PKG phosphopeptides belonged to Cluster 3, which decreased only after 8 h of IAA treatment. The final cluster of depleted phosphopeptides, Cluster 4, only exhibits down-regulation at 8h of IAA treatment.</p>
<p>Up-regulated phosphopeptides mirrored the dynamics of the down-regulated clusters. Cluster 5 phosphopeptides were elevated within 3 h of IAA treatment and continued to increase thereafter. Cluster 6 was up-regulated by 3 h of IAA treatment and was stable thereafter. Cluster 7 increased gradually and predominantly after 8 h of IAA treatment. Upregulated phosphosites may arise from a number of mechanisms following SPARK depletion. For example, SPARK activity may inhibit downstream kinases or activate downstream phosphatases, sterically block access of serines/threonines to other enzymes, or give rise to crosstalk between PTMs.</p>
<p>Because non-phosphopeptide and phosphopeptide abundances were quantified in different mass spectrometry experiments, it is challenging to compare the rates of phosphopeptide and parent protein abundance changes, especially when phosphorylation status and protein stability are interconnected. In general, both PKA C1, PKA R, and PKG protein and phosphosite abundances decreased following SPARK depletion (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), as discussed below. We also observed down-regulation of phosphopeptide and protein abundances of a MIF4G domain protein. Approaches that take into account subcellular proximity were required to distinguish direct substrates from pathways downstream of SPARK function.</p>

<title>Proximity labeling identifies putative SPARK targets <italic>in situ</italic></title>
<p>To gain insight into proximal SPARK interactors in intracellular parasites, we tagged the endogenous C terminus of SPARK with a TurboID domain and carried out proximity labeling experiments, as previously described for SPARKEL. We observed overlap in the phosphoproteomic and proximity labeling experiments. PKG was enriched (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref><bold> and Supplementary File 3</bold>), while PKA C1 narrowly missed our cutoffs. A putative HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase (TGGT1_280660) with two phosphosites down-regulated in the SPARK-dependent phosphoproteome was a candidate interactor. We also detected enrichment of PKA C3. PKA C3 is a coccidian-specific ortholog of the apicomplexan PKA catalytic subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sugi et al., 2016</xref>); however, no PKA C3 phosphopeptides were quantified in our depletion phosphoproteome experiments, likely due to the low abundance of the protein. SPARKEL was not quantified in the proximity labeling experiment, despite prior detection of the reciprocal interaction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). These integrated proteomics approaches hint that the phenotypes associated with SPARK depletion may arise from the altered activity of AGC kinases regulated by SPARK.</p>

<title>SPARK functionally interacts with PKA and PKG</title>
<p>The SPARK depletion time course phosphoproteome showed a reduction in the abundance of PKA C1 T190 and T341, which are located in the activation loop and C-terminal tail, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

<p>We considered the possibility that the SPARK depletion phosphoproteome represents a convolution of phosphoproteomes arising from broader AGC kinase down-regulation. We systematically tested this possibility by generating phosphoproteomes of parasites depleted of PKA R and PKG (<bold>Supplementary File 4</bold>). As association with PKA R inhibits PKA C1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jia et al., 2017</xref>), we reasoned that phosphosites up-regulated after a short window of PKA R depletion represent candidate PKA C1 targets. Similarly, phosphosites down-regulated after PKG depletion represent candidate PKG substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). Phosphopeptides above two modified Z-scores were considered candidate targets of each kinase.</p>
<p>Compared to the bulk phosphoproteome, the PKA C1-dependent phosphopeptides significantly decreased in abundance between 8 and 24 h of SPARK depletion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). When we applied the same analysis to a similarly acquired PP1-dependent phosphoproteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Herneisen et al., 2022</xref>), we found no significant relationship to the SPARK phosphoproteome (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the association with PKA C1 is specific. Several of the overlapping SPARK and PKA C1–dependent phosphoproteins localized to the parasite periphery and apex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>), for example, IMC25, AC13, CIP1, CIP2, and AC3. Others are putatively involved in RNA-binding functions, such as eIF4E and two KH proteins, including a component of the METTL3/METTL14 core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Farhat et al., 2021</xref>). We also observed regulation of phosphoproteins involved in ubiquitin transfer, including the aforementioned E2 and HECT E3 proteins (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Regulation of these proteins may account for both the kinetic- and replicative-phase phenotypes attributed to perturbed PKA C1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Uboldi et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>We carried out related experiments to validate that SPARK regulates PKG function. The SPARK depletion time course phosphoproteome showed a reduction in the abundance of several phosphosites residing in the N terminus of PKG as well as T838, which corresponds to the activation loop (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). By contrast, S105 did not greatly decrease, and S40 abundance increased slightly. Attempts to tag PKG with a fluorophore in a functional SPARK-AID background were unsuccessful. Global genetic screens have indicated that parasites with hypomorphic PKG—as can arise through endogenous tagging—are rapidly outcompeted by wildtype parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Fang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we instead relied on chemical-genetic interactions to validate the relationship between PKG and SPARK. We reasoned that parasites with down-regulated PKG activity might be sensitized to the specific PKG inhibitor Compound 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Donald et al., 2002</xref>). Previous studies had shown that SPARK is dispensable for A23187-induced egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Smith et al., 2022</xref>); however, PKG function is required for ionophore-induced egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Lourido et al., 2012</xref>). We performed egress assays using parasites depleted of SPARK for 24 h and treated with different concentrations of Compound 1. As anticipated, SPARK depletion sensitized parasites to inhibition with Compound 1, as assessed by A23187-induced egress (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B–C</xref>), suggesting that PKG activity is decreased in the absence of SPARK.</p>

<title>Depletion of SPARK, SPARKEL, or PKA C3 promotes chronic differentiation</title>
<p>Several pieces of evidence suggested that SPARK and SPARKEL depletion may prompt differentiation from the tachyzoite to bradyzoite state through dysregulation of another AGC kinase, PKA C3. First, down-regulation of SPARK and SPARKEL coincided with up-regulation of bradyzoite markers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Second, SPARK proximity labeling resulted in enrichment of PKA C3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>)—a negative regulator of the bradyzoite stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sugi et al., 2016</xref>) and, to date, the only AGC kinase characterized with a function in differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Augusto et al., 2020</xref>). Prolonged SPARK and SPARKEL depletion indeed elevated differentiation under normal culture conditions, as measured by staining of the cyst walls with dolichos binding lectin, a characteristic of chronic-stage bradyzoite vacuoles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A–B</xref>). N-terminal tagging of SPARKEL with AID similarly elevated differentiation upon IAA treatment (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>). Alkaline media in combination with serum starvation and low carbon dioxide is commonly used to induce bradyzoite transformation in cell culture.

<p>To dissect the hypothesized PKA C3–dependent arm of SPARK regulation, we altered the PKA C3 genomic locus with a V5-mAID-mNG-Ty tagging payload. Addition of IAA to the culture medium resulted in down-regulation of PKA C3 levels to below the detection limit within one hour (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C–D</xref>). PKA C3 exhibited low expression levels in cytoplasmic puncta (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sugi et al., 2016</xref>). We confirmed that prolonged PKA C3 depletion led to elevated differentiation rates under normal and alkaline-stress culture conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A–B</xref>) and observed that the effect was similar to SPARK or SPARKEL knock-down. Given that SPARK also regulates PKG and PKA C1, we considered the possibility that differentiation may be linked to a block in motility. However, the inability to egress is not sufficient for differentiation, as conditional knockdown of PKG or CDPK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Shortt et al., 2023</xref>) did not enhance the frequency of differentiation markers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A–B</xref>). We did not assess differentiation in PKA C1 knockdown parasites, as these mutants spontaneously egress from host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Uboldi et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The RH strain in which we generated mutants is reported to be refractory to differentiation into the bradyzoite form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Dubey et al., 1999</xref>), likely due to defects downstream of the pathways that lead to the initial synthesis of the cyst wall. We generated SPARKEL- and PKA C3-AID strains in the ME49 background (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>), which readily undergoes differentiation in tissue culture and mice, and confirmed that depletion of either prompts spontaneous differentiation in tissue culture (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E–F</xref>). We did not assess alkaline-induced differentiation, as this stress treatment results in near-complete differentiation in the ME49 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Waldman et al., 2020</xref>), which complicates measurement of enhanced differentiation.</p>
<p>To assess whether excess differentiation caused by SPARK and PKA C3 depletion is dependent on a previously characterized transcriptional regulator of differentiation, BFD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Waldman et al., 2020</xref>), we replaced the <italic>BFD1</italic> CDS with a sortable dTomato cassette in the SPARK- and PKA C3-AID strains (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>). The resulting SPARK- and PKA C3-AID/Δ<italic>bfd1</italic> mutants failed to undergo differentiation as measured by cyst wall staining (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G–H</xref>), suggesting that differentiation caused by depletion of these kinases depends on the BFD1 circuit. We additionally profiled transcriptomic remodeling in PKA C3-AID parasites that had been depleted of the kinase for 24 h and compared these changes to the chronic-stage transcriptome of parasites overexpressing BFD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Waldman et al., 2020</xref>). We observed up-regulation of several chronic-stage proteins upon PKA C3 depletion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>), including BAG1, CST1, CST10, MIC13, and <italic>Tg</italic>SPT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Licon et al., 2023</xref>). PKA C3 mRNA abundance was down-regulated, suggesting that tagging may alter steady-state transcript levels. Together, these results suggest that the bradyzoite stage conversion induced by knockdown of PKA C3 and SPARK proceeds through the canonical transcriptional pathway.</p>

<title>PKA C3 interacts with the SPARK complex</title>
<p>Several AGC kinases, including PKA C3, share the activation loop motif TLC/VGTxxY, which displayed SPARK-dependent phosphorylation in PKA C1 and PKG. PKA C3 was not detected in our SPARK depletion proteomics experiments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). To determine whether SPARK and PKA C3 interact, we immunopurified PKA C3 lysates, using the mNG epitope as a handle.

<title>SPARK down-regulation does not reduce PKA C3 protein levels</title>
<p>To determine whether SPARK activity affects PKA C3 abundance, as for PKA C1 and PKG, we tagged the endogenous PKA C3 C terminus with an mNG fluorophore in the SPARK-AID background. After 24 h of IAA treatment, PKA C3 levels were unaltered or slightly elevated, as measured by immunoblot (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B–C</xref>). Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry measurements of mNG intensity after 0, 3, 8, and 24 h of IAA treatment revealed a trend towards increasing PKA C3 abundance, although this difference was not significant (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D–F</xref>). Thus, unlike PKA C1, PKA C3 does not exhibit down-regulation following SPARK depletion. We considered the possibility that SPARK function could instead alter PKA C3 activity.</p>

<title>The PKA C3 phosphoproteome identifies candidates regulating the transition to the bradyzoite state</title>
<p>To pursue the functional consequences of PKA C3 inhibition, we performed a depletion phosphoproteomics time course experiment with the PKA C3-AID strain following 1, 3, 8, or 24 h of IAA treatment (Supplementary File 3). PKA C3-dependent phosphopeptides were identified as for the SPARK depletion proteome (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). The resulting proteome identified 4,792 proteins and 12,721 phosphopeptides, of which 9,576 were quantified with more than one PSM. PCA separated the 24 hour IAA samples from all others (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar to the SPARK depletion proteome, several of the up-regulated proteins were reported to be transcriptional signatures of the bradyzoite stage, including BRP1, TGGT1_208740, two secreted cAMP-dependent protein kinases, and BFD2 (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify phosphopeptides most altered by IAA treatment, we summed and ranked phosphopeptides by log<sub>2</sub>-ratios of abundances in the PKA C3-AID strain relative to the untreated (0 h) samples (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). By this metric, 129 phosphopeptides (94 with &gt;1 PSMs) and 49 phosphopeptides (31 with &gt;1 PSMs) were down- or up-regulated by more than 3.5 in the modified Z-scores, respectively. Gaussian mixture-model algorithms heuristically clustered phosphopeptides identified by more than one PSM into three classes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>). Cluster 1 contained 12 phosphopeptides that rapidly decreased within 1–3 h of PKA C3 depletion and continued to decrease thereafter. This cluster includes CBP80, a DEP domain protein, <italic>Tg</italic>ZnT, <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT3-1, AC13, and FtsH1 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Cluster 2 comprised 82 phosphopeptides that also decreased within 1–3 h of IAA treatment, after which their abundances remained stable, overall decreasing to a lesser extent than cluster 1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>). Cluster 2 included genes putatively involved in gene regulation, including eIF4G1, NOC3p, a zinc finger protein, a DNA repair protein, SET1, and a nucleotidyltransferase (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Several phosphosites belonging to proteins involved in daughter cell biogenesis were also down-regulated, including AC13, IAP2, BCC8, and condensin 2. We also observed down-regulated phosphosites for transporters in this cluster—for example, TgApiAT2, ATP4, and a nucleoside transporter. The early events in bradyzoite differentiation have not been extensively characterized but involve translational regulation of BFD1 enhanced by a BFD1/BFD2 feed-forward loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Licon et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Waldman et al., 2020</xref>). Down-regulation of PKA C3 may enhance conditions that activate this loop, for example due to global down-regulation of cap-dependent translation (CBP80, eIF4G1) or alteration of the replicative cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Radke et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Cluster 2 also contains numerous proteins trafficking through secretory organelles, including the micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules. Modified phosphosites belonging to micronemal proteins included CRMPb, TGGT1_221180, and TGGT1_304490 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The rhoptry proteins ROP1, ROP13, ROP17, ROP40, and RON9 were also differentially regulated. Modified dense granule/parasitophorous vacuole proteins included GRA3, GRA4, GRA6, GRA7, GRA8, GRA31, GRA57, GRA62, GRA70, SFP1, and MAG1. Many of these proteins are lumenal within their respective organelles, and regulation by PKA C3 is therefore likely indirect. Nonetheless, each of the secretory organelles contain stage-specific subproteomes with implications for metabolism and protein complex assembly in bradyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Sinai et al., 2020</xref>); the regulation observed here may reflect such early stages of proteomic remodeling.</p>
<p>The 31 phosphopeptides belonging to cluster 3 increased in abundance following PKA C3 depletion and therefore are likely indirect targets of the kinase. This cluster contained phosphoproteins involved in gene regulation (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), such as AP2XII-9, an ISWI protein, CAF1, PLU-1, GCFC, and two zinc finger proteins: TGGT1_223880 and BFD2. We also identified several candidates involved in proteostasis, including HSP90, p23, CSN3, PSME4. Regulation of such proteins may be related to the transition to the bradyzoite state, albeit not as a direct consequence of PKA activity.</p>
<p>The protein phosphatase PP2A has recently been characterized as a regulator of bradyzoite differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). We therefore analyzed proteins that exhibited both PKA C3- and PP2A-dependent phosphoregulation. Several candidates in this category were identified as differentially important in interferon-stimulated cells, including TGGT1_209500, GRA57, and GRA70. Numerous phosphosites belonging to AC13 were differentially regulated in both phosphoproteomes. Some proteins involved in endo- and exocytosis also exhibited dynamic phosphoregulation, including CRMPb and Kelch13. PKA R S<sup>27</sup> was up-regulated upon PKA C3 depletion and was also up-regulated in <italic>Δpp2a</italic> mutants. Finally, nucleic acid-binding proteins exhibited differential phosphoregulation, including BFD2, a KH protein, eIF4G2, and AP2XII-1. Given the stage conversion phenotypes of parasites lacking PKA C3 or PP2A, the phosphoregulation of overlapping targets may be functionally important in the context of bradyzoite differentiation.</p>

<title>The SPARK phosphoproteome shares signatures with the PKA C3–depletion phosphoproteome</title>
<p>We systematically compared the abundances of candidate PKA C3 targets (as defined above) to overlapping phosphosites in the SPARK phosphoproteome. Compared to the bulk phosphoproteome, the PKA C3–dependent phosphopeptides significantly decreased in abundance within three h of SPARK depletion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>). Several of the phosphoproteins found to be altered by both PKA C3 and SPARK depletion belonged to proteins involved in gene regulation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), including CBP80, eIF4G2, SET1, NOC3p, Spt5, a KH protein, a nucleotidyltransferase, and PRP4. Some of these proteins associate with large transcription factor assemblies, including the AP2IX4/MORC and GCN5b complexes. Transporters also overlapped between the two phosphoproteomes, including ZnT, TgApiAT2, and TgApiAT3-1. Several phosphosites belonging to apical cap proteins were also shared between the phosphoproteomes, including numerous AC13 phosphopeptides.</p>
<p>The SPARK and PKA C3 phosphoproteomes notably diverged with regards to regulation of dense granule proteins, which was observed as a subpopulation of PKA C3–dependent phosphopeptides that increased in abundance upon SPARK depletion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7K</xref>). This effect was specific to the indicated phosphopeptides, as corresponding protein levels of the dense granule proteins were not changed (<bold>Supplementary File 4</bold>). The differentially regulated dense granule proteins include many of those belonging to cluster 2 of the PKA C3 depletion proteome (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7K</xref>). The phosphoproteome of SPARK shares signatures of reduced PKA C3 activity; however, due to concomitant down-regulation of other AGC kinases, the phosphoproteomes of SPARK and PKA C3 depletion diverge in ways that remain to be explored.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SPARK is an ortholog of PDK1, which is considered a key regulator of AGC kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Mora et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Pearce et al., 2010</xref>). These kinases are united by general structural features required for activity and integrity, such as the activation segment (also known as the activation loop or T-loop), and the C-terminal hydrophobic and turn motifs, which are common loci of regulation that can position the kinase into an active conformation. In mammals, AGC kinases depend on PDK1 in various ways. For example, phosphorylation of the Akt (PKB) activation loop by PDK1 leads to partial activation; additional phosphorylation by the target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex produces maximal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Pearce et al., 2010</xref>). Some protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms undergo sequential phosphorylation by upstream enzymes—including PDK1—that prime PKC for activity and prevent kinase degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Newton, 2010</xref>). PKA catalytic isoforms require T-loop phosphorylation for activity; however, whether this modification is installed autocatalytically or by PDK1 depends on the cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cheng et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Moore et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Williams et al., 2000</xref>). Consequently, PDK1 dysregulation provokes diverse cellular consequences, including enhanced growth, migration, and cell survival—processes associated with cancer in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Gagliardi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Mora et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Raimondi and Falasca, 2011</xref>). In this study, we characterize the diverse consequences of the PDK1 ortholog dysregulation in the ubiquitous and divergent eukaryotic parasite of animals, <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p>
<p>A prior study identified SPARK as a regulator of parasite invasion and egress following 24 h of kinase depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). Unexpectedly, we observed that three h of SPARK depletion were insufficient to impact <italic>T. gondii</italic> motility or calcium-dependent signaling, indicating that the phenotypes associated with SPARK depletion develop over time. A similar time delay was observed for the development of phenotypes following depletion of the SPARK-interacting protein SPARKEL. Quantitative proteomics revealed that PKA and PKG abundances began to decrease after more than three h of SPARK depletion. Proximity labeling experiments also suggested that SPARK, PKA, and PKG are spatially associated within the parasite cell. We propose a model in which SPARK is required for the activation and stabilization of PKG and PKA.</p>
<p>From our own studies, multiple mass spectrometric and cell biological experiments support the relationship between SPARK and AGC kinases. Furthermore, PDK1 mutations in the related apicomplexan <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> were observed to suppress toxicity related to overexpression of <italic>Pf</italic>PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hitz et al., 2021</xref>). Both <italic>Tg</italic>PKG and <italic>Tg</italic>PKA C1 possess features of AGC kinases involved in PDK1 interaction, such as the PDK1-interacting fragment FXXF. PKA C1 terminates in the sequence FTSW, whereas PKG has two non-terminal FXXF motifs, FGDF and FLYF. Although these motifs are not strictly C-terminal, as in animals, their position resembles that observed in some plant AGC kinases, up to 50 amino acids upstream of the C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Rademacher and Offringa, 2012</xref>). The T-loop phosphorylation sites of each kinase—PKA C1 T190 and PKG T838—were detected in the global phosphoproteome and were down-regulated following SPARK knockdown. The requirement of T-loop threonine phosphorylation for PKG activity is unclear, as recombinant <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. PKG was still active when this residue was mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bakkouri et al., 2019</xref>). Conformational changes due to cGMP binding—in particular, rearrangement of the N-terminal autoinhibitory segment otherwise adjacent to the activation loop—appeared particularly important for PKG activity. Upon SPARK depletion, multiple phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal and cyclic nucleotide–binding domains of PKG (T16, S20, S22, T59, S62, T96, T99, and S129) decrease in abundance, whereas others remain stable or increase (S40 and S105). Thus, phosphorylation may function in the regulation of these domains. Heterologous expression and activity assays of PKA C1 and PKG may resolve the importance of activation loop and cyclic nucleotide–domain phosphorylation for kinase function; however, such biochemical assays are not currently available for the <italic>T. gondii</italic> kinases. The cause for reduction of PKA C1 and PKG levels also requires further study; in principle, active degradation or dilution mechanisms due to new protein synthesis and cell division are possible. In support of the latter, down-regulation of both kinases was only observed after 8 h of SPARK depletion, a period longer than the <italic>T. gondii</italic> cell cycle. SPARK could also indirectly stabilize PKA C1 and PKG abundances, for example by phosphorylating and inhibiting a ubiquitin ligase. One candidate could be the HECT domain protein TGGT1_280660, which exhibited SPARK-dependent phosphoregulation and was enriched in SPARK proximity labeling experiments. Examination of the SPARK-dependent ubiquitinome or pulse-chase phosphoproteomics experiments could yield further insight into the mechanisms of PKA C1 and PKG down-regulation following SPARK depletion.</p>
<p>Independent of biochemical mechanisms, genetic evidence supports the hypothesis that SPARK phenotypes associated with kinetic transitions in the lytic cycle—such as motility, egress, and invasion—arise from dysregulated PKA C1 and PKG activities. In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, PKA negatively regulates egress and positively regulates the transition between invasion and the establishment of a replicative niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Uboldi et al., 2018</xref>); by contrast, in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, PKA mediates parasite invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Flueck et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Patel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Wilde et al., 2019</xref>). PKG is more broadly required for apicomplexan motility, invasion, and egress and functions by mobilizing parasite intracellular calcium stores. Genetic pathway analysis of <italic>T. gondii</italic> PKA C1 and PKG inhibition supports a model in which PKG lies downstream of PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jia et al., 2017</xref>). Increasingly, proteomic, genetic, and physiological studies implicate negative feedback mechanisms between cAMP and cGMP signaling pathways in apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bisio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Brochet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Moss et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Nofal et al., 2022</xref>). In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, SPARK inhibition releases the brakes that PKA C1 holds on egress and jams the engine of PKG activity, resulting in parasite stasis. The PKA signaling circuit differs in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp., where a sole PKA C subunit is indispensable for invasion but not egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Patel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Wilde et al., 2019</xref>). However, SPARK inhibition would lead to a similarly inhibitory effect on parasite proliferation, as has been suggested recently in studies employing altered <italic>P. falciparum</italic> PDK1 and PKA alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hitz et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>T. gondii</italic> has two additional paralogs of the PKA catalytic subunit, relative to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp., PKA C2 and PKA C3. PKA C2 expression levels are low outside of the parasite sexual stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Ramakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sugi et al., 2016</xref>). PKA C3 disruption was previously reported to increase conversion to the bradyzoite stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sugi et al., 2016</xref>). Our results using a PKA C3 conditional knockdown support this finding. Furthermore, PKA C3 and SPARK associate, as revealed through approaches that probe reciprocal interactions. PKA C3 possesses a canonical PDK1-interacting fragment (FDNF) and shares an activation loop motif with PKA C1. Although PKA C3 peptide levels were below the detection limit in our depletion phosphoproteome experiments, we propose that SPARK depletion leads to down-regulation of PKA C3 activity separately from a reduction in PKA C3 protein abundance. SPARK and PKA C3 depletion phenocopy each other with respect to <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation. Candidates for the molecular targets responsible for differentiation may reside in the overlapping phosphosites in the SPARK and PKA C3 depletion phosphoproteomes.</p>
<p>The regulation of SPARK remains an open inquiry. Mammalian PDK1 is constitutively active due to auto-phosphorylation in <italic>trans</italic>. The PH domain triggers mammalian PDK1 homodimerization upon binding of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Levina et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Masters et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Pearce et al., 2010</xref>). SPARK lacks the PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Smith et al., 2022</xref>); therefore, apicomplexans have likely evolved alternative mechanisms for regulating PDK1. The complex of proteins interacting with SPARK—the elongin-like protein SPARKEL and the putative AGC kinase TGME49_205550—may represent a means of modulating SPARK activity. Elongin C forms a component of multiprotein complexes. E3 ubiquitin ligases are well-known examples; however, elongin C can affect steady-state protein levels through mechanisms distinct from ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Hyman et al., 2002</xref>). In metazoans, PDK1 has been reported to associate with E3 ligases and exhibit monobiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Uras et al., 2012</xref>). However, the SPARK and SPARKEL IPs and proximity experiments failed to identify obvious components of stable ubiquitin ligase complexes. Given the co-depletion of the complex—as has been reported for other tightly associated proteins studied with the AID system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Tosetti et al., 2020</xref>)—further biochemical studies are required to discern the regulatory interactions between SPARK and SPARKEL. Unlike most apicomplexans, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. appear to have lost SPARKEL, possibly requiring alternative mechanisms to control SPARK activity.</p>
<p>Our unbiased and integrative proteomic approaches uncovered ancient features of signaling networks <italic>de novo</italic> and revealed how such relationships can be repurposed for parasitism. Apicomplexans are well-adapted to transition between life stages in their hosts. Synthesizing genetic, proteomic, and phenotypic data, we propose that SPARK fundamentally integrates cyclic nucleotide signaling networks in apicomplexan parasites. In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, proper SPARK function preserves tachyzoite physiology by activating PKG, PKA C1, and PKA C3, thus promoting cycling within the acute stages of the infection over differentiation into the chronic stage wherein AGC kinase activity is lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Fu et al., 2021</xref>). In principle, SPARK may serve as a central node for regulation of the asexual stages.</p>

<p>Parasites freshly egressed from host cell monolayers and expressing SPARK-TurboID-Ty, SPARKEL-TurboID-Ty, or mNG-TurboID-Ty were infected onto a 15-cm dish confluent with HFFs (approximately 1-4 × 10<sup>7</sup> parasites per dish). The parasites invaded and replicated in host cells for approximately 32 h, at which point the media was aspirated and replaced with 10 ml of Ringer’s solution (155 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM KCl, 1mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose) with 1% IFS and 500 µM biotin. The dishes were incubated at 37°C and ambient CO<sub>2</sub> for 30 minutes to allow equilibration of biotin across the host and parasite plasma membranes. The monolayers were then scraped, and parasites were mechanically released by passage through a 27-gauge syringe into a conical tube. The parasite suspension was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and was spun at 1,500 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 minutes at ambient temperature. The supernatant was decanted. The parasite pellet was resuspended in 1 ml PBS and transferred to a 1.5 ml protein low-bind tube. The tubes were spun at 4°C and 21,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 1 minute, after which the supernatant was discarded and the parasite pellet was resuspended in 1 ml PBS. This spin and wash cycle was repeated twice more, for three washes total to remove excess biotin and serum. After the final wash, the parasite pellet was resuspended in 500 µl lysis buffer (140 mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 supplemented with Pierce protease inhibitors and benzonase), was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and was stored at –80°C until sample processing.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Raw files were analyzed in Proteome Discoverer 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to generate peak lists and protein and peptide IDs using Sequest HT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the ToxoDB GT1 version 49 sequence database. Raw files of the phosphopeptide-enriched and unenriched samples were analyzed separately. The unenriched sample search included the following post-translational modifications: dynamic oxidation (+15.995 Da; M), dynamic acetylation (+42.011 Da; N-terminus), static TMT6plex (+229.163 Da; any N-terminus), static TMT6plex (+229.163 Da; K), and static methylthio (+45.988 Da; C). The enriched sample search included the same post-translational modifications, but with the addition of dynamic phosphorylation (+79.966 Da; S, T, Y). The allowed mass tolerance for precursor and fragment ions was 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively. False discovery was assessed using Percolator with a concatenated target/decoy strategy using a strict FDR of 0.01, relaxed FDR of 0.05, and maximum Delta CN of 0.05. Only unique peptide quantification values were used. Co-isolation and signal-to-noise thresholds were set to 50% and 10, respectively. Normalization was performed according to total peptide amount. In the case of the unenriched samples, protein abundances were calculated from summation of non-phosphopeptide abundances. The mass spectrometry proteomics datasets have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Perez-Riverol et al., 2022</xref>) with the following dataset identifiers: SPARK-AID phosphoproteomics, PXD040602; SPARKEL-AID proteomics, PXD040635; PKA C3-AID phosphoproteomics, PXD042989.</p>
<p>Exported phosphopeptide and unenriched protein abundance files from Proteome Discoverer 2.4 were loaded into R (version 4.0.4). The normalized abundance values of all phosphopeptides were used as input for a principal component analysis using the R stats package (version 3.6.2). The strain basal downregulation score was determined for the SPARK-AID phosphoproteome by calculating the modified z-score of the log<sub>2</sub>-ratios of altered abundances in the SPARK-AID strain with no IAA treatment relative to the TIR1 parental strain. The IAA score was calculated by summing the log<sub>2</sub>-ratios of altered phosphopeptide abundances in the SPARK-AID strain relative to the SPARK-AID untreated samples, followed by transformation into a modified z-score. Clustering analysis was performed with the mclust package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Scrucca et al., 2016</xref>) (version 5.4.7) using the log<sub>2</sub> ratios of relative to the vehicle-treated SPARK-AID samples.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Herneisen et al characterise the Toxoplasma PDK1 orthologue SPARK and an associated protein SPARKEL (cute name) in controlling important fate decisions in Toxoplasma. Over recent years this group and others have characterised the role of cAMP and cGMP signalling in negatively and positively regulating egress, motility and invasion, respectively. This manuscript furthers this work by showing that SPARK and SPARKEL likely act upstream, or at least control the levels of the cAMP and cGMP-dependent kinases PKA and PKG, respectively, thus controlling the transition of intracellular replicating parasites into extracellular motile forms (and back again).</p>
<p>The authors use quantitative (phospho)proteomic techniques to elegantly demonstrate the upstream role of SPARK in controlling cAMP and cGMP pathways. They use sophisticated analysis techniques (at least for parasitology) to show the functional association between cGMP and cAMP signalling pathways. They therefore begin to unify our understanding of the complicated signalling pathways used by Toxoplasma to control key regulatory processes that control the activation and suppression of motility. The authors then use molecular and cellular assays on a range of generated transgenic lines to back up their observations made by quantitative proteomics that are clear in their design and approach.</p>
<p>The authors then extend their work by showing that SPARK/SPARKEL also control PKAc3 function. PKAc3 has previously been shown to negatively regulate differentiation into bradyzoite forms and this work backs up and extends this finding to show that SPARK also controls this. The authors conclude that SPARK could act as a central node of regulation of the asexual stage, keeping parasites in their lytic cell growth and preventing differentiation. Whether this is true is beyond the scope of this paper and will have to be determined at a later date.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an exceptional body of work. It is elegantly performed, with state-of-the-art proteomic methodologies carefully being applied to Toxoplasma. Observations from the proteomic datasets are masterfully backed up with validation using quantitative molecular and cellular biology assays.</p>
<p>The paper is carefully and concisely written and is not overreaching in its conclusions. This work and its analysis set a new benchmark for the use of proteomics and molecular genetics in apicomplexan parasites.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are no weaknesses in this paper.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Herneisen et al. examines the Toxoplasma SPARK kinase orthologous to mammalian PDK1 kinase. The extracellular signals trigger cascades of the second messengers and play a central role in the apicomplexan parasites' survival. In Toxoplasma, these cascades regulate active replication of the tachyzoites, which manifests as acute toxoplasmosis, or the development into drug-resilient bradyzoites characteristic of the chronic stage of the disease. This study focuses on the poorly understood signaling mechanisms acting upstream of such second messenger kinases as PKA and PKG. The authors showed that similar to PDK1, Toxoplasma SPARK likely regulates several AGC kinases.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study demonstrated a strong association of the SPARK kinase with the SPARKL factor and an uncharacterized AGC kinase. Using a set of standard assays, the authors determined the SPARK /SPARLS role in parasite egress, invasion, and bradyzoite differentiation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the revised manuscript has significantly improved, the primary concern of incomplete data analysis still needs to be addressed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper focuses on the roles of a toxoplasma protein (SPARKEL) with homology to an elongin C and the kinase SPARK that it interacts with. They demonstrate that the two proteins regulate the abundance of PKA and PKG and that depletion of SPARKEL reduces invasion and egress (previously shown with SPARK), and that their loss also triggers spontaneous bradyzoite differentiation. The data are overall very convincing and will be of high interest to those who study Toxoplasma and related apicomplexan parasites.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is very well executed with appropriate controls. The manuscript is also very well and clearly written. Overall, the work clearly demonstrates that SPARK/SPARKEL regulate invasion and egress and that their loss triggers differentiation.</p>
<p>Comments on the revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed my concerns.</p>

<p>This study defines a fundamental aspect of protein kinase signalling in the protist parasite Toxoplasma gondii that is required for acute and chronic infections. The authors provide compelling evidence for the role of SPARK/SPARKEL kinases in regulating cAMP/cGMP signalling, although evidence linking the loss of these kinases to changes in the phosphoproteome is incomplete. Overall, this study will be of great interest to those who study Toxoplasma and related apicomplexan parasites.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and positive evaluation of our work. Below, we have addressed all of the public reviews and recommendations for the authors in point-by-point responses. Additionally, we include with this resubmission RT-qPCR data where we observe no significant change in transcript levels for the relevant AGC kinases, supporting the hypothesis that SPARK/SPARKEL–regulation is post-translational.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Herneisen et al characterise the Toxoplasma PDK1 orthologue SPARK and an associated protein SPARKEL in controlling important fate decisions in Toxoplasma. Over recent years this group and others have characterised the role of cAMP and cGMP signalling in negatively and positively regulating egress, motility, and invasion, respectively. This manuscript furthers this work by showing that SPARK and SPARKEL likely act upstream, or at least control the levels of the cAMP and cGMP-dependent kinases PKA and PKG, respectively, thus controlling the transition of intracellular replicating parasites into extracellular motile forms (and back again).</p>
<p>The authors use quantitative (phospho)proteomic techniques to elegantly demonstrate the upstream role of SPARK in controlling cAMP and cGMP pathways. They use sophisticated analysis techniques (at least for parasitology) to show the functional association between cGMP and cAMP signalling pathways. They therefore begin to unify our understanding of the complicated signalling pathways used by Toxoplasma to control key regulatory processes that control the activation and suppression of motility. The authors then use molecular and cellular assays on a range of generated transgenic lines to back up their observations made by quantitative proteomics that are clear in their design and approach.</p>
<p>The authors then extend their work by showing that SPARK/SPARKEL also control PKAc3 function. PKAc3 has previously been shown to negatively regulate differentiation into bradyzoite forms and this work backs up and extends this finding to show that SPARK also controls this. The authors conclude that SPARK could act as a central node of regulation of the asexual stage, keeping parasites in their lytic cell growth and preventing differentiation. Whether this is true is beyond the scope of this paper and will have to be determined at a later date.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an exceptional body of work. It is elegantly performed, with state-of-the-art proteomic methodologies carefully being applied to Toxoplasma. Observations from the proteomic datasets are masterfully backed up with validation using quantitative molecular and cellular biology assays.</p>
<p>The paper is carefully and concisely written and is not overreaching in its conclusions. This work and its analysis set a new benchmark for the use of proteomics and molecular genetics in apicomplexan parasites.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This reviewer did not identify any weaknesses.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Herneisen et al. examines the Toxoplasma SPARK kinase orthologous to mammalian PDK1 kinase. The extracellular signals trigger cascades of the second messengers and play a central role in the apicomplexan parasites' survival. In Toxoplasma, these cascades regulate active replication of the tachyzoites, which manifests as acute toxoplasmosis, or the development into drug-resilient bradyzoites characteristic of the chronic stage of the disease. This study focuses on the poorly understood signaling mechanisms acting upstream of such second messenger kinases as PKA and PKG. The authors showed that similar to PDK1, Toxoplasma SPARK appears to regulate several AGC kinases.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study demonstrated a strong association of the SPARK kinase with an elongin-like SPARKEL factor and an uncharacterized AGC kinase. Using a set of standard assays, the authors determined the SPARK/SPARKEL role in parasite egress and invasion. Finally, the study presented evidence of the SPARK/SPARKEL involvement in the bradyzoite differentiation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the study can potentially uncover essential sensing mechanisms operating in Toxoplasma, the evidence of the SPARK/SPARKEL mechanisms is weak. Specifically, due to incomplete data analysis, the SPARK/SPARKEL-dependent phosphoregulation of AGC kinases cannot be evaluated. The manuscript requires better organization and lacks guidance on the described experiments. Although the study is built on advanced genetics, at times, it is unnecessarily complicated, raising doubts rather than benefiting the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The evidence for the SPARK/SPARKEL interaction is demonstrated through diverse experimental approaches that are internally consistent. Five separate mass spectrometry experiments, with replicates and appropriate controls, with tags on either SPARK or SPARKEL, showed that SPARK and SPARKEL form a strong interaction (Figure 1A, 1D, 1E; Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Global mass spectrometry experiments assessing the impact of  SPARK or SPARKEL depletion showed similar features (a reduction in PKG and PKA abundance and up-regulation of bradyzoite-associated proteins; Figure 3C–D). The phenotypes associated with SPARK and SPARKEL depletion phenocopy one another in all cell biological assays we tested (Figure 2A, 2D and PMID: 35484233; Figure 2E–J; Figure 4E–F; Figure 6A–B). Measuring the abundance of SPARK and SPARKEL in unenriched samples was challenging, but immunoblotting and proteomics suggest that depletion of one factor leads to down-regulation of the other (Figure 2B, 2C; Figure 3—figure supplement 1), which explains the genetic and cell biological phenocopying described above. We note that “further biochemical studies are required to discern the regulatory interactions between SPARK and SPARKEL” (first submission lines 590-591) and are beyond the scope of this work.</p>
<p>The evidence for SPARK/SPARKEL regulation of AGC kinase activity is demonstrated through diverse experimental approaches that are also internally consistent. PKA C1 and PKG abundance levels decrease in parasites depleted of SPARK/SPARKEL, as measured by mass spectrometry (Figure 3A and 3C) and cell-based assays for PKA C1/R (Figure 4D–F). Comparisons of the global SPARK-, PKA R-, PKG-, and PKA C3-depleted phosphoproteomes suggest that PKA and PKG activity is reduced upon SPARK depletion whereas the activity of an unrelated factor (PP1) is unaffected (Figure 4G–H, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 5D–E, Figure 7I–J). Parasites depleted of SPARK are hypersensitized to a PKG inhibitor (Figure 5B–C). SPARK, PKA, and PKG are proximal in cellulo (Figure 3I) and SPARK co-purifies with PKA C3 (Figure 7A). The kinetic-phase phenotypes associated with SPARK and SPARKEL depletion (PMID: 32379047, Figure 2A, 2D–2J) are consistent with reduced PKG activity (PMID: 28465425) and only develop after PKG has been depleted as shown by proteomics experiments (Figure 2E-J and Figure 3C). Other studies have shown that the effects of reduced PKG activity are dominant to reduced PKA C1 activity (PMID: 29030485). The replicative-phase phenotypes associated with SPARK and SPARKEL depletion are consistent with reduced PKA C3 activity (PMID: 27247232 and herein). Mechanistically, PKG and PKA C1 activity must be lower in SPARK-depleted parasites because the abundances of these kinases are lower (Figure 3A, 3C). The mechanism of regulation may be more complex in the case of PKA C3, as SPARK depletion did not cause a reduction in PKA C3 abundance as measured by cellular assays (Figure 7B–F), but PKA C3 activity decreased (Figure 7I–K). We concede that multiple mechanisms may lead to the reduction in PKA C1 and PKG abundances, such as decreased activation loop phosphorylation and autophosphorylation at other stabilizing sites or enhanced ubiquitin ligase activity leading to active degradation of the kinases; we have moved speculation regarding such mechanisms to the Discussion.</p>
<p>Although the reviewer commented that the manuscript “requires better organization” in the public review, no specific recommendations were provided to the authors. Therefore, we did not change the organization of the manuscript. We added an additional paragraph to the Discussion to reiterate key findings: “A prior study identified SPARK as a regulator of parasite invasion and egress following 24 hours of kinase depletion (Smith et al., 2022). Unexpectedly, we observed that three hours of SPARK or SPARKEL depletion were insufficient to impact T. gondii motility or calcium-dependent signaling, indicating that the phenotypes associated with SPARK and SPARKEL depletion develop over time. Quantitative proteomics revealed that PKA and PKG abundances began to decrease after more than three hours of SPARK depletion. Proximity labeling experiments also suggested that SPARK, PKA, and PKG are spatially associated within the parasite cell. We propose a model in which SPARK down-regulation coincides with reduced PKG and PKA activity due to diminished protein levels.” This work built upon genetic and proteomic approaches recently described by our group, which we cited in the text and extensive methods section. We added additional experimental detail where noted in the reviewer’s recommendations to the authors.</p>
<p>The study utilizes advanced genetics because biochemical tools for eukaryotic parasites are limited. For example, no antibodies for T. gondii SPARK, PKA subunits, or PKG exist; to say nothing of phosphosite-specific antibodies, which are common in the mammalian cell signaling field. Therefore, to measure the relationship between SPARK, SPARKEL, and PKA subunits, we had to generate strains in which multiple proteins were tagged with epitopes for downstream analysis. The genetic experiments included appropriate controls and were internally consistent with results obtained using orthogonal approaches, such as mass spectrometry.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper focuses on the roles of a toxoplasma protein (SPARKEL) with homology to an elongin C and the kinase SPARK that it interacts with. They demonstrate that the two proteins regulate the abundance of PKA and PKG, and that depletion of SPARKEL reduces invasion and egress (previously shown with SPARK), and that their loss also triggers spontaneous bradyzoite differentiation. The data are overall very convincing and will be of high interest to those who study Toxoplasma and related apicomplexan parasites.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is very well executed with appropriate controls. The manuscript is also very well and clearly written. Overall, the work clearly demonstrates that SPARK/SPARKEL regulate invasion and egress and that their loss triggers differentiation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors fail to discriminate between SPARK/SPARKEL acting as negative regulators of differentiation as a result of an active role in regulating stage-specific transcription/translation or as a consequence of a stress response activated when either is depleted</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We demonstrate a novel function for SPARK and SPARKEL as negative regulators of differentiation. The pathways leading to differentiation are being actively studied. Up-regulation of a positive transcriptional regulator of chronic differentiation, BFD1, is sufficient to trigger differentiation in vitro in the absence of other stressful growth conditions (PMID: 31955846). SPARK or SPARKEL depletion results in up-regulation of proteins that are up-regulated upon BFD1 overexpression. Whether BFD1 overexpression or SPARK and SPARKEL depletion triggers cellular stress pathways is beyond the scope of the current work, which focused instead on the immediate effect of these pathways on AGC kinases. Study of the effect of the various kinases on the parasite phosphoproteome shows that the putative targets of PKA C3 are specifically downregulated upon SPARK knockdown, indicating PKA C3 activity is indeed decreased in the latter condition.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The function of SPARKEL has not been addressed. In mammalian cells, Elongin C is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that regulates transcription and other processes. From what I can tell from the proteomic data, homologs of the Elongin B/C complex were not identified. This is an important issue as the authors find that PKG and PKA protein levels are reduced in the knockdown strains</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our experiments suggest that SPARK and SPARKEL form a complex, and down-regulation of one complex member leads to down-regulation of the other. Thus in all tested assays, knockdown of SPARK and SPARKEL phenocopy one another. Further biochemical and structural work will be required to determine the mechanism by which SPARKEL regulates SPARK.</p>
<p>Nearly all studies of the function of elongin C have been conducted in mammalian cells. Proteins with elongin C domains may serve alternative and unexplored functions in unicellular eukaryotes. We searched for the presence of Elongin A/B and known Elongin C complex members in the T. gondii genome and were unable to identify orthologs, explaining why these proteins were not identified in mass spectrometry experiments. Please see our response in Recommendations for the Authors, Reviewer 3 point 2.</p>
<p>Beyond the concerns raised by the review team, we have identified and corrected the following errors or omissions in the first submission of the manuscript:</p>
<p>- Line 176 of the first submission referred to a “peptide sequence match (PSM)”, which we have changed to “peptide-spectrum match”.</p>
<p>- We recolored and relabeled the lines in Figure 5A so that it is easier to match a specific peptide with a specific line; and also corrected a mislabeling.</p>
<p>- Figure 7B SPARK panel was incorrectly centered. The raw files can be viewed in Figure 7—source data 2.</p>
<p>- Figure 7—figure supplement 1D was missing an x-axis label.</p>
<p>- Line 1172 referred to “Supplementary File X”, which we corrected to “Supplementary File 3”.</p>
<p>- We have updated references to preprints that have since been published, including PMID: 38093015, 37933960, 37966241, and 37610220.</p>

<p><bold>Editors comments:</bold></p>
<p>The proteomics data reported in this study underpin the major findings and are very comprehensive. As noted in the reviews, it is strongly recommended that the authors normalize the levels of detected phosphopeptides against the levels of the parent protein in the different mutant lines in order to identify changes in protein phosphorylation that are linked to protein kinase activity rather than protein degradation. A focus on changes that occur at early time points following protein knock-down may also help to identify the main targets of each kinase.</p>

<p>How the phosphoproteome was analyzed needs to be clarified. The normalization step, computing the ratio of the phosphopeptide to the protein (peptide) intensity, appears omitted. It is the most critical step of the analysis. The minor shifts between protein and phosphosite intensity seem negligible, as seen in Figure 4 AB. The significant changes can only be deduced by calculating this ratio. In the current state, the presented results are inconclusive. The manuscript contains overreaching and often unsupported statements because the data has not been appropriately filtered. Related to this topic, it is advisable to use well-accepted terminology and complete words when describing proteome and phosphoproteome. The interexchange of a &quot;peptide&quot; and a &quot;phosphopeptide&quot; in the text confuses and misleads.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To clarify the phosphoproteome analysis:</p>
<p>We cite a previous description of the phosphoproteomics sample preparation workflow (lines 1124-1125 of the first submission for example). Our quantitative phosphoproteomics experiments comprise two datasets generated from the same multiplexed samples. The samples were split at the point of phosphopeptide enrichment. Ninety-five percent of the samples were subjected to phosphopeptide enrichment (titanium dioxide followed by nickel affinity chromatography; “enriched samples”). Five percent of the samples were reserved as a reference for the non-enriched proteome (“non-enriched samples”). To clarify this point, we have added the sentences “Approximately 95% of the proteomics sample was used for phosphopeptide enrichment” and “The remaining 5% of the sample was not subjected to the phosphopeptide enrichment protocol” to the Methods sections, after describing the multiplexing steps.</p>
<p>The samples were fractionated separately and run separately on an LC-MS system, which is described in the Methods section, for example lines 1130-1149 of the first submission. Raw files of the phosphopeptide-enriched and unenriched samples were analyzed separately, which is described in the Methods section, for example lines 1151-1158 of the first submission. To clarify this point, we have added the sentence “Raw files of the phosphopeptide-enriched and unenriched samples were analyzed separately” to the Methods sections. Many of the search parameters and descriptions of normalization and protein abundances were described in lines 1085-1093 of the first submission in reference to the 24h SPARK depletion proteome. We added this information to the description of the SPARK depletion time course phosphoproteome data analysis: “The allowed mass tolerance for precursor and fragment ions was 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively. False discovery was assessed using Percolator with a concatenated target/decoy strategy using a strict FDR of 0.01, relaxed FDR of 0.05, and maximum Delta CN of 0.05. Only unique peptide quantification values were used. Co-isolation and signal-to-noise thresholds were set to 50% and 10, respectively. Normalization was performed according to total peptide amount. In the case of the unenriched samples, protein abundances were calculated from summation of non-phosphopeptide abundances.”</p>
<p>We hope that this clarifies how the unenriched sample protein-level abundances were calculated. When we discuss “protein abundance”, we are referencing the unenriched sample summed non-phosphopeptide abundance. Our phosphoproteome analysis was based only on phosphopeptides, as our phosphopeptide enrichment resulted in 99% efficiency, and peptides lacking phosphorylation sites were filtered out before subsequent analyses. We used “peptide” and “phosphopeptide” interchangeably because the only peptide-level analysis performed was based on phosphopeptide abundances. We have changed any mention of “peptide” to “phosphopeptide” in the main text.</p>
<p>“The normalization step, computing the ratio of the phosphopeptide to the protein (peptide) intensity, appears omitted. It is the most critical step of the analysis.”:</p>
<p>Unlike common differential gene expression analysis pipelines, proteomics analysis pipelines are not settled. Many analyses do not perform peptide-to-parent-protein corrections; some normalize phosphopeptide abundances to parent protein abundances calculated from summing non-phosphopeptides or a combination of phosphopeptide and non-phosphopeptides on an ad hoc basis; some calculate global normalization factors based on regressions of protein and phosphopeptide abundances or other pairwise comparisons. A caveat of protein normalization of phosphopeptides is that it over-corrects cases in which protein abundance and phosphorylation are interdependent, as is the case for auto-phosphorylation and some activation loop phosphorylations (PMID: 37394063). We used the approach that retained the greatest complexity of the data, which is to not normalize abundances across different mass spectrometry experiments and discard information that was not in the overlap. We have updated Supplementary File 3.3 to include protein-level quantification values (from Supplementary File 3.2) if measured.</p>
<p>We clarified that the phosphopeptide abundances and protein-level abundances were derived from different datasets that were each internally normalized (globally centered by total peptide amount). Protein-level abundances were summed from non-phosphopeptide abundances. The calculated log2 changes are based on the globally centered data within each dataset. We analyzed the kinetic profiles of changing phosphopeptide abundances relative to a control using approaches similar to those described for several recent temporally resolved T. gondii phosphoproteomes (e.g. PMID: 37933960, 35976251, 36265000, 29141230) and as described in the Methods. The approach does not first correct for unenriched-sample parent protein abundance—in some applications, unenriched samples are not collected at all; instead, phosphopeptide ratios are median-normalized to non-phosphopeptide ratios (quantified due to inefficient phosphopeptide enrichment) and are individually tested against the null distribution of non-phosphopeptide ratios (e.g. PMID: 36265000, 29141230). We did not use this approach because our phosphopeptide enrichment was 99% efficient (18518 phosphopeptides of 18758 peptides with quantification values). In several cases using our approach, parent protein abundance is not quantified in the unenriched proteome dataset, but phosphopeptides are reliably quantified in the enriched proteome dataset. We note that phosphopeptide abundance changes can be difficult to interpret in such cases, e.g. in the first submission lines 178-186 and 193-194. We have added similar text to the results noting that in the case of PKA and PKG, both unenriched parent protein and enriched phosphopeptide abundances decreased (see below). We have also moved speculation about whether SPARK phosphorylates the activation loop of PKA and PKG, or whether the down-regulation of PKA and PKG arises from indirect effects, to the Discussion.</p>
<p>We have moved comparisons of protein and phosphopeptide abundances from the Results to the Discussion. We added the following sentences to the result section Clustering of phosphopeptide kinetics identifies seven response signatures: “Because non-phosphopeptide and phosphopeptide abundances were quantified in different mass spectrometry experiments, it is challenging to compare the rates of phosphopeptide and parent protein abundance changes, especially when phosphorylation status and protein stability are interconnected. In general, both PKA C1, PKA R, and PKG protein and phosphosite abundances decreased following SPARK depletion (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), as discussed further below. We also observed down-regulation of phosphosite and protein abundances of a MIF4G domain protein.” Figure 3—figure supplement 1E is a new panel that shows PKA C1, PKA R, and PKG phosphopeptide and parent protein abundances along with global changes in phosphopeptide and parent protein abundances in the cases which both were quantified. We changed lines 278-282 in the first submission to “The SPARK depletion time course phosphoproteome showed a reduction in the abundance of PKA C1 T190 and T341, which are located in the activation loop and C-terminal tail, respectively (Figure 4A). Several phosphosites residing in the N terminus of PKA R (e.g. S17, S27, and S94) also decreased following SPARK depletion (Figure 4B).” We changed lines 313-315 in the first submission to “The SPARK depletion time course phosphoproteome showed a reduction in the abundance of several phosphosites residing in the N terminus of PKG as well as T838, which corresponds to the activation loop (Figure 5A). By contrast, S105 did not greatly decrease, and S40 abundance slightly increased.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The description of experiments should be more detailed. For example, the 3, 8, and 24 h treatments were used reversely; thus, they should be emphasized as time points before natural egress. Consequently, it seems that 3h treatment should be prioritized, given the SPARK/SPARKEL role in egress/invasion. Unexpectedly, the study draws more attention to a 24-hour treatment. If the AID-SPARK/SPARKEL is eliminated within 1h, parasites undoubtedly accumulate numerous secondary defects during a prolonged 23h deprivation. Since the SPARK pathway activates kinase/phosphatase cascades, the 24h data is likely overwhelmed with the consequences of the long-term complex degradation, making it a poor source of the putative SPARK substrates. Likewise, the downregulation of PKA observed in the 8 hours after SPARK depletion may be an indirect effect of the SPARK degradation. The direct effects and immediate substrates should be detectable within 2-3h of auxin treatment of the nearly egressing cultures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The first submission described how parasites were harvested at 32 hours post-infection with 0, 3, 8, or 24 hours of IAA treatment (lines 157-160, 1097-1110, and Figure 3B). To reiterate this experimental detail, we have added “harvested 32 hours post-infection” to the sentence “...quantitative proteomics with tandem mass tag multiplexing that included samples with 0, 3, 8, and 24 hours of SPARK or SPARKEL depletion” and similarly in the figure legend. The time points are unrelated to natural egress because the experiment was terminated at 32 hours post-infection, which is earlier than the window typically used to study natural egress under these conditions (40-48 hours post-infection). We chose to terminate the experiment before natural egress to better localize phosphopeptide changes related to SPARK depletion. The phosphoproteome undergoes dramatic reorganization during egress due to the activity of myriad kinases and phosphatases (see PMID: 35976251, 37933960, and 36265000), which would have likely complicated the signal.</p>
<p>A pivotal result motivating time-course experiments and analysis was that SPARK/SPARKEL's role in egress and invasion emerges only after an extended depletion period (Figure 2E–J, first submission lines 126-145). The 24h depletion was used in the experimental system that first identified SPARK as a regulator of egress, which motivated our initial experiments, as stated in the first submission lines 126-144 and 149-151. We draw attention to the observation that SPARK and SPARKEL phenotypes develop over time in the first submission, lines 137-145. The role for SPARK/SPARKEL in egress/invasion does not manifest at 3h depletion; it manifests at 24h depletion. To ensure that this point is not overlooked by the reader, we have created a new heading in the Results section (SPARK and SPARKEL depletion phenotypes develop over time) for the paragraph that was previously lines 137-145. The remainder of the manuscript integrates data from proteomic, genetic, and cell-based assays across temporal dimensions to build a working model of how the phenotypes associated with SPARK depletion develop over time.</p>
<p>Underpinning this comment is an assumption that phosphopeptides that decrease the most rapidly following a kinase’s depletion are direct substrates, whereas phosphopeptides that decrease with slower kinetics are not. This is not always the case. Consider a kinase that phosphorylates sites on substrate A and substrate B. The site on substrate A is also the target of a phosphatase, whereas the site on substrate B is recalcitrant to phosphatase activity. If the kinase were inhibited, then the site on substrate A would be actively dephosphorylated. As measured by a phosphoproteomics experiment, the abundance of the substrate A phosphopeptide would drop rapidly due to the inactivity of the kinase and activity of the phosphatase. In the text, we called such sites “constitutively regulated” or dynamic—they are actively dephosphorylated and phosphorylated within a short timeframe. The phosphosite on substrate B is comparatively static; once it is phosphorylated by the kinase, it is unaffected by subsequent inhibition of the kinase. Only newly synthesized substrate B molecules would be affected by kinase inhibition. As measured by a phosphoproteomics experiment, the abundance of the substrate B phosphopeptide would drop more gradually after kinase inhibition, as the unphosphorylated peptide is found only on newly synthesized proteins that were not previously exposed to kinase activity. An example of the scenario described for substrate A would be that of yeast Cdk1 T14/Y15, which is phosphorylated by Wee1 and dephosphorylated by Cdc25 (e.g. PMID: 7880537). An example of the scenario described for substrate B would be that of the human PKA C activation loop T197, which is phosphorylated by PDK1 and is phosphatase-resistant under physiological conditions (e.g. PMID: 22493239, 15533936).</p>
<p>Both substrate A and B may be “direct” and functionally relevant targets of the kinase. Categorizing substrates as “immediate” is comparatively less informative in this context (although it may be relevant when studying fast, synchronized processes with high temporal resolution, such as induced Plasmodium spp. gametocyte activation or stimulation of T. gondii secretion). Furthermore, our earlier experiments had shown that the role for SPARK/SPARKEL in motility manifests after 3h depletion and is complete by 24h depletion. By this logic, we were most interested in the candidates showing differences at these time points. We conducted proximity labeling experiments to identify the overlap of proteins that exhibited SPARK-dependent decreases in the global proteomics and were also proximal to SPARK in space (first submission Figure 3I and lines 260-275), thus revealing a prioritized list of candidates, which included PKG and PKA. When technically feasible, we included a temporal dimension to follow-up experiments, rather than relying on a 24h terminal comparison (e.g. Figure 4E–H, Figure 5D–E, Figure 7D–F, Figure 7I–K; all first submission).</p>

<p>Fig2 (B and C). What antibodies had been used to detect tagged proteins? There is a concern regarding the use of multiple tags attached to the same protein to the point that it doubles the size of the studied protein. The switch of the mobility of the SPARK and SPARKEL on the WB due to a change in MW adds to the confusion. Furthermore, the study did not use all the fused epitopes (e.g., HA). At the same time, the same V5 tag was used to detect two factors in the same parasite. Although the controls are provided, it does not eliminate the possibility that the second band on the WB results from one protein degradation rather than the presence of two individual proteins. Different tags should be used to confirm the co-expression of two proteins. Panel E is missing the X-axis label.</p>

<p>Figure 2B was incorrectly labeled; the labels corresponding to SPARK and SPARKEL were switched. We corrected this error in the revised figures. The antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-V5 as described in the key resources table of the first submission. We added “V5” to Figure 2A and 2B. Regarding the effect of the tagging payload attached to the proteins, we have included in all assays a control relative to a parental strain (TIR1) without a tagging payload, and additionally included internal controls within tagged strains to calculate dependency of a phenotype on IAA treatment. The western blots in Figure 2B and 2C are from two different strains and experiments. The strains and experiments are described in the first submission main text (lines 113-124), the figure legend (lines 1847-1850), the key resources table, and the methods (lines 650-664, 872-891). A description of the SPARK-AID/SPARKEL-mNG strain was included in the key resources table but omitted in the methods. We therefore added the following section to the Methods:</p>
<p>“SPARKEL-V5-mNG-Ty/SPARK-V5-mAID-HA/RHΔku80Δhxgprt/TIR1</p>
<p>The HiT vector cutting unit gBlock for SPARKEL (P1) was cloned into the pALH193 HiT empty vector. The vector was linearized with BsaI and co-transfected with the pSS014 Cas9 expression plasmid into SPARK-V5-mAID-HA/RHΔku80Δhxgprt/TIR1 parasites. Clones were selected with 1 µM pyrimethamine and isolated via limiting dilution to generate the SPARKEL-V5-mNG-Ty/SPARK-V5-mAID-HA/RHΔku80Δhxgprt/TIR1 strain. Clones were verified by PCR amplification and sequencing of the junction between the 3′ end of SPARKEL (5’-GGGAGGCCACAACGGCGC-3’) and 5′ end of the protein tag (5’-gggggtcggtcatgttacgt-3’).”</p>
<p>To clarify the expected MW of each species, we have added the following text to the Methods:</p>
<p>“The expected molecular weight of SPARKEL-V5-HaloTag-mAID-Ty is 66 kDa, from the 42.7 kDa tagging payload and 23.3 kDa protein sequence. The expected molecular weight of SPARK-V5-mCherry-HA is 89.7 kDa, from the 31.9 kDa tagging payload and 57.8 kDa protein sequence. The expected molecular weight of SPARK-V5-mAID-HA is 71.3 kDa, from the 13.5 kDa tagging payload and 57.8 kDa protein sequence. The expected molecular weight of SPARKEL-V5-mNG-Ty is 55.2 kDa, from the 31.9 kDa tagging payload and 23.3 kDa protein sequence.”</p>
<p>SPARK and SPARKEL are lowly expressed, which may have been compounded by basal degradation due to the AID tag (see for example Figure 3—figure supplement 1D of the first submission). We attempted several immunoblot conditions and antibodies, and only the V5 antibody proved effective in recognizing these proteins above the limit of detection. For this reason, we included an additional single-tagged control in each immunoblot experiment. Uncropped images of the blots are included in the first submission as Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E and as Figure 2 source data. We added the following statement to the results section of the text:</p>
<p>“However, SPARK and SPARKEL abundances are low and approach the limit of detection. We could only detect each protein by the V5 epitope. Although our experiments included single-tagged controls, we cannot formally eliminate the possibility that SPARK-AID yields degradation products that run at the expected molecular weight of SPARKEL. More sensitive methods, such as targeted mass spectrometry, may be required to measure the absolute abundance and stoichiometries of SPARK and SPARKEL.”</p>
<p>We added “h +IAA” to the x-axis of panel 2E.</p>

<p>Fig. 3. There is plentiful proteomic data on the factor-depleted parasites. Can it be used to confirm the co-degradation of the SPARK/SPARKEL complex components? This figure mainly includes quality control data that can be moved to Supplement. Did you detect SPARKEL in the TurboID experiment described in panel I? The plot shows only an AGC kinase.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>SPARK and SPARKEL are lowly expressed, and we often do not detect SPARK or SPARKEL peptides with quantification values in complex samples (such as global depletion proteomes and phosphoproteomes; IPs and streptavidin pull-downs are comparatively less complex, with IPs being the least complex samples). We discussed this caveat in the first submission lines 178-186. To additionally clarify this point, we have added “We were unable to measure SPARK or SPARKEL abundances in this proteome” earlier in the text.</p>
<p>We consider the figure panels relevant to the discussion in the text.</p>
<p>SPARKEL was not quantified in the SPARK-TurboID experiment (Supplementary File 2). We have added “SPARKEL was not quantified in this experiment” to the text. “Not quantified” is a different outcome from “quantified but not enriched”. The interaction between SPARK and SPARKEL is supported by five other independent interaction experiments in which SPARKEL was quantified (Figure 1A, 1D, 1E; and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). The added insight from the SPARK proximity labeling experiments comes from integration with the global proteomics, which suggests that AGC kinases are in proximity to SPARK and exhibit SPARK-dependent stability and hence activity. The logic of the proximity labeling experiment is described in lines 258-275 of the first submission.</p>

<p>Fig. 6G is missing deltaBDF1 control for unbiased evaluation of the SPARK KD effect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The logic of this experiment was to evaluate whether excess differentiation caused by SPARK and PKA C3 depletion (Figure 6A and 6B) was dependent on the BFD1 circuit. The ∆bfd1 phenotype is well-established under these experimental conditions: parasites lacking BFD1 do not differentiate under spontaneous or alkaline conditions (e.g. PMID: 31955846, 37081202, 37770433). Parasites lacking BFD1 do not differentiate when SPARK and PKA C3 are depleted, suggesting that differentiation caused by SPARK or PKA C3 depletion occurs through the BFD1 circuit. If differentiation caused by SPARK or PKA C3 depletion did not depend on the BFD1 circuit, we might have observed differentiation in the SPARK- and PKA C3-AID/∆bfd1 mutants.</p>
<p>To clarify this point, we have changed the first sentences of the last paragraph in the results section Depletion of SPARK, SPARKEL, or PKA C3 promotes chronic differentiation: “To assess whether excess differentiation caused by SPARK and PKA C3 depletion is dependent on a previously characterized transcriptional regulator of differentiation, BFD1 (Waldman et al., 2020), we knocked out the BFD1 CDS with a sortable dTomato cassette in the SPARK- and PKA C3-AID strains (Figure 6–figure supplement 1). The resulting SPARK- and PKA C3-AID/∆bfd1 mutants failed to undergo differentiation as measured by cyst wall staining (Figure 6G–H), suggesting that differentiation caused by depletion of these kinases depends on the BFD1 circuit.”</p>

<p>Lines 239-242. The logic behind the categories of &quot;constitutively regulated sites&quot; and &quot;newly synthesized proteins dependent on SPARK activation&quot; is odd. The former (3h treatment) represents the SPARK-specific events (even though it should be shortened to 1-2h), while an 8h treatment is already contaminated with secondary effects. Since Toxoplasma divides asynchronously, the &quot;newly synthesized&quot; proteins will be present at the time. Also, the protein phosphorylation does not always lead to substrate activation; it can be repressive, too.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We describe the logic in response to a comment above (substrate A vs. substrate B). It is correct that T. gondii divides asynchronously, with a cell cycle of approximately 8 hours, and 60% of parasites in G1 at a given time (PMID: 11420103). The proteomics experiments measure peptide and protein abundances at a population level. Newly synthesized proteins will be present at all time points; but the proportion of proteins synthesized after SPARK depletion relative to proteins synthesized before SPARK depletion will increase over time.</p>
<p>We moved lines 238-243 from the first submission to the Discussion.</p>
<p>It is accurate that phosphorylation does not always lead to substrate activation; it can also be repressive or not change substrate behavior. However, in the case of protein kinases, activation loop phosphorylation is highly correlated with activation (e.g. PMID: 15350212, 31521607).</p>

<p>Line 250-252: Because the SPARK degradation did not affect intracellular replication, SPARK is unlikely to affect cell cycle-specific phosphorylation.</p>

<p>To parallel the prior sentences describing different SPARK-dependent down-regulated clusters, we truncated this sentence to “The final cluster of depleted phosphopeptides, Cluster 4, only exhibits down-regulation at 8h of IAA treatment.”</p>
<p>SPARKEL depletion did not significantly affect intracellular replication under the time frames investigated here (approximately 25 hours post-invasion; Figure 2D).

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Authors should show alignment of SPARKEL with Elongin C. Are key residues conserved?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added an alignment of the SKP1/BTB/POZ domains of Homo sapiens elongin C, S. cerevisiae elongin C, and T. gondii SPARKEL as Figure 1—figure supplement 1B. This panel highlights elongin B interface, cullin binding sites, and target protein binding sites based on the human elongin C annotation. As discussed below, these interfaces may not be functionally conserved in T. gondii. Ultimately, future mechanistic and structural studies beyond the scope of the current work will be required to determine how SPARK and SPARKEL physically interact. The Discussion states, “further biochemical studies are required to discern the regulatory interactions between SPARK and SPARKEL” (lines 590-591).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The failure to identify other Elongin B/C complex members should be addressed by direct IP analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, elongin C has traditionally been characterized as a component of multisubunit complexes comprising Elongin A/B/C or Elongin BC/cullin/SOCS that regulate transcription or function as ubiquitin ligases, respectively (for a review, PMID: 22649776). We see two major issues when attempting to generalize these results to apicomplexan parasites. First, nearly all studies of the function of elongin C have been conducted in a single eukaryotic supergroup (the opisthokonts, including yeast and metazoans). The majority of eukaryotic diversity exists in other supergroups, including the SAR supergroup to which apicomplexans such as T. gondii belong (PMID: 31606140). Proteins with elongin C domains may serve alternative and unexplored functions in non-opisthokont unicellular eukaryotes. Second (in support of the first), we were unable to find orthologs of many of the opisthokont complex members in T. gondii, as systematically described below.</p>
<p>By BLAST, the most similar protein to SPARKEL in S. cerevisiae is ELC1 (YPL046C), with a BLAST E = 0.003. The next most similar protein was SCF ubiquitin ligase subunit SKP1 (YDR328C) with an E value of 0.62. ELC1 is 99 amino acids. The Elongin C (IPR039948) and SKP1/BTB/POZ superfamily domains (IPR011333) span most of this sequence. SPARKEL is 216 amino acids; the Elongin C and  SKP1/BTB/POZ superfamily domains occupy the C-terminal half of the protein. The N-terminal domain of SPARKEL may be important for its function; however, future work is required to address this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Elongin B: Elongin B is not found universally amongst even opisthokonts; fungi and choanoflagellates lack obvious orthologs. The most similar T. gondii protein to human Elongin B (Q15370) by BLAST is TGME49_223125 (E = 0.017), an apicoplast ubiquitin-like protein PUBL (PMID: 28655825, 33053376). TGME49_223125 has a C-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (IPR000626) but no ELOB domain (IPR039049); indeed, no T. gondii protein has an ELOB domain that can be identified by sequence searching. Given the lack of similarity between EloB and TGME49_223125, as well as this protein’s possible red algal endosymbiont origin, we consider it an unlikely ortholog of EloB and topologically unlikely to  interact with the SPARK/SPARKEL complex. We did not detect TGME49_223125 in SPARK or SPARKEL IPs (Supplementary File 1).</p>
<p>Elongin A: T. gondii appears to lack a human elongin A ortholog (Q14241) on the basis of sequence similarity. The most similar T. gondii protein to yeast Elongin A (O59671) by BLAST is TGME49_299230 (E = 0.022). Yeast EloA is 263 amino acids. TGME49_299230 is 1101 amino acids and does not have an EloA domain (IPR010684), suggesting it is not a true EloA ortholog.</p>
<p>Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS): T. gondii appears to lack human SOCS1 or SOCS2 orthologs (O15524 and O14508) on the basis of sequence similarity. We were unable to identify T. gondii proteins with SOCS domains (PF07525, SM00253, SM00969, and SSF158235).</p>
<p>Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL): T. gondii appears to lack a human VHL ortholog (P40337) on the basis of sequence similarity.  We were unable to identify T. gondii proteins with VHL domains (IPR024048, IPR024053, PF01847, and SSF49468).</p>
<p>Cul-2/5: Cullins appeared early in the eukaryotic radiation (PMID: 21554755), and thus T. gondii possesses several. Since the ELC complex has been best characterized with human cullin-2 (Q13617) and cullin-5 (Q93034), we searched for orthologs of these proteins and identified TGME49_289310, TGME49_289310, and TGME49_316660. TGME49_289310 functionally resembles cullin-1 of the SCF complex (PMID: 31348812). None of these proteins were enriched in the SPARK or SPARKEL IPs (Supplementary Table 1).</p>
<p>Rbx1: We searched for human Rbx1 orthologs (P62877) and identified TGME49_213690, which functionally resembles Rbx1 of the SCF complex (PMID: 31348812); as well as several other RING proteins (TGME49_267520, TGME49_277740, TGME49_261990, and TGME49_232160) that were not found in the SPARK or SPARKEL IPs (Supplementary File 1).</p>
<p>Rbx2: We searched for human Rbx2 orthologs (Q9UBF6) and identified several RING proteins (TGME49_285190, TGME49_254700, TGME49_292340, TGME49_226740, TGME49_244610, and TGME49_304460) that were not found in the SPARK or SPARKEL IPs (Supplementary File 1). No T. gondii protein has an Rbx2 domain (cd16466) that can be identified by sequence searching.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we conducted “direct IP analysis” (Figure 1A, 1D; Figure 1-supplement 1A) of the SPARK and SPARKEL complex in the first submission of the manuscript. The observation that SPARK and SPARKEL form strong interactions was validated in cellulo via proximity labeling (Figure 1E; Figure 1-supplement 1B) in the first submission of the manuscript. These results are described together in the results section SPARK complexes with an elongin-like protein, SPARKEL (lines 75-110, first submission of manuscript). The failure to identify an interaction between SPARKEL and Elongin B/C complex members in T. gondii may be due to the observation that Elongin B and several ELC complex members do not exist in most eukaryotes, including T. gondii. We added the sentences “The function of proteins with Elongin C-like domains has not been widely investigated in unicellular eukaryotes” to the Results and “However, the SPARK and SPARKEL IPs and proximity experiments failed to identify obvious components of ubiquitin ligase complexes” to the Discussion.</p>

<p>(3) PKA and PKG half-lives should be measured as well as their transcript abundances.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The finding that PKA C1 and PKG protein abundances decreased upon SPARK/SPARKEL depletion was internally consistent across experiments. This down-regulation may be due to transcriptional, translational, or post-translational mechanisms. We measured PKG and PKA C1 transcript abundances in SPARK-AID and TIR1 parasites after 24 hours of IAA treatment using RT-qPCR. We did not detect significant differences in transcript levels of the queried kinases. These findings suggest that SPARK depletion leads to PKG and PKA down-regulation through post-transcriptional mechanisms. Translational control is normally enacted globally, for example through regulation of eukaryotic translation factors (PMID: 15459663). The rapid and specific down-regulation of PKG and PKA C1 would suggest that the kinase abundance levels are regulated by non-global translational mechanisms (e.g. mRNA-specific) or rather post-translational mechanisms.</p>
<p>Substantial additional work is required to determine protein half-lives in eukaryotic parasites. In our discussion of possible mechanisms and models, we were agnostic as to the cause of reduced PKG and PKA abundances upon SPARK depletion. We note in the discussion, “The cause for reduction of PKA C1 and PKG levels requires further study” (lines 541-542).</p>
