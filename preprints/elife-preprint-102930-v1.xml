<title>Abstract</title><p>The insulator protein CTCF is essential for mediating chromatin loops and regulating gene expression. While it is established that DNA methylation hinders CTCF binding, the impacts of this methylation-sensitive CTCF binding on chromatin architecture and transcription are poorly defined. Here, we used a selective DNMT1 inhibitor to investigate the characteristics and functions of ‘reactivated’ CTCF peaks resulting from global DNA demethylation. We found that reactivated peaks preferentially form chromatin loops on gene bodies and interact with highly-looping partner peaks located in regions of active chromatin. Notably, both reactivated CTCF peaks and their highly-looping partners are enriched near nuclear speckles, condensate bodies implicated in transcription and splicing. Utilizing targeted protein degradation, we specifically depleted CTCF and nuclear speckles to elucidate their functional interplay. By degrading CTCF upon DNMT1 inhibition, we revealed that CTCF is important for DNMT1 inhibitor-dependent interactions between chromatin and speckle proteins. Moreover, we found that CTCF promotes the activation of genes near speckles upon DNMT1 inhibition. Conversely, acute depletion of nuclear speckles revealed that they influence transcription but do not maintain CTCF binding or looping. Collectively, our study suggests a model wherein DNA methylation prevents spurious CTCF occupancy and interactions with regulatory elements near nuclear speckles, yet CTCF looping is robust towards the loss of speckles.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The mammalian genome is organized at multiple length scales into compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs) and chromatin loops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. This three-dimensional chromatin folding contributes to essential cellular processes such as transcription and DNA replication and is actively maintained by protein cofactors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The architectural protein CTCF establishes the anchors of many DNA loops and TADs likely by blocking loop extrusion by cohesin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Consequently, perturbation of CTCF binding sites at domain boundaries can lead to aberrant cross-domain enhancer-promoter contacts, which have been linked to gene misexpression in cancer and developmental disorders <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Furthermore, CTCF binding and looping on or near genes can directly enforce enhancer-promoter loops and facilitate differential splicing and polyadenylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Although these examples demonstrate that CTCF can modulate transcription in specific contexts, acute depletion of CTCF only leads to moderate transcriptional defects, highlighting the complex and nuanced roles of CTCF in regulating gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>CTCF binding is sensitive to DNA methylation, and consequently global DNA demethylation ‘reactivates’ hundreds to thousands of previously masked CTCF peaks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. However, these reactivated CTCF sites comprise only a small subset of all potential methylated CTCF sites, suggesting that DNA methylation serves as a specialized mechanism to regulate specific CTCF binding sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. While methylation-sensitive CTCF peaks have been linked to gene expression and mRNA processing in some instances,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> the functions of most methylation-sensitive CTCF peaks are unknown. Moreover, the broader impacts of reactivated CTCF binding upon global DNA demethylation on chromatin looping have been largely unexplored.</p>
<p>In this study, we employed a selective inhibitor of DNMT1, the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, to induce genome-wide DNA demethylation and investigated the chromatin looping patterns of the resulting reactivated CTCF peaks. We found that reactivated CTCF peaks within genes form loops to highly-looping partner peaks located in active chromatin regions. Remarkably, reactivated CTCF peaks and their highly-looping partners are located close to nuclear speckles, condensate bodies of protein and RNA that have been implicated in transcription and splicing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Subnuclear localization relative to nuclear landmarks such as nuclear speckles is linked to genome structure and function, so we explored this relationship further by developing acute degron systems for both CTCF and speckles. Through these experiments, we clarify the directionality of the relationship between CTCF and speckles and glean novel insights into how methylation-sensitive CTCF contributes to chromatin structure and gene expression.</p>

<title>DNMT1 inhibition reactivates CTCF peaks and loops on gene bodies</title>
<p>Loss of DNA methylation leads to increased CTCF occupancy at hundreds to thousands of CTCF sites depending on the cell type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, but a global understanding of their looping patterns and functions is lacking. Recently, selective, noncovalent DNMT1 inhibitors (e.g., GSK3484862) have become available, enabling dynamic control of DNA methylation with fewer undesirable effects such as DNA damage and cytotoxicity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Consequently, we employed these new DNMT1 inhibitors to probe the functions and looping patterns of methylation-sensitive CTCF sites.</p>
<p>We treated K562 and HCT116 cells with GSK3484862 (here after referred to as DNMT1i, 10 µM) for three days, and performed CTCF ChIP-seq and HiChIP to investigate CTCF-associated changes in chromatin looping (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Under these conditions, DNMT1i treatment led to minimal growth defects in both cell types (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1A</xref>). Consistent with prior studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, DNMT1i treatment increased CTCF binding at thousands of sites, previously termed “reactivated peaks” due to their overlap with CTCF peaks in other cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B,C</xref>, 2,079 up- and 2 down-regulated in K562, 6,686 up- and 328 down-regulated in HCT116). As expected, reactivated CTCF sites were largely methylated in wild-type cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1B</xref>), and many CTCF binding motifs enriched within these peak regions were methylated at two key CpG sites implicated in CTCF binding (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1C</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>

</fig>
<p>We next evaluated whether these reactivated CTCF peaks form chromatin loops. CTCF HiChIP revealed that a large subset of reactivated peaks resides within at least one loop anchor and these are henceforth called “looping” peaks (see Methods) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. An example of reactivated looping CTCF peaks is shown at the <italic>PCDHA</italic> locus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). On average, loops that are anchored by reactivated peaks increase in strength upon DNMT1 inhibition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). We next sought to evaluate these findings using our published Hi-C dataset following DNMT1 inhibition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Specifically, we analyzed Hi-C interaction strength using standard aggregate pileup analysis over all reactivated CTCF sites identified in our ChIP-seq data. Consistent with our Hi-ChIP data, this analysis revealed an increase in Hi-C interaction signal at reactivated peaks following 3 days of DNTM1 inhibition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>We next characterized the genomic annotations of looping and nonlooping reactivated CTCF peaks. Consistent with previous findings using azacitidine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, loss of DNA methylation through DNMT1i treatment led to the preferential reactivation of CTCF peaks on gene bodies, particularly in non-intron regions (exons, promoters, and transcription termination sites (TTS), <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1D, S1E</xref>). Notably, this enrichment on gene bodies was particularly pronounced looping reactivated CTCF peaks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1D, S1E, S1F</xref>), highlighting an underappreciated propensity for CTCF peaks on gene bodies to engage in chromatin loops. Altogether, selective DNMT1 inhibition leads to the emergence of thousands of reactivated CTCF peaks on gene bodies that engage in new chromatin interactions.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Reactivated CTCF peaks interact with highly-looping partners near nuclear speckles</title>
<p>We next scrutinized the CTCF partners that loop to reactivated CTCF peaks. Notably, the CTCF partners of reactivated peaks tend to engage in a greater total number of different loops compared to all CTCF peaks (i.e., have more looping partners, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), particularly for K562 cells. This trend is in part driven by the tendency of non-intronic gene body CTCF peaks to more frequently participate in loops with highly-looping CTCF partners in comparison to intronic or intergenic CTCF peaks (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2A</xref>). To characterize these highly-looping partners, we ranked all CTCF peaks by the number of different partners they interact with and called those with the most partners ‘highly-looping’, analogously to how superenhancers or supersilencers were previously characterized (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2B</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. HiChIP loops between reactivated peaks and highly-looping peaks increased in strength upon DNMT1 inhibition, consistent with increased interactions between these sites (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2C</xref>). The propensity for a given CTCF site to engage in many contacts may reflect architectural stripes, a chromatin structural feature identified from Hi-C data that is postulated to result from persistent loop extrusion at a single region <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Stripe anchors are enriched for chromatin accessibility and histone modifications associated with active enhancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Similarly, regions near highly-looping CTCF peaks are accessible and enriched for active chromatin marks such as H3K9ac and H3K27ac (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Furthermore, based on previously published Hi-C data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, highly-looping CTCF sites have a stronger propensity to engage in chromatin interactions compared to ordinary CTCF sites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). In addition, stripe anchors identified from these Hi-C data also reside closer to highly-looping CTCF peaks than all peaks, consistent with the similarities between these features (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2D</xref>). Thus, these results show that upon DNA demethylation, reactivated CTCF sites form loops to highly-looping partners associated with active regulatory marks and stripe anchors.</p>

To do so, we investigated their distribution across genomic subcompartments that exhibit variable transcriptional activity and association with nuclear landmarks, such as the nuclear lamina or nuclear speckles. In particular, we found a striking enrichment of reactivated CTCF peaks and highly-looping CTCF peaks in the A1 subcompartment of the genome, which is differentiated from the A2 subcompartment largely due to its localization near nuclear speckles (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2E</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that nuclear speckles are hubs of DNA-DNA contacts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Additionally, CTCF can form stress-responsive clusters near nuclear speckles in some cell types, and genomic subcompartments associated with speckles have been correlated with increased CTCF binding and looping <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. However, a direct connection between nuclear speckles and CTCF binding and looping has not been extensively explored.</p>
<p>To determine if reactivated peaks and highly-looping CTCF peaks are preferentially located near nuclear speckles, we performed Cut&amp;Tag for SON, a core speckle protein, in K562 and HCT116 cells with and without DNMT1 inhibition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Consistent with localization near speckles, reactivated peaks appeared in regions of higher SON signal compared to all CTCF peaks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2F</xref>). Notably, this trend is strong for looping reactivated CTCF peaks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>). This enrichment of looping reactivated peaks near speckles is further corroborated by publicly available SON TSA-seq data in wildtype cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2G</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Thus, reactivated CTCF peaks reside closer to nuclear speckles than non-reactivated peaks.</p>
<p>Strikingly, relative to all CTCF peaks, highly-looping CTCF peaks are enriched at nuclear speckles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2H</xref>). More broadly, the number of different loops a CTCF peak engages in and their corresponding strength are positively correlated with SON Cut&amp;Tag signal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2I</xref>). In addition, we observed that CTCF peaks with strong Cut&amp;Tag SON signal preferentially engage in strong shorter-range interactions in published Hi-C interaction data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2J</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Overall, our results reveal that reactivated CTCF peaks interact with highly-looping partners located near nuclear speckles.</p>

<title>DNMT1i-induced gene activation and speckle association depend on CTCF</title>
<p>Our data revealed that CTCF reactivation and looping are highly correlated with nuclear speckle association. As such, we next sought to study the nature of this relationship through degrading either CTCF or nuclear speckles. We first generated a HaloTAG-CTCF homozygous knock-in HCT116 cell line, which enabled the inducible recruitment of CTCF to the VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase upon addition of the small molecule HaloPROTAC3, causing subsequent proteolytic degradation within 8 hours (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3A</xref>). We then performed SON Cut&amp;Tag after pretreating our CTCF-HaloTag knockin cells with HaloPROTAC3 or vehicle for 8 hours before co-treating with DNMT1i or vehicle for 24 hours (32 hours total for HaloPROTAC3 treatment). This shorter timepoint was used to capture direct effects of CTCF degradation and DNA demethylation as well as avoid toxicity caused by CTCF depletion. We found that reactivated CTCF peaks gain SON Cut&amp;Tag signal upon DNMT1i treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). This gain in SON signal is blocked when CTCF is degraded by HaloPROTAC3 treatment, suggesting that speckle association at these reactivated sites is dependent on CTCF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Thus, SON associates with reactivated CTCF peaks in a CTCF-dependent manner.</p>

<p>Because reactivated peaks fail to engage with nuclear speckles if CTCF is not present, we hypothesized that gene activation induced upon loss of DNA methylation may be dampened in the absence of CTCF. Prior work has suggested that cell-type specific DNA methylation may protect a “labile” set of CTCF peaks from reactivation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> and that methylation-dependent CTCF occupancy on gene bodies has been linked to changes in gene processing, but a global understanding of the functions of methylation-sensitive CTCF peaks on transcription remains lacking <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Thus, we tested whether reactivated CTCF peaks promote gene activation upon DNMT1 inhibition.</p>
<p>To assess the role of CTCF in enabling DNMT1i-dependent gene activation, we pretreated our CTCF-HaloTag knockin cells with HaloPROTAC3 or vehicle for 8 hours and then co-treated the cells with DNMT1i or vehicle for 24 hours before performing RNA-seq (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Consistent with prior studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, acute CTCF degradation altered the expression of hundreds of genes with approximately equal numbers up- and down-regulated (488 up-regulated, 338 down-regulated, Padj &lt;0.05, |log<sub>2</sub>fold-change| &gt; 0.5) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3B</xref>), with downregulated genes possessing higher baseline levels of CTCF at their promoters (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3C</xref>). As expected, DNMT1i treatment in this cell line for 24 hours primarily resulted in gene upregulation, with 135 genes upregulated and 8 genes downregulated (Padj &lt;0.05, |log<sub>2</sub>fold-change| &gt; 0.5) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3B</xref>).</p>
<p>We focused our analysis on genes that were differentially expressed in DNMT1i versus DMSO treatment in the presence of CTCF (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3B, left</xref>). Using K-means clustering, we identified four gene clusters within this group defined by unique z-score normalized expression patterns across the conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Clusters 1, 2, and 4 comprise genes that increase in expression upon DNMT1 inhibition, whereas Cluster 3 contains the few genes that decrease in expression upon DNMT1 inhibition. Moreover, genes in Cluster 1 are upregulated by CTCF depletion, whereas genes within Clusters 2, 3, and 4 are unaffected by CTCF depletion alone.</p>
<p>We focused on Clusters 2 and 4, which contain lowly-expressed genes that are upregulated upon DNMT1 inhibition and unaffected by CTCF depletion in the absence of DNMT1i (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3D</xref>). Significantly, while genes in Cluster 4 are upregulated upon DNMT1 inhibition with or without CTCF present, genes in Cluster 2 depend on CTCF for DNMT1i-mediated upregulation. To determine how CTCF binding might be related to the observed changes in gene expression, we performed CTCF ChIP-seq in our HaloTag-CTCF HCT116 cells following 24 hours of DNMT1i or vehicle treatment. Notably, genes in Cluster 2 preferentially gained CTCF occupancy upon DNMT1 inhibition compared to genes in other clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D, right</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3E</xref>). Thus, these data demonstrate that a subset of genes enriched for CTCF reactivation depend on CTCF for expression upon DNMT1i treatment.</p>
<p>We next assessed the correlation between CTCF-dependent genes and speckle association. Intriguingly, genes in Cluster 2 have higher SON TSA-seq levels than genes in Cluster 4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>), while genes in cluster 1, which are upregulated by CTCF depletion alone, are closest to nuclear speckles. Moreover, genes in cluster 2 gain a modest level of SON Cut&amp;Tag signal upon DNMT1i treatment (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3F</xref>). Taken together, these experiments show that CTCF is necessary for both gene activation and speckle protein association upon DNMT1 inhibition.</p>

<title>Acute disruption of nuclear speckles alters gene expression without disrupting CTCF</title>
<p>To further explore the observed connection between speckles and CTCF looping, we tested whether nuclear speckles play a causal role in promoting CTCF occupancy and/or looping. To accomplish this, we sought to acutely degrade speckles to evaluate whether speckles actively maintain CTCF loops while mitigating confounding factors associated with mitotic arrest caused by long-term SON depletion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Consequently, we engineered a K562 knock-in cell line with the core speckle proteins, SON and SRRM2, both endogenously tagged with FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> for use with the dTAG degradation system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>.

Treatment of the K562 FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> double knock-in cell line with dTAG-13 resulted in near-complete degradation of both SON and SRRM2 within 6 hours (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4A</xref>).</p>

<p>We next assessed if speckle disruption directly alters gene expression by performing RNA-seq after 6 hours of dTAG-13 treatment. Upon speckle degradation, 541 genes were down-regulated and 184 genes were up-regulated (padj &lt; 0.05, |log<sub>2</sub>fold-change| &gt; 0.25) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4B</xref>). Consistent with a role of nuclear speckles in mediating active transcription, a large majority of down-regulated genes were located within the closest decile to nuclear speckles by TSA-seq (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4C</xref>), and genes with the highest SON Cut&amp;Tag signal exhibited the strongest decrease in expression (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4D</xref>). These results show that disrupting nuclear speckles has immediate effects on RNA abundance.</p>
<p>To determine whether speckle disruption alters CTCF binding and/or looping, we performed CTCF ChIP-seq and HiChIP in the speckle dTAG cell line after treatment with dTAG-13 or DMSO for 6 hours. In contrast to the immediate transcriptional effects, CTCF occupancy remained unchanged upon speckle degradation, with only 2 significantly downregulated peaks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4E</xref>). CTCF HiChIP also revealed that loop strength was largely unchanged across speckle Cut&amp;Tag and TSA-seq quantiles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4F</xref>) despite a positive correlation between speckle association and baseline loop strength (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref>). Even after 12 hours of dTAG treatment, there was only a very subtle decrease in CTCF looping near speckles (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4F</xref>). In addition, changes in gene expression were not associated with changes in loop strength or CTCF binding (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4G, H</xref>). Conversely, depleting CTCF for 24 hours in our HaloTag-CTCF HCT116 knockin cell line did not noticeably change speckle morphology (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4I</xref>). Altogether, acute disruption of nuclear speckles did not appreciably disrupt CTCF binding or looping, suggesting that maintenance of 3D CTCF loop structure is independent of speckle association. This complements our finding that conversely, speckle association depends upon reactivated CTCF.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>DNA methylation accounts for much of the variation in CTCF binding across cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, but the functions and features of methylation-sensitive CTCF peaks are incompletely understood. Here we leveraged a selective DNMT1 inhibitor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> to gain new insights into how reactivated CTCF peaks interface with chromatin looping and transcription. This new inhibitor is a valuable tool for reactivating CTCF without the confounding effects caused by the covalent nature and toxicity of earlier hypomethylating agents.</p>
<p>We found that reactivated CTCF peaks preferentially form loops on gene bodies and interact with promiscuous partner peaks at stripe anchors. Architectural stripes may contribute to transcription by promoting enhancer contacts with gene bodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, and may also represent a mechanism to poise transcription <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Thus, we propose that reactivated peaks enable transcriptional activation by interacting with regulatory elements through highly-looping CTCF partner peaks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). However, DNA demethylation causes pleiotropic effects ranging from changes in gene expression to transcription factor binding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, and we cannot rule out that these other features could contribute to the effects we observe.</p>
<p>Strikingly, reactivated CTCF peaks and their highly-looping partners are located near nuclear speckles, consistent with prior studies showing that subcompartments near nuclear speckles exhibit increased CTCF binding and looping <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. We first explored this relationship by degrading CTCF and intriguingly observed that reactivated CTCF peaks gain SON Cut&amp;Tag signal upon DNMT1 inhibition in a CTCF-dependent manner, indicating a functional tie between reactivated CTCF and speckles. This is consistent with a recent preprint reporting that CTCF helps establish basal speckle-gene contacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Additionally, our CTCF degron experiments demonstrate that a large fraction of genes that are differentially expressed upon DNMT1 inhibition depends on CTCF for up-regulation. These genes preferentially gain CTCF binding and are located near nuclear speckles. Consequently, CTCF peaks that are reactivated upon DNMT1 inhibition could facilitate the activation of genes near speckles, perhaps by mediating the engagement of genic CTCF sites with speckle-associated stripe anchors and/or splicing factors, although this model requires further study (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). A role of CTCF in facilitating chromatin loops near speckles is synergistic with proposed models suggesting that intragenic looping contributes to gene splicing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Thus, reactivated CTCF peaks may reorganize genes near nuclear speckles as a means of influencing transcription.</p>
<p>We next studied whether speckles impact CTCF binding or looping by achieving the first acute degradation of nuclear speckles. Previous work knocking down SRRM2 support a causative role of speckles in modulating chromatin structure but did not specifically study changes in CTCF binding or looping <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Although acute disruption of speckles supports their direct involvement in transcription, we observed minimal impacts on CTCF binding or looping. This notion is consistent with recent work showing that CTCF clustering and looping is not dependent on phase separation or nuclear bodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> and that transcriptional disruption does not immediately impact chromatin looping or CTCF binding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Our findings also suggest that the genome interactions disrupted upon SRRM2 depletion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> are not mediated by CTCF or only occur after a longer time. However, it is possible that nuclear speckles contribute to the establishment, but not maintenance, of CTCF loops, which may not be evident in our system due to the short time points employed for speckle degradation. Moreover, other features enriched near speckles, such as open chromatin, high GC content, and active gene expression, could instead contribute to increased CTCF binding and looping near speckles. Overall, our speckle degradation experiments help clarify the directionality of the relationship between speckles and CTCF.</p>
<p>Taken altogether, our findings highlight a potential mechanism through which DNA methylation modulates genome architecture — by protecting a subset of genic CTCF sites from engaging with promiscuous CTCF peaks located near nuclear speckles. In particular, genes near nuclear speckles may be susceptible to activation through CTCF-dependent mechanisms, and thus might require this layer of protective regulation. Furthermore, the GC-rich composition of non-intron gene bodies might increase the likelihood of CTCF motifs in comparison to other genomic regions, increasing the vulnerability of these sites to ectopic CTCF binding. More broadly, our work nominates new functions for the known antagonism between gene body methylation and CTCF occupancy in regulating transcription through remodeling genome architecture.</p>

<title>Calculating looping changes across conditions</title>
<p>To calculate foldchange and mean CPM loop strength between conditions, mango Hichipper output files for individual replicates were input into Diffloop (v 1.16.0) and processed with the loopsmake mango function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. The full loop list was then filtered for loops with FDR &lt;0.01 and with at least 8 PETs across samples for a given cell type and loops that appeared strongly (&gt;5 PETs) in only one replicate but 0 PETS in the other were removed. The quickAssoc function was then used to get loop strength foldchange and CPM values for each loop. Diffloop output files obtained from the summary() function were then intersected with genomic features (such as reactivated peak overlap, subcompartment, Cut&amp;Tag signal) for further analyses using pgltools (v 2.2.0) intersect1D and redundant loops were merged using pgltools (v 2.2.0) merge and files were further processed in python (v 3.7.0) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</ext-link>) with pandas (v1.0.3), matplotlib (v 3.2.1) seaborn (v 0.11.2) and statannot (v 0.2.3) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>RNA-seq processing and differential expression analysis</title>
<p>RNA-seq data were analyzed following Lexogen’s recommended protocol. First, UMIs were extracted with umi-tools (v 1.1.1) extract <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. Adapters were then trimmed with cutadapt (v 2.7) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>.

<p>For gene expression analysis, HTseq – count (v 0.11.2) was used to count reads in genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>.

Hierarchical clustering was performed on the regularized log<sub>2</sub>-transformed counts using Euclidean distance as a metric and the complete clustering method. All genes with both an adjusted <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction, and |log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change)| &gt; 0.5 between wildtype DNMT1i and DMSO were included in the clustered heatmap. The regularized log<sub>2</sub>-transformed counts for the variable genes were grouped by <italic>k</italic>-means clustering (<italic>k</italic> = 4) and the Z-scores for the variable genes, ordered according to their cluster identity, are depicted. For differential exon analysis, Dexseq (v 1.34.1) was used. Files were then imported into R and foldchange values were computed according to the standard Dexseq workflow. BioMart was used to map the genomic ranges for each gene onto RNA-seq differential expression output files. Gene expression changes were compared with Cut&amp;Tag signal and CTCF peak overlap using bedtools (v 2.26.0) map with -o mean.

<p>This study examines the impact of DNA methylation on CTCF binding in two cancer cell lines. Increased CTCF binding sites are enriched in gene bodies, and associate with nuclear speckles, indicating a potential role in increased transcription. However, the association with nuclear speckles needs to be more diligently demonstrated. Thus the strength of the evidence is considered <bold>incomplete</bold>. This work would be made more <bold>valuable</bold> to the community if these claims were buttressed by additional evidence and a deeper discussion of new findings in the light of previous relevant literature. This work will be of interest to the chromosome biology/epigenetics field.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>
Roseman et al. use a new inhibitor of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 to probe the role of methylation on binding of the CTCF protein, which is known to be involved chromatin loop formation. As previous reported, and as expected based on our knowledge that CTCF binding is methylation-sensitive, the authors find that loss of methylation leads to additional CTCF binding sites and increased loop formation. By comparing novel loops with the binding of the pre-mRNA splicing factor SON, which localizes to the nuclear speckle compartment, they propose that these reactivated loops localize to near speckles. This behavior is dependent on CTCF whereas degradation of two speckle proteins does not affect CTCF binding or loop formation. The authors propose a model in which DNA methylation controls the association of genome regions with speckles via CTCF-mediated insulation.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>
The strengths of the study are 1) the use of a new, specific DNMT1 inhibitor and 2) the observation that genes whose expression is sensitive to DNMT1 inhibition and dependent on CTCF (cluster 2) show higher association with SON than genes which are sensitive to DNMT1 inhibition but are CTCF insensitive, is in line with the authors' general model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>
There are a number of significant weaknesses that as a whole undermine many of the key conclusions, including the overall mechanistic model of a direct regulatory role of DNA methylation on CTCF-mediated speckle association of chromatin loops.</p>
<p>(1) The authors frequently make quasi-quantitative statements but do not actually provide the quantitative data, which they actually all have in hand. To give a few examples: &quot;reactivated CTCF sites were largely methylated (p. 4/5), &quot;many CTCF binding motifs enriched...&quot; (p.5), &quot;a large subset of reactivated peaks...&quot;(p.5), &quot;increase in strength upon DNMT1 inhibition&quot; (p.5); &quot;a greater total number.....&quot; (p.7). These statements are all made based on actual numbers and the authors should mention the numbers in the text to give an impression of the extent of these changes (see below) and to clarify what the qualitative terms like &quot;largely&quot;, &quot;many&quot;, &quot;large&quot;, and &quot;increase&quot; mean. This is an issue throughout the manuscript and not limited to the above examples.</p>
<p>
Related to this issue, many of the comparisons which the authors interpret to show differences in behavior seem quite minor. For example, visual inspection suggests that the difference in loop strength shown in figure 1E is something like from 0 to 0.1 for K562 cells and a little less for KCT116 cells. What is a positive control here to give a sense of whether these minor changes are relevant. Another example is on p. 7, where the authors claim that CTCF partners of reactivated peaks tend to engage in a &quot;greater number&quot; of looping partners, but inspection of Figure 2A shows a very minor difference from maybe 7 to 7.5 partners. While a Mann-Whitney test may call this difference significant and give a significant P value, likely due to high sample number, it is questionable that this is a biologically relevant difference.</p>
<p>(2) The data to support the central claim of localization of reactivated loops to speckles is not overly convincing. The overlap with SON Cut&amp;Tag (figure 2F) is partial at best and although it is better with the publicly available TSA-seq data, the latter is less sensitive than Cut&amp;Tag and more difficult to interpret. It would be helpful to validate these data with FISH experiments to directly demonstrate and measure the association of loops with speckles (see below).</p>
<p>(3) It is not clear that the authors have indeed disrupted speckles from cells by degrading SON and SRRM2. Speckles contain a large number of proteins and considering their phase separated nature stronger evidence for their complete removal is needed. Note that the data published in ref 58 suffers from the same caveat.</p>
<p>(4) The authors ascribe a direct regulatory role to DNA methylation in controlling the association of some CTCF-mediated loops to speckles (p. 20). However, an active regulatory role of speckle association has not been demonstrated and the observed data are equally explainable by a more parsimonious model in which DNA methylation regulates gene expression via looping and that the association with speckles is merely an indirect bystander effect of the activated genes because we know that active genes are generally associated with speckles. The proposed mechanism of a regulatory role of DNA methylation in controlling speckle association is not convincingly demonstrated by the data. As a consequence, the title of the paper is also misleading.</p>
<p>(5) As a minor point, the authors imply on p. 15 that ablation of speckles leads to misregulation of genes by altering transcription. This is not shown as the authors only measure RNA abundance, which may be affected by depletion of constitutive splicing factors, but not transcription. The authors would need to show direct effects on transcription.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
CTCF is one of the most well-characterized regulators of chromatin architecture in mammals. Given that CTCF is an essential protein, understanding how its binding is regulated is a very active area of research. It has been known for decades that CTCF is sensitive to 5-cystosine DNA methylation (5meC) in certain contexts. Moreover, at genomic imprints and in certain oncogenes, 5meC-mediated CTCF antagonism has very important gene regulatory implications. A number of labs (eg, Schubeler and Stamatoyannopoulos) have assessed the impact of DNA methylation on CTCF binding, but it is important to also interrogate the effect on chromatin organization (ie, looping). Here, Roseman and colleagues used a DNMT1 inhibitor in two established human cancer lines (HCT116 [colon] and K562 [leukemia]), and performed CTCF ChIPseq and HiChIP. They showed that &quot;reactivated&quot; CTCF sites-that is, bound in the absence of 5meC-are enriched in gene bodies, participate in many looping events, and intriguingly, appear associated with nuclear speckles. This last aspect suggests that these reactivated loops might play an important role in increased gene transcription. They showed a number of genes that are upregulated in the DNA hypomethylated state actually require CTCF binding, which is an important result.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Overall, I found the paper to be succinctly written and the data presented clearly. The relationship between CTCF binding in gene bodies and association with nuclear speckles is an interesting result. Another strong point of the paper was combining DNMT1 inhibition with CTCF degradation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The most problematic aspect of this paper in my view is the insufficient evidence for the association of &quot;reactivated&quot; CTCF binding sites with nuclear speckles needs to be more diligently demonstrated (see Major Comment). One unfortunate aspect was that this paper neglected to discuss findings from our recent paper, wherein we also performed CTCF HiChIP in a DNA methylation mutant (Monteagudo-Sanchez et al., 2024 PMID: 39180406). It is true, this is a relatively recent publication, although the BioRxiv version has been available since fall 2023. I do not wish to accuse the authors of actively disregarding our study, but I do insist that they refer to it in a revised version. Moreover, there are a number of differences between the studies such that I find them more complementary rather than overlapping. To wit, the species (mouse vs human), the cell type (pluripotent vs human cancer), the use of a CTCF degron, and the conclusions of the paper (we did not make a link with nuclear speckles). Furthermore, we used a constitutive DNMT knockout which is not viable in most cell types (HCT116 cells being an exception), and in the discussion mentioned the advantage of using degron technology:</p>
<p>&quot;With high-resolution techniques, such as HiChIP or Micro-C (119-121), a degron system can be coupled with an assessment of the cis-regulatory interactome (118). Such techniques could be adapted for DNA methylation degrons (eg, DNMT1) in differentiated cell types in order to gauge the impact of 5meC on the 3D genome.&quot;</p>
<p>The authors here used a DNMT1 inhibitor, which for intents and purposes, is akin to a DNMT1 degron, thus I was happy to see a study employ such a technique. A comparison between the findings from the two studies would strengthen the current manuscript, in addition to being more ethically responsible.</p>
