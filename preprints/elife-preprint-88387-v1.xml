<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Intranasal vaccination is an attractive strategy for preventing COVID-19 disease as it stimulates the production of multimeric secretory immunoglobulin A (IgAs), the predominant antibody isotype in the mucosal immune system, at the target site of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry. Currently, the evaluation of intranasal vaccine efficacy is based on the measurement of polyclonal antibody titers in nasal lavage fluid. However, how individual multimeric secretory IgA protects the mucosa from SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be elucidated. To understand the precise contribution and molecular nature of multimeric secretory IgAs induced by intranasal vaccines, we developed 99 monoclonal IgAs from nasal mucosa and 114 monoclonal IgAs or IgGs from nonmucosal tissues of mice that were intranasally immunized with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The nonmucosal IgAs exhibited shared origins and both common and unique somatic mutations with the related nasal IgA clones, indicating that the antigen-specific plasma cells in the nonmucosal tissues originated from B cells stimulated at the nasal mucosa. Comparing the spike protein binding reactivity, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-blocking and SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization of monomeric and multimeric IgA pairs recognizing different epitopes showed that even nonneutralizing monomeric IgA, which represents 70% of the nasal IgA repertoire, can protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection when expressed as multimeric secretory IgAs. Our investigation is the first to demonstrate the function of nasal IgAs at the monoclonal level, showing that nasal immunization can provide effective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 by inducing multimeric secretory IgAs at the target site of virus infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is differentially distributed between the systemic and mucosal immune systems (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Li et al., 2020</xref></italic>). Monomeric IgA (M-IgA) is predominantly present in serum, whereas secretory IgA (S-IgA) is the most prevalent IgA in mucous secretions. S-IgA is composed of two IgA units and one J chain, which are synthesized and assembled in local plasma cells. Secretory components expressed on the basolateral surface of mucosal epithelial cells bind the IgA complex through the J chain and transport the molecule to the apical cell membrane (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Woof and Kerr, 2006</xref></italic>). Recent studies have shown that S-IgA in the nasal mucosa exists not only as dimers but also as multimers (trimers and tetramers) in the human upper respiratory mucosa (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Saito et al., 2019</xref></italic>). S-IgA plays an important role in the protection and homeostatic regulation of the airway, intestinal and vaginal epithelium through a process known as immune exclusion and immunosuppression (<italic>Matsumoto, 2022</italic>). Many studies have shown that S-IgA on mucosal surfaces is more effective and more cross-protective than IgG in serum for protection from harmful pathogens (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Okuya et al., 2020b</xref></italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Asahi et al., 2002</xref></italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dhakal et al., 2018</xref></italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Asahi-Ozaki et al., 2004</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>COVID-19 is a disease caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes mild upper respiratory symptoms in most cases, but some patients develop bilateral pneumonia with acute respiratory distress (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Budinger et al., 2021</xref></italic>). The SARS-COV-2 spike protein expressed on the virus surface is a multidomain homotrimer protein composed of an S1 domain consisting of an N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor binding domain (RBD) and an S2 domain that mediates fusion of the virus and host cell membrane. Viral infection is initiated through the interaction between the RBD and the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jackson et al., 2022</xref></italic>). Thus, the spike protein is the main target for current vaccine development because antibodies against this protein can neutralize the infection. Currently approved intramuscular COVID-19 vaccines predominantly induce a systemic immune response by producing IgG in serum before they cause severe tissue damage, resulting in a high degree of efficacy (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Polack et al., 2020</xref></italic>). However, these vaccines mainly induce IgG and M-IgA in serum; they do not induce S-IgA, which coats the upper respiratory tract mucosal surface (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">DeFrancesco, 2020</xref></italic>). The emergence of highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants may undermine the therapeutic efficacy of vaccines, requiring more effective vaccination to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since nose epithelial cells are a primary target for SARS-CoV-2, internasal vaccinations that induce S-IgA in the upper respiratory tract are desirable for protection against the infection and transmission of the virus (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sungnak et al., 2020</xref></italic>). To date, some internasal vaccines are under development and have shown a robust mucosal and humoral immune responses in human and animal models (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Houston, 2023</xref></italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chavda et al., 2021</xref></italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alu et al., 2022</xref></italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barrett et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bricker et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">DâArco et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kim et al., 2021</xref></italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Vabret et al., 2020</xref></italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ohtsuka et al., 2021</xref></italic>). Considerable efforts have been made to develop mucosal vaccines against pathogens, and nasal lavage fluids containing polyclonal S-IgAs have been used to evaluate the response to these vaccinations (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Maltseva et al., 2022</xref></italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gianchecchi et al., 2019</xref></italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wong et al., 2022</xref></italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Afkhami et al., 2022</xref></italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sui et al., 2021</xref></italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Azzi et al., 2022</xref></italic>). However, it is difficult to obtain information regarding the functions of individual antibodies that comprise the polyclonal anti-viral mucosal repertoire from such broad assays. It has also been shown that intranasal vaccination induces a systemic antibody response, but the origin of these antibodies has not previously been investigated at the molecular level (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tumpey et al., 2001</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>To understand the precise contribution and molecular nature of S-IgA induced by intranasal vaccines with respect to its antiviral function, the development of monoclonal S-IgAs from plasma cells localized in nasal mucosa and studying their function is essential. However, because of the difficulties in developing monoclonal IgA antibodies from nasal mucosal tissue, many studies have used artificial switching of IgG to IgA for recombinant production, and this approach has been used to study the protective properties of IgA against pathogens (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ejemel et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Saito et al., 2019</xref></italic>). Such technological limitations have hampered the biochemical and clinical evaluation of intranasal vaccination at the molecular level. Our group has established robust protocols for the isolation of single antigen-specific plasma cells from a variety of animals and the high-throughput production of monoclonal antibodies (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kurosawa et al., 2012</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Here, using this technology, we developed 213 antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies from plasma cells derived from mice that were intranasally immunized with a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer protein (Spike) and demonstrated that intranasal immunization induced nose-related antibodies in the spleen, lung, and blood. Analysis of the properties of monoclonal IgAs recognizing different epitopes revealed that multimerization of M-IgAs could induce neutralizing activity.</p>

<title>Development of anti-Spike monoclonal M-IgAs from plasma cells localized in nasal mucosa</title>
<p>To evaluate the immune response after the intranasal administration of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein of the Wuhan-Hu-1/D614G strain (Spik<sub>Wuhan</sub>), nasal lavage fluids and serum were collected from the mice one week after the last immunization. The intranasal administration of Spik<sub>Wuhan</sub> induced high levels of antigen-specific IgA but not IgG in nasal lavage fluids compared with those of the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Elevated levels of antigen-specific IgA and IgG responses were found in serum taken from the immunized mice, which is consistent with a previous study showing that intranasal vaccinations induce both nasal and serum IgA levels (<italic>Sterlin et al., 2021</italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Maltseva et al., 2022</xref></italic>). We selected three immunized mice with high nasal IgA titers and isolated antigen-specific plasma cells from the nasal mucosa, spleen, lung and blood. Cells isolated from these tissues were stained with fluorescently labeled anti-CD138, ER-tracker ER-Tracker Blue-White DPX, anti-IgA and S1 subunit of Spik<sub>Wuhan</sub> (S1), and then antigen-specific plasma cells defined as anti-CD138<sup>+</sup>, ER-tracker<sup>high</sup>, anti-IgA<sup>+</sup> and S1 <sup>+</sup> were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Consistent with the pattern of the IgA response observed in nasal lavage fluid, the proportions of antigen-specific IgA<sup>+</sup> plasma cells in the nasal mucosa of immunized mice were significantly higher than those of control mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and Supplementary file 1A).</p>

<p>Cognate pairs of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (VH) and kappa light chain variable genes (VL) were amplified by rapid amplification of 5â cDNA ends PCR from the single-sorted cells. After constructing full-length immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain genes, antibodies were expressed by DNA transfection into CHO-S cells. Antigen-specific antibody clones were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with immobilized Spik<sub>Wuhan</sub>. After sequencing of the entire coding region of heavy and light chain genes, the antibodies sharing the same V-(D)-J genes were grouped (Supplementary Table 1). Then, representative antibody clones from each group were analyzed for their binding to the spike protein RBD of Wuhan, Beta, Kappa and Delta variants and an NTD of Spik<sub>Wuhan</sub>. The antibodies were also analyzed for their ability to block ACE2 binding to RBDs and to neutralize Wuhan pseudotyped virus.

<title>Intranasal immunization induces functionally diverse IgA in the nasal mucosa and spleen</title>
<p>We conducted detailed characterization of antibodies obtained from the No. 1 mouse, as many antigen-specific M-IgA clones were obtained. Of the 51 nasal M-IgA clones analyzed, they were classified into 11 groups based on their V-(D)-J usage, with the majority (83%) clonally expanding into four major clusters (G2, G3, G4 and G10) and the remainder (17%) scattered across branches (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). The antibodies in the G1-G4 clusters were categorized as Type 1. The G1 antibody appeared only once. This clone displayed potent binding to the RBD of Wuhan, Kappa and Delta, and moderately to the Beta variant. It was also able to block ACE2 binding to all RBDs except the Beta variant RBD. The antibodies in G2-4 clusters bound to the RBD of Wuhan and Delta but not to the RBD of Beta and Delta. They were able to block ACE2 binding to the RBD of Wuhan and Delta but not to the RBD of Beta and Kappa. The antibodies in G5-G9 clusters were categorized as Type 2 and bound to all four RBD variants and uniformly blocked ACE2 binding to the RBDs of all four strains. G10 antibodies were categorized as Type 3 and represented 38% of the nasal IgA repertoire. They bound to the RBDs of all four strains but failed to block ACE2 binding to the RBDs of all four strains. The G11 antibody was categorized as Type 4, was an anti-NTD antibody and did not block ACE2 binding to the RBDs of all four strains.</p>

<title>Intranasal immunization induces nose-related antibodies in the spleen, lung, and blood</title>
<p>Previous reports suggest that nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue preferentially selects high-affinity IgA<sup>+</sup> B cells, which not only home back to regional mucosa but also migrate into nonmucosal tissues (<italic>Shimoda et al., 2001</italic>). If this is the case, a fraction of S1-specific plasma cells differentiated from nose-originated B cells may reside in the spleen and produce antibodies. To directly evaluate the cellular origin of the anti-S1 antibodies in nonmucosal tissues, we analyzed the presence of S1-specific plasma cells in the spleen, lung, bone marrow and Peyerâs patches. FACS analysis of splenocytes harvested from No. 1 mice showed the presence of S1-specific IgA<sup>+</sup> plasma cells, but the splenocytes harvested from control mice did not exhibit S1-specific IgA<sup>+</sup> plasma cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and Supplementary file 1B). Single-cell-based immunoglobulin gene cloning resulted in the successful production of 49 S1-specific monoclonal IgAs. DNA sequence analysis of these clones revealed significant clonal overlap between the nose and spleen. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). Clonal overlap was found in the G2-G3, G5, G6 and G10 clusters, in which G10 possessed the most expanded splenic clones, as in the case of nasal IgA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Further investigation was carried out to determine whether IgG<sup>+</sup> plasma cells that express nose-related IgA could be detected in the spleen. Although the number of antigen-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> plasma cells was limited, eight IgG clones specific for S1 were isolated, among which five were nose-related. When we attempted to isolate antigen-specific IgA<sup>+</sup> plasma cells from the lung, nine S1-specific IgA clones were obtained, among which three were nose-related. The gut mucosa and bone marrow possessed a large population of IgA<sup>+</sup> plasma cells. However, we could not detect S1-specific IgA<sup>+</sup> plasma cells in Peyerâs patches and bone marrow (Supplementary file 1B).</p>
<p>Next, we focused on the expanded antibody groups G2, G3 and G10 to analyze the patterns of somatic hypermutation (SHM). We found complex patterns of shared and unique SHMs in antibodies obtained from the nose, spleen and lung. In G2, the VHs of the three splenic clones (S530A, S208G, and S619A) had the same sequence, except for framework 4 of an IgG clone (S208G) and had three shared SHMs with the nasal clones (N219A and N226A). In addition, the VKs of the three splenic clones and N226A had the same sequence. In Group 3, seven nasal clones (N109A, N112A, N135A, N139A, N244A, N245A and N715A) and two splenic clones (S545 and S607) were 100% identical in nucleotide sequence, with N135A and N245 differing from the other clones by only one nucleotide in their VKs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Sequence analysis of the most expanded group, Group 10, also demonstrated clonal overlap in the nose, lung and spleen. For example, the VHs of a nasal clone (N221), spleen clones (S647, S503, S640 and S543) and a lung clone (L009) were 100% identical, with S647 differing from the other clones by only one nucleotide in VK (Supplementary file 2). Antibody lineage analysis of these clones suggests that each family of related antibodies originates from a common ancestor gene that waws subjected to class switching and SHM. We also developed S1-specific Abs from No. 2 and No. 3 mice and analyzed their sequences (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and Supplementary file 3). In No. 2 mice, we obtained 29 nasal IgAs, 15 splenic antibodies (13 IgAs and two IgGs), five lung IgAs and six blood IgAs. They were classified into 17 groups based on their V-(D)-J usage, and each group was categorized as either Type 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 based on antibody properties. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Nose-related clones were found in spleen, lung and blood (G5, 6, and 8). These clones also showed a complex pattern of shared and unique SHM with nasal clones throughout the full length of the VH and VL genes. In mouse No. 3, we cloned 19 nasal IgAs and 22 splenic antibodies (17 IgAs and five IgGs). They were classified into 10 groups, and each group was categorized as either Type 1, 3, 4 or 5. A high degree of clonal overlap between the nose and spleen was found, in which 13 out of 22 splenic Abs were nose-related clones (Supplementary file. 3). Analysis of the VH and VL repertoires of the three mice revealed that the expanded clones constituted varying fractions of the antibody repertoire among different mice despite having received the same antigen, and no group of antibodies stood out across mice, suggesting that individual mice had immunologically distinct responses (Supplementary figure 4). In all mice, only a few bound to the NTD, and most of them were RBD-directed. Approximately 30% of M-IgAs categorized as Type 1 showed neutralizing activity (Supplementary figure 4). Taken together, regarding the mutation frequency and the pattern of SHM, it can be assumed that B cells stimulated by nasal challenges were the major precursor of antigen-specific plasma cells in the spleen, lung and blood, which may contribute to antibody production in the lower respiratory tract and systemic circulation.</p>

<title>Multimerization of M-IgA enhances antigen-binding activity</title>
<p>To examine how IgA multimerization affects antigen-binding activity, four representative clones (N5203, N142, N114 and N217) were selected from each type of antibody, and S-IgAs were expressed by cotransfecting alpha heavy chain, kappa light chain, J-chain and secretory component into CHO-S cells. Analysis of the purified S-IgAs by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSâPAGE) revealed a band corresponding to the alpha heavy chain, kappa light chain and secretory component. Native PAGE analysis revealed bands corresponding to the dimer (â¼400 kDa), trimer (â¼550 kDa) and tetramer (â¼750 kDa) at a molar ratio of 5:1:3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Then, we compared the binding kinetics of each pair of M-IgA/S-IgA by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with immobilized Spik<sub>Wuhan</sub>, Spik<sub>Delta</sub> or Spik<sub>Omicron</sub>. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, N5203 M-IgA, which has moderate binding affinity to Spik<sub>Wuhan</sub> (apparent equilibrium constant, K<sub>D</sub>=5.2E-9), acquired dramatic enhancement of the binding activity to Spik<sub>Wuhan</sub> after multimerization (K<sub>D</sub>=1.3E-13). However, multimerization did not enhance the binding activity to Spik<sub>Delta</sub> (K<sub>D</sub>=2.1E-9). N142 M-IgA, which has high affinity for Spik<sub>Wuhan</sub> (K<sub>D</sub>=4.5E-11) and Spik<sub>Delta</sub> (K<sub>D</sub>=7.8E-11), did not show enhanced binding activity to them after multimerization. Almost the same phenomenon was found for N114 M-IgA, which has high affinity for Spik<sub>Wuhan</sub> (K<sub>D</sub>=6.8E-11) and Spik<sub>Delta</sub> (K<sub>D</sub>=9.7E-11). N142 M-IgA, which has the lowest affinity to Spike<sub>Wuhan</sub> (K<sub>D</sub>=2.1E-8), also acquired dramatic enhancement of the binding activity to Spik<sub>Wuhan</sub> after multimerization (K<sub>D</sub>=6.4E-11) but not to Spik<sub>Delta</sub>. All antibodies showed little or marginal levels of binding to Spik<sub>Omicron</sub>. These results suggest that the degree of avidity of S-IgAs depends on the affinity of the parent monomeric antibody: antibodies with low or intermediate affinity in the monomeric state (N5203 and N217) can increase their avidity by multimerization but not antibodies with high affinity in the monomeric state (N142 and N114). These results are consistent with recent work by Saito, S. et al., who examined the function of multimerized IgA against influenza viruses (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Saito et al., 2019</xref></italic>).</p>

<p>Multimerization of N114 and N217 M-IgA did not enhance RBD<sub>Wuhan</sub>-ACE2 and RBD<sub>Delta</sub>-ACE2 blocking, as in the case of their monomeric forms. None of the antibodies showed RBD<sub>Omicron</sub>-ACE2 blocking even at the highest antibody concentrations. To analyze whether multimerization affects the functionality of M-IgAs, we tested all M-IgA/S-IgA pairs for their ability to neutralize pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing the Wuhan, Delta or Omicron spike protein. Both monomeric and multimeric forms of N5203 showed strong neutralizing activity against the Wuhan and Delta pseudotyped lentiviruses, but the concentrations required to achieve the 50% neutralizing titer (NT<sub>50</sub>) were almost the same for both. Although both forms of N142 displayed RBD<sub>Wuhan</sub>-ACE2 and RBD<sub>Delta</sub>-ACE2 blocking, only the multimeric form showed neutralization activity against the Wuhan and Delta pseudotyped lentiviruses. Notably, N114 M-IgA and N217 M-IgA, which did not have RBD<sub>Wuhan</sub>-ACE2 blocking activity, displayed neutralizing activity against the Wuhan but not the Delta pseudotyped lentivirus after multimerization. None of the antibodies exhibited neutralization activity against the Omicron pseudotyped lentivirus. We further tested the neutralization activity of these antibodies by using an authentic SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain. N5203 S-IgA showed twofold higher neutralization activity than its monomeric counterpart. As predicted from the results of the pseudotyped lentivirus assay, multimerization of N142, N114 and N217 M-IgA induced neutralization activity, while their monomeric counterparts failed to neutralize live virus at the highest antibody concentration. These results suggest that the neutralizing activity of S-IgAs is not solely attributed to the spike protein affinity and the RBD-ACE2 blocking activity of M-IgAs, and that the valence and binding mode between the epitope and paratope affect their function.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper, we developed 99 antigen-specific monoclonal IgAs from the nasal mucosa of mice intranasally immunized with SpikWuhan and demonstrated that immunization induces functionally diverse antibodies in nasal mucosa. We also cloned 114 antigen-specific antibodies from plasma cells localized in the spleen, lung and blood of the immunized mice, which revealed the presence of many nose-related sequences. Analysis of the reactivity and functionality of the antibodies recognizing different epitopes revealed that multimerization facilitates the neutralizing activity of nonneutralizing M-IgAs. The different effects of multimerization suggest that each S-IgA has a different mechanism of action with respect to the suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the affinity, valence, and binding mode of the epitope and paratope may contribute to this variation.</p>
<p>It has been shown that the mucosal route of immunization elicits immune responses at local sites, as well as systemic immune responses. (<italic>Lapuente et al., 2021</italic>). Our analysis demonstrated that the spleen possessed a larger population of antigen-specific plasma cells that expressed nose-related IgAs and IgGs. These results suggest that the B cells activated in the nasal immune system give rise to plasma cells that reside in the nasal mucosa and produce S-IgA, while the B cells also migrate to the spleen and produce M-IgA. The role of the spleen in the induction of nose-related antibodies by intranasal immunization is yet to be determined. The antigen specific plama cells in spleen may respond in cases of systemic infection by supplying M-IgAs and IgGs into the bloodstream or protecting the body against subsequent infection (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Afkhami et al., 2022</xref></italic>) (<italic>Sheikh-Mohamed et al., 2022</italic>). Although bone marrow and the intestines are reservoirs for IgA-producing B cells, we could not detect antigen-specific plasma cells in these tissues. The molecular mechanisms regulating nose-related B-cell migration into the spleen but not into bone marrow and Peyerâs patches remain to be determined.</p>
<p>To date, SARS-CoV-2 research has mainly focused on <italic>anti-RBD</italic> neutralizing antibodies, and the role of nonneutralizing antibodies has not been adequately analyzed. In this study, we demonstrated that nonneutralizing M-IgAs, which comprise 70% of the nasal IgA repertoire, showed strong neutralizing activity when expressed as S-IgAs. Our findings suggest that <italic>factors other than the ability to block the ACE2 binding site of RBDs are involved in the neutralization activity of S-IgAs</italic> (<italic>Nicasio et al., 2012</italic>) (<italic>Tan et al., 2016</italic>). Recent reports show that antibodies that induce inter-or intraspike crosslinking can inhibit viral binding or shedding by the host cell through steric hindrance or cause conformational changes in the spike proteins (<italic>Galimidi et al., 2015</italic>) (<italic>Jackson et al., 2022</italic>) (<italic>Klein and Bjorkman, 2010</italic>). Such inter- and intraspike cross-linking may be limited in M-IgAs if the spike protein density on the virus surface is low or if the epitopes are unfavorably located. We hypothesize that S-IgA could exert the above effects through its multivalent arms, a mode of action that is hard to achieve with M-IgA, and factors such as valency, epitope selection, antibody binding angle, and the bulkiness of the Fc are involved in this process. (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Okuya et al., 2020a</xref></italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Callegari et al., 2022</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>There are limitations of our study, including the number of antigen-specific plasma cells isolated from the nasal mucosa of immunized mice was insufficient for a comprehensive analysis of systemic and mucosal immune responses. In this study, antibodies that did not share V-(D)-J with nasal clones were found in the spleen, lungs and blood of immunized mice. This finding was probably due to the limited number of clones that was isolated from the nose. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that these clones were differentiated from local naÃ¯ve B cells.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study highlights the key role of S-IgA in the protective effect of mucosal immunity, which may be useful for better understanding how intranasal vaccines can help protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

Full-length germline sequences were reconstructed, with nucleotide additions/deletions in the junction between V-(D)-J adjusted to match the sequence of each antibody group. Within these groups, if the combined sequence of the heavy and light chains differed by more than five bases from each other, they were defined as separate clones.

The nucleotide lengths were aligned by adding â-â to the missing bases. The data file required by Alakazam was created in RStudio (version 2022.12.0+353), and a phylogenetic tree was created by Alakazam (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/alakazam/versions/1.2.1">https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/alakazam/versions/1.2.1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alakazam.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">https://alakazam.readthedocs.io/en/stable/</ext-link>).

<p>This work provides <bold>valuable</bold> insights into mucosal antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 following intranasal immunization by characterizing a large number of monoclonal antibodies at both mucosal and non-mucosal sites. The evidence supporting the claims is overall <bold>solid</bold>, although the flow cytometric assessment of antibody-expressing cells would benefit from more rigorous controls. The demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity of antibodies characterized provides a rationale for developing mucosal vaccines, especially if confirmed in vivo and benchmarked against antibodies generated following intramuscular vaccination.</p>

<p>Despite evidence suggesting the benefits of neutralizing mucosa-derived IgA in the upper airway in protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, all currently approved vaccines are administered intramuscularly, which mainly induces systemic IgG. Waki et al. aimed to characterize the benefits of intranasal vaccination at the molecular level by isolating B cell clones from nasal tissue. The authors found that Spike-specific plasma cells isolated from the spleen of vaccinated mice showed significant clonal overlap with Spike-specific plasma cells isolated from nasal tissue. Interestingly, they could not detect any spike-specific plasma cells in the bone marrow or Peyer's patches, indicating that these nose-derived cells did not necessarily home to and reside in these locations, although the Peyer's patch is not a typical plamsa cell niche - rather the lamina propria of the gut would have been a better place to look. Furthermore, they found that multimerization improves the antibody/antigen binding when the antibody is of low or intermediate affinity, but that high-affinity monomeric antibodies do not benefit from multimerization. Lastly, the authors used a competitive ELISA assay to show that multimerization could improve the neutralizing capacity of these antibodies.</p>
<p>The strength of this paper is the cloning of multiple IgA from the nasal mucosae (n=99) and the periphery (n=114) post-SARS-CoV-2 i.n. vaccination to examine the clonal relationship of this IgA with other sites, including the spleen. This analysis provides novel insights into the nature of the mucosal antibody response at the site where the host would encounter the virus, and whether this IgA response disseminates to other tissues.</p>
<p>There were also some weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. The finding that multimerization improves binding and neutralization is not surprising as this was observed before by Wang and Nussenzweig for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA (authors should cite Enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by dimeric IgA. Wang et al, Sci. Transl. Med 2021, 13:3abf1555). In addition, as far as I can tell we cannot ascertain the purity of fractions from the size exclusion chromatography thus I wasn't sure whether the input material used in Fig. 4 was a mixed population of dimer/trimer/tetramer?</p>
<p>2. The flow cytometric assessment of the IgA+ clones from the nasal mucosae was difficult to interpret (Fig. 1B). It was hard for me to tell what they were gating on and subsequently analysing without an IgA-negative population for reference.</p>
<p>3. While the i.n. study itself is large and challenging, it would have been interesting to compare an i.m. route and examine the breadth of SARS-CoV-2 variant S1 binding for IgGs as in Fig. 2A. Are the IgA responses derived from the mucosae of greater breadth than systemic IgG responses? Alternatively, and easier, authors could do some comparisons with well-characterized IgG mAb for affinity and cross-reactivity as a benchmark to compare with the IgAs they looked at.</p>
<p>Overall the authors did a good job of looking at a large range of systemic vs mucosal S1-specific antibodies in the context of an intra-nasal vaccination and this provides additional evidence for the utility of mucosal vaccination approaches for reducing person-to-person transmission.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This research demonstrates the breadth of IgA response as determined by isolating individual antigen-specific B cells and generating mAbs in mice following intranasal immunization of mice with SARS-CoV2 Spike protein. The findings show that some IgA mAb can neutralize the virus, but many do not. Notable immunization with Wuhan S protein generates a weak response to the omicron variant.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Detailed analysis characterizing individual B cells with the generation of mAbs demonstrates the response's breadth and diversity of IgA responses and the ability to generate systemic immune responses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The data presentation needs clarity, and results show mAb ability to inhibit SARS-CoV2 in vitro. How IgA functions in vivo is uncertain.</p>
