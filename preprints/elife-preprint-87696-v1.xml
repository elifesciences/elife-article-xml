<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Rubella virus is an important human pathogen that can cause neurologic deficits in a developing fetus when contracted during pregnancy. Despite successful vaccination programs in the Americas and many developed countries, rubella remains endemic in many regions worldwide and outbreaks occur wherever population immunity is insufficient. Intense interest since rubella virus was first isolated in 1962 has advanced our understanding of clinical outcomes after infection disrupts key processes of fetal neurodevelopment. Yet it is still largely unknown which cell types in the developing brain are targeted. We show that in human brain slices, rubella virus predominantly infects microglia. This infection occurs in a heterogeneous population but not in a highly microglia-enriched monoculture in the absence of other cell types. By using an organoid-microglia model, we further demonstrate that rubella virus infection leads to a profound interferon response in non-microglial cells, including neurons and neural progenitor cells, and this response is attenuated by the presence of microglia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neurotropic viruses contracted during pregnancy can have grave consequences for the fetus. These comprise both viruses of longstanding concern like Human cytomegalovirus and Herpes simplex virus as well as emerging viruses like Zika virus. Yet our understanding of how direct viral infection and indirect inflammatory consequences affect fetal brain development is limited. This is true even for well-studied pathogens like rubella virus (RV), which is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus of the family <italic>Matonaviridae</italic> restricted to human transmission. Infection with RV typically causes a mild, self-limiting illness with a characteristic rash during childhood, often referred to as “German measles.” However, infection during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or a range of birth defects including congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The sequelae of congenital RV infection were first recognized in 1941 and although the first RV vaccines were licensed in 1969, an estimated 105,000 infants with CRS were born each year worldwide as of 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Vynnycky et al., 2016</xref>). As of 2019, RV-containing vaccine coverage remains incomplete and inconsistent, with ongoing endemic transmission and reporting gaps primarily in the African, Eastern Mediterranean, and South-East Asian World Health Organization Regions (World Health Organization, 2020). Countries with RV-containing vaccine programs also remain susceptible to outbreaks, such as Japan and China where outbreaks in 2013-14 and 2018-19 caused a two-fold increase in reported rubella cases worldwide (26,033 total cases in 2018 vs 49,179 cases in 2019) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Plotkin, 2021</xref>) and included CRS the following year (423 total cases worldwide in 2019 vs 1,252 cases in 2020) (World Health Organization, 2022).</p>
<p>The most common features of CRS are congenital cataracts, sensorineural deafness, and cardiac defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Banatvala &amp; Brown, 2004</xref>). In addition, microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Munro, Sheppard, Smithells, Holzel, &amp; Jones, 1987</xref>), developmental delay and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chess, 1977</xref>), and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Brown et al., 2001</xref>) are associated with the syndrome, but the pathophysiology of these neurological complications is not well described. To gain mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of CRS it is essential to understand the tropism of the virus. Initial infection in the lymphoid tissues of the nasopharynx and upper respiratory tract leads to systemic viremia, with virus spread across the placenta and into nearly all fetal organs on post-mortem examination, primarily via infected mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nguyen, Pham, &amp; Abe, 2015</xref>). As for the fetal nervous system, RV was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue of fetuses and infants with CRS in studies from the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bellanti et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Esterly &amp; Oppenheimer, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Korones, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Monif, Avery, Korones, &amp; Sever, 1965</xref>). However, further details of where RV might replicate in the brain are lacking. Autopsies in that early era revealed nonspecific gliosis and cerebral vessel degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rorke &amp; Spiro, 1967</xref>). In limited pathology specimens from more recent outbreaks, RV RNA and antigens were identified in rare cells in the cortex and cerebellum presumed to be “nerve cells” and neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lazar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). Experimental infections of cells that might not accurately represent the primary cells in the developing brain have yielded little further insight. To complicate the matter, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) has been proposed as a cellular receptor for RV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cong, Jiang, &amp; Tien, 2011</xref>), but it is exclusively expressed in oligodendrocytes in the human brain and therefore cannot explain infection in other cell populations. Thus, there is clear evidence for the presence of RV in the central nervous system in infants with CRS, but the identity of infected cell type(s) remains elusive.</p>
<p>Here we address RV tropism in the human developing brain and other poorly understood molecular aspects of CRS. By combining primary human brain tissue with a variety of cell culture techniques, we show that microglia are the predominant cell type infected by RV. Furthermore, we show that diffusible factors from non-microglia cells are necessary to render microglia susceptible to RV. By using brain organoids supplemented with primary microglia, we demonstrate that RV infection leads to a robust interferon response and leads to dysregulation of multiple genes implicated in human brain development. Finally, we compared transcriptomic changes between microglia-transplanted and non-transplanted organoids and found that in the presence of microglia, interferon pathway upregulation following RV exposure is reduced.</p>

<title>RV infects microglia in the human developing brain</title>
<p>To investigate RV tropism in the human brain, cultured cortical slices from mid-gestation samples were infected with M33 RV, representing a laboratory strain originally derived from a clinical isolate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). At 72 hours post-infection, immunostaining for the RV capsid protein revealed numerous cells positive for the RV antigen, of which &gt;90% were co-labeled with the microglia marker Iba1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref>). To confirm functional transcription and translation of the viral genome, a new strain of RV designed to express GFP within the non-structural P150 gene was generated (RV-GFP, GenBank Accession OM816675, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) and validated by GFP expression in Vero cells (Supplementary Figure 1). In human primary brain slices infected with RV-GFP, GFP expression was detected predominantly in microglia, confirming the production of RV proteins inside this cell type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>) consistent with the wildtype M33 RV.</p>

<title>Cell microenvironment influences RV infectivity</title>
<p>Such specificity of RV for microglia in this model is striking given that microglia represent only 1-5% of the cells of the human developing brain (D.A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Menassa et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, the previously published viral entry factor MOG is not specific to microglia according to analysis of publicly available RNA and protein expression profiles of the human developing brain (Supplementary Figure 2). Further, common components of the host cell membrane, such as sphingomyelin and cholesterol that appear to be essential for RV entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Otsuki et al., 2018</xref>), cannot explain viral tropism for microglia. Thus, to identify factors contributing to the relatively specific infection of microglia, RV infectivity was tested in monocultures of primary human microglia. Microglia from mid-gestation cortical brain samples were purified using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and then subsequently infected with RV (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, RV infection of the microglia monoculture was negligible (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). To resolve this apparent paradox, we investigated whether microglia infectivity could be restored by the presence of other cell types, such as neurons or progenitor cells. Microglia were co-cultured with either neuronally-enriched cultures (sorted with PSA-NCAM magnetic beads), or the glial component (flow-through that was depleted of both the CD11b-positive microglia cells and the PSA-NCAM-positive population). Both conditions successfully restored infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-E</xref>). In the pure microglial cultures, less than 2% of microglia were positive for RV capsid by immunostaining, but when different cell fractions were added to the culture (neuronal; glial; or mixed cultures), up to 60% of microglia had RV capsid immunopositivity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Similar to the cortical brain slices, microglia represented the main cell type infected with RV in the mixed co-cultures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Furthermore, mixed cultures inoculated with lower viral titers had fewer cells with RV capsid immunopositivity overall, but retained a high proportion of infected microglia demonstrating specificity for microglia (Supplementary Figure 3).</p>

<p>We then tested whether RV capsid immunopositivity in microglia could be due to phagocytic activity by this macrophage population. To exclude microglia engulfing other infected cells, a transwell system was employed where microglia and other cell types are grown in compartments separated by a semi-permeable membrane that allows media exchange without direct cell-cell contacts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Both the presence of other cell types in the same well (co-culture) and the media exchange between the two chambers (transwell) restored infection in microglia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-C</xref>). Consistent with our previous experiments, microglia represented the main cell type infected with RV. Together, these results suggest that RV infection of microglia is influenced by diffusible factors from other cell populations found in the tissue microenvironment.</p>

<title>Rubella infection elicits an interferon response in brain organoids</title>
<p>Given the striking difference in infection rates in different cell environments, we next investigated how the presence of microglia modulates gene expression profiles associated with the presence of RV. Under standard protocols, brain organoids do not robustly develop any cells of myeloid origin, making them a useful reductionist model for investigating the role of immune cells in brain homeostasis and development. Brain organoids were generated following previously established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pasca et al., 2015</xref>), and at five weeks of differentiation, when the majority of cell types are present in the organoids, mid-gestation primary human microglia were introduced as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Popova et al., 2021</xref>). After allowing microglia to engraft into the organoids for five weeks, organoids were infected with RV. At 72 hours post-infection with RV, brain organoids were processed for single-cell RNA sequencing with 10X Genomics and downstream analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In organoids with engrafted primary microglia subsequently exposed to RV, immunostaining revealed RV capsid in microglia, similar to primary tissue and co-culture experiments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). After processing for single-cell RNA sequencing, cells with fewer than 500 detected genes and/or more than 20% mitochondrial genes were removed from the analysis. Ribosomal transcripts and pseudogenes were excluded. Approximately 11,000 cells passed filtering criteria, revealing the expected major cell populations of the human developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nowakowski et al., 2017</xref>), including radial glia cells, immature and mature neurons, and astrocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, D</xref>). Cell cluster annotations were assigned based on combinations of co-expressed cluster marker genes, such as <italic>FGFBP2</italic> and <italic>SOX2</italic> for radial glial cells (clusters 5 and 10), TAGLN3, <italic>HES6, NEUROD4</italic> for neural progenitor cells (cluster 7), <italic>TUBB2A, TUBB2B, STMN2</italic> for neurons (cluster 2), <italic>CLU, PTN</italic> and <italic>SPARCL1</italic> for astrocytes (cluster 6), and <italic>MKI67, UBE2C</italic> and <italic>CENPF</italic> for dividing cells (clusters 3 and 4) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, Supplementary Figure 4 D-E for individual cluster marker genes, Table 1 for the full list of markers). Cells derived from organoids with and without microglia were present in all clusters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). A separate microglia cluster was not identified. Rare cells expressing the microglia marker <italic>AIF1</italic> (encoding the Iba1 protein) were present, but such cells have been previously reported to develop spontaneously in organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">He et al., 2022</xref>) and the canonical microglia marker <italic>P2RY12</italic> was not detected in those cells (Supplementary Figure 4F). We attribute the apparent lack of microglia to both the small starting population and loss due to cell dissociation during processing for scRNAseq. Consistent with the lack of microglia cells in our scRNAseq data, we did not recover appreciable numbers of the viral transcripts. However, exposure of organoids to RV resulted in significant transcriptomic differences including genes involved in the interferon signaling pathway and its response (<italic>IFI27, IFI6, IFITM3</italic>)(<italic>HLA-A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Campbell, Bizilj, Colman, Tuch, &amp; Harrison, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Keskinen, Ronni, Matikainen, Lehtonen, &amp; Julkunen, 1997</xref>) and <italic>BST2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Holmgren, Miller, Cavanaugh, &amp; Rall, 2015</xref>)) (cluster 1, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C,D,F</xref>, Table 1). The majority of cells in cluster 1 came from RV-exposed organoids. While genes involved in the interferon response showed increased expression in organoids both with and without microglia, the magnitude of their upregulation was lower among cells in microglia-containing organoids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-F</xref>).</p>

<p>Radial glia and dividing cells had a greater transcriptomic response to RV exposure as compared to neurons, both with and without microglia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Cells captured from microglia-containing organoids showed fewer differentially expressed genes in response to RV in each of the major cell classes compared to organoids that did not contain microglia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>), with radial glia and neurons reaching statistically significant levels (p-values shown on the right side of the panel) and neural progenitor cells showing the overall trend without reaching statistical significance. One gene family that was specifically upregulated in the presence of RV in organoids without microglia included nuclear factor I – <italic>NFIB</italic> and <italic>NFIA</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, Table 2) – two genes that form heterodimers <italic>in vivo</italic> and are associated with induction of gliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tchieu et al., 2019</xref>) in embryonic brain development.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we demonstrate that in the developing brain RV predominantly infects microglia, the resident macrophage population. This finding is consistent with RV tropism for monocytes in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Perelygina et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">van der Logt, van Loon, &amp; van der Veen, 1980</xref>), and adds new information to the limited understanding of RV infection in the central nervous system. Supporting data from real-world infections including post-mortem specimens would be helpful to evaluate clinical strains. Tropism for microglia raises interesting questions about how and where RV persists in CRS, perhaps in brain tissue during the extended period of viral shedding, similar to other relatively immuno-privileged sites such as the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Doan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sugishita et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings also help contextualize CRS in comparison to congenital infections by other neurotropic viruses: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and Zika virus, which target microglia directly; Herpes simplex virus, which replicates poorly in microglia with cytopathic effect; and Human cytomegalovirus, which causes microglia to produce antiviral cytokines without productive infection or cytopathic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lum et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Retallack et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rock et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Like some of these other viruses, we found that by establishing viral transcription and translation in microglia, RV elicits a strong interferon response in other cell types. It has been previously shown that the interferon response in neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells can induce molecular and morphological changes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including neurite length and gene expression changes associated with schizophrenia and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Warre-Cornish et al., 2020</xref>). The interferon response is additionally associated with pathobiology in a range of congenital infections and interferonopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Crow &amp; Manel, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, in our preliminary experiments in organoids, where microglia do not develop under standard protocols, the RV-induced interferon response was attenuated in the presence of microglia, suggesting a possible protective role of microglia on other cell types. One limitation of the current work is the lack of information on transcriptional differences in microglia in the context of RV-exposed organoids due to the low number of recovered microglia. However, our data on molecular changes in neural progenitor cells and neurons, which likely produce the bulk of neurological symptoms seen in CRS, provide a valuable resource for future investigation of congenital viral infections. Our finding that the presence of microglia may reduce RV-associated transcriptional differences across different cell populations may also shed light on neuro-immune consequences of other congenital infections that coincide temporally with phases of microglia population expansion and reduction (D. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Menassa et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, RV infection rates were largely influenced by the local cell environment, where diffusible factors from non-microglia cells were necessary for RV infection of microglia. These factors did not depend on the cell type, as both progenitor/glial cells and neurons were equally effective in supporting RV infection of microglia. This finding opens new directions to advance our limited understanding of host factors needed for RV entry and infection. Based on previous reports in 2D cell cultures and pathology examination of infected tissues, RV can establish infection in a variety of cell types, suggesting that the viral entry receptor is ubiquitously expressed, or that viral entry is facilitated by cell membrane components and their modifications. Indeed, membrane phospholipids and glycolipids have been shown to participate in viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mastromarino, Cioe, Rieti, &amp; Orsi, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Otsuki et al., 2018</xref>). Our study suggests secreted factors may also contribute to RV entry, perhaps in conjunction with other ubiquitous cell surface elements.</p>
<p>Moreover, our study highlights the importance of considering tissue complexity when studying viral infection in brain organoids. Complex, multi-lineage organoids can now be designed by incorporating vascular or immune cells into differentiation protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cakir et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cakir et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Popova et al., 2021</xref>). We show that transcriptomic consequences of RV exposure are dependent on the presence of microglia in the organoid tissue environment. Future studies will be needed to determine the precise mechanisms that mediate this effect. One possibility is that microglia become the predominant cellular target of RV infection. Another possibility is microglia actively altering the microenvironment to modulate the antiviral response.</p>
<p>Clearly, efforts to eliminate RV worldwide through vaccination are a priority. However, our work on neuro-immune interactions in CRS may inform how early brain development goes awry in many contexts including prenatal infection with other neurotropic viruses, genetic conditions associated with dysregulated interferon responses such as Aicardi Goutières Syndrome, and a variety of perturbations that activate common inflammatory pathways. Understanding the specific role of microglia may be key to unlocking the pathophysiology and developing therapies to prevent or mitigate damage.</p>

<title>Rubella Virus</title>
<p>To generate viral stocks, a plasmid containing a full infectious clone of RV-M33 was linearized then added to an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reaction with Sp6 (New England Biolabs, M0207L). The resulting RNA was purified then polyadenylated (New England Biolabs, M0276S) and capped using Vaccinia Capping System (New England Biolabs, M2080S). This RNA was then introduced to Vero cells using TransIT-mRNA transfection (Mirus Bio, MIR 2250). At 72 hours post-transfection, culture media was collected and passaged onto fresh Vero cells. To generate viral stocks, Vero cells were inoculated with low passage number RV (P2-P3) and cultured at 37°C. Culture media was collected at 72 hours post-inoculation, clarified, and stored at −80°C. Immunofluorescent titering assays were performed on Vero cells using anti-RV capsid antibody (ab34749), yielding titers of 10<sup>5</sup>-10<sup>6</sup> focus-forming units/mL (ffu/mL) for RV stocks. RV-GFP stocks were prepared in the same manner, from a plasmid that had been modified through an <italic>in vitro</italic> reaction with nCas9 and custom guides to cut the RV-M33 plasmid midway through the p150 gene at residues 717-718 (dgRNA system with DNA oligos for RNA in vitro transcription as follows: tracrRNA sequence: AAA AAG CAC CGA CTC GGT GCC ACT TTT TCA AGT TGA TAA CGG ACT AGC CTT ATT TTA ACT TGC TAT GCT GTC CTA TAG TGA GTC GTA TTA, crRNA oRV012 sequence: CAA AAC AGC ATA GCT CTA AAA CGC TCG CGG CCA CGT CAC CGC CTA TAG TGA GTC GTA TTA).

<title>Primary human microglia purification</title>
<p>Deidentified primary tissue samples were collected with previous patient consent in strict observance of the legal and institutional ethical regulations. Brain tissue was immediately placed in a sterile conical tube filled with oxygenated artificial spinal fluid (aSCF) containing 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO4 bubbled with carbogen (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Prenatal human microglia were purified from primary brain tissue from mid-gestation (gestational week 18-23) samples using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) kit with CD11b magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-049-601) following manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, primary brain tissue was minced to 1mm<sup>3</sup> pieces and enzymatically digested in 10 ml of 0.25% trypsin reconstituted from 2.5% trypsin (Gibco, 15090046) in DPBS (Gibco, 14190250) for 30 mins at 37 °C. 0.5 ml of 10 mg/ml of Dnase (Sigma Aldrich, DN25) was added in the last 5 minutes of dissociation. After the enzymatic digestion, tissue was mechanically triturated using a 10 ml pipette, filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer (Corning 352340), pelleted at 300xg for 5 minutes and washed twice with DBPS. Dissociated cells were resuspended in MACS buffer (DPBS with 1 mM EGTA and 0.5% BSA) with addition of 0.5 mg/ml DNAse and incubated with CD11b antibody for 15 minutes on ice. After the incubation, cells were washed with 10 ml of MACS buffer and loaded on LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-042-401) on the magnetic stand. Cells were washed 3 times with 3 ml of MACS buffer, then the column was removed from the magnetic field and microglia cells were eluted in 5 ml of MACS buffer. Cells were pelleted at 300xg, re-suspended in 1 ml of culture media, counted, and used for downstream analysis. We routinely obtained 1×10^6 of microglia cells from a single MACS purification.</p>
<p>For experiments requiring microglia co-culture with different cell types, the flow through eluent from microglia selection served either as a cell type fraction depleted of microglia (denoted as “flow through”) or was used for an additional separation between neuronal and glial fractions by using PSA-NCAM antibody (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-092-966) following the same procedure described for microglia purification.</p>

MAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Finak et al., 2015</xref>) was used on log normalized raw counts for all differential expression tests. The gene marker lists were filtered after testing by specifically removing unannotated genes from HGNC. Organoid demultiplexing and doublet filtering was done through deMULTIplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">McGinnis et al., 2019</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/chris-mcginnis-ucsf/MULTI-seq">https://github.com/chris-mcginnis-ucsf/MULTI-seq</ext-link>). Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (Leland McInnes, John Healy, Nathaniel Saul, &amp; Großberger, 2018) embeddings and neighbors for Leiden clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Traag, Waltman, &amp; van Eck, 2019</xref>) were used for clustering and visualization. Nebulosa was used to generate density plots and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bunis, Andrews, Fragiadakis, Burt, &amp; Sirota, 2020</xref>) for color-blind friendly plotting of clusters. Pearson correlation was calculated on the intersection of the shared genes between datasets which averaged Pearson residuals for each cluster. Organoid cells were batch corrected using default parameters of the SCTransform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hafemeister &amp; Satija, 2019</xref>) integration workflow.</p>

<title>Data analysis and statistical tests</title>
<p>Cell co-localization with the RV capsid was quantified using the CellProfiler 3.0 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">McQuin et al., 2018</xref>). First, individual cells were identified by using IdentifyPrimaryObjects module with threshold strategy “Global”, threshold method “Otsu” and a two-class thresholding for each individual channel for DAPI, Iba1 and RV capsid fluorescence images. Then resulting cell objects were paired by using RelateObjects module to identify Iba1-postive, RV-positive and double-positive DAPI objects. Finally, CalculateMath was used to quantify proportions for each cell population, including RV-positive and RV-negative Iba1 microglia cells and non-microglia cells, depending on the analysis.</p>
<p>Prism 9.3.1 was used for statistical analysis and data plotting in mixed and transwell co-cultures. Unpaired t-test with assumed Gaussian distribution of the variants and the same standard deviations were used to calculate statistical significance for any cell counts. Unpaired nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to compare differentially expressed genes that reached significance value of p=0.05 between conditions in organoids.</p>

<p>The authors sought to address the longstanding question of which cell types are infected during congenital or perinatal rubella virus infection. They used brain slice and organoid-microglia experimental models to demonstrate that the main cell types targeted by rubella virus are microglia. It does not appear that microglia support rubella virus production in this experimental system, though future studies would be needed to address this more thoroughly. The authors further show that infection results in augmented interferon responses in neighboring neuronal cells but not in the microglia themselves. The data support the conclusions, with major strengths being the sophisticated primary cell models and single-cell RNA-Seq used to pinpoint microglia as the main cellular targets of rubella virus, and neurons as the bystander targets of immune signaling. This study reveals a new cellular target that will have important implications for basic studies on rubella virus-host interactions and for the potential development of therapies or improved vaccines targeting this virus. As rubella virus is a pathogen of high concern during human pregnancy, this study also has important implications in the field of neonatal infectious diseases.</p>

<p>In this manuscript by Popova et al., the authors report the pathological impact of Rubella virus (RV) infection on human brain development. In particular, they uncovered a selective tropism of Rubella virus for microglial cells in cultured slices of human developing brain and 2D mixed fetal brain cell culture. Their results suggest that RV infection of microglia relies on the presence of diffusible factors from other cell populations. Moreover, the authors showed that RV infection of human brain organoids supplemented or not with microglia leads to interferon response and dysregulation of gene involved in brain development. This set of data will help understanding the cellular specificity and pathological mechanisms occurring in the developing brain upon RV infection. The data provided are overall of high quality and shed new light on the cellular tropism and the pathomechanisms of RV infection.</p>
