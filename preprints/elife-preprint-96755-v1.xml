<title>Abstract</title><p>Axonemal protein complexes, including the outer and inner dynein arms (ODA/IDA), are highly ordered structures of the sperm flagella that drive sperm motility. Deficiencies in several axonemal proteins have been associated with male infertility, which is characterized by asthenozoospermia or asthenoteratozoospermia. Dynein axonemal heavy chain 3 (DNAH3) resides in the IDA and is highly expressed in the testis. However, the relationship between DNAH3 and male infertility is still unclear. Herein, we identified biallelic variants of <italic>DNAH3</italic> in four unrelated Han Chinese infertile men with asthenoteratozoospermia through whole-exome sequencing (WES). These variants contributed to deficient DNAH3 expression in the patients’ sperm flagella. Importantly, the patients represented the anomalous sperm flagellar morphology, and the flagellar ultrastructure was severely disrupted. Intriguingly, <italic>Dnah3</italic> knockout (KO) male mice were also infertile, especially showing the severe reduction in sperm movement with the abnormal IDA and mitochondrion structure. Mechanically, nonfunctional DNAH3 expression resulted in decreased expression of IDA-associated proteins in the spermatozoa flagella of patients and KO mice, including DNAH1, DNAH6, and DNALI1, the deletion of which has been involved in disruption of sperm motility. Moreover, the infertility of patients with <italic>DNAH3</italic> variants and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice could be rescued by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. Our findings indicated that <italic>DNAH3</italic> is a novel pathogenic gene for asthenoteratozoospermia and may further contribute to the diagnosis, genetic counseling, and prognosis of male infertility.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Infertility is a global public health and social problem that affects approximately one in six couples worldwide. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) Male infertility, which accounts for half of infertile cases, is a multifactorial disease with common phenotypes, including oligo/azoospermia (poor sperm count or absence of spermatozoa); teratozoospermia (aberrant sperm morphology); asthenozoospermia (weakened sperm motility); and a combination of these phenotypes, such as asthenoteratozoospermia, oligoasthenozoospermia, oligoteratozoospermia and oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>)</p>
<p>Asthenoteratozoospermia is one of the most common phenotypes of male infertility, and genetic factors have been established as the predominant cause of asthenoteratozoospermia. Multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF), a subtype of asthenoteratozoospermia, characterized by a mosaic of abnormalities of the flagellar morphology, including absent, short, coiled, bent and/or irregular flagella, is almost always caused by genetic defects. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) To date, more than 40 genes have been identified as pathogenic genes of MMAF, but these genes can only explain approximately 60% of MMAF-affected cases. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) Therefore, the genetic basis of the remaining cases is still unknown.</p>
<p>The motility of a sperm is driven by its rhythmically beating flagella, and at the center of the flagella lies a conserved axonemal structure, containing the “9 + 2” microtubular arrangement: a ring of nine microtubule doublets (MTDs) surrounding a central pair (CP) of singlet microtubules. Each MTD consists of an A tubule and a B tubule, and the outer (ODA) and inner (IDA) dynein arms are anchored along the A tubule. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) The ODA and IDA are ATPase-based protein complexes that drive the movement between the A tubule and the neighboring B tubule of the next doublet, producing the original force for sperm motility. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) Structural and functional abnormalities of the ODA and IDA have been demonstrated to cause male infertility associated with asthenozoospermia and/or asthenoteratozoospermia. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>)</p>
<p>The dynein axonemal heavy chain (DNAH) family comprises a series of proteins (DNAH1–3, DNAH5–12, and DNAH17) that are precisely assembled with other axonemal dynein motor proteins in the ODAs and IDAs of sperm flagella and motile cilia. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) In humans, DNAH1, DNAH2, DNAH6, DNAH7, DNAH8, DNAH10, DNAH12 and DNAH17 are highly expressed in the testis, and deficiency of these proteins has been demonstrated to cause MMAF-associated asthenoteratozoospermia. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) DNAH3 is an evolutionarily conserved IDA-associated protein and is highly expressed in testes of humans and mice. Deficient DNAH3 has been shown to impair sperm motility in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and cattle. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) In humans, <italic>DNAH3</italic> has been identified as a novel breast cancer candidate gene. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) However, the role of DNAH3 in male reproduction in humans and mice remains largely unknown.</p>
<p>In the present study, we identified four biallelic variations in <italic>DNAH3</italic> in four unrelated Han Chinese patients with asthenoteratozoospermia using whole-exome sequencing (WES). The spermatozoa of the patients showed extremely reduced sperm motility and a high proportion of sperm tail defects characterized by the MMAF phenotype. We further generated <italic>Dnah3</italic> knockout (KO) mice, and the male KO mice expectedly showed aberrations in sperm movement, flagellar IDA, and mitochondrion. Moreover, the absence of DNAH3 led to decreased expression of other IDA-associated proteins, including DNAH1, DNAH6 and DNALI1. Importantly, good outcomes of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment were observed in <italic>DNAH3</italic>-deficient patients and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice. This study revealed <italic>DNAH3</italic> as a novel pathogenic gene of asthenoteratozoospermia, and the findings provide valuable suggestions for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of male infertility.</p>

<title>Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants of <italic>DNAH3</italic> in four unrelated infertile men</title>
<p>In the present study, we conducted whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify potential candidate genes associated with primary asthenoteratozoospermia. Interestingly, after filtering, four biallelic variations in <italic>DNAH3</italic> (NG_052617.1, NM_017539.2, NP_060009.1) were identified in four unrelated patients: a compound heterozygous mutation of c.3590C&gt;T (p.P1197L) and c.3590C&gt;G (p.P1197R) in Patient 1, a homozygous missense mutation of c.4837G&gt;T (p.A1613S) in Patient 2, a compound heterozygous mutation of c.5587del (p.L1863*) and c.10355C&gt;T (p.S3452L) in Patient 3 and a compound heterozygous mutation of c.2314C&gt;T (p.R772W) and c.4045G&gt;A (p.D1349N) in Patient 4 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). Importantly, routine semen analysis revealed that all patients showed extremely reduced sperm motility and a high proportion of sperm tail defects (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). These variants either were not recorded or had an extremely low frequency in multiple public population databases and were predicted to be potentially deleterious by SIFT, PolyPhen-2 and Mutation Tester (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>). Next, Sanger sequencing confirmed these variants in the probands, and their fertile parents carried the heterozygous variants (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). Moreover, the variant sites are localized in several domains of the DNAH3 protein and are highly conserved across species (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Strikingly, immunofluorescence staining revealed that DNAH3 was exclusively resided in the tail and concentrated in the midpiece of control sperm. However, the fluorescence signal of DNAH3 was hardly detected in the patients’ spermatozoa (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). Additionally, subsequent western blotting analysis yielded consistent results with immunofluorescence staining, indicating that these variants led to disrupted expression of DNAH3 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). These results suggested that biallelic variants in <italic>DNAH3</italic> disrupted DNAH3 expression and might be responsible for the infertility of the four patients.</p>

<title>Asthenoteratozoospermia phenotype is observed in patients with <italic>DNAH3</italic> variants</title>
<p>We next investigated the aberrant sperm morphology of the patients using Papanicolaou staining and SEM analysis. Notably, the tails of sperm from the patients exhibited a typical phenotype associated with MMAF, including coiled, short, bent, irregular, and/or absent flagella (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A and B</xref></bold>). In addition, a fraction of defects in the sperm head were also present in the patients’ sperm (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A and B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>TEM was employed to determine the ultrastructure of the sperm from the patients. Compared to the integrated and well-organized “9 + 2” axonemal arrangement of the sperm flagella from the normal control, spermatozoa from the patients showed absent or disordered CPs, MTDs, and outer dense fibers (ODFs) in different regions of the flagella (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>).</p>

Cross-sections of the midpiece, principal piece and endpiece of sperm from normal control showed the typical ‘‘9 + 2’’ microtubule structure, and an IDA and an ODA were displayed on the A-tube of each microtubule doublet. Cross-sections of the midpiece, principal piece and endpiece of sperm from the patients displayed absent or disordered CPs, MTDs and ODFs, as well as an evident missing of the IDAs in different pieces of the flagella.

<graphic xlink:href="580977v1_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Interestingly, the IDAs of sperm flagella of the patients were hardly captured compared to the control (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). Additionally, in the midpiece of sperm flagella of the patients, dissolved mitochondrial material was also observed evidently under TEM (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). We next conducted immunofluorescence staining to label the mitochondria of patients’ sperm with TOM20, a subunit of the mitochondrial import receptor. Remarkably, in contrast to the robust TOM20 signals observed in the normal control, the TOM20 signals in the sperm from the patients were considerably diminished, indicating a disrupted mitochondrial function (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). Together, these data suggested that <italic>DNAH3</italic> may function in sperm flagellar development, and loss-of-function variants were associated with MMAF in humans.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>DNAH3 is exclusively expressed in the sperm flagella of humans and mice</title>
<p>To further understand the function of DNAH3 in male reproduction, we explored the expression pattern of DNAH3 in humans and mice. qPCR results revealed that <italic>Dnah3</italic> was predominantly expressed in the mouse testis (<bold>Figure S1A</bold>). Moreover, when observing the expression of <italic>Dnah3</italic> in testes from mice at different postnatal days, we found that <italic>Dnah3</italic> expression was significantly elevated beginning on postnatal Day 22, peaked at postnatal Day 30, and maintained a stable expression level thereafter (<bold>Figure S1B</bold>). In addition, germ cells at different stages were isolated from the testes of humans and mice and were stained with anti-DNAH3 antibody. The results showed that DNAH3 was expressed in the cytoplasm of spermatocytes and spermatogonia and then obviously in the flagellum of early and late spermatids (<bold>Figure S2A and B</bold>). These expression data suggest that DNAH3 may play an important role in sperm flagellar development during spermatogenesis in humans and mice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Deletion of <italic>Dnah3</italic> causes male infertility in mice</title>
<p>Considering the absent expression of DNAH3 in the patient sperm, we generated <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice using CRISPR‒Cas9 technology to further confirm the essential role of DNAH3 in spermatogenesis (<bold>Figure S3A</bold>). PCR, qPCR, and immunofluorescence staining were used to confirm that <italic>Dnah3</italic> was null in KO mice (<bold>Figure S3B-E</bold>). The <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice survived without any evident abnormalities in development and behavior. H&amp;E staining further revealed that there were no histological differences in the lung, brain, eye, or oviduct between wild-type (WT) and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice (<bold>Figure S4A</bold>). In addition, no obvious abnormalities in ciliary development were observed in these organs in KO mice compared to WT mice (<bold>Figure S4B</bold>).

<p>TEM was further utilized to evaluate the sperm flagellar ultrastructure of <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice.

<title>DNAH3 deficiency impairs IDAs related to the reduction of IDA-associated proteins</title>
<p>Considering the disrupted IDAs revealed by TEM analysis in both our patients and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice, we speculated whether the defective IDAs were attributed to the decreased expression of the key IDA-associated proteins. The immunofluorescence data showed that DNAH1/DNAH6 and DNALI1, corresponding to the heavy and light intermediate chains of the IDAs, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) respectively, were almost invisible along the sperm flagella of the patients when compared to control (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref></bold>). Consistent results were obtained in our subsequent western blotting analysis of sperm lysates from the patients (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-F</xref></bold>), indicating that DNAH3 may manipulate the assembly of IDA through regulating the expression of IDA-associated proteins.

<title>ICSI treatment of humans with <italic>DNAH3</italic> variants and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice</title>
<p>ICSI treatment has been reported to be effective in asthenoteratozoospermia-associated infertility. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) ICSI cycles were attempted for the patients after written informed consent was obtained. The female partners all had normal basal hormone levels and underwent a long gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist protocol (<bold><xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref></bold>). The wife of Patient 1 underwent one ICSI attempt. A total of 21 metaphase II (MII) oocytes were retrieved and microinjected, of which 17 oocytes were successfully fertilized (17/21, 80.95%) and cleaved (17/17, 100%). Thirteen Day 3 (D3) embryos were formed, six of which developed into blastocysts (8/13, 61.54%) after standard embryo culture. Two blastocysts were transferred, one of which was implanted. She eventually achieved clinical pregnancy, and the pregnancy is ongoing (<bold><xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref></bold>). The partner of Patient 2 underwent two ICSI attempts. In her first ICSI attempt, six MII oocytes were retrieved, of which three were fertilized (3/6, 50%) and cleaved (3/3, 100%). After standard embryo culture, two D3 embryos were formed and transferred. However, this ICSI failed because no embryos were implanted. In her second ICSI attempt, all five MII oocytes were fertilized and cleaved (5/5, 100%). Five D3 embryos were obtained, of which two were transferred, but no embryos were implanted. The remaining three D3 embryos were cultured continuously, and two available blastocysts were formed and kept to be transferred in the future (<bold><xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref></bold>). The partner of Patient 3 underwent one ICSI attempt. Of the 20 MII oocytes retrieved, 19 oocytes were fertilized (19/20, 95.0%) and cleaved (19/19, 100%). Fifteen D3 embryos were obtained, and 10 developed into available blastocysts (10/15, 66.7%). One blastocyst was transferred and implanted. She achieved clinical pregnancy, and the pregnancy is ongoing (<bold><xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref></bold>). The wife of Patient 4 underwent four failed ICSI attempts. In her first two ICSI attempts, 13 and 12 MII oocytes were retrieved, of which five (5/12, 41.67%) and six (6/13, 46.15%), respectively, were fertilized and cleaved. Two available D3 embryos were obtained and transferred in both ICSI attempts, but no embryos were implanted. In her third ICSI attempt, of the eight MII oocytes retrieved, four (4/8, 50%) were fertilized and cleaved (4/4, 100%). However, no available D3 embryos were acquired. In her last ICSI attempt, seven MII oocytes were retrieved, of which three were fertilized (3/7, 42.68%) and two were cleaved (2/3, 66.7%), but no available D3 embryos were formed (<bold><xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we identified pathogenic variants in <italic>DNAH3</italic> in unrelated infertile men with asthenoteratozoospermia. These variations resulted in the almost absence of DNAH3 and sharply decreased the expression of other IDA-associated proteins, including DNAH1, DNAH6 and DNALI1. Combined with similar findings in <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice, we demonstrated that DNAH3 is fundamental for male fertility. Moreover, we suggest that ICSI might be a favorable treatment for male infertility caused by DNAH3 deficiency. Our findings identify a function for DNAH3 in male reproduction in humans and mice and may provide a new view on the clinical practice of male infertility.</p>
<p>Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD, MIM: 244400) is a genetic disorder affecting at least one in 7554 individuals. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) The most common symptoms of PCD are recurrent infections in airways due to malfunction of the motile cilia that are responsible for mucus clearance. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) It has been suggested that male infertility associated with sperm defects is highly prevalent (up to 75%) among individuals with PCD. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) Axonemal defects caused by variants within <italic>DNAH</italic> family members, including <italic>DNAH5</italic>, <italic>DNAH6</italic>, <italic>DNAH7</italic>, <italic>DNAH9</italic> and <italic>DNAH11,</italic> are causative factors for PCD. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) Moreover, deficiency in these PCD-causing <italic>DNAH</italic>s has also been associated with male infertility. (9, 14, 20, 21, 37-39) Additionally, other <italic>DNAH</italic>s, such as <italic>DNAH1</italic>, <italic>DNAH2</italic>, <italic>DNAH8</italic>, <italic>DNAH10</italic>, <italic>DNAH12</italic> and <italic>DNAH17,</italic> are suggested to be pathogenic genes of isolated male infertility. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) These phenotype–genotype correlations may be attributed to the fact that ciliary and flagellar axonemes have cell type-specific or cell type-enriched DNAHs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>) DNAH3 resides in the IDA and is expressed in testis and ciliary tissues, including the lung, brain, eye, and oviduct. However, despite its presence in these tissues, the relationship between deficient DNAH3 and disease is unclear to date. Intriguingly, in our study, we observed male infertility associated with abolished sperm movement and IDA structure in both patients carrying biallelic <italic>DNAH3</italic> mutations and <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice. However, none of the patients reported suffering from any of the principal PCD symptoms, and the <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice showed normal ciliary development in the lung, brain, eye, and oviduct. These findings suggested that DNAH3 may play a more important role in sperm flagellar development than in other motile cilia functions. Given that DNAH3 is expressed in ciliary tissues, its role in these tissues remains intriguing and could be elucidated through sequencing of larger cohorts of individuals with PCD.</p>
<p>In our study, both <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO male mice and <italic>DNAH3</italic>-mutant men are infertile and showed the immotile sperm with disrupted flagellar IDAs and mitochondria. However, there are still some differences between their phenotypes. The <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice displayed moderate sperm morphological defects, and the “9 + 2” microtube arrangement showed no obvious abnormalities. While our patient exhibited a high proportion of sperm tail defects, including coiled, short, bent, and irregular flagella, along with seriously defective “9 + 2” microtube arrangement. Importantly, previous studies have suggested that the phenotypes resulting from depletions of <italic>Dnah</italic>s in mice do not always resemble deficiencies in the human orthologs. Specifically, <italic>Dnah1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice was infertile due to decreased sperm motility, without any observable structural defects of the axoneme. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) In contrast, spermatozoa from <italic>DNAH1</italic>-deficient men exhibited significant axonemal disorganization and MMAF phenotype. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) Combined with our findings, it is conceivable that DNAH3 is crucial for human and mouse male reproduction, but may play distinct roles during flagellar axonemal assembly.</p>
<p>ICSI has been an efficient treatment for male infertility. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) However, the outcomes of ICSI for male infertility caused by variants in different <italic>DNAH</italic> genes are variable. It has been demonstrated that infertile males with variants in <italic>DNAH1</italic>, <italic>DNAH2</italic>, <italic>DNAH7</italic>, and <italic>DNAH8</italic> have a favorable prognosis, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>) while patients with variants in <italic>DNAH17</italic> have poor outcomes after ICSI treatment. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>) Meanwhile, the ICSI outcomes in male infertility caused by <italic>DNAH6</italic> variants may depend on the specific mutation or be controversial. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>) The patients with <italic>DNAH3</italic> mutations in our study experienced different clinical outcomes of ICSI treatment. The partners of Patient 1 and Patient 3 achieved clinical pregnancy. The wives of Patient 2 and Patient 4 obtained favorable fertilization and cleavage rates but experienced no clinical pregnancy due to the nonimplantation of the transferred embryos. Remarkably, despite the diverse variants within <italic>DNAH3</italic> observed in the four patients, all variants led to a complete absence of DNAH3 expression. Therefore, these different ICSI outcomes might be attributed to additional unexplained factors from the female partners. Considering the successful ICSI outcomes observed in <italic>Dnah3</italic> KO mice, we suggested ICSI as an optimized treatment for infertile men carrying variants in <italic>DNAH3</italic>. More cases are needed to precisely estimate the prevalence of <italic>DNAH3</italic> mutations and determine a prognosis for ICSI treatments.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study revealed an unexplored role of DNAH3 in male reproduction in humans and mice, suggesting <italic>DNAH3</italic> as a novel causative gene for human asthenoteratozoospermia. Moreover, ICSI is as an optimized treatment for infertile men with <italic>DNAH3</italic> variants. This study expands our knowledge of the relationship between DNAH proteins and disease, facilitating genetic counseling and clinical treatment of male infertility in the future.</p>

<p>Animal experiments in this study were approved by the Experimental Animal Management and Ethics Committee of West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, and complied with the Animal Care and Use Committee of Sichuan University. A <italic>Dnah3</italic> knockout mouse model was generated by the CRISPR‒Cas9 system. Briefly, Cas9 and signal-guide RNAs (5’-GTATCAAGTGGATGTAAACC-3’) were transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase in vitro and comicroinjected into the cytoplasm of single-cell C57BL/6J mouse embryos to generate frameshift mutations by nonhomologous recombination through introduction of a 1 bp insertion in exon 13. Then, the embryos were cultured and transferred into the oviducts of pseudopregnant female mice at 0.5 days post-coitum. A mutation of <italic>Dnah3</italic> in the founder mouse and their offspring was confirmed using PCR and Sanger sequencing. The primers used for the generation of animal models are listed in <bold>Table S1.</bold></p>

<title>Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)</title>
<p>ICSI was carried out using standard techniques. In brief, one-month-old female KM mice were injected with 5 IU of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) (ProSpec, HOR-272) to induce superovulation. Metaphase II-arrested (MII) oocytes were acquired through another injection of 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin after 48 hours. MII oocytes were incubated with Chatot-Ziomek-Bavister medium (Easycheck, M2750) at 37.5 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> until use. Mouse cauda epididymal spermatozoa were incubated in human tubal fluid (HTF) medium (Easycheck, M1150) and then frozen and thawed repeatedly to remove sperm tails. For ICSI, a single sperm head was microinjected into an MII oocyte by using a NIKON inverted microscope and a Piezo (PrimeTech, Osaka, Japan) in Whitten’s-HEPES medium containing 0.01% polyvinyl alcohol (Gibco,12360-038) and cytochalasin B (3.5 g/ml; Sigma‒Aldrich, C-6762). The successfully injected oocytes were transferred into G1-Plus medium (Vitrolife, 10132) and incubated at 37.5 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The animal experiments were approved by the Experimental Animal Management and Ethics Committee of West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study identifies biallelic variants of DNAH3 in four unrelated infertile men. In addition, it reports that DNAH3 knockout (KO) mice are infertile, and that compromised DNAH3 activity decreases the expression of IDA-associated proteins in the spermatozoa of human patients and the KO mice. Of note, the infertility of both can be rescued by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In aggregate, the work provides <bold>solid</bold> evidence to demonstrate that DNAH3 is a novel pathogenic gene for asthenoteratozoospermia and male infertility . It will be of substantial interest to clinicians, reproductive counselors, embryologists, and basic researchers working on infertility and assisted reproductive technology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study identified biallelic variants of DNAH3 in four unrelated Han Chinese infertile men through whole-exome sequencing, which contributes to abnormal sperm flagellar morphology and ultrastructure. To investigate the importance of DNAH3 in male infertility, the authors generated crispant DNAH3 knockout (KO) male mice. They observed that KO mice are also infertile, showing a severe reduction in sperm movement with abnormal IDA (inner dynein arms) and mitochondrion structure. Moreover, nonfunctional DNAH3 expression decreased the expression of IDA-associated proteins in the spermatozoa of patients and KO mice, which are involved in the disruption of sperm motility. Interestingly, the infertility of patients and KO mice was rescued by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Taken together, the authors propose that DNAH3 is a novel pathogenic gene for asthenoterozoospermia and male infertility.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work investigates the role of DNAH3 in sperm mobility and male infertility and utilised gold-standard molecular biology techniques, showing strong evidence of its role in male infertility. All aspects of the study design and methods are well described and appropriate to address the main question of the manuscript. The conclusions drawn are consistent with the analyses conducted and supported by the data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript lacks a comparison with previous studies on DNAH3 in the Discussion section.</p>
<p>(2) The variants of DNAH3 in four infertile men were identified through whole-exome sequencing. Providing an overview of the WES data would be beneficial to offer additional insights into whether other variants may contribute the infertility. This could also help explain why ICSI only works for two out of four patients with DNAH3 variants.</p>
<p>(3) Quantification of images would help substantiate the conclusions, particularly in Figures 2, 3, 4, and 6. Improved images in Figures 3A, 4B, and 4C, would help increase confidence in the claims made.</p>
