<title>Abstract</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease with a high prevalence in the elderly population, but our understanding of its mechanisms remains incomplete. Analysis of serum exosomal small RNA sequencing data from clinical patients and gene expression data from OA patient serum and cartilage obtained from the GEO database revealed a common dysregulated miRNA, miR-NA-199b-5p. In vitro cell experiments demonstrated that miRNA-199b-5p inhibits chondrocyte vitality and promotes extracellular matrix degradation. Conversely, inhibition of miRNA-199b- 5p under inflammatory conditions exhibited protective effects against damage. Local viral injec-tion of miRNA-199b-5p into mice induced a decrease in pain threshold and OA-like changes. In an OA model, inhibition of miRNA-199b-5p alleviated the pathological progression of OA. Fur-thermore, bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation identified <italic>Gcnt2</italic> and <italic>Fzd6</italic> as tar-get genes of miRNA-199b-5p. Thus, these results indicated that miRNA-199b-5p/<italic>Gcnt2</italic> and <italic>Fzd6</italic> axis might be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of OA.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease characterized by the deterioration of articular carti-lage and affecting all components of the joint, including the synovium, subchondral bone, and meniscus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Knee OA (KOA) is the leading cause of disability and increased living costs among elderly patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Currently, the treatment options for osteoarthritis are limited to symptomatic relief and joint replacement. However, the insufficient relief of symptoms, potential medication side effects, and the economic burden and complications associated with joint replacement sur-geries have prompted the need to identify new, effective, and safe treatment methods and explore unknown targets for individuals with KOA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that are distributed in body fluids such as serum and play a crucial biological role by delivering molecules such as MicroRNAs (miRNAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. They serve as vital carriers for intercellular communication and transfer of genetic information. MiRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs ranging from 18 to 24 nucleotides in length, which exert inhibitory effects on the expression of target genes through interactions with mRNA. Studies have demon-strated that miRNAs play a crucial role as a pathogenic factor in osteoarthritis (OA). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. For in-stance, miR-199b-5p was found to contribute to the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>; another miR-140 showed cartilage-specific expression, and its expression was significantly reduced in OA cartilage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup><sup>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.recently, intra-articular injection of antisense oligonu-cleotides of miR-181a-5p produced chondroprotective effects in OA mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we initially screened miR-199b-5p as a potential key miRNA based on clinical data by detecting differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs. To elucidate the role and function of miR-199b-5p, we investigated its impact on chondrocytes, which are crucial pathogenic cells in KOA, and identified its molecular targets through in vitro experiments. Furthermore, we ex-plored its role in vivo. Hence, this article not only identifies miR-199b-5p as a potential micro-target for KOA but also provides a potential strategy for future identification of new molecular drugs.</p>

<title>Identification and enrichment analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs in serum exo-somes</title>
<p>To investigate the dysregulated miRNAs in serum exosomes of KOA patients, we extracted exo-somal miRNAs from serum and performed sequencing. Serum samples from 15 patients with KOA and 10 healthy subjects were collected (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). After extraction, the se-rum exosomes were observed under transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis, revealing a diameter ranging from approximately 70 to 150 nm (Fig. S1A, B). Further-more, the surface marker proteins CD9, CD63, and CD81 were found to be expressed on the ex-osomes (Fig. S1C). Next, we performed sequencing of miRNAs in serum exosomes.</p>
<p>The results showed that 88 miRNAs were up-regulated and 89 miRNAs were downregulated in KOA patients compared with the control group based on fold change &gt; 1.5 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). Afterwards, we performed bioinformatics Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses on these differentially expressed genes. Among the top 5 enriched results of up-regulated differentially expressed miRNAs, the CC (Cell, intracellular, and cytoplasm) GO terms were notable. The MF (Translation activator activity, binding to ubiq-uitin-conjugating enzymes, and possessing transferase activity) GO terms and BP (Cell differen-tiation and the stabilization of mRNA through 3’-UTR mediation) GO terms were also significant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The top 10 enriched KEGG pathways, PI3K-AKT signaling, Ras signaling, apoptosis, and other types of O-glycan biosynthesis are considered to be of significant importance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).The analysis of the top 5 down-regulated differential miRNAs reveals interesting findings. the CC (Cell, intracellular) GO terms were particularly noteworthy. The MF (RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity and sequence-specific DNA binding) GO terms, as well as the BP (collagen-activated signaling pathway) GO terms, were also deemed significant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). More-over, the analysis of the top 10 enriched KEGG pathways revealed a strong association with the Hedgehog signaling pathway, pluripotency of stem cells, and glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-keratan sulfate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>Dysregulated serum exosomal miRNAs were found to be expressed in both serum and car-tilage</title>
<p>Subsequently, we aimed to investigate whether these dysregulated miRNAs in serum exosomes show differential expression in other affected sites or tissues of KOA. Leveraging the KOA pa-tient cartilage and serum sequencing data available in the GEO database, we compared our dysregulated miRNA list with the datasets. Remarkably, we identified 169 miRNAs that exhibit-ed differential expression in the serum of KOA patients (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), suggesting their involvement in the disease. Moreover, these miRNAs were also found to be expressed in KOA patient carti-lage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). This robust validation reinforces the reliability of our data. Consequently, we pro-ceeded with further screening of differentially expressed genes.</p>

<title>miRNA-199b-5p has been identified as a potential target molecule in KOA</title>
<p>Based on the P-value and exosomal expression, five miRNAs(hsa-mir-3168, hsa-mir-1296-5p, hsa-mir-15b-3p, hsa-mir-338-3p and hsa-mir-199b-5p) were selected to further research and val-idated in independent human samples by RT-qPCR (hsa-mir-199b-5p, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; hsa-mir-3168, <italic>p</italic>=0.33; hsa-mir-15b-3p, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; hsa-mir-338-3p, <italic>p</italic>=0.20 and hsa-mir-1296-5p, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). To further explore the functional roles of these miRNAs, we established a mouse model of KOA to evaluate their expression in the joints. Due to species limitations, we examined the ex-pression of miR-199b-5p (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.01), miR-15b-3p (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.05) and miR-338-3p (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.05) in joint tissue samples (control <italic>vs</italic> M-0.5) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). The results showed that only the expression trend of miR-199b-5p was consistent between the clinical samples and the mouse arthritis model. There-fore, we selected miR-199b-5p as the target for our subsequent research.</p>

<title>miR-199b-5p mimic inhibits the cell viability and extracellular matrix (ECM) of chondro-cytes and inhibitor restores LPS-induced chondrocytes damage</title>
<p>We first extracted mouse primary chondrocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref>). In vitro experiments showed that overexpression miR-199b-5p inhibited the viability of chondrocytes(<italic>p</italic>&lt;<italic>0.01</italic>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, Fig. S2). we also find miR-199b-5p mimic increased the mRNA expressions of <italic>MMP3</italic> (<italic>p=</italic>0.09) and <italic>ADAMTS5</italic> (<italic>p&lt;0.05</italic>) and decreased the mRNA expression of <italic>COL2A1</italic>(<italic>p</italic>=0.05), <italic>AGGRECAN</italic> (p=0.20) and <italic>SOX9</italic> (<italic>p</italic>=0.22), which are often used as the biomarkers of chondrocytes ECM met-abolic balance.

While some gene expression changes may not be significant in statistic, but the modulation of miR-199b-5p expression has been ob-served to exert an influence on the metabolic alterations of chondrocytes.</p>

<p>To explore the effect of miR-199b-5p under pathological conditions, an LPS-stimulated inflam-mation chondrocyte cell model was established. We examined the effect of LPS at 5, 10, and 15 μg/ml on cell viability and found that cell viability was significantly decreased at 15 μg/ml(<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>). Next, we chose 15 μg/ml of LPS to establish a chondrocyte injury model. The CCK-8 assay showed that miR-199b-5p inhibitor reversed the decrease of cell viabil-ity caused by LPS (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>). Also, we revealed that LPS elevated <italic>MMP3</italic> (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) and <italic>ADAMTS5</italic> (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) and decreased <italic>COL2A1</italic>(<italic>p</italic>=0.06), <italic>AGGRECAN</italic> (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01), and <italic>SOX9</italic> (<italic>p</italic>=0.13) expression. In the presence of miR-199b-5p inhibitor, the changes in mRNA levels were re-versed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L-P</xref>). These results suggest that miR-199b-5p overexpression reduces cell viability and miR-199b-5p inhibition partly restores LPS-induced cell damage and ECM degradation.</p>

<title>miR-199b-5p mimic induces inflammation in normal mice, and miR-199b-5p inhibitor alle-viates symptoms in KOA mice</title>
<p>Now, we want to know the vivo role of miRNA-199b-5p. Firstly, we screened Adneovirus(AD) and utilized High-AD as a vector to either overexpress or inhibit the expression of miR-199b- 5p(Fig. S3). Then, miR-199b-5p mimic was injected to the joint of mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) and a decrease in pain threshold was found (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Four weeks later, serum <italic>IFN-γ</italic> (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) and <italic>TNF-α</italic> (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) were also significantly increased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). The cartilage of mice injected with the miR-199b-5p mimic was slightly degraded (<italic>p</italic>=0.02) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, F</xref>). Additionally, the ar-ticular surface showed insect erosion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). interestingly, the level of serum inflammation in the miR-199b-5p inhibitor injection group was significantly decreased compared with the mimic group (<italic>IFN-γ</italic>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01; <italic>TNF-α</italic>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). These results indicated that intra-articular injection of miR-199b-5p mimic induced inflammation response in mice.</p>

Safranin-fast green staining of joints showed recovery of articular cartilage degradation (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E, F</xref>), and the moth erosion of the cartilage μCT was partly improved (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>).

<title><italic>Gcnt2</italic> and <italic>Fzd6</italic> are two target genes of miR-199b-5p</title>
<p>In order to investigate the underlying mechanism of miRNA-199b-5p, we utilized five widely used miRNA target gene prediction tools, namely miRWalk, miRDB, TarBase, starbase, and TargetScan, to identify potential target genes. Consequently, we identified six putative target genes of miRNA-199b-5p (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Bioinformatics analysis of the six possible target genes showed that BP is in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression and angiogenesis; CC is in cytoplasmic vesicle and cell leading edge; and MF is in ubiquitin protein ligase binding and pro-tein domain specific binding (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we initially performed sequencing of serum exosomal miRNAs from clinical pa-tients and identified 177 dysregulated miRNAs. Subsequently, through comparison with GEO data, we found that 169 miRNAs were expressed in both KOA serum and cartilage. Following a screening process, miR-199b-5p was selected for further experiments. In cell-based assays, we discovered that miR-199b-5p can influence the viability of chondrocytes and cytokine-mediated extracellular matrix metabolism. Moreover, in vitro experiments demonstrated that it can induce inflammation and abnormal pain threshold in normal mice. Importantly, inhibition of miR-199b- 5p alleviated the pathological symptoms of KOA. Finally, these effects were achieved by target-ing <italic>Gcnt2</italic> and <italic>Fzd6</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Thus, our findings demonstrated that miR-199b-5p might be a novel potential therapeutic target for OA prevention and treatment.</p>

<p>miRNAs function as regulators of gene expression in biological processes by regulate mRNA translation by specifically binding to the 3′UTRs of target mRNAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Exosomes are rich in miRNAs, and various cells can secrete exosomes to target cells under physiological and patho-logical conditions, which function as delivery vehicles for miRNAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup><sup>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. There is evidence sug-gesting that miRNAs can participate in various cellular processes (inflammation, cell viability, ECM dysregulation) and signaling pathways (Hedgehog signaling, PI3K-AKT signaling) rele-vant to OA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup><sup>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Our differential miRNA enrichment analysis also strongly supports the correla-tion with these findings.</p>
<p>In cancer research, overexpression of miR-199b-5p can inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo by targeting DDR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, exogenous miR-199b-5p inhibited the growth of bone marrow mesenchy-mal stem cells (MSCs) and promoted the differentiation of bone MSCs into chondrocytes by tar-geting the <italic>JAG1</italic> pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup><sup>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Our functional experiments showed that overexpression of miR- 199b-5p reduced chondrocyte viability and the expression of anabolic factors such as COL2A1, AGGREGN, and SOX9. It also increased inflammation levels and decreased pain thresholds in control mice. Although no pathological changes were observed in the articular cartilage of con-trol mice, a similar study demonstrated that pathological cartilage changes only occurred after six months in mice with miR-211 and miR-204 knockout<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, we speculate that the time of overexpression of miR-199b-5p in our experiment was too short, so it only caused inflammation and pain threshold response. To best of our knowledge, this is the initial investigation document-ing the involvement of miR-199b-5p in KOA.</p>
<p><italic>Fzd6</italic> is known to be up-regulated during the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and can be regu-lated by miR-194-5p to activate the WNT signaling pathway, thereby promoting osteogenic dif-ferentiation of MSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. <italic>Gcnt2</italic> has been found to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition and enhance migration and invasion of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Our findings in-dicate that miR-199b-5p plays a crucial role in KOA by targeting <italic>Fzd6</italic> and <italic>Gcnt2</italic>. Future re-search should further explore the roles and mechanisms of <italic>Fzd6</italic> and <italic>Gcnt2</italic> in the context of KOA.</p>
<p>This study also has some limitations. We initially detected serum exosomes miRNA and later examined the miRNA through in vitro experiment and animal study. However, whether the miRNAs targeting the joints have the same role as the serum exosome miRNAs or blood miRNA has not been clear. We also performed direct intra-articular injection of adenoviral vectors. The intra-articular injection can reduce the exposure of extra-articular tissue, thereby minimizing the associated side effects and improving targeting. Besides, more in-vivo study such as gene knockout mice study can be used in the future study.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found that miR-199b-5p is elevated in osteoarthritis and may affect cell viabil-ity and related cytokines by targeting <italic>Gcnt2</italic> and <italic>Fzd6</italic>. Overexpression of miR-199b-5p induced OA-like pathological changes in normal mice and inhibiting miR-199b-5p alleviated symptoms in KOA mice, suggesting it may be a target for treatment of OA. Through human clinical trials, cell experiments, and animal models, we not only identified a new OA-related miR-199b-5p but also examined the biological function of miR-199b-5p in OA.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors observed that miR-199b-5p is elevated in osteoarthritis (OA) patients. They also found that overexpression of miR-199b-5p induced OA-like pathological changes in normal mice and inhibiting miR-199b-5p alleviated symptoms in knee OA mice. They concluded that miR-199b-5p is not only a potential micro-target for knee OA but also provides a potential strategy for the future identification of new molecular drugs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data are generated from both human patients and animal models.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The data presented in this manuscript is not solid enough to support their conclusions. There are several questions that need to be addressed to improve the quality of this study.</p>
<p>The following questions that need to be addressed to improve the quality of the study.</p>
<p>1. Exosomes were characterized by electron microscopy and western blot analysis (for CD9, 264 CD63, and CD81). However, figure S1 only showed two sample WB results and there is no positive and negative control as well as the confused not clear WB figure.</p>
<p>2. The sequencing of miRNAs in serum exosomes showed that 88 miRNAs were upregulated and 89 miRNAs were downregulated in KOA patients compared with the control group based on fold change &gt; 1.5 and p &lt; 0.05. Figure 2 legend did not clearly elucidate what those represent and why the authors chose those five miRNAs to further validate although they did mention it with several words in line 108 'based on the p-value and exosomal'.</p>
<p>3. In Figure 3 legend and methods, the authors did not mention how they performed the cell viability assay. What cell had been used? How long were they treated and all the details? Other figure legends have the same problem without detailed information.</p>
<p>4. The authors claimed that Gcnt2 and Fzd6 are two target genes of miR-199b-5p. However, there is no convincing evidence such as western blot to support their bioinformatics prediction.</p>
<p>5. To verify the binding site on 3'UTR of two potential targets, the authors designed a mouse sequence for luciferase assay, but not sure if it is the same when using a human sequence.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors identified miR-199b-5p as a potential OA target gene using serum exosomal small RNA-seq from human healthy and OA patients. Their RNA-seq results were further compared with publicly available datasets to validate their finding of miR-199b-5p. In vitro chondrocyte culture with miR-199b-5p mimic/inhibitor and in vivo animal models were used to evaluate the function of miR-199b-5p in OA. The possible genes that were potentially regulated by miR-199b-5p were also predicted (i.e., Fzd6 and Gcnt2) and then validated by using Luciferase assays.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. Strong in vivo animal models including pain tests.</p>
<p>
2. Validates the binding of miR-199b-5p with Fzd6 and binding of miR-199b-5p with Gcnt2.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. The authors may overinterpret their results. The current work shows the possible bindings between miR-199b-5p and Fzd6 as well as bindings between miR-199b-5p and Gcnt2.
