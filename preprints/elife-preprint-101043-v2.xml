<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Intrinsic sensory neurons are an essential part of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and play a crucial role in gastrointestinal tract motility and digestion. Neuronal subtypes in the ENS have been distinguished by their electrophysiological properties, morphology, and expression of characteristic markers, notably neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Here we investigated synaptic cell adhesion molecules as novel cell type markers in the ENS. Our work identifies two Type II classic cadherins, <italic>Cdh6</italic> and <italic>Cdh8,</italic> specific to sensory neurons in the mouse colon. We show that <italic>Cdh6+</italic> neurons demonstrate all other distinguishing classifications of enteric sensory neurons including marker expression of <italic>Calcb</italic> and <italic>Nmu</italic>, Dogiel type II morphology and AH-type electrophysiology and <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> current. Optogenetic activation of <italic>Cdh6+</italic> sensory neurons in distal colon evokes retrograde colonic motor complexes (CMCs), while pharmacologic blockade of rhythmicity-associated current <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> disrupts the spontaneous generation of CMCs. These findings provide the first demonstration of selective activation of a single neurochemical and functional class of enteric neurons, and demonstrate a functional and critical role for sensory neurons in the generation of CMCs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sensory signaling within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract plays a critical role in the autonomous regulation of digestion. The GI tract is the only internal organ system containing its own sensory neurons. Intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs) detect relevant stimuli through chemo- and mechano-sensation and direct appropriate GI functions via downstream components of the enteric nervous system (ENS), including ascending and descending interneurons, and excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). These neuronal subtypes have begun to be distinguished morphologically, electrophysiologically, and by marker expression, classically especially of neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), and together this information has provided an opening to characterize individual neuron subtype function within the GI tract.</p>
<p>Synaptic cell adhesion molecules define neuronal subtype connectivity within many regions of the CNS. Type II Cadherins are a family of synaptic cell adhesion molecules with combinatorial expression in multiple neural circuits of the CNS, including retina, limbic, olivonuclear, and auditory projection systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Type II Cadherins bind homophilically by expression of the same cadherin at both the pre- and post-synapse, which stabilizes developing synapses between correct partners while incorrect synapses are pruned away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Recent RNA- Seq studies of human and mouse ENS have identified synaptic cell adhesion molecules, including Type II Cadherins, expressed in enteric neuronal subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). However, the specificity of their expression has yet to be harnessed to assess neuronal subtype-specific function in the ENS.</p>
<p>Here we identify Type II Cadherin, <italic>Cdh6</italic>, as a novel marker for IPANs of the colonic ENS. We demonstrate the sensory identity of <italic>Cdh6</italic> neurons by immunohistochemical, morphological and neurophysiological classification. <italic>Cdh6</italic> neurons express IPAN markers <italic>Calcb</italic> and <italic>Nmu</italic>. Sparse labeling of individual IPANs reveals they project mainly circumferentially and branch extensively in myenteric ganglia. Whole cell patch clamp recordings of sensory neurons <italic>in situ</italic> reveal action potential (AP) slow after-hyperpolarizations characteristic of IPANs, and hyperpolarization-activated cationic current (<italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic>), a rhythmicity indicator in thalamocortical and other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Using a <italic>Cdh6</italic> genetic mouse model, we show that optogenetic activation of distal colon IPANs is sufficient to evoke retrograde CMCs, while pharmacologic block of <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> in IPANs disrupts colonic rhythmicity and reversibly abolishes spontaneous CMCs.</p>

<title>Expression of the type II classic cadherin <italic>Cdh6</italic> in colonic IPANs</title>
<p>To identify Cadherins expressed in enteric neuronal subtypes in mouse, we screened recently published RNA-Seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) for Classic Type II cadherin expression. <italic>Cdh6</italic> and <italic>Cdh8</italic> appeared to be restricted to IPAN subsets in both small intestine and colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). <italic>Cdh9</italic> was previously identified in a separate population of IPANs in the small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). We validated <italic>Cdh6</italic> and <italic>Cdh8</italic> expression by RNAscope <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization in the myenteric plexus, which contains the enteric motility circuitry. <italic>Cdh6</italic> mRNA was expressed in 14.7 Â± 0.8% of myenteric neurons in small intestine (jejunum) and in 6.8 Â± 0.3% of myenteric neurons in distal colon (mean Â± SEM) [<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A-C</xref>]. <italic>Cdh8</italic> was almost exclusively co-expressed in <italic>Cdh6+</italic> neurons, although at a much lower level of detection [<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D-H</xref>]. We therefore focused our further analysis on <italic>Cdh6+</italic> neurons.</p>

<p>To confirm IPAN identity of <italic>Cdh6+</italic> neurons, we first established the differential expression of two putative and broadly used markers of IPANs, <italic>Calcb</italic> and <italic>Nmu</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). We found that all <italic>Nmu+</italic> neurons co-express <italic>Calcb</italic> in both jejunum and distal colon [<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1I-K</xref>]. In contrast, only about half of <italic>Calcb+</italic> neurons in the jejunum and two-thirds in the distal colon co-express <italic>Nmu</italic> [<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1L</xref>].</p>
<p>We next assessed co-expression of <italic>Cdh6</italic> with <italic>Calcb</italic> and <italic>Nmu.</italic> In the jejunum, we found that nearly all <italic>Nmu+</italic> neurons and <italic>Calcb+</italic> neurons express <italic>Cdh6</italic> [<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1P, U</xref>], though only about three-quarters of all <italic>Cdh6+</italic> neurons express <italic>Calcb</italic> and only about half express <italic>Nmu</italic> [<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1O, T</xref>]. In contrast, in the distal colon, while <italic>Cdh6</italic> is only expressed in about two-thirds of all <italic>Calcb+</italic> neurons [<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1U</xref>], nearly all <italic>Cdh6+</italic> neurons express <italic>Nmu</italic> and <italic>Calcb</italic> [<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1O, T</xref>]. Taken together, our data show that in the myenteric plexus, <italic>Cdh6</italic> is expressed exclusively in <italic>Calcb+/Nmu+</italic> IPANs in the mouse distal colon [<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1W, X</xref>].</p>

<title>Mouse colonic IPANs display AH-type electrophysiology and <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> current</title>
<p>We next assessed the electrophysiological properties of <italic>Cdh6+</italic> IPANs. We focused our analysis on the colon, and for ease of neuron tracing, took advantage of a genetic strategy to sparsely label <italic>Cdh6+</italic> neurons. Previous studies of Hb9:GFP transgenic mice have shown that due to the inserted transgeneâs proximity to <italic>Cdh6</italic>, <italic>Cdh6+</italic> neurons can express eGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Hb9:GFP+ neurons were rare and projected extensively throughout the myenteric plexus [<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A-C</xref>]. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization confirmed <italic>eGFP</italic> expression was limited to a small fraction (3.5 Â± 0.8%) of <italic>Cdh6+</italic> colonic neurons [<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2D, F-H</xref>], and all <italic>eGFP+</italic> neurons expressed <italic>Cdh6</italic> [<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2E</xref>].</p>

<p>We developed a protocol to perform whole-cell patch-clamp recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) in Hb9:GFP+ colonic neurons in the distal colon. Membrane capacitance reflecting overall size of these cells was 32 Â± 8.7 pF [<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3D</xref>]; their resting membrane potential (RMP) was â49.4 Â± 2.9 mV [<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref>]. The input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>) was 393 Â± 54.7 Mâ¦ [<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3E</xref>] as computed from the slope of the voltage-current (V-I) relationship. All patched neurons had large-amplitude action potentials (AP; 72 Â± 2.5 mV, [<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3F, E</xref>]) with threshold of â26.4 Â± 0.9 mV [<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3L</xref>] and a half width of 1.2 Â± 0.1 ms [<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3H</xref>] elicited at rheobase (20 Â± 4.5 pA, [<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3G</xref>]), each followed by an afterhyperpolarization (AHP= â67.7 Â± 0.9 mV, [<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3K</xref>]). In addition, the first derivative of membrane voltage during the action potential (dV/dt, [<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3J</xref>]) exhibited an inflection during the repolarization phase, suggesting the presence of fast and slow AP repolarization mechanisms [<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3F</xref>]. Patched Hb9:GFP+ neurons generally could not sustain repetitive APs in response to long depolarizing current pulses. All patched neurons responded to hyperpolarizing current pulses with a time-dependent membrane potential sag (â6.3 Â± 1.2 mV, [<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3B, M</xref>]), and a rebound depolarization following the hyperpolarization [<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3B, N</xref>].</p>

<title>Optogenetic activation of distal colon IPANs evokes CMCs</title>
<p>In thalamocortical relay neurons, <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> contributes to intrinsic slow rhythmic burst firing at 1-2Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), but the function of <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> in colonic IPANs is not known. During colonic motor complexes (CMCs), large regions of the ENS oscillate in synchrony at 1-2Hz to generate traveling contractions along the colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Recent calcium imaging studies have shown that IPANs participate, along with all other subtypes of enteric neurons, in this synchronized oscillatory firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Furthermore, our electrophysiological studies confirm the presence of <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> in mouse colonic IPANs [<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3N</xref>].

Blue light stimulation of <italic>Cdh6+</italic> IPANs in distal colon 60-90 seconds after a spontaneous CMC (âcontrolâ CMC) resulted in an evoked, premature CMC that began during stimulation (N = 17 stimulations; n = 5 mice)[<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6D, E</xref>]. Evoked CMCs traveled retrogradely from the distal to the proximal colon. They were similar to spontaneous CMCs in peak amplitude, area under the curve, and duration, though the contractile force (peak amplitude and AUC) was slightly weaker in the proximal colon [<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6F-H</xref>]. Blue light stimulation in proximal or mid colon failed to generate CMCs (n = 5/5, data not shown).

<title>Blockade of <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> current in colonic IPANs disrupts CMC production</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study shows that in the myenteric plexus, <italic>Cdh6</italic> is expressed exclusively in <italic>Calcb+/Nmu+</italic> IPANs located in the mouse distal colon, while in the small intestine, <italic>Cdh6</italic> is also expressed in some <italic>Calcb+/Nmu-</italic> and <italic>Calcb-/Nmu-</italic> neurons. We confirm the IPAN identity of <italic>Cdh6+</italic> distal colonic neurons by electrophysiological recordings revealing AH-type signature, and single neuron tracings showing Dogiel type II morphology. Finally, we demonstrate that activation of IPANs in the distal colon evokes retrograde CMCs, while pharmacologic blockade of <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic>, a rhythmicity associated current we show also present in mouse colonic IPANs, disrupts spontaneous CMC generation.</p>
<p>Together with <italic>Cdh8</italic>, which we show to be co-expressed with <italic>Cdh6,</italic> our study validates two new adhesion molecules specific to IPANs in the distal colon. Notably, these markers show a different expression pattern than another cadherin, <italic>Cdh9</italic>, which is exclusively expressed in the small intestine in mouse, not in the colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). <italic>Cdh9</italic> is expressed in a subset of IPANs not expressing either <italic>Calcb</italic> or <italic>Nmu</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). It is possible that in the small intestine <italic>Cdh6</italic> and <italic>Cdh9</italic> mark some of the same neurons. However, RNA-Seq data from two separate studies suggest this is unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). We conclude that <italic>Cdh6/Cdh8</italic> IPANs are a separate population from <italic>Cdh9</italic> IPANs. Finally, our study was limited to the myenteric plexus, containing motility circuitry. IPANs are also present in the submucosal plexus, and it would be interesting to investigate <italic>Cdh6</italic> expression and neuronal subtype in the SMP.</p>
<p>Though IPANs are positioned to initiate motility by activating other subtypes in enteric circuitry, their role in spontaneous CMCs has been debated, as CMCs can occur in the absence of luminal contents, without any apparent stimulus for IPANs to sense, or upon stimulation of nitrergic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Only recently has evidence emerged to suggest that IPANs participate in oscillatory rhythmic firing of the ENS during CMCs, and that activation of neuronal subtypes expressing calretinin, including IPANs, together can evoke CMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Our results demonstrate that excitement of IPANs alone in the distal colon is capable of producing retrograde CMCs. The exact mechanism causing CMC generation at an established and controlled frequency of once every few minutes, without evident stimulus, remains to be determined.</p>
<p>A major observation was that optogenetic stimulation of <italic>Cdh6</italic>+ neurons readily evoked CMCs from the distal colon, but never from the proximal colon. Failure of proximal colonic stimulation to evoke CMCs may reflect inhibition by IPAN recruitment of descending pathways; or conversely, high efficacy of stimulation from distal colon may reflect bias toward activation of ascending excitatory cholinergic pathways. Our classification of <italic>Cdh6+</italic> neurons as IPANs in the distal colon may not extend to the proximal colon; thus, we cannot extrapolate that <italic>Cdh6</italic>+ optogenetic activation in the colon is restricted to IPANs as in the distal colon. In addition, our stimulus paradigm in the proximal colon may not have activated enough neurons based on light density and illumination. In previous studies, optogenetic stimulation of calretinin-expressing neurons or choline acetyl transferase (ChAT)-expressing neurons (both of which include IPANs, interneurons and motor neurons) elicited anterograde CMCs regardless of stimulus location, including proximal colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Proximal colon stimulation of nitric oxide synthase-expressing neurons also elicited CMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). These studies, as noted, each activated multiple neuronal classes employing the same neurotransmitter. How broad and non-specific activation of such disparate neuron classes readily evokes CMCs remains unclear.</p>
<p>Spontaneous and evoked CMCs were abolished in hexamethonium, confirming that CMC synchronous firing is dependent on nicotinic cholinergic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). This reinforces that nicotinic cholinergic transmission is required for greater activation and synchrony of the entire ENS motility network to generate CMCs.</p>
<p>Through our electrophysiological investigation of IPANs in the distal colon using voltage clamp, our work reveals the presence of two voltage gated ion conductances and their underlying currents, <italic>I<sub>T</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic>. Slow AHP, <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>T</sub></italic> have been previously identified as distinguishing characteristics of IPANs in rat and guinea pig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Although prior studies noted <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> and proposed <italic>I<sub>T</sub></italic> in guinea pig Dogiel type II neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), they have not previously been reported in studies of intact mouse distal colon myenteric plexus due to the conventional reliance on sharp electrode recordings in which voltage clamp is not possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). The presence of <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>T</sub></italic> in thalamocortical relay neurons and other cell types supports intrinsic rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). It is possible that these two currents may similarly promote autonomous rhythmic activity in colonic IPANs.</p>
<p><italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> is conducted through hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated (HCN) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). HCN channel family members HCN1 and HCN2 have been shown to be present in mouse distal colonic Dogiel type II neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), and RNA-Seq ENS screens similarly indicate their expression in IPANs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Knockout of HCN2 in mouse leads to a severe growth restriction phenotype due to malnutrition and GI dysmotility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Here we demonstrate that pharmacologic blockade of <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic>, which we show to be present in IPANs, with two distinct HCN channel blockers ZD7288 and CsCl abolishes CMCs, an otherwise persistent and ongoing pattern of motor activity in the mouse colon. We speculate that <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> in colonic IPANs, as in thalamocortical neurons, plays a role in promoting either rhythmic oscillatory single neuron activity, or network burst firing, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Blocking <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> may impair individual IPANsâ ability to fire rhythmically, or the ability of IPANs to synchronize into a network burst firing mode. Failure of IPANs to fully activate and synchronize could prevent generation of both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) synchronized rhythmic myenteric network activation of motility circuits, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) the resulting synchronized contractions that sum to much larger contractile forces during CMCs.</p>
<p>Type II cadherins are most commonly homophilic synaptic cell adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). <italic>Cdh6</italic> can also form heterodimers with <italic>Cdh7, Cdh10,</italic> and <italic>Cdh14</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). However, <italic>Cdh10</italic> and <italic>Cdh14</italic> are very lowly expressed in the colon by single cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), and we performed RNAscope for <italic>Cdh7</italic> and did not observe any expression (data not shown). Restricted expression of two Type II cadherins, <italic>Cdh6</italic> and <italic>Cdh8</italic>, to mouse colonic IPANs raises the possibility of these cadherins supporting IPAN-IPAN synaptic connections. While broadly speaking, IPANs are not known to receive synaptic input and in fact have been characterized electrophysiologically by their lack thereof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), some work has in fact suggested that AH-AH neuron interconnected pairs may exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Immunohistochemical and electron microscopy investigation of synapses on enteric neurons further showed that calbindin-positive neurons, presumed IPANs, do receive synapses, though fewer than non-calbindin neurons, and some of those synapses were also calbindin-reactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). These observations informed a proposed âIPAN driver circuitâ theory, in which IPANs form an interconnected network of positive feedback to synchronize and amplify sensory signaling and thus activate large swaths of enteric circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). In contrast, more recently, activation of large regions of the ENS has been suggested to be driven by interneuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). It is important to note that our study was unsuccessful in localizing Cdh6 protein via immunohistochemistry, to confirm protein expression in neurons or in Cdh6-cre-tdT+ muscle cells or visualize synaptic connections between neurons or connections to other cell types. Further investigations are necessary to determine whether synaptic adhesion molecules, such as <italic>Cdh6</italic> and <italic>Cdh8</italic>, may in fact support IPAN-IPAN synapses underlying an âIPAN driver circuit.â</p>

Briefly, each intestinal segment was opened along the mesentery border, pinned flat under light tension serosa-side up, and fixed in 4% PFA in PBS at 4Â°C with gentle rocking for 90 minutes. Segments were washed three times in PBS at 4Â°C for at least 10 minutes with gentle rocking. Muscularis was separated from the mucosa at one end of the segment with fine forceps for 2-3 mm, then pinned mucosa-side up in the dish. The mucosa was peeled away from the muscularis with fine forceps while the muscularis was gently held down in the dish with a cotton swab. For immunohistochemistry, segments were processed immediately or stored in PBS with 0.1% NaN<sub>3</sub> at 4Â°C until use. For RNAscope, muscularis segments were post-fixed in 4% PFA in PBS at 4Â°C with gentle rocking overnight, then washed three times in PBS at 4Â°C with gentle rocking for at least 10 minutes each wash before use.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Briefly, muscularis wholemount tissue segments about 7mm x 7mm were incubated with primary antibodies in PBT (PBS with 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton-X 100) at 4Â°C with gentle rocking overnight, then washed three times in PBT for at least ten minutes each at room temperature with gentle shaking. Tissues were incubated in secondary antibodies in PBT for 2 hours with gentle shaking, washed twice in PBT, and twice in PBS, then mounted on Superfrost Plus slides with Fluoromount G medium (Southern Biotech). Primary antibodies: human anti-HuC/D (1:75k) (gift from Vanda Lennon); sheep anti-GFP (1:1k) (Biogenesis); rabbit anti-RFP (1:1k) (Rockland); rabbit anti-PGP9.5 (1:4k) (Abcam). Secondary antibodies: donkey anti-human AlexaFluor (AF)-647 (1:500); donkey anti-sheep AF-488 (1:1k); donkey anti-rabbit AF-488 (1:1k); streptavidin AF-546 (1:500).</p>

<title>Confocal imaging</title>
<p>Images were acquired on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope using a 20x (NA 0.75) oil objective at 1024 x 1024 pixel resolution. Tiled images (24-30 tiles) of Z-stacks (2.5Âµm between planes) were acquired and stitched together using the Navigator mode within LASX (Leica). Imaged regions were located away from the mesenteric border.</p>

<sec id="s6f">
<title>Image analysis and quantification</title>
<p>Image analysis was performed using ImageJ/FIJI (NIH, Bethesda, MD), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). HuC/D images (z-stack individual planes) were blurred and thresholded; then maximally projected and total neurons counted using the Analyze Particles function. Cdh6<sup>CreER</sup>;Ai32 expression and RNAscope <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and Cdh6<sup>CreER</sup>;Ai14 expression were counted manually.

<title>Electrophysiological recordings</title>
<p>Whole cell patch clamp electrophysiological recordings of Hb9:GFP+ neurons were performed according to Osorio &amp; Delmas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), with modifications for recording from the distal colon. The protocol is described in brief below.</p>
<sec id="s6g1">
<title>Tissue dissection and preparation</title>
<p>Mice aged 8-10 weeks were culled by CO<sub>2</sub> and cervical dislocation. The colon was removed and flushed with ice cold oxygenated Krebs solution [118 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM CaCl2 and 11 mM glucose, supplemented with scopolamine (2 M) and nicardipine (6 Î¼M)], then placed in a Sylgard-lined Petri dish with ice cold oxygenated Krebs solution for further dissection. Krebs solution was changed out for fresh oxygenated solution every 5 minutes. Under a dissection microscope, the distal colon was pinned and the mucosa peeled away using fine forceps, leaving a few millimeters of mucosa along the edges of the tissue for pinning stability. The muscularis was then flipped over and re-pinned, serosa side up, and the longitudinal muscle carefully peeled away. The tissue was transferred to a custom 3D-printed recording chamber lined with a thin layer of clear Sylgard, and re-pinned under light tension, with the myenteric plexus facing up. The tissue was kept at 32Â°C and was continuously perfused with oxygenated Krebs solution. Hb9:GFP+ neurons were visually identified within a ganglion under epifluorescence illumination with a 455nM LED (Thorlabs, M455L2) and a 470 (excitation)/525 (emission) nm wavelength filter set. A local perfusion of protease XIV (0.2% in Krebs) (Sigma, P5417) was applied on top of the targeted cell to digest any muscle fiber residue. A 1-2Mâ¦ pipet with a trimmed arm hair glued to the tip was used to brush and clean the surface of the ganglion. Further cleaning with 1mg/mL collagenase (Worthington, CLS-4) 4mg/mL dispase (Sigma, D4693) in Krebs solution was also performed to expose the GFP neuron for patching.</p>

<sec id="s6g2">
<title>Patching and recording</title>
<p>Patch pipettes (4â6 MÎ©) pulled from borosilicate glass were filled with internal solution containing in mM: 144 K-gluconate, 3 MgCl2, 0.5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2 (285/295 mOsm) and 2% biocytin (Millipore Sigma, B4261-100MG). Patch clamp recordings were collected with a Multiclamp 700A (Molecular Devices) amplifier, a Digidata 1440 digitizer and pClamp10.7 (Molecular Devices). Recordings were sampled and filtered at 10kHz. Passive properties analysis was performed using pClamp10.7. Analysis of action potentials was performed using a custom MATLAB (MathWorks) software. All recordings were performed at 32Â°C. Membrane potentials were not corrected for liquid junction potential. Immediately after whole cell configuration, the cell was maintained at â70mV and a short voltage clamp membrane test protocol consisting of 20 times 600ms, 10mV depolarization steps was performed to assess cell health and recording conditions. Recordings were performed in Hb9:GFP+ colonic neurons with an access resistance less than 30Mâ¦ (16.69 Â± 2.63 Mâ¦). Next, the current clamp mode was used to measure resting membrane potential (RMP), input resistance (Rin) and APs stimulated. Membrane potential was not adjusted from resting potential, and cells were depolarized by 1 second current pulses in 10pA increments until APs were triggered (rheobase). Finally, if the seal was still stable, a voltage clamp steady-state inactivation of T-current protocol was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). In brief, a sequence of depolarization from â90 to â45mV for 500ms quickly followed by a depolarization to â40mV for 200ms. Tissues were then fixed and immunostained according to <italic>Wholemount preparations</italic> and <underline>Immunohistochemistry</underline> sections above.</p>

<title>Mechanical recordings &amp; optical stimulation</title>
<p>Optogenetic stimulation experiments were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). A 2.5 mm stainless steel rod was inserted through the lumen of the colon and mounted in an organ bath (120 * 40 * 12 mm; L*W*H) located on a heated base. Krebs solution (35.5-36Â°C) superfused the bath (â¼5 mL/min). Smooth muscle force was recorded via 4 evenly spaced hooks in the colonic muscularis externa, each linked to an isometric force transducer (Grass FT03C) by suture thread. Initial base resting tension was set between 0.5 - 1.0 g. Preamplified signals (Biomedical Engineering, Flinders University) were digitized by a PowerLab 16/35 (ADInstruments, Bella Vista, NSW, Australia) and recorded using LabChart 7 software (ADInstruments) on iMac computer. Post hoc analysis of the mechanical recordings was done using LabChart 8 software on PC.</p>
<p>For optical stimulation during mechanical recordings <italic>in vitro</italic>, two LEDs (emitting 470 nmÎ» photons; C470DA2432, Cree Inc., NC, USA) were used, driven by a variable power supply. The area of light emission from each LED was 240 Î¼m x 320 Î¼m (0.0768 mm<sup>2</sup>). To characterise LED function, light power density across a range of currents was measured 5 mm from the LED using a standard photodiode power sensor (S120C; Thorlabs, NJ, USA) and a power meter (Thorlabs, PM100USB). The stimulator panel within LabChart software was used to set parameters and manually trigger LED pulse trains via the 10V analogue output of the PowerLab and an ILD1 opto-isolator.</p>

<title>Intraluminal pellet CMC recordings</title>
<p>To record proximal and distal colon CMCs separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), full length colon was bisected halfway between the caeco-colonic junction and terminal rectum, creating equal length proximal and distal colon preparations. Each preparation was suspended vertically on a stainless-steel holder inside a glass, water jacketed organ bath containing Krebs solution (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6J, K</xref>). A 2.7 mm diameter synthetic pellet (polymethyl methacrylate, âPerspexâ) was placed inside the gut lumen and linked by stainless steel rod to a force transducer (MLT0420, ADInstruments), allowing measurement of both anterograde and retrograde propulsive forces on the pellet. Signals were amplified by bridge amplifier (FE224, ADInstruments), digitized at 1kHz (PLCF1, ADInstruments) and recorded using LabChart 8 software.</p>
<p>ZD7288 (73777, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in water as stock solution at 10 mM. Caesium Chloride (C4036, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in water as stock solution at 200 mM. Tetrodotoxin citrate (T-550, Alomone Labs) was dissolved in water as stock solution at 3 mM. Control, ZD7288, CsCl and washout periods were at least 30 mins; TTX was applied for at least 10 minutes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6j">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical tests and graphical representation of data were performed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad). Statistical comparisons were performed using paired t tests (one-tailed, CMC intervals; two-tailed, peak amplitude, AUC, duration) and Welchâs t test (marker colocalizations).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript, Gomez-Frittelli and colleagues characterize the expression of cadherin6 (and -8) in colonic IPANs of mice. Moreover, they found that these cdh6-expressing IPANs are capable of initiating colonic motor complexes in the distal colon, but not proximal and midcolon. They support their claim by morphological, electrophysiological and optogenetic, and pharmacological experiments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is very impressive and involves several genetic models and state-of-the-art physiological setups including respective controls. It is a very well-written manuscript that truly contributes to our understanding of GI-motility and its anatomical and physiological basis. The authors were able to convincingly answer their research questions with a wide range of methods without overselling their results.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors put quite some emphasis on stating that cdh6 is a synaptic protein (in the title and throughout the text), which interacts in a homophilic fashion. They deduct that cdh6 might be involved in IPAN-IPAN synapses (line 247ff.). However, Cdh6 does not only interact in synapses and is expressed by non-neuronal cells as well (see e.g., expression in the proximal tubuli of the kidney). Moreover, cdh6 does not only build homodimers, but also heterodimers with Chd9 as well as Cdh7, -10, and -14 (see e.g., Shimoyama et al. 2000, DOI: 10.1042/0264-6021:3490159). It would therefore be interesting to assess the expression pattern of cdh6-proteins using immunostainings in combination with synaptic markers to substantiate the authors' claim or at least add the possibility of cell-cell-interactions other than synapses to the discussion. Additionally, an immunostaining of cdh6 would confirm if the expression of tdTomato in smooth muscle cells of the cdh6-creERT model is valid or a leaky expression (false positive).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Intrinsic primary afferent neurons are an interesting population of enteric neurons that transduce stimuli from the mucosa, initiate reflexive neurocircuitry involved in motor and secretory functions, and modulate gut immune responses. The morphology, neurochemical coding, and electrophysiological properties of these cells have been relatively well described in a long literature dating back to the late 1800's but questions remain regarding their roles in enteric neurocircuitry, potential subsets with unique functions, and contributions to disease. Here, the authors provide RNAscope, immunolabeling, electrophysiological, and organ function data characterizing IPANs in mice and suggest that Cdh6 is an additional marker of these cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper would likely be of interest to the enteric neuroscience community and increases information regarding the properties of IPANs in mice. These data are useful and suggest that prior data from studies of IPANs in other species are likely translatable to mice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major weaknesses:</p>
<p>
(1) The novelty of this study is relatively limited. The main point of novelty suggests an additional marker of IPANs (Cdh6) that would add to the known list of markers for these cells. How useful this would be is unclear. Other main findings basically confirm that IPANs in mice display the same classical characteristics that have been known for many years from studies in guinea pigs, rats, mice and humans.</p>
<p>(2) Critical controls are needed to support the optogenetic experiments. Control experiments are needed to show that ChR2 expression 1) does not change the baseline properties of the neurons, 2) that stimulation with the chosen intensity of light elicits physiologically relevant responses in those neurons, and 3) that stimulation via ChR2 elicits comparable responses in IPANs in the different gut regions focused on here. These essential controls remain absent in the study and limit confidence in the data derived from this model.</p>
<p>(3) The motor effects observed in optogenetic experiments are difficult to understand in the absence of good controls for optogenetic control of the proposed neuron population (discussed above). It remains unclear how stimulating IPANs in the distal colon would generate retrograde CMCs while stimulating IPANs in the proximal colon did nothing. Key controls confirming that the optogentic stimulus was adequate, specific, and relevant are needed. In addition, better characterization of the Cdh6+ population of cells in both regions would be needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these effects.</p>
<p>(4) From the data shown, it is clear that expression driven by the Cdh6CreERT2 driver is not confined to IPANs. There is obviously expression of GFP and ChR2 in smooth muscle cells. This is a major limitation for the physiological experiments that attempt to use this model to specifically stimulate IPANs and assess changes in gut motor function. Better characterization of this model is needed and control experiments are necessary to assess whether functional ChR2 is expressed in cells beyond the proposed subtype of enteric IPANs.</p>
<p>(5) Some of the main conclusions of this study are overstated and claims of priority are made that are not true. For example, the authors state on lines 27-28 of the abstract that their findings provide the &quot;first demonstration of selective activation of a single neurochemical and functional class of enteric neurons&quot;. This is certainly not true since Gould et al (AJP-GIL 2019) expressed ChR2 in nitrergic enteric neurons and showed that activating those cells disrupted CMC activity. In fact, prior work by the authors themselves (Hibberd et al Gastro 2018) showed that activating calretinin neurons with ChR2 evoked motor responses. Work by other groups has used chemogenetics and optogenetics to show effects of activating multiple other classes of neurons in the gut.</p>
<p>(6) The electrophysiological characterization of mouse IPANs is useful but is limited to a small subset of Cdh6+ neurons in the distal colon myenteric plexus. Therefore, it remains unclear how well the properties reported here might reflect those of other Cdh6+ IPANs in the same or different regions. Similarly, blocking IH with ZD7288 affects all IPANs and does not add specific information regarding the role of the proposed Cdh6+ subtype.</p>
<p>(7) The submucosal plexus (SMP) also contains enteric IPANs and these were not included in the analysis of Cdh6 expression. Whether or not the proposed IPAN marker Cdh6 would be useful for identifying or targeting those cells remains unclear.</p>
<p>[Editor's note: The Reviewing Editor considers that further controls requested from the reviewers have largely been provided already in prior publications by other groups, as they concern specifically tools published years ago but in a different tissue context. Hence the methodology used to deliver the results reported here fall within the standard practices in the field. The comprehensive, multi-technique approach to the results is compelling in and of itself, and ought to suffice, rendering this work reproducible and therefore a basis for further research.]</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that Cdh6 could be mediating some other cell-cell interaction besides synapses between IPANs, and we noted it in the discussion. Cdh6 primarily forms homodimers but, as the reviewer points out, has been known to also form heterodimers with some other cadherins. We performed RNAscope in the colonic myenteric plexus with Cdh7 and found no expression (data not shown). Cdh10 is suggested to have very low expression (Drokhlyansky et al., 2020), possibly in putative secretomotor vasodilator neurons, and Cdh14 has not been assayed in any RNAseq screens. We attempted to visualize Cdh6 protein via antibody staining (Duan et al., 2018) but our efforts did not result in sufficient signal or resolution to identify synapses in the ENS, which remain broadly challenging to assay. Similarly, immunostaining with Cdh6 antibody was unable to confirm Cdh6 protein in tdT-expressing muscle cells, or by RNAscope. We have addressed these caveats in the discussion section.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs support of our study and insightful critiques for its improvement.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The advance presented here beyond what is already known is minimal. Some of the core conclusions are overstated and there are multiple other major issues that limit enthusiasm. Key control experiments are lacking and data do not specifically address the properties of the proposed Cdh6+ population.</p>
<p>Major weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The novelty of this study is relatively low. The main point of novelty suggests an additional marker of IPANs (Cdh6) that would add to the known list of markers for these cells. How useful this would be is unclear. Other main findings basically confirm that IPANs in mice display the same classical characteristics that have been known for many years from studies in guinea pigs, rats, mice and humans.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the already existing markers for IPANs in the ENS and the existing literature characterizing these neurons. The primary intent of this study was to use these well-established characteristics of IPANs in both mice and other species to characterize Cdh6-expressing neurons in the mouse myenteric plexus and confirm their classification as IPANs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Some of the main conclusions of this study are overstated and claims of priority are made that are not true. For example, the authors state in lines 27-28 of the abstract that their findings provide the &quot;first demonstration of selective activation of a single neurochemical and functional class of enteric neurons&quot;.

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point and apologize if our wording was not clear. Whilst single neurochemical classes of enteric neurons have been manipulated to alter gut functions, all such instances to date do not represent manipulation of a single functional class of enteric neurons. In the given examples, multiple functional classes are activated utilizing the same neurotransmitter, as NOS and calretinin are each expressed to varying degrees across putative motor neurons, interneurons and IPANs. In contrast, Chd6 is restricted to IPANs and therefore this study is the first optogenetic investigation of enteric neurons from a single putative functional class. Our abstract and discussion emphasizes this point and differentiates this study from those previous.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Critical controls are needed to support the optogenetic experiments. Control experiments are needed to show that ChR2 expression a) does not change the baseline properties of the neurons, b) that stimulation with the chosen intensity of light elicits physiologically relevant responses in those neurons, and c) that stimulation via ChR2 elicits comparable responses in IPANs in the different gut regions focused on here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We completely agree controls are essential. However, our paper is not the first to express ChR2 in enteric neurons. Authors of our paper have shown in Hibberd <italic>et al.</italic> 2018 that expression of ChR2 in a heterogeneous population of myenteric neurons did not change network properties of the myenteric plexus. This was demonstrated in the lack of change in control CMC characteristics in mice expressing ChR2 under basal conditions (without blue light exposure). Regarding question (b), that it should be shown that stimulation with the chosen intensity of light elicits physiologically relevant responses in those neurons. We show the restricted expression of ChR2 in IPANs and that motor responses (to blue light) are blocked by selective nerve conduction blockade.</p>
<p>Regarding question (c), that our study should demonstrate that stimulation via ChR2 elicits comparable responses in IPANs in the different gut regions. We would not expect each region of the gut to behave comparably. This is because the different gut regions (i.e. proximal, mid, distal) are very different anatomically, as is anatomy of the myenteric plexus and myenteric ganglia between each region, including the density of IPANs within each ganglia, in addition to the presence of different patterns of electrical and mechanical activity [Spencer <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020]. Hence, it is difficult to expect that between regions stimulation of ChR2 should induce similar physiological responses. The motor output we record in our study (CMCs) is a unified motor program that involves the temporal coordination of hundreds of thousands of enteric neurons and a complex neural circuit that we have previously characterized [Spencer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018]. But, never has any study until now been able to selectively stimulate a single functional class of enteric neurons (with light) to avoid indiscriminate activation of other classes of neurons.</p>

<p>(4) The electrophysiological characterization of mouse IPANs is useful but this is a basic characterization of any IPAN and really says nothing specifically about Cdh6+ neurons. The electrophysiological characterization was also only done in a small fraction of colonic IPANs, and it is not clear if these represent cell properties in the distal colon or proximal colon, and whether these properties might be extrapolated to IPANs in the different regions. Similarly, blocking IH with ZD7288 affects all IPANs and does not add specific information regarding the role of the proposed Cdh6+ subtype.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our electrophysiological characterization was guided to be within a subset of Cdh6+ neurons by Hb9:GFP expression. As in the prior comment (1) above, we used these experiments to confirm classification of Cdh6+ (Hb9:GFP+) neurons in the distal colon as IPANs. We have clarified in the results and methods that these experiments were performed in the distal colon and agree that we cannot extrapolate that these properties are also representative of IPANs in the proximal colon. We apologize that this was confusing. Finally, we agree with the reviewer that ZD7288 affects all IPANs in the ENS and have clarified this in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Why SMP IPANs were not included in the analysis of Cdh6 expression is a little puzzling. IPANs are present in the SMP of the small intestine and colon, and it would be useful to know if this proposed marker is also present in these cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer. In addition to characterizing Cdh6 in the myenteric plexus, it would be interesting to query if sensory neurons located within the SMP also express Cdh6. Our preliminary data (n=2) show ~6-12% tdT/Hu neurons in Cdh6-tdT ileum and colon (data not shown). We have added a sentence to the discussion.</p>

<p>(6) The emphasis on IH being a rhythmicity indicator seems a bit premature. There is no evidence to suggest that IH and IT are rhythm-generating currents in the ENS.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding the statement there is no evidence to suggest that IH and IT are rhythm-generating currents in the ENS. We agree with the reviewer that evidence of rhythm generation by IH and IT in the ENS has not been explicitly confirmed. We are confident the reviewer agrees that an absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, although the presence of IH has been well described in enteric neurons. We have modified the text in the results to indicate more clearly that IH and IT are known to participate in rhythm generation in thalamocortical circuits, though their roles in the ENS remain unknown. Our discussion of the potential role of IH or IT in rhythm generation or oscillatory firing of the ENS is constrained to speculation in the discussion section of the text.</p>

<p>(7) As the authors point out in the introduction and discuss later on, Type II Cadherins such as Cdh6 bind homophillically to the same cadherin at both pre- and post-synapse. The apparent enrichment of Cdh6 in IPANs would suggest extensive expression in synaptic terminals that would also suggest extensive IPAN-IPAN connections unless other subtypes of neurons express this protein. Such synaptic connections are not typical of IPANs and raise the question of whether or not IPANs actually express the functional protein and if so, what might be its role. Not having this information limits the usefulness of this as a proposed marker.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the proposed IPAN-IPAN connection is novel although it has been proposed before (Kunze et al., 1993). As detailed in our response to Reviewer #1, we attempted to confirm Cdh6 protein expression, but were unsuccessful, due to insufficient signal and resolution. We therefore discuss potential IPAN interconnectivity in the discussion, in the context of contrasting literature.</p>

<p>(8) Experiments shown in Figures 6J and K use a tethered pellet to drive motor responses. By definition, these are not CMCs as stated by the authors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer makes a valid criticism as to the terminology, since tethered pellet experiments do not record propagation. We believe the periodic bouts of propulsive force on the pellet is triggered by the same activity underlying the CMC. In our experience, these activities have similar periodicity, force and identical pharmacological properties. Consistent with this, we also tested full colons (n = 2) set up for typical CMC recordings by multiple force transducers, finding that CMCs were abolished by ZD7288, similar to fixed pellet recordings (data not shown).</p>

<p>(9) The data from the optogenetic experiments are difficult to understand. How would stimulating IPANs in the distal colon generate retrograde CMCs and stimulating IPANs in the proximal colon do nothing? Additional characterization of the Cdh6+ population of cells is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the different optogenetic responses in the proximal and distal colon are challenging to interpret, but perhaps not surprising in the wider context. It is not only possible that the different optogenetic responses in this study reflect regional differences in the Chd6+ neuronal populations, but also differences in neural circuits within these gut regions. A study some time ago by the authors showed that electrical stimulation of the proximal mouse colon was unable to evoke a retrograde (aborally) propagating CMC (Spencer, Bywater, 2002), but stimulation of the distal colon was readily able to. We concluded that at the oral lesion site there is a preferential bias of descending inhibitory nerve projections, since the ascending excitatory pathways have been cut off. In contrast, stimulation of the distal colon was readily able to activate an ascending excitatory neural pathway, and hence induce the complex CMC circuits required to generate an orally propagating CMC. Indeed, other recent studies have added to a growing body of evidence for significant differences in the behaviors and neural circuits of the two regions (Li et al., 2019, Costa et al., 2021a, Costa et al., 2021b, Nestor-Kalinoski et al., 2022). We have expanded this discussion.</p>

<p>(1) The authors repeatedly refer to IPANs as &quot;sensory&quot; neurons (e.g. in title, abstract, and introduction) but there is some debate regarding whether these cells are truly &quot;sensory&quot; because the information they convey never reaches sensory perception. This is why they have classically been referred to as intrinsic primary afferent (IPAN) neurons. It would be more appropriate to stick with this terminology unless the authors have compelling data showing that information detected by IPANs reaches the sensory cortex.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comment, but respectfully disagree. The term âsensory neuronâ is well established in the ENS. The first definitive proof that âsensory neuronsâ exist in the ENS was published in Kunze et al., 1995. We note that this paper did not use the word âIPANâ but used the term âsensory neuronâ. Furthermore, mechanosensory neurons were published in Spencer and Smith (2004).</p>
<p>Regarding the reviewerâs comment that the authors would need compelling data showing that information detected by IPANs reaches the sensory cortex before the term âsensory neuronâ should be valid, it is important to note that many sensory neurons do not provide direct information to the cortex.</p>
