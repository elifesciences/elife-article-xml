<title>Abstract</title><p>Neuronal oscillations at about 10 Hz, called alpha oscillations, are often thought to arise from synchronous activity across occipital cortex, reflecting general cognitive states such as arousal and alertness. However, there is also evidence that modulation of alpha oscillations in visual cortex can be spatially specific. Here, we used intracranial electrodes in human patients to measure alpha oscillations in response to visual stimuli whose location varied systematically across the visual field. We separated the alpha oscillatory power from broadband power changes. The variation in alpha oscillatory power with stimulus position was then fit by a population receptive field (pRF) model. We find that the alpha pRFs have similar center locations to pRFs estimated from broadband power (70–180 Hz), but are several times larger. The results demonstrate that alpha suppression in human visual cortex can be precisely tuned. Finally, we show how the pattern of alpha responses can explain several features of exogenous visual attention.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>The alpha oscillation is the largest electrical signal generated by the human brain. An important question in systems neuroscience is the degree to which this oscillation reflects system-wide states and behaviors such as arousal, alertness, and attention, versus much more specific functions in the routing and processing of information. We examined alpha oscillations at high spatial precision in human patients with intracranial electrodes implanted over visual cortex. We discovered a surprisingly high spatial specificity of visually driven alpha oscillations, which we quantified with receptive field models. We further use our discoveries about properties of the alpha response to show a link between these oscillations and the spread of visual attention.</p>

<p>Hans Berger first measured electrical oscillations at 10 Hz from the human brain using EEG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Shortly thereafter, Adrian and Matthews confirmed that when a participant closes their eyes or views a uniform field, the oscillatory power increases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. These studies suggested that the rhythm reflects widespread neural synchrony in visual cortex, and that the presence or absence of the rhythm is likely related to overall state of the person, such as arousal or cognitive engagement. Consistent with the interpretation, subsequent studies have confirmed that global modulation of alpha oscillations can be caused by changes in arousal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, alertness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> or attention <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, several subsequent studies have found that visuospatial attention can modulate the alpha rhythm in a more localized manner. Worden et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> found a reduction of the alpha oscillation in the contralateral hemisphere when attending the left or right visual fields, and an increase in the oscillation in the ipsilateral hemisphere, measured by EEG. This finding links alpha oscillations to brain areas relevant to attended visual locations, rather than to the overall state of the individual. This contralateral specificity has been replicated many times in EEG (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>). Moreover, the suppression of the alpha oscillation has been reported to be more specific than just a contralateral bias: when measuring alpha oscillations as a function of attended location, the EEG pattern differed for stimuli attended 45 deg apart within the visual same hemifield <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Recent studies, using either MEG or EEG in conjunction with channel encoding models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, showed that modulation of the alpha rhythm was specific to cortical locations representing the polar angle of cued locations, testing between 6 and 16 polar angles.</p>
<p>These seemingly disparate results –some showing large-scale synchrony in the alpha rhythm and some showing spatial specificity– might be reconciled if the rhythm is generally caused by processes spanning much of the occipital cortex, but can be disrupted in small cortical regions by changes in inputs to those regions. Here, we tested the spatial specificity of the suppression of the alpha rhythm using electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings in 9 participants using an experimental and computational approach developed for characterizing receptive fields of neural populations in fMRI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. This approach differs from prior work on spatial specificity because here the modulation in the alpha response is stimulus driven rather than top-down, and because the spatial specificity of the measurement (ECoG) is high. The participants viewed spatially restricted stimuli, bars containing a contrast pattern on an otherwise uniform background. We then fit a population receptive field model (pRF) to the measured alpha oscillation in each electrode in visual cortex and demonstrate that modulation of the alpha rhythm is precisely linked to stimulus location.</p>
<p>For comparison, we also fit a pRF model to the broadband power measured from each electrode, as in previous work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. The broadband pRFs and alpha pRFs had similar locations (center positions) but differed in size. As expected, they also differed in sign, with the broadband signal elevated and the alpha signal suppressed by stimulus contrast in the receptive field. Together, the results suggest that the alpha oscillation in human visual cortex is spatially tuned. In the Discussion, we consider how the tuned alpha response may contribute to visual function, showing a surprisingly tight link between the spatial profiles of the stimulus- driven alpha oscillation on the one hand, and the behavioral effects of spatial attention on the other hand.</p>
<p>Finally, we show how the former may give rise to the latter.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>T<sc>wo signatures of visual responses measured with electrocorticography</sc></title>
<p>Visual stimulation causes a variety of temporal response patterns measured in visual cortex. In addition to the evoked potential, which is a characteristic change in voltage time-locked to the stimulus onset, there are also spectral perturbations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The largest such perturbation is the alpha oscillation. Typically, when the eyes are closed or when the participant views a blank screen (no stimulus contrast) the field potential measured from visual cortex oscillates at about 8 to 13 Hz <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Opening the eyes or viewing a stimulus reduces this oscillation. In addition to these spectral perturbations, there is also a broadband response, an increase in power across a wide frequency range following stimulus onset <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Both the broadband increase and alpha suppression can be elicited by the same stimulus and measured from the same electrode. In the example shown in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>, stimulus onset caused a broadband increase in power spanning the full range plotted, from 1 Hz to 150 Hz, and it eliminated the peak in the alpha range. The two types of response cannot be separated by simply applying filters with different temporal frequency ranges because the signals overlap in the low frequency range (6 to 22 Hz in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref></bold>).</p>

<label>2.2</label><title>S<sc>eparating the alpha oscillation from broadband power</sc></title>
<p>Because stimulus onset tends to cause an increase in broadband power and a decrease in the alpha oscillation, it is possible for the two effects to cancel at some frequencies. In the example shown in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>, the power at the peak of the alpha oscillation (∼13 Hz, black dashed line) is nearly the same during stimulus and blank. It would be incorrect, however, to infer that the alpha oscillation was unaffected by the stimulus. Rather, the decrease in the alpha oscillation and the increase in broadband power were about equal in magnitude. Depending on the relative size of these two spectral responses, the power at the alpha frequency can increase, decrease, or not change. We illustrate these possibilities with three nearby electrodes from one patient (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>). For all three electrodes as shown in the left panels, there is a peak in the alpha range during blanks (black lines) but not during visual stimulation (brown lines). Due to the interaction with the broadband response, the power at the peak alpha frequency for stimulus relative to blank increased slightly for one electrode (Oc18), decreased slightly for a second electrode (Oc17), and decreased more substantially for a third electrode (Oc25). By adjusting the baseline to account for the broadband response as shown in the right panels, it is clear that the stimulus caused the alpha oscillation to decrease for all three electrodes. For these reasons, simply comparing the spectral power at the alpha frequency between two experimental conditions is not a good indicator of the strength of the alpha rhythm. To separate the alpha oscillation from the broadband change, we applied a baseline correction using a model-based approach.</p>

<label>2.3</label><title>A<sc>lpha responses are accurately predicted by a population receptive field model</sc></title>
<p>By estimating the alpha oscillatory power from the low-frequency decomposition and the broadband power from the high frequency summary, we obtain two time-courses per electrode, one for the alpha suppression and one for the broadband elevation (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>). Each point in these time courses indicates a summary measure of the response components for a 500 ms stimulus presentation. Hence the time series are at very different scales from the ms voltage time series used to derive the summary measures.</p>

<caption><title>Example time series and pRF fits.</title>
<p>Representative data from a V3 electrode (‘GB103’) from Patient 8. The left column shows the time series averaged across six 190-s mapping runs, during which bar stimuli swept the visual field 8 times (with 4 blank periods indicated by the gray bars). Each data point (black circle) is a summary value–either broadband or alpha–for one stimulus position (<xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Equations 1</xref>-<xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">3</xref>). Predicted responses from a pRF model are shown as solid lines. The insets on the right show how the broadband and alpha summary metrics were computed for an example stimulus location. Model predictions below baseline in broadband and above baseline in alpha were possible because of the Difference of Gaussians (DoG) pRF model (see <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref></bold>). The rightmost panel shows the location of the pRFs fitted to the broadband and alpha times series. The circles show the 1-sigma pRF bootstrapped 100 times across the 6 repeated runs. See <italic>makeFigure3.m</italic>.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="528137v5_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>After a small amount of pre-processing (averaging across repeated runs, temporal decimation, dividing out the mean response during the blanks), we separately fit pRF models to the broadband and the alpha time series (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>). The pRF model we fit assumes linear spatial summation, with a circularly symmetric Difference of Gaussians (but constrained so that the surrounding Gaussian is large compared to the field of view of the experiment). Similar results were obtained using a model with compressive spatial summation or a model in which the surround size was allowed to vary.</p>
<p>In the example time series, it is evident that both components of the response vary with the stimulus position: for certain stimulus locations, the broadband response increased about 5- to 10-fold over baseline and the alpha response decreased about 3- to 5-fold. The pRF models accurately predicted these time series, with two-fold cross-validated variance explained of 90.2% for broadband and 69.5% for alpha. For both types of pRF, the center locations are in the parafovea in the left lower visual field, but the alpha pRF is about twice the size of the broadband pRF (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>, right panel).</p>
<p>Next, we quantified the prediction accuracy of the pRF model fit across many electrodes, participants, and visual field maps. We first selected a large set of electrodes based only on location (see <italic>Electrode Localization</italic> in Methods 4.6). We then separated these electrodes into two groups based on whether or not we expected them to be visually responsive. Some of these electrodes are not expected to be visually responsive, for example if their receptive field is beyond the stimulus extent. We identified visually responsive electrodes as those whose broadband pRF model accurately predicted the broadband time course (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref></bold>, left). Because the broadband quantification is limited to high frequencies (70–180 Hz), this criterion provides an independent means to separate the electrodes into groups to assess the alpha pRF model accuracy, which only depends on signals below 30 Hz.</p>
<p>We find that for V1 to V3, the alpha pRF model explains about 37% of the cross-validated variance in the alpha time series of visually selective electrodes (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4</xref></bold>). The non-visually selective electrodes provide a null distribution for comparison, and for these electrodes, the pRF model explains close to 0% of the variance. In dorsolateral maps beyond V1–V3, the alpha pRF model explained about 24% of the variance in visually responsive electrodes, and no variance in the non-responsive group. These results show that across visual cortex, the pRF models explain a substantial part of the variance in the alpha time series.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<label>2.4</label><title>T<sc>he alpha prfs are larger than broadband prfs, but have similar locations</sc></title>
<p>We next compared the alpha and broadband pRF parameters. We limited these comparisons to electrodes for which both signal types were well fit by pRF models (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref></bold>) and whose pRF centers were within the maximal stimulus extent (8.3°) for both broadband and alpha. Fifty-three electrodes met these criteria, of which 35 are assigned to V1–V3 and 45 to dorsolateral maps. (Because the assignments are probabilistic, 27 electrodes are assigned to both visual areas.)</p>
<p>As with the sample electrode (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>), the center locations of the two pRF types tend to be close (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). However, the alpha pRFs tend to be much larger and slightly more peripheral. For most electrodes, the broadband pRFs are within the alpha pRFs. Truncating the pRF sizes at 1 standard deviation, the percentage of the broadband pRF inside the alpha pRF was 92.3% (V1–V3) and 98.0% (dorsolateral) pRFs. This overlap is not a trivial consequence of the alpha pRFs simply being large. If we shuffle the relationship between alpha and broadband pRFs across electrodes, these numbers decrease to 30.0% (V1–V3) and 25.7% (dorsolateral). We summarized the relationship between the broadband and alpha pRFs by normalizing the parameters into a common space (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>, d</bold>) and then averaging pRFs across electrodes for both alpha and broadband. This analysis again confirms that the broadband pRF is, on average, smaller and less peripheral than the alpha pRF, and is mostly inside the alpha pRF.</p>

<p>In addition, a direct comparison of the alpha and broadband pRFs for each separate pRF model parameter (polar angle, eccentricity, size) reveals several patterns (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref></bold>). First, the polar angles are highly similar between broadband and alpha both in V1–V3 and dorsolateral visual areas. Second, the eccentricities are correlated but not equal: the alpha pRFs tend to have larger eccentricities than the broadband pRFs, especially in dorsolateral visual areas. Third, the sizes of alpha pRFs also correlate with those of broadband pRFs, but are about 2–4 times larger. These results suggest that the same retinotopic maps underlie both the alpha suppression and the broadband elevation, but that the alpha suppression pools over a larger extent of visual space. In the Discussion, we speculate about why the eccentricity of the alpha pRF might be systematically larger than the broadband eccentricity, even if the two signals originate from the same retinotopic map.</p>

<p>Our results also indicate that pRF size is much larger for alpha than for broadband. Because the comparison between alpha and broadband pRF size has such a steep slope (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref></bold>, bottom row), one might wonder whether the size of the alpha pRFs vary in any meaningful way. Contrary to this possibility, we find that for both broadband pRFs and alpha pRFs, the pRF size systematically increases with eccentricity (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref></bold>), consistent with known properties of visual neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and with fMRI data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.

<p>We used a model-based approach to separate the alpha oscillatory power from the broadband response because the two responses overlap in temporal frequency. Had we not used this approach, and instead used a more traditional frequency band approach –simply measuring the power in the alpha band without accounting for broadband shifts– we would have obtained different values for the alpha responses and inaccurate pRF fits. The difference between the two methods is especially clear in V1–V3, where the broadband response extends into the low frequencies (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></bold>). To clarify the advantage of the model-based approach, we compared the two types of pRF fits for all visually responsive electrodes in V1–V3 (based on maximum probability of map assignment: <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></bold>). For these comparisons, we allowed the gain to be positive or negative. First, the cross-validated variance explained was about 3 times higher for the model-based method (32%±5% vs 10%±5%, mean±sem). Second, as expected, the model- based approach consistently results in negative gain (29 out of 31 electrodes), meaning that alpha oscillations are suppressed by stimuli in the receptive field. In contrast, the frequency band approach shows a mixture of positive and negative gains (14 negative, 17 positive), complicating the interpretation. Third, the model-based method, but not the frequency band method, shows that pRF size increases with eccentricity. These analyses confirm the importance of disentangling the alpha oscillation from the broadband response.</p>

<label>2.6</label><title>A<sc>lpha oscillations are coherent across a larger spatial extent than broadband signals</sc></title>
<p>The large pRFs for alpha suppression might result from a limit to the spatial resolution at which alpha oscillations can be controlled. If, for example, alpha oscillations are up- or down-regulated with a point spread function of ∼5 or 10 mm of cortex, then alpha pRFs would necessarily be large. We assessed the spatial resolution of the alpha oscillation by measuring coherence of the signal across space. Specifically, we measured coherence at the alpha frequency for electrode pairs in two high-density grids (Patients 8 and 9; See <bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7</xref></bold> for pRF parameters on the two high-density grids). These grids have 3 mm spacing between electrodes, about 10 times the density of standard grids (1 cm spacing). For comparison, we also measured the coherence between the same electrode pairs averaged across the frequencies we used for calculating broadband responses (70 Hz to 180 Hz).</p>
<p>We find two clear patterns as shown in <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></bold>. First, as expected, coherence declines with distance. The alpha coherence is about 0.6 between neighboring electrodes, declining to a baseline level of about 0.35 by about 1 cm. Second, the coherence was higher at the alpha frequency than in the broadband frequencies, especially between neighboring electrodes. The pattern is the same whether the coherence is computed only from trials in which the bar position overlapped pRF, or only from trials in which it did not overlap the pRF, or both (data not shown.) Overall, the larger coherence at the alpha frequency is consistent with coarser spatial control of this signal (in mm of cortex), and larger pRFs (in deg of visual angle). The highest coherence is at the peak alpha frequency (<bold><xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8</xref></bold>). This suggests that the elevated coherence is not simply an artifact of greater volume conduction at low frequencies.</p>

<p>Our main two findings are that visual cortex alpha suppression is specific to stimulus location, as measured by its pRF, and that alpha pRFs are more than twice the size of broadband pRFs. This supports that alpha suppression in and near the locations of the driven response increases cortical excitability. This has implications for visual encoding in cortex, perception, and attention, with several close parallels between the alpha pRF and exogenous (stimulus-driven) attention.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<label>3.1</label><title>W<sc>hat is the function of the large alpha p</sc>RFS?</title>
<p>The alpha oscillation was originally characterized as an “idling” or default cortical state, reflecting the absence of sensory input or task demand <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. However, more recent work supports the idea that alpha oscillations act as a gate, actively suppressing neural signals by reducing cortical excitability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> via “pulsed inhibition” (hyperpolarization followed by rebound). This pulsed inhibition explains why cortical excitability depends on both alpha oscillation <italic>magnitude</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and <italic>phase</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>: when the oscillations are large, there is one phase when cortex is most excitable and one phase when it is least excitable (phase dependence), and when the oscillations are small, cortex is on average more excitable (magnitude dependence). When coupled to the large pRFs, this predicts that the onset of a focal visual stimulus will cause an increase in cortical excitability, spreading beyond the region that responds directly, i.e., with broadband field potentials and spiking (<bold><xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 9</xref></bold>). A transient increase in excitability spreading beyond the stimulus is conceptually similar to stimulus-driven (“exogenous”) spatial attention, in which a visual cue leads to faster response times, increased discriminability, higher perceived contrast <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, and increased neural response, as measured by single unit spike rates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and BOLD fMRI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The relationship may be more than conceptual, however, as we find that the spatial profiles of exogenous attention, measured behaviorally <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, and of the alpha pRF are quite similar (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref></bold>), with three close parallels. For both measures, the spatial spread (1) increases with eccentricity, (2) is asymmetric, spreading further into the periphery than toward the fovea, and (3) shows center/surround organization, with the attentional effect changing from a benefit to a cost and the alpha response changing from suppression to enhancement. The timing also matches, since exogenous attention has a maximal effect at about 100 ms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, the duration of an alpha cycle.</p>

<p>While many studies have proposed that attention, whether stimulus driven (exogenous) or internal (endogenous), influences the alpha oscillation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, our proposal flips the causality. We propose that the stimulus causes a change in the alpha oscillation and this in turn causes increased neural responsivity and behavioral sensitivity, the hallmarks of covert spatial attention. The spatial spread of the alpha oscillation can be traced in part to the neural mechanisms generate it in the thalamus (see section <italic>3.2</italic>). Top-down attention may capitalize on some of the same mechanisms, as feedback to the LGN can modulate the alpha-initiating neural populations, then resulting in the same effects of cortical excitability in visual cortex that occur from bottom-up spatial processing. This is consistent with findings that endogenous attention is accompanied by local reductions in alpha oscillations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>This link to attention contrasts with the proposal that the alpha oscillation in visual cortex reflects surround suppression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. We think the alpha oscillation is not tightly linked to surround suppression. First, the alpha pRF is negative, and alpha tends to be inhibitory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, meaning that visual stimuli within the alpha pRF disinhibit cortex, the opposite of surround suppression. An excitatory surround (alpha suppression) and a suppressive surround can coexist if they differ in timing and feature tuning. Surround suppression is relatively fast, disappearing 60 ms after surround stimulus offset <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> whereas the ∼10 Hz alpha oscillation is likely to be modulated at a slower time scale. Furthermore, surround suppression is feature-specific <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, whereas the alpha oscillation, being coherent over several mm of cortex, is unlikely to be limited only to cells whose tuning match the stimulus. Nonetheless surround suppression may be linked to neural oscillations, albeit at a higher frequency range <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We focused on the spatial specificity of alpha oscillations on the cortical surface. A separate line of research has also examined the specificity of alpha oscillations in terms of cortical depth and inter-areal communication. One claim is that oscillations in the alpha and beta range play a role in feedback between visual areas, with evidence from nonhuman primate for specificity of alpha and beta oscillations in cortical depth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, no one has examined the spatial specificity of the alpha oscillation across the cortical surface and across cortical depth in the same study, and it remains an open question as to whether the same neural circuits are involved in both types of effects.</p>

<label>3.2</label><title>T<sc>he importance of separating oscillatory and non-oscillatory signals</sc></title>
<p>Separating the alpha power into oscillatory and broadband components was motivated by the different biological origins of the two signals. Recent work has identified a population of high threshold thalamocortical neurons that generates bursts in the alpha or theta frequency range (depending on membrane potential) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. These bursts are synchronized by gap junctions. These neurons themselves appear to be the pacemakers, generating the alpha rhythm in the LGN and transmitting it to V1. This explains the rhythmic nature of the signal (bursting), the coherence across space (synchrony by gap junctions), and the occipital locus of alpha (thalamocortical generators). The fact that this cell population is located in the LGN does not imply that the alpha oscillation is only based on feedforward signals. Feedback signals from V1 to LGN via corticothalamic cells can modulate the frequency and amplitude of the alpha generating thalamocortical cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. There may also be intracortical circuits that modulate the alpha oscillation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The broadband response differs in several ways. First and most obvious, the signal is not limited to a narrow frequency range <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, and hence is not generally considered an oscillation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Therefore, functions which are hypothesized to depend specifically on oscillations should likely not be imputed to this signal, such as a behavioral bias during certain phases of the oscillation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> or long range synchronization of signals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Second, broadband signal are found throughout the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, likely arising from non-oscillatory neural generators <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, whereas the alpha rhythm is largest in the occipital lobe. Finally, the broadband signal measured at the electrode has lower amplitude because the generators are not synchronized across space.</p>
<p>The motivation to separate the signals was confirmed by the results. Compared to the frequency band method (no decomposition), the decomposition method resulted in higher variance explained, more consistent direction (negative pRFs rather than a mixture of positive and negative), and a tighter relationship between pRF eccentricity and size. The frequency band method has poorer results because it conflates two signals with different properties.</p>
<p>The difference between the methods likely explains some discrepancies across studies. Klink et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> fit pRF models to electrode data from macaque primary visual cortex in many frequency bands, including alpha, without removing the broadband signal. They found no systematic relationship between pRF size and eccentricity and found that the gain was positive for some electrodes and negative for others. The interpretation was that some locations in the visual field show suppression and others excitation. Our results suggest that it is more likely that most or all locations show both responses, alpha suppression and broadband increase, with either of the two signals sometimes being lager. Second, Harvey et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> examined spatial selectivity of human ECoG responses in the alpha band. They fit pRF models to the broadband response and then measured alpha power for stimulus positions relative to the broadband pRFs. They reported that alpha power increased in V1 electrodes when stimuli were outside the pRF, and that there was no change in alpha power when the stimulus overlapped the broadband pRF. The combination of these two results led to an interpretation that the alpha response is specifically related to surround suppression. Our results confirm their first observation - that alpha power increases when the stimulus is outside the pRF (as reflected in our Difference of Gaussians model); however, in contrast to their report, we find strong alpha suppression when the stimulus is in the pRF center. The discrepancy is reconciled by the approach. We, too, find that total alpha power is approximately unchanged by the stimulus in the pRF center, but the model- based approach shows that this is due to cancellation from an increased broadband response and a reduced alpha oscillation, rather than to the alpha oscillation not changing.</p>
<p>A similar decomposition approach was used in prior ECoG studies to separate broadband power from steady state visual evoked potentials <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and from narrowband gamma oscillations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. A generalization of this approach has also been implemented in a toolbox for separating broadband and narrowband signals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. These approaches are premised on the idea that different signals arise from different neurobiological causes and may be modulated independently by stimulus or task. This contrasts with the tradition of separating the field potential into frequency bands, where band-limited power is often computed without identifying a spectral peak and without removing non-oscillatory contributions.</p>
<p>One potential concern about our approach might be circularity: is it possible that we found the alpha and broadband signals to have opposite signs and similar pRF locations because there is in fact only one independent neural response, which we projected onto two measures? We think this is not the case. First, the broadband and the alpha power changes fitted by the pRF model were computed in different frequency ranges so that they were mathematically independent: the broadband was computed in high frequency range (70–180 Hz) and the alpha was decomposed from the low-frequency broadband response in 3–26 Hz (or 3– 32 Hz). Second, if the two responses arose from one independent signal, then both the center locations and the sizes of alpha and broadband pRFs would be the same, but the alpha pRFs were much larger than the broadband pRFs.</p>

<label>3.3</label><title>H<sc>ow broad is broadband?</sc></title>
<p>Since Crone et al.’s <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> observations of task related power increases at high frequency (70-100 Hz, above the typical gamma band), there has been a great deal of interest in these high frequency signals. Unlike the lower frequency gamma oscillations studied previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, the signals above 70 Hz had no clear peak. Crone et al. speculated that this was due to the ECoG signal pooling across multiple oscillatory circuits with different peak frequencies. Signal changes above 70 Hz have been referred as “high gamma” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, implicitly conveying that the signals are similar to gamma oscillations, but just at a higher frequency.</p>
<p>In contrast, Miller et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> proposed that these signals, although appearing to be concentrated in high frequencies, do not in fact arise from neural oscillations at all. They interpreted these signals as reflecting broadband neural activity with no specific time scale, spanning the whole spectrum but obscured at lower frequencies by changes in narrowband phenomena <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Such task-related broadband power increases have been found in human intracranial electrodes over V1 to V3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and in human microelectrode recordings of local field potentials <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Our results confirm their findings as the broadband increase is observed from as low as 3 Hz in V1–V3. The broadband responses in low-frequency (3–26 Hz) and high-frequency band (70–180 Hz) showed similar response patterns to the pRF stimuli, as reflected in similar pRF model parameters, suggesting they have a common cause.</p>
<p>There may, however, be variability across cortical locations (and across people) in the neural circuit properties that generate broadband responses. We find a difference in the pattern between V1–V3 and the dorsolateral maps. In V1–V3, the stimulus-related broadband elevation is clear all the way down to 3 Hz or lower, whereas in dorsolateral cortex it is clear only down to about 25 Hz. The difference could reflect fundamental differences in the type of field potentials that can be generated from the two regions, or could depend on how well matched the stimuli are to the tuning of the brain areas: the simple contrast patterns used for pRF mapping more effectively drive the early visual field maps than higher level areas (e.g., producing twice the percent signal change in high broadband signals). The human microelectrode recordings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> indicate that broadband power extending as low as 2 Hz can be measured across many brain regions, including frontal, parietal, and occipital cortices as well as hippocampus and amygdala. A further consideration is that broadband power changes might entail changes in the exponent of the spectral power function in addition to a change in the scaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. In either case, however, it is likely that the power changes in high frequency regions reported here and elsewhere (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>) reflect processes which are not oscillatory and hence not limited to a narrow range of frequencies. And because the model-based method of quantifying alpha oscillations shows a clear advantage for some regions (V1–V3) and no disadvantage for others, it is a more interpretable and general method than simply measuring the power at a particular frequency.</p>

<sec id="s3d">
<label>3.4</label><title>C<sc>onclusion</sc></title>
<p>With high spatial precision measurements, we have discovered that spectral power changes in the alpha range reflect both suppression of alpha oscillations and elevation of broadband power. Separating the two responses was essential for accurately fitting pRF models to the alpha oscillation. The large, negative alpha pRF indicates that visual stimulation suppresses alpha oscillations and likely increases cortical excitability over a large cortical extent (larger than the region with broadband and spiking increases). Together, these results predict many of the effects observed in spatial cueing experiments, thus providing further links between the alpha oscillation and spatial attention. More generally, alpha oscillation is likely to play a role in how cortex encodes sensory information.</p>

<p>Stimuli were shown on a 15 in. MacBook Pro laptop. The laptop was placed 50 cm from the participant’s eyes at chest level. Screen resolution was 1280 × 800 pixels (33 × 21 cm). Prior to the start of the experiment, the screen luminance was linearized using a lookup table based on spectrophotometer measurements (Cambridge Research Systems). ECoG data were recorded using four kinds of electrodes: Standard size grids, linear strips, depth electrodes, and high-density grids, with the following details.

Recordings were made using one of two amplifier types: NicoletOne amplifier (Natus Neurologics, Middleton, WI), bandpass filtered from 0.16-250 Hz and digitized at 512 Hz, and Neuroworks Quantum Amplifier (Natus Biomedical, Appleton, WI) recorded at 2048 Hz, bandpass filtered at 0.01–682.67 Hz and then downsampled to 512 Hz. Stimulus onsets were recorded along with the ECoG data using an audio cable connecting the laptop and the ECoG amplifier. Behavioral responses were recorded using a Macintosh wired external numeric keypad that was placed in a comfortable position for the participant (usually their lap) and connected to the laptop through a USB port. Participants self-initiated the start of the next experiment by pushing a designated response button on the number pad.</p>

<p>Visual stimuli were generated in MATLAB 2018b. Stimuli were shown at 8.3 degrees of visual angle (16.6 degrees stimulus diameter) using Psychtoolbox-3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://psychtoolbox.org/">http://psychtoolbox.org/</ext-link>) and were presented at a frame rate of 60 Hz. Custom code was developed in order to equalize visual stimulation across the two recording sites as much as possible; for example, all stimuli were constructed at high resolution (2000 x 2000 pixels) and subsequently downsampled in a site-specific manner such that the stimulus was displayed at the same visual angle at both recording sites (see <italic>stimMakePRFExperiment.m</italic> and <italic>bairExperimentSpecs.m</italic> in BAIRR01/BAIR_stimuli). Stimuli consisted of grayscale bandpass noise patterns that were created following procedures outlined in Kay et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Briefly, the pattern stimuli were created by low-pass filtering white noise, thresholding the result, performing edge detection, inverting the image polarity such that the edges are black, and applying a band-pass filter centered at 3 cycles per degree (see <italic>createPatternStimulus.m</italic>).</p>
<p>All stimuli were presented within bar apertures; the remainder of the display was filled with neutral gray. This stimulus has been shown to effectively elicit responses in most retinotopic areas <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. The width of the bar aperture was 2 degrees of visual angle, which was 12.5% of the full stimulus extent. The bar aperture swept across the visual field in eight directions consisting of twenty-eight discrete steps per sweep, 850 ms step duration. During each step, the bar stimulus was displayed for 500 ms followed by a 350 ms blank period showing a gray mean luminance image. The eight sweeps included 2 horizontal (left to right or right to left), 2 vertical (up to down or down to up) and 4 diagonal sweeps (starting from one of the 4 directions). For the diagonal sweeps, the bar was replaced with a blank for the last 16 of the 28 steps, so that the stimuli swept diagonally across the visual field from one side to the center in twelve steps followed by 13.6 s of blanks (16 x 850 ms). Each experiment included 224 850-ms steps plus 3 s of blank at the beginning and end, for a total of 196.4 seconds.</p>

<p>All participants completed pRF mapping experiments in which they viewed visual stimuli for the purpose of estimating the spatial selectivity for individual electrodes (population receptive field mapping <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>). In these experiments, participants were instructed to fixate on a cross located in the center of the screen and press a button every time the cross changed color (from green to red or red to green). Fixation cross color changes were created independently from the stimulus sequence and occurred at randomly chosen intervals ranging between 1 and 5 s. Participants completed one to three recording sessions. Each session included two pRF mapping experiments. The experimenter stayed in the room throughout the testing session. Participants were encouraged to take short breaks between experiments.</p>

Raw data traces obtained in each recording session were visually inspected for spiking, drift or other artifacts. Electrodes that showed large artifacts or showed epileptic activity were marked as bad and excluded from analysis. Data were then separated into individual experiments and formatted to conform to the iEEG-BIDS format <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Data for each experiment were re- referenced to the common average across electrodes for that experiment, whereby a separate common average was calculated per electrode group (i.e., separate common average for each of the 4 electrode types– standard grid, high-density grid, strip, and depth electrodes, see <italic>bidsEcogRereference.m</italic>). The re-referenced voltage time series for each experiment were written to BIDS derivatives directories.</p>

<title>Electrode localization</title>
<p>Intracranial electrode arrays from NYU patients were localized from the post-implantation structural T1- weighted MRI images and co-registered to the preoperative T1-weighted MRI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Electrodes from UMCU patients were localized from the postoperative CT scan and co-registered to the preoperative T1-weighted MRI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Electrode coordinates were computed in native T1 space and visualized on the pial surface reconstruction of the preoperative T1-weighted scan generated using FreeSurfer.</p>
<p>Cortical visual field maps were generated for each individual participant based on the T1-weighted scan by aligning the surface topology with a probabilistically defined retinotopic atlas derived from a retinotopic fMRI mapping dataset as shown in <bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref></bold> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. We use the full probability map, rather than the maximum probability map, in order to account for the uncertainty in the mapping between electrodes location and visual field map in the patient’s native T1 space. For each cortical vertex, the atlas contains the probability of being assigned to each of 25 maps. Electrodes were matched to the probabilistic atlases using the following procedure (see <italic>bidsEcogMatchElectrodesToAtlas.m</italic> in ECoG_utils): For each electrode, the distance to all the nodes in the FreeSurfer pial surface mesh was calculated, and the node with the smallest distance was determined to be the matching node. The atlas value for the matching node was then used to assign the electrode to a probability of belonging to each of the following visual areas: V1v, V1d, V2v, V2d, V3v, V3d, hV4, VO1, VO2, PHC1, PHC2, TO2, TO1, LO2, LO1, V3b, V3a, IPS0, IPS1, IPS2, IPS3,IPS4, IPS5, SPL1, or FEF. We then merged these 25 visual areas into 12 groups: V1 (V1v + V1d), V2 (V2v +V2d), V3 (V3v + V3d), hV4, VO (VO1 + VO2), PHC (PHC1 + PHC2), TO (TO1 + TO2), LO (LO1 + LO2), V3AB (V3a + V3b), IPS (IPS0–5), SPL (SPL1), or FEF.</p>
<p>To visualize the electrodes on the cortical surface we use a modified version of the Wang et al. full probability atlas. First, we select vertices that have a probability greater than 95% of not belonging to any of the retinotopic regions, and labeled as “none”. Next, for the remaining vertices we assigned the region with the highest probability, even if the probability for not belonging to one of the retinotopic regions was higher (e.g., <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref></bold>, <bold>2</bold>, <bold>Supplementary Figures 1, and 7</bold>).</p>

<title>Data epoching</title>
<p>The preprocessed data were analyzed using custom MATLAB code (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/KenYMB/ECoG_alphaPRF">https://github.com/KenYMB/ECoG_alphaPRF</ext-link>). First, a dataset was created by reading in the voltage time courses of each experiment for each participant from the corresponding BIDS derivatives folders. To combine the UMCU and NYU participants into a single dataset, the UMCU data were downsampled at 512 Hz to match the sample rate of the NYU data. Visual inspection of the data indicated an obvious delay in response onset for the UMCU participants relative to the NYU participants. The cause of the delay could not be tracked down but it was clearly artifactual. To correct the delay, UMCU data were aligned to the NYU data based on a cross- correlation on the average event-related potentials (ERPs) across all stimulus conditions from the V1 and V2 electrodes from three participants (1 UMCU, 2 NYU). The delay in stimulus presentation was estimated to be 72ms, and stimulus onsets of the UMCU participants were shifted accordingly (Groen et al. 2022). One NYU patient (Patient 3) had inaccurate trigger onset signals for each stimulus event due to a recording malfunction. The onset timings for this patient were reconstructed by using the first onset in each experiment (which were recorded correctly), and then assumed to begin every 850 ms as controlled by the stimulus computer.</p>
<p>The voltage data were then epoched for all trials between [-0.2 and 0.8] seconds relative to stimulus onset (see <italic>ecog_prf_getData.m</italic>). Baseline-correction was applied by subtracting the average pre-stimulus amplitude computed in [-0.2 and 0] seconds within each trial.</p>

<title>Electrode selection and exclusion of noisy data</title>
<p>In two participants (10 and 11), there were high-density grids over lateral posterior cortex. All electrodes from these two grids were included in the pRF analyses (described below). In addition, we also included all standard grid or strip electrodes which were assigned to one of the visual areas with a minimum of 5% according to the Wang et al full probability atlas. Together, this resulted in 239 high-density electrodes and 131 standard grid or strip electrodes. After excluding 4 electrodes due to high noise (see paragraph below), the data selection resulted in a total of 366 electrodes from 9 participants. Of these 366 electrodes, 334 covered visual areas V1, V2, V3, hV4, VO, PHC, TO, LO, V3AB, IPS, and SPL. The other 32 electrodes belonged to one of the high-density grids but could not be assigned to a particular visual area.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we excluded epochs containing voltages that were large relative to the evoked signal. Specifically, for each electrode, we derived a distribution of the expected peak of the evoked signal by (1) converting voltage to power (squared voltage), (2) taking the maximum power from each epoch, excluding blanks, during the stimulus period (0–500 ms), and (3) fitting an inverse Gaussian distribution to these numbers. This yields one distribution for each electrode. Next, we computed the evoked potential by averaging the voltage time series across all epochs excluding blanks, and projected this out from every epoch. Finally, from the residual time series in each epoch, we compared the maximum power to the inverse Gaussian distribution for that electrode. If that value fell in the far tail, defined as the upper 0.01% of the area under the curve, then we excluded that epoch. This resulted in the exclusion of 0.8% of epochs (3,422 out of ∼430,000). Twelve electrodes showed unusually high variance across trials (over three standard deviations across electrodes) and were therefore excluded from further analysis. Furthermore, two runs from Patient 3 were not included in final analyses, as the patient broke fixation during these runs (see <italic>ecog_prf_selectData.m</italic>).</p>

<title>Computing power spectral density</title>
<p>We computed power spectral density (PSD) for each electrode in each epoch. We assumed in our analysis that the alpha oscillation is bandpass, centered at about 8–13 Hz, and that the biophysical processes giving rise to the oscillation are distinct from those causing the low-pass visually evoked potential. The two signals overlap in frequency, however. Hence, in order to remove the influence of the evoked signal on estimates of alpha power (and other spectral responses) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, we computed the voltage signal averaged across trials (“Event related potential”, or ERP) separately for epochs with stimulus presentation and for epochs without stimuli (blanks). We then regressed the ERP time series out from each epoch (see <italic>ecog_prf_regressData.m</italic>). From the time series after removal of the ERP, we computed the PSD during the stimulus presentation period (0–500 ms) in 1 Hz bins. We used Welch’s (1967) method with a 200 ms length Hann window with 50% overlap to attenuate edge effects. Baseline power spectra were computed for each electrode by taking a geometric average of the power spectra at each frequency bin across blank epochs (see <italic>ecog_prf_spectra.m</italic>).</p>

<label>4.7</label><title>P<sc>rf analysis</sc></title>
<p>Each participant had multiple identical pRF runs, with the same sequence of 224 trials per run, and 2 to 6 runs per participant. For each electrode and for each of the 224 trials, we computed the geometric mean of the PSD per frequency bin across the repeated runs, to yield a sequence of 224 PSDs per electrode. We extracted a summary measure of alpha power and broadband power from each of the PSDs, so that for each electrode, we obtained a series of 224 alpha values and 224 broadband values.</p>
<sec id="s4g1">
<title>Estimating alpha power from the PSD</title>
<p>We used a model-based approach to compute the alpha responses. This is important because the broadband response extends to low frequencies, and if one just measured the power in a pre-defined range of frequencies corresponding to the alpha band, it would reflect a sum of the two signals rather than the alpha response alone.</p>
<p>To decompose the spectral power into a broadband shift and a change in the alpha oscillation, we modeled the spectral power changes in the 3 to 26 Hz range as the sum of two responses in the log power / log frequency domain: a linear shift to capture the broadband response and a Gaussian to capture the alpha response (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref></bold>), according to the formula based on Hermes et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> decomposition of broadband and gamma oscillations:

<p><italic>P</italic>(<italic>k</italic>) is the power spectral density (PSD), either for the stimulus (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>) or the blank (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub>). 10<sup>μ</sup> indicates the peak alpha frequency. We define the change in power as the logarithm of the ratio, so that, for example, a doubling or halving in power are treated symmetrically. Typically, the response to a stimulus is an increase in broadband power and a decrease in the alpha oscillation, so β<sub><italic>broadband_low</italic></sub> is usually positive and β<sub><italic>alpha</italic></sub> is usually negative. We refer to the broadband component as β<sub><italic>broadband_low</italic></sub> to distinguish it from the broadband power we estimate at higher frequencies (70–180 Hz). While the two responses might result from a common biological cause, as proposed by <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, we treat the power elevation at lower and higher frequencies separately here. This ensures that the pRFs estimated from the broadband response (70–180 Hz) and from the alpha responses are independent measures, and that any relationship between them is not an artifact of the decomposition method. Confining the broadband signal to higher frequencies to estimate the broadband pRFs also facilitates comparison with other reports, since most groups exclude low frequencies from their estimates of ECoG broadband data. Hence the term β<sub><italic>broadband_low</italic></sub> is defined here only to help estimate the alpha response, and is not used directly for fitting pRF models in our main analysis comparing alpha and broadband pRFs.</p>
<p>For two participants, there was a prominent spectral peak just above the alpha band (∼24 Hz, beta band), which interfered with this spectral decomposition. In this case, we added a third component to the model, identical to the term for alpha, except with a center constrained to 15–30 Hz instead of 8 to 13 Hz, and applied the model in the 3 to 32 Hz range:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="528137v5_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
The amplitude of this beta oscillation was modeled as a nuisance variable in that it helped improve our estimate of the alpha oscillation but was not used further in analysis. Including this additional term for the other participants had negligible effect, since there were not clear beta oscillations in other participants so that the coefficient was usually close to 0. For simplicity, we omitted the beta terms for all datasets except for the two participants which required it. This spectral decomposition was computed for each aperture step in the pRF experiments with the constraint that the peak alpha frequency, 10<sup>μ</sup>, was within ±1 Hz of the peak estimated from averaging across the responses to all apertures for each electrode.</p>

<title>Time courses from pRF analyses</title>
<p>The computations above yield one estimate of alpha power and one estimate of broadband power per trial per electrode, meaning two time series with 224 samples. Visual inspection showed that these two metrics both tended to rise and fall relatively slowly relative to the small changes in position of the sweeping bar aperture. Therefore, the rapid fluctuations in the summary time series were mostly noise. To increase signal-to-noise ratio, each time course was decimated using a lowpass Chebyshev Type I infinite impulse response (IIR) filter of order 3, resulting in 75 time points (see <italic>ecog_prf_fitalpha.m</italic> and <italic>ecog_prf_constructTimeSeries.m</italic>).

<title>Fitting pRF models</title>
<p>The alpha and broadband power time course and the sequential stimulus contrast apertures were used to estimate two pRFs per electrode (one for alpha, one for broadband), using a Difference of Gaussians (DoG) model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. The DoG model predicts the response amplitude as the dot product of the binarized stimulus aperture and a pRF. For broadband, the pRF was assumed to be a positive 2D Gaussian (circular) summed with a negative surround. For alpha, the pRF was assumed to be negative with a positive surround. Early analyses indicated a need for the surround, but a lack of precision in estimating its size. For simplicity and to avoid overfitting, we assumed the surround to extend infinitely. Hence the pRF is a Gaussian with an offset. For each model (alpha and broadband) for each electrode, 5 parameters were fit: center location of the pRF (<italic>x, y</italic>), standard deviation of the center Gaussian (σ), and the gains of the center (<italic>g</italic><sub>1</sub>) and the surround (<italic>g</italic><sub>2</sub>). We estimated these pRF parameters using the analyzePRF toolbox <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. We modified the toolbox to incorporate the surround (see <italic>analyzePRFdog.m</italic> in ECoG_utils). The predicted response is obtained by the dot product of aperture and pRF:

We set the boundary on the center of Gaussian (<italic>x, y</italic>) as [-16.6° and 16.6°], two times the maximal extent of the visual stimulus. We performed the fitting twice, once to compute pRF parameters and once to compute model accuracy separately. We use the results of the fit to the complete dataset for each electrode to report pRF parameters. To estimate model accuracy, we fit the data using two-fold cross-validation. For cross- validation, each time course was separated into first and second half time courses. Both halves included all horizontal and vertical stimulus positions but reversed in temporal order. We estimated the pRF parameters from each half time course (37 or 38 time points), and used these parameters to predict the response to the other half of the time course. Then we obtained the cross-validated coefficient of determination as the model accuracy of the concatenated predictions (<italic>R</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>):

To summarize the data from each electrode, we took the cross-validated variance explained from the split half analysis, and the parameter estimates from the full fit, converting the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> parameters to polar angle and eccentricity (see <italic>ecog_prf_analyzePRF.m</italic>).</p>

<title>Comparison of alpha and broadband pRFs</title>
<p>We compared the pRF parameters for the alpha model and broadband models for a subset of electrodes which showed reasonably good fits for each of the two measures. To be included in the comparison, electrodes needed to have a pRF center within the maximal stimulus extent (8.3°) for both broadband and alpha, and to have a goodness of fit exceeding thresholds for both broadband and alpha.</p>
<p>The goodness of fit thresholds were defined based on null distributions. The null distributions were computed separately for broadband and alpha. In each case, we shuffled the assignment of pRF parameters to electrodes, computing how accurately the pRF model from one electrode explained the time series from a different electrode. We did this 5,000 times to compute a distribution, and chose a variance explained threshold that was higher than 95% of the values in this null distribution. That value was 31% for broadband and 22% for alpha (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref></bold>). Electrodes whose cross-validated variance explained without shuffling exceeded these values were included for the comparison between the two types of signals (assuming their pRF centers were within the 8.3° stimulus aperture).</p>
<p>This procedure resulted in 54 electrodes from 4 patients. Of these, 35 electrodes had non-zero probability assignments to V1, V2, or V3, 45 to dorsolateral visual areas (TO, LO, V3AB, or IPS), and 3 to ventral visual areas (hV4, VO, or PHC). The total is greater than 54 because of the probabilistic assignment of electrodes to areas (See <italic>Electrode localization</italic> for the probabilistic assignment). See <bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold> for details.</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl2" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<label>Table 2.</label>
<caption><title>Overview of electrodes and patients per visual area and figure</title><p>. The totals are lower than the sum of V1–V3 and Dorsolateral because some electrodes are counted toward both (see <italic>Electrode Localization</italic>, <xref rid="s4f" ref-type="sec">section 4.6</xref>). The electrodes in visual areas indicate electrodes which have at least 5% probability to be assigned to a visual area.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="528137v5_tbl2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>The visually responsive electrodes indicate the electrodes in visual areas with satisfying thresholding criteria in broadband pRFs. The electrodes for comparing broadband and alpha pRFs are the electrodes satisfying thresholding criteria both in broadband and alpha pRFs. Because assignments to the visual areas are probabilistic, the total numbers of electrodes are less than the sum of the numbers of electrodes in each visual area.</p>
<p>To summarize the relationship between broadband and alpha pRF parameters separately for low (V1–V3) vs. high (dorsolateral) visual areas, we used a resampling procedure that accounts for uncertainty of the assignment between electrodes and visual area. We sampled from the 54 electrodes 54 times with replacement, and randomly assigned each electrode to a visual area according to the Wang full probability distributions. After the resampling, average 17.7 electrodes were assigned to V1–V3, 23.2 to dorsolateral, and 53 to either (i.e., one electrode was not assigned to either of V1–V3 or dorsolateral). We repeated this procedure 5,000 times. We then plotted pRF parameters from the broadband and alpha models as 2D histograms (e.g., <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref></bold>). For the 2D histograms, we computed and plotted 68% confidence intervals derived from the covariance matrix using the function <italic>error_ellipse.m</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4705-error_ellipse">https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4705-error_ellipse</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Coherence in the high-density grids</title>
<p>We assessed the spatial dependence of coherence in each of the two signals (broadband and alpha) by analyzing data from the two high-density grids (Patients 8 and 9). For each pair of electrodes on a grid, we computed the cross power spectral density (CPSD) in each epoch. The CPSD was computed on the time series after regressing out the ERPs, as described above (<italic>Computing power spectral density</italic>) in 500-ms sliding windows (75% overlap, Hann windows, Welch’s method <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>). Regressing out the ERPs ensures that coherence measured between electrodes is not a result of the two electrodes having similar stimulus-triggered responses. The CPSD was calculated over the stimulus interval (-200–800 ms) in 1 Hz frequency bins (see <italic>ecog_prf_crossspectra.m</italic>). For each electrode pair, and for each of the 224 time series, the magnitude- squared coherence (MSC) was computed and averaged across the <italic>N</italic> repeated experiments:
<disp-formula id="eqn7">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="528137v5_eqn7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
This calculation returns an array of time series by frequency bins for each electrode pair. We then derived summary metrics of coherence for alpha and broadband (see <italic>ecog_prf_connectivity.m</italic>). We defined the alpha coherence between a seed electrode and all other electrodes on the high-density grid as the coherence at the peak alpha frequency. We defined broadband coherence as the average of the coherence in the broadband frequency range, 70–180 Hz. For every electrode pair on a grid, we then had 224 measures of alpha coherence and 224 measures of broadband coherence. For consistency with the pRF analyses, these time series of alpha and broadband coherence were again decimated into 75 time points.</p>
<p>We then binned the coherence data by electrode pair as a function of inter-electrode distance and by trial as a function of stimulus location. Electrode pairs were binned into inter-electrode distances in multiples of 3 mm. Only electrodes pairs for which the seed electrode satisfied the pRF threshold as computed in the previous section were selected (see <italic>Comparison of alpha and broadband pRFs</italic>). We used bootstrapping to compute error bars. For each inter-electrode distance, we randomly sampled electrode pairs with replacement, and averaged the coherence across the electrode pairs and trials. We repeated this procedure 5,000 times. The averaged coherences were fitted to the exponential decay function across inter-electrode distances using the least squares method.</p>

<p>The distributions of variance explained in alpha and broadband pRFs from all visual areas show rightward tendency compared to shuffled distributions.

The medians shown as black arrows have larger values in the raw distributions than the shuffled distributions (24% vs -21% in broadband and 5% vs -18% in alpha), suggesting the prediction accuracy of the pRF model fit is meaningful both in broadband and alpha. The false positive criterions were set at 95% of the values in this null distribution (dashed line: 31% for broadband and 22% for alpha). The electrodes shown in the right side of the false positive criterion (dark gray bars) were included for the comparison between broadband and alpha pRFs. in broadband pRFs are the visually selected electrodes. The electrodes shown in the right side of the false positive criterion in alpha pRFs are considered as the alpha sensitive electrodes. See <italic>makeFigureS3_S4.m</italic>.</p></caption>

<p>This intracranial EEG study presents <bold>important</bold> neural evidence supporting the high spatial specificity (receptive field) of visually-driven alpha-band oscillation in human brains and its potential role in exogenous cuing attention. The evidence supporting the claims is <bold>solid</bold>, although more control analyses to exclude other explanations could further strengthen the conclusion. The work challenges the predominant view about the role of alpha-band oscillation in visual attention and advocates that stimulus-driven alpha suppression is precisely tuned and might contribute to exogenous spatial attention.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors build upon previous research that utilized non-invasive EEG and MEG by analyzing intracranial human ECoG data with high spatial resolution. They employed a receptive field mapping task to infer the retinotopic organization of the human visual system. The results present compelling evidence that the spatial distribution of human alpha oscillations is highly specific and functionally relevant, as it provides information about the position of a stimulus within the visual field.</p>
<p>Using state-of-the-art modeling approaches, the authors not only strengthen the existing evidence for the spatial specificity of the human dominant rhythm but also provide new quantification of its functional utility, specifically in terms of the size of the receptive field relative to the one estimated based on broad band activity.</p>
<p>The present manuscript currently omits the complementary view that the retinotopic map of the visual system might be related to eye movement control. Previous research in non-human primates using microelectrode stimulation has clearly shown that neuronal circuits in the visual system possess motor properties (e.g. Schiller and Styker 1972, Schiller and Tehovnik 2001). More recent work utilizing Utah arrays, receptive field mapping, and electrical stimulation further supports this perspective, demonstrating that the retinotopic map functions as a motor map. In other words, neurons within a specific area responding to a particular stimulus location also trigger eye movements towards that location when electrically stimulated (e.g. Chen et al. 2020).</p>
<p>Similarly, recent studies in humans have established a link between the retinotopic variation of human alpha oscillations and eye movements (e.g., Quax et al. 2019, Popov et al. 2021, Celli et al. 2022, Liu et al. 2023, Popov et al. 2023). Therefore, it would be valuable to discuss and acknowledge this complementary perspective on the functional relevance of the presented evidence in the discussion section.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this work, Yuasa et al. aimed to study the spatial resolution of modulations in alpha frequency oscillations (~10Hz) within the human occipital lobe. Specifically, the authors examined the receptive field (RF) tuning properties of alpha oscillations, using retinotopic mapping and invasive electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings. The authors employ established approaches for population RF mapping, together with a careful approach to isolating and dissociating overlapping, but distinct, activities in the frequency domain. Whereby, the authors dissociate genuine changes in alpha oscillation amplitude from other superimposed changes occurring over a broadband range of the power spectrum. Together, the authors used this approach to test how spatially tuned estimated RFs were when based on alpha range activity, vs. broadband activities (focused on 70-180Hz). Consistent with a large body of work, the authors report clear evidence of spatially precise RFs based on changes in alpha range activity. However, the size of these RFs were far larger than those reliably estimated using broadband range activity at the same recording site. Overall, the work reflects a rigorous approach to a previously examined question, for which improved characterization leads to improved consistency in findings and some advance of prior work.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Overall, the authors take a careful and well-motivated approach to data analyses. The authors successfully test a clear question with a rigorous approach and provide strong supportive findings. Firstly, well-established methods are used for modeling population RFs. Secondly, the authors employ contemporary methods for dissociating unique changes in alpha power from superimposed and concomitant broadband frequency range changes. This is an important confound in estimating changes in alpha power not employed in prior studies. The authors show this approach produces more consistent and robust findings than standard band-filtering approaches. As noted below, this approach may also account for more subtle differences when compared to prior work studying similar effects.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
-Theoretical framing: The authors frame their study as testing between two alternative views on the organization, and putative functions, of occipital alpha oscillations: i) alpha oscillation amplitude reflects broad shifts in arousal state, with large spatial coherence and uniformity across cortex; ii) alpha oscillation amplitude reflects more specific perceptual processes and can be modulated at local spatial scales. However, in the introduction this framing seems mostly focused on comparing some of the first observations of alpha with more contemporary observations. Therefore, I read their introduction to more reflect the progress in studying alpha oscillations from Berger's initial observations to the present. I am not aware of a modern alternative in the literature that posits alpha to lack spatially specific modulations. I also note this framing isn't particularly returned to in the discussion. A second important variable here is the spatial scale of measurement. It follows that EEG based studies will capture changes in alpha activity up to the limits of spatial resolution of the method (i.e. limited in ability to map RFs). This methodological distinction isn't as clearly mentioned in the introduction, but is part of the author's motivation. Finally, as noted below, there are several studies in the literature specifically addressing the authors question, but they are not discussed in the introduction.</p>
<p>-Prior studies: There are important findings in the literature preceding the author's work that are not sufficiently highlighted or cited. In general terms, the spatio-temporal properties of the EEG/iEEG spectrum are well known (i.e. that changes in high frequency activity are more focal than changes in lower frequencies). Therefore, the observations of spatially larger RFs for alpha activities is highly predicted. Specifically, prior work has examined the impact of using different frequency ranges to estimate RF properties, for example ECoG studies in the macaque by Takura et al. NeuroImage (2016) [PubMed: 26363347], as well as prior ECoG work by the author's team of collaborators (Harvey et al., NeuroImage (2013) [PubMed: 23085107]), as well as more recent findings from other groups (Luo et al., (2022) BioRxiv: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.28.505627">https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.28.505627</ext-link>). Also, a related literature exists for invasively examining RF mapping in the time-voltage domain, which provides some insight into the author's findings (as this signal will be dominated by low-frequency effects). The authors should provide a more modern framing of our current understanding of the spatial organization of the EEG/iEEG spectrum, including prior studies examining these properties within the context of visual cortex and RF mapping. Finally, I do note that the author's approach to these questions do reflect an important test of prior findings, via an improved approach to RF characterization and iEEG frequency isolation, which suggests some important differences with prior work.</p>
<p>-Statistical testing: The authors employ many important controls in their processing of data. However, for many results there is only a qualitative description or summary metric. It appears very little statistical testing was performed to establish reported differences. Related to this point, the iEEG data is highly nested, with multiple electrodes (observations) coming from each subject, how was this nesting addressed to avoid bias?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This study tackles the important subject of sensory driven suppression of alpha oscillations using a unique intracranial dataset in human patients. Using a model-based approach to separate changes in alpha oscillations from broadband power changes, the authors try to demonstrate that alpha suppression is spatially tuned, with similar center location as high broadband power changes, but much larger receptive field. They also point to interesting differences between low-order (V1-V3) and higher-order (dorsolateral) visual cortex. While I find some of the methodology convincing, I also find significant parts of the data analysis, statistics and their presentation incomplete. Thus, I find that some of the main claims are not sufficiently supported. If these aspects could be improved upon, this study could potentially serve as an important contribution to the literature with implications for invasive and non-invasive electrophysiological studies in humans.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study utilizes a unique dataset (ECOG &amp; high-density ECOG) to elucidate an important phenomenon of visually driven alpha suppression. The central question is important and the general approach is sound. The manuscript is clearly written and the methods are generally described transparently (and with reference to the corresponding code used to generate them). The model-based approach for separating alpha from broadband power changes is especially convincing and well-motivated. The link to exogenous attention behavioral findings (figure 8) is also very interesting. Overall, the main claims are potentially important, but they need to be further substantiated (see weaknesses).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
I have three major concerns:</p>
<p>
1. Low N / no single subject results/statistics: The crucial results of Figure 4,5 hang on 53 electrodes from four patients (Table 2). Almost half of these electrodes (25/53) are from a single subject. Data and statistical analysis seem to just pool all electrodes, as if these were statistically independent, and without taking into account subject-specific variability. The mean effect per each patient was not described in text or presented in figures. Therefore, it is impossible to know if the results could be skewed by a single unrepresentative patient. This is crucial for readers to be able to assess the robustness of the results. N of subjects should also be explicitly specified next to each result.</p>
<p>2. Separation between V1-V3 and dorsolateral electrodes: Out of 53 electrodes, 27 were doubly assigned as both V1-V3 and dorsolateral (Table 2, Figures 4,5). That means that out of 35 V1-V3 electrodes, 27 might actually be dorsolateral. This problem is exasperated by the low N. for example all the 20 electrodes in patient 8 assigned as V1-V3 might as well be dorsolateral. This double assignment didn't make sense to me and I wasn't convinced by the authors' reasoning. I think it needlessly inflates the N for comparing the two groups and casts doubts on the robustness of these analyses.</p>
<p>3. Alpha pRFs are larger than broadband pRFs: first, as broadband pRF models were on average better fit to the data than alpha pRF models (dark bars in Supp Fig 3. Top row), I wonder if this could entirely explain the larger Alpha pRF (i.e. worse fits lead to larger pRFs). There was no anlaysis to rule out this possibility. Second, examining closely the entire 2.4 section there wasn't any formal statistical test to back up any of the claims (not a single p-value is mentioned). It is crucial in my opinion to support each of the main claims of the paper with formal statistical testing.</p>
<p>While I judge these issues as crucial, I can also appreciate the considerable effort and thoughtfulness that went into this study. I think that addressing these concerns will substantially raise the confidence of the readership in the study's findings, which are potentially important and interesting.</p>

<p>We appreciate the responses from the editors and reviewers and will submit a revised manuscript addressing all of the main points raised. We are glad to see broad agreement that we took a careful approach and addressed a clear question.</p>
<p>There were questions raised about the framing of the study vis-à-vis prior literature. One question was whether low frequency signals always have larger point spread functions, thereby making our result unsurprising. A second question was whether the notion of alpha oscillations as having wide-spread coherence and relating to system-general states was out-of-date. We appreciate these comments and agree that they could use further discussion. Our view is that neither of these points weakens the study, but our framing could be clearer regarding these two important issues. We will improve discussion of these topics in the revision.</p>
<p>A second criticism mentioned by two reviewers is the lack of null-hypothesis testing. The value of null hypothesis statistical testing (NHST) in biomedicine is hotly debated, with many statisticians and scientists arguing that NHSTs add little to no value (Gigerenzer &amp; Marewski, 2015; McShane et al., 2019; Meehl, 1978). Others of course disagree (Mogie, 2004). Our goal was not to try to rule out null hypotheses, but rather to make systematic measurements and to report the reliable patterns. We generally focused on observations where the results were well above the noise, obviating the need to test the null. Nonetheless, we can (and will) improve the clarity of our arguments in terms of how we rely on specific statistical analyses to support particular conclusions, as well as how to deal with the issue of multiple electrodes coming from small numbers of subjects, an important point raised by R3. We will clarify these issues in the revision.</p>
<p>Reviewer 1 also made an interesting point about visual maps having an oculomotor component. We will do our best to incorporate this interesting issue into our revision.</p>
<p>In addition to the public review, the reviewers made a number of useful recommendations for the revision. We appreciate these recommendations and will carefully consider each of them.</p>
