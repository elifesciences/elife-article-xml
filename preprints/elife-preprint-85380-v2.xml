<title>Abstract</title><p>In adult mammals, spermatogenesis embodies the complex developmental process from spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) to spermatozoa. At the top of this developmental hierarchy lie a series of SSC subpopulations. Their individual identities as well as the relationships with each other, however, remain largely elusive. Using single-cell analysis and lineage tracing, we discovered both in mice and humans the quiescent adult SSC subpopulation marked specifically by forkhead box protein C2 (FOXC2). All spermatogenic progenies can be derived from FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSCs and the ablation of FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSCs led to the depletion of the undifferentiated spermatogonia pool. During germline regeneration, FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSCs were activated and able to completely restore the process. Germ cell specific <italic>Foxc2</italic> knockout resulted in an accelerated exhaustion of SSCs and eventually led to male infertility. Furthermore, FOXC2 prompts the expressions of negative regulators of cell cycle thereby ensures the SSCs reside in quiescence. Thus, this work proposes that the quiescent FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSCs are essential for maintaining the homeostasis and regeneration of spermatogenesis in adult mammals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Through spermatogenesis, spermatozoa are generated from spermatogenic cells that are originated from spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). It is critical for this process to be continuous and successful that SSCs are maintained in a homeostatic balance between self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">S. Sharma et al., 2019</xref>). The SSCs, which belong to a subgroup of undifferentiated spermatogonia (uSPG), exhibit significant heterogeneity and dynamic characteristics. In recent years, great insights into SSC behaviors and regulations have been provided by a body of pioneer works, especially with recent advances in single-cell gene-expression profiling, highlighting great heterogeneity of SSC and focusing on characterizing the nature of SSC states. Within the population of uSPG, a number of genes relatively higher expressed in primitive subfractions have been identified and well investigated, i.e., <italic>Gfra1</italic>, <italic>ID4</italic>, <italic>Ret</italic>, <italic>Eomes</italic>, <italic>Pax7</italic>, <italic>Nanos2</italic>, <italic>Shisa6</italic>, <italic>T</italic>, <italic>Pdx1</italic>, <italic>Lhx1</italic>, <italic>Egr2</italic> and <italic>Plvap</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aloisio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Guo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Helsel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jijiwa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">La et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nakagawa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Oatley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">M. Sharma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tokue et al., 2017</xref>). Particularly, <italic>Gfra1</italic>, <italic>ID4</italic>, <italic>Eomes</italic>, <italic>Pax7</italic>, <italic>Nanos2</italic>, and <italic>Plvap</italic> are further validated through lineage tracing experiment, which is considered to be a reliable method to study the development of stem cells. However, some essential and primitive sub-populations remain undiscovered, and the identification of which is of great significance for elucidating the developmental process of SSC renewal and its behavior in testis.</p>
<p>Adult stem cells (ASCs), as the undifferentiated primitive cells that can be found in nearly all types of tissues in mammals, are characteristic for a unique quiescent status reflected by both reversible cell cycle arrest and specific metabolic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">van Velthoven &amp; Rando, 2019</xref>). The role of the quiescent stem cells is to avoid premature exhaustion and to allow the long-term maintenance of a functional stem cell pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheung &amp; Rando, 2013</xref>). The adult SSCs appear to share this characteristic, as revealed in recent single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis in humans and mice, being largely non-proliferative while capable of reciprocating between the quiescent and activated status during homeostasis and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hermann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Suzuki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tan &amp; Wilkinson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). This notion has also been significantly supported by the discoveries of important regulators such as USF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Faisal et al., 2019</xref>) and DNMT3L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Liao et al., 2014</xref>) as well as the pathways including the PI3K/MAPK and mTORC1 signalings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Suzuki et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, it is generally believed that cells in a quiescent state are supposed to be more resilient to genotoxic insults, thus theoretically the quiescent SSCs can restore spermatogenesis upon such disturbance. However, by large, much remain unknown as to the characteristics and regulation of the quiescence state of adult SSCs. Thus, more important insights can be obtained through searching the quiescent SSC population and defining the essential characteristics of this population as the foundation of successful spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>Forkhead box protein C2 (FOXC2), a member of the forkhead/winged helix transcription factor family, plays essential roles in the development of various tissues in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bahuau et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kume et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Motojima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sasman et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, FOXC2 has been found to be expressed in A<sub>s</sub> and A<sub>pr</sub> spermatogonia of mouse testes and is required for SSC maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wei et al., 2018</xref>). However, the role of FOXC2 in the development of adult SSCs <italic>in vivo</italic> has yet to be explored. In this study, we identified a subpopulation of adult SSCs specifically expressed by FOXC2. In adult mice, FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSCs gave rise to all spermatogenic progenitor cells that can complete the full spermatogenesis. Upon the loss of FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSCs, the undifferentiated spermatogonia pool was exhausted, eventually leading to defective spermatogenesis. Specifically, FOXC2 is required for maintaining SSC quiescence by promoting the expression of negative regulators of cell cycle. Moreover, the FOXC2<sup>+</sup> population endured the chemical insult with busulfan and effectively restored spermatogenesis. Overall, we propose that FOXC2<sup>+</sup> represents the quiescent state of the SSCs in adult mammals that is crucial for the homeostasis and regeneration of SSCs.</p>

<title>Identification of FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSCs from the adult uSPGs</title>
<p>We performed single-cell RNA-seq (10x genomics) of the uSPG from adult mice testes marked by THY1, a widely recognized surface marker for uSPG with self-renewing and transplantable state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hammoud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kubota et al., 2004</xref>), to dissect the heterogeneity and developmental trajectory (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Among 5 distinct clusters identified, Cluster1 was characterized by the high expression of stemness markers whereas other clusters were featured by progenitor or differentiating spermatogonia (dSPG) markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Primarily mapped to the extreme early point of the developmental trajectory, Cluster1 cells appeared quiescent and likely represented the primitive state of uSPG populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E-G</xref>). The top10 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with Cluster1 are featured by SSC markers such as <italic>Mcam</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kanatsu-Shinohara et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Gfra1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hara et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Tcl1</italic> and <italic>Egr2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hermann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">La et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure1C</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1â figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>) in addition to six others expressed in different stages of germ cells and/or somatic cells, in which only FOXC2 was exclusively localized in the nucleus of a subgroup of ZBTB16<sup>+</sup> uSPG in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buaas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Costoya et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). More specifically, FOXC2 displayed differential expressions among various subtypes of uSPG, being more specific in A<sub>s</sub> (59.9%) than other subtypes including A<sub>pr</sub> (5.2%), A<sub>pr-1</sub> (4.1%), A<sub>al4-1</sub> (1.83%), A<sub>al8-1</sub> (1.5%), and A<sub>al16-1</sub> (1.67%) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). There was only a small fraction (5.1%) was active in proliferation as indicated by MKI67 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cells are primarily quiescent. Additionally, when examining the SSC markers validated previously by lineage tracing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">La &amp; Hobbs, 2019</xref>), we found that FOXC2 displays a higher level of co-localization with GFRA1 and EOMES than PAX7 and NEUROG3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nakagawa et al., 2007</xref>), indicating the FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cells contain but differ from the known SSC subsets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>

<p>We next analyzed the expression of FOXC2 in adult human testis using the published scRNA-seq dataset (GSE112013) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). As expected, FOXC2 was also specifically expressed in the human SSCs, most of which were MKI67<sup>-</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). Pseudotime analysis showed that the FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cells located at the start of the developmental trajectory with a proportion of about 90% that were MKI67<sup>-</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cells were a subset of ZBTB16<sup>+</sup> spermatogonia in adult human testis, and most of them were MKI67<sup>-</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>), representing a quiescent subpopulation of SSCs in human testis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Clermont, 1966a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">1966b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ehmcke &amp; Schlatt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ehmcke et al., 2006</xref>). These results suggest that FOXC2 is similarly expressed in the SSCs of adult human and mouse testis and may possess a conserved function.</p>

Tamoxifen was introduced at 2-month of age, after which the FOXC2-expressing lineage (GFP<sup>+</sup>) was tracked at d3 (day3), w1 (week1), w2, w4, w6, m4 (month4), m7, and m12 respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). At d3, the tracked cells were both GFP<sup>+</sup> and FOXC2<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) and constituted 0.027% of the total testicular cells as indicated by the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). GFP<sup>+</sup> cells and THY1<sup>+</sup> cells sorted by FACS were then transplanted into testes of recipient mice pre-treated with busulfan, respectively. Two months after transplantation, FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cells generated 3.6 times greater number of colonies than the THY1<sup>+</sup> control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D, E</xref>), indicating that the FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cells possess higher stemness as convinced by stronger transplantable viability.</p>

<p>At w1, all GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were identified as uSPGs, encompassing A<sub>s</sub>, A<sub>pr</sub>, and A<sub>al-4</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref><sub>a</sub>). Specifically, FOXC2<sup>+</sup> A<sub>s</sub> gave rise to 3 types of A<sub>pr</sub>, i.e., FOXC2<sup>+</sup>/FOXC2<sup>+</sup>, FOXC2<sup>+</sup>/FOXC2<sup>-</sup>, and FOXC2<sup>-</sup>/FOXC2<sup>-</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref><sub>c1</sub>, <sub>b</sub>, <sub>c2</sub>, <sub>d2</sub>), which then either produced FOXC2<sup>+</sup> or FOXC2<sup>-</sup> A<sub>s</sub> through symmetric or asymmetric division (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref><sub>c3</sub>, <sub>d1</sub>, <sub>f1</sub>), or developed into A<sub>al</sub> with no more than one FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cell in the chains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref><sub>e</sub>, <sub>f2</sub>). These results confirm that FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cells are capable of self-renewal to sustain the population as well as replenishing the uSPG pool by producing downstream progenies, thereby serving as SSCs. In the following 2-6 weeks, GFP<sup>+</sup> colonies further expanded and produced GFP<sup>+</sup> sperms in the epididymis, from which healthy GFP<sup>+</sup> offspring were given birth by C57BL/6J female recipients (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). The GFP<sup>+</sup> colonies constituted 83.67%, 90.48%, 96.78%, 98.55%, and 99.31% of the total length of the seminiferous tubules at w6, m2, m4, m7, and m12 respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H, I</xref>). All offspring were GFP<sup>+</sup> from m4 onwards (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). Additionally, the EOMES<sup>+</sup>, GFRA1<sup>+</sup> and PAX7<sup>+</sup> cells were all GFP<sup>+</sup> at w2, further confirming these progenies were derived from the FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). Overall, FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSCs can produce all subtypes of uSPG, thus initiating spermatogenesis in adult mice.</p>

<title>Specific ablation of the FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSCs results in the depletion of uSPG pool</title>
<p>We then prepared <italic>Foxc2<sup>iCreERT2/+</sup></italic>;<italic>Rosa26<sup>LSL-DTA/+</sup></italic> mice to investigate the physiological requirement of FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSCs in spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). FOXC2<sup>+</sup> population in 2-month-old mice was specifically ablated with tamoxifen-induced diphtheria toxin (DTA). The testes of these mice were examined at d3, d7, and d14 post tamoxifen induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Gradual loss of weight in testes coincided with the reduction in the size of testes in all the mice while body weight was maintained (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, C</xref>). Specifically, at d3, there were no detectable FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cells in addition to the decrease in the number of GFRA1<sup>+</sup>, LIN28A<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>) and ZBTB16<sup>+</sup> uSPG at the basement membrane of seminiferous tubules; at d14, all GFRA1<sup>+</sup>, LIN28A<sup>+</sup> and ZBTB16<sup>+</sup> uSPG disappeared while vacuoles formed at the basement membrane with remaining spermatocytes and spermatids in the seminiferous lumen (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3DâF</xref>, <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Meanwhile, the expression of DDX4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Toyooka et al., 2000</xref>) and DAZL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li et al., 2019</xref>) as germ cell markers was significantly reduced along with nearly undetectable expression of uSPG markers such as ZBTB16, LIN28A, GFRA1, RET, and NEUROG3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nakagawa et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>).

<title>FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSCs are resistant to busulfan and indispensable for germline regeneration</title>
<p>Next, we examined the regenerative viability of FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSCs. At d20 post busulfan treatment (20mg/kg), FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cells constituted the majority of uSPGs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Following a sharp decrease in cell number in the first five days, ZBTB16<sup>+</sup> and GFRA1<sup>+</sup> cells began to recover from d25 while the number of FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cells remained stable (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that this population is insensitive to busulfan. We then checked changes in the proportion of MKI67<sup>+</sup> cells in FOXC2<sup>+</sup> population after busulfan treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, D</xref>). At d30, the MKI67<sup>+</sup> proportion rose to 15.92%, indicating a higher level of proliferation, albeit the total cell number stayed static (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B, D</xref>), thereby becoming the driving force in restoring spermatogenesis. Up to d120, the MKI67<sup>+</sup> proportion had settled gradually back to the pre-treatment level, accompanied by the full recovery of spermatogenesis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Further details of this process were revealed during lineage tracing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Three days after tamoxifen induction, the 2-month-old <italic>Foxc2<sup>iCreERT2/+</sup></italic>;<italic>Rosa26<sup>LSL-T/G/LSL-T/G</sup></italic> mice were treated with busulfan. Consistent with the results above, at d20, the survived uSPGs were predominantly GFP<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Over 68.5% of the total length of the seminiferous tubules were GFP<sup>+</sup> at m2, and this proportion rose to 95.43%, 98.41%, and 99.27% at m4, m7, and m12 respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G, H</xref>), which was comparable to the proportion by tamoxifen induction alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). From m4 onwards, nearly all germ cells, spermatids, and their offspring were GFP<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G, I</xref>). Together, these results confirm that FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSCs are indispensable for germline regeneration that is central to spermatogenesis recovery from interruptions.</p>

<title>FOXC2 is essential for SSC maintenance in adult mice</title>
<p>We then focused on dissecting the role of FOXC2 in the SSC maintenance using <italic>Foxc2<sup>f/-</sup>;Ddx4<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gallardo et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).

The pseudotime analysis identified Cluster1, which represented the FOXC2-expressing SSCs in <italic>Foxc2<sup>f/+</sup></italic>mice corresponding to the FOXC2-deleting SSCs in the <italic>Foxc2<sup>f/-</sup>;Ddx4<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>mice, was specifically assigned to the extremely early stage of the development trajectory in respective samples, which was validated by the expression of corresponding markers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Aggregated analysis of the overall uSPG populations showed that cells derived from <italic>Foxc2<sup>f/-</sup>;Ddx4<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>mice were specifically associated with the late stage of the development trajectory, as opposed to <italic>Foxc2<sup>f/+</sup></italic>mice where nearly all the cells derived were concentrated at the early stage of development (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). This implies that the loss of FOXC2 prompts the SSCs to progress into a more differentiated stage. Further analysis of the cells in Cluster1 revealed two distinct subclusters, i.e., Subclusters0 and Subclusters1 (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6â figure supplement 2A</xref>). Formed primarily by the Cluster1 cells derived from <italic>Foxc2<sup>f/+</sup></italic>mice, Subclusters0 was featured by stemness markers, while Subcluster1, representing the majority of Cluster1 cells from <italic>Foxc2<sup>f/-</sup>;Ddx4<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>mice, was featured by progenitor markers (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2B, C</xref>). Consistently, pseudotime analysis showed that Cluster1 cells from <italic>Foxc2<sup>f/+</sup></italic> mice projected a forward stage of the developmental trajectory indicated by stemness markers, whereas Cluster1 cells from <italic>Foxc2<sup>f/-</sup>;Ddx4<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice were associated with a later stage of the developmental trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure6D</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2D, E</xref>). More specifically, less number of cells were found at the starting state1 in Cluster1 from <italic>Foxc2<sup>f/-</sup>;Ddx4<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice than in <italic>Foxc2<sup>f/+</sup></italic>mice, with rather more cells in the developmental progression (from state1 to state5), especially at the advanced state5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, FOXC2 deletion caused defective SSC maintenance and committed the SSCs to a differentiation destiny. Further, there were 932 genes down-regulated in Cluster1 cells derived from <italic>Foxc2<sup>f/-</sup>;Ddx4<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>mice in comparison to <italic>Foxc2<sup>f/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6âsource data 1</xref>), which were functionally associated with both stem cell population maintenance and mitotic cell cycle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, a comprehensive analysis of uSPG populations with scRNA-seq and the following lineage tracing study by whole-mount immunofluorescence assay led to the identification of FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSCs as a quiescent SSC subpopulation in adult mice. Further investigation through functionality analysis confirmed FOXC2 is essential for SSC self-renewal and stemness, thereby is required for maintaining the SSC population that is critical for continuous spermatogenesis. Importantly, our data demonstrated that the colonies formed by FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cells constituted nearly the total length of the seminiferous tubules (99.31%), implying that the FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSCs can support the complete spermatogenesis in adult mice.</p>
<p>GFRA1<sup>+</sup> A<sub>pr</sub> and A<sub>al</sub> cells are found to break randomly and a portion of them can return to the stem cell state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hara et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, our findings showed FOXC2 appeared in one of the A<sub>pr</sub> or A<sub>al</sub> cells at times, therefore raising a possibility that the subset of GFRA1<sup>+</sup> cells that return to stem cell state after intercellular bridge break, maybe FOXC2<sup>+</sup> due to different cell cycle state. If so, based on both findings, GFRA1<sup>+</sup>FOXC2<sup>+</sup> could represent a quiescent state whereas GFRA1<sup>+</sup>FOXC2<sup>-</sup> is proliferate active, which certainly requires further validation possibly through multiple lineage tracing and live imaging.</p>
<p>We observed that the FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSCs were almost all in a non-proliferative state (â¼94.9%), and further revealed that FOXC2 functioned in the negative regulation of cell cycle progression, thus confirming that FOXC2-expressing SSCs are quiescent SSC population in adult mice. The finding that FOXC2 inhibited cell cycle and differentiation of SSCs in testis is consistent with that reported in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Davis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sabine et al., 2015</xref>). In general, the quiescent state is a protective mechanism for stem cell storage and prevents stem cells from damage or depletion under genotoxic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arai &amp; Suda, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Relaix &amp; Zammit, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rodgers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">S. Sharma et al., 2019</xref>). In our work, after the busulfan treatment, the quantity of FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cells remained stable and the survived uSPGs were predominantly FOXC2<sup>+</sup>, indicating its insensitivity to cytotoxic agents. However, the proportion of MKI67<sup>+</sup>FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cells increased by 15.92% after 30 days of the busulfan treatment and decreased back to the pre-treatment level (5.08%) at 120 days, implying that the quiescent FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cells are able to transform into the proliferative FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cells to replenish the SSC pool to maintain the SSC homeostasis and normal spermatogenesis. We further confirmed by lineage tracing analysis that FOXC2-expressing cells were the only remaining SSC population and were responsible for germline regeneration after the busulfan treatment, indicating that FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSCs represent a functionally important stem cell population with regenerative ability. In the future, more insights into the unique regulation of SSCs can be drawn from studying and comparing the transition between the quiescent and proliferative states in FOXC2<sup>+</sup> and other SSC subpopulations.</p>
<p>According to our findings, we propose a model for the maintenance of the FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSC subpopulation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7K</xref>). Under physiological conditions, FOXC2<sup>+</sup> A<sub>s</sub> cells (including FOXC2<sup>+</sup>GFRA1<sup>+</sup>, FOXC2<sup>+</sup>EOMES<sup>+</sup> cells, etc.) constitute the SSC pool, of which only a small proportion (â¼5.1%) cells are proliferative while the majority remains quiescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Ka</xref>). This population can divide symmetrically or asymmetrically into different A<sub>pr</sub> and A<sub>al</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Kb</xref>). Then FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Kb</xref>) may break from the syncytial and return to A<sub>s</sub> state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Ka</xref>) to maintain the stable number of the SSC pool. FOXC2<sup>-</sup> progenies, derived from the FOXC2<sup>+</sup> population, form progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Kc</xref>) to support spermatogenesis. However, it requires continuous supply from the FOXC2<sup>+</sup> population and is subject to exhaustion when the supply is disrupted. In the context of regeneration conditions, the FOXC2<sup>+</sup>MKI67<sup>-</sup> cells can survive and set out the recovery process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Kd</xref>). At the early stage, increasing proportion of FOXC2<sup>+</sup>MKI67<sup>-</sup> cells is committed to transforming into proliferative FOXC2<sup>+</sup>MKI67<sup>+</sup> cells, strengthening the supply to the progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Ke</xref>). At the late recovery stage, MKI67<sup>+</sup>/MKI67<sup>-</sup> ratio returns to the physiological level in FOXC2<sup>+</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Ka</xref>), leaving the total number of FOXC2<sup>+</sup> cells stable, therefore maintaining the SSC homeostasis. However, it is necessary to perform more investigation to further improve and modify this model to gain a complete understanding of the connections between different SSC subpopulations in the testes of adult mice.</p>
<p>Based on our observation, FOXC2 seems nonessential for the transformation from gonocytes to SSCs in infant mice, in contrast to its requirement for adult spermatogenesis. A recent study showed that FOXC2<sup>+</sup> subpopulation in the postnatal mouse testis (&lt;5 weeks) appeared more active in proliferation than the adult counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wei et al., 2018</xref>). Such differential functionality might reflect the difference in the physical nature of spermatogenesis between developmental stages. For example, the maturity of spermatogenesis is still under development during the juvenile period with a focus on establishing and expanding the SSC pool. Therefore, it would be interesting to explore differences in individual functional contexts as well as the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Meanwhile, FOXC2, highly conserved between mice and humans with 94% identity in amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Miura et al., 1997</xref>), is also expressed in a subset of human adult SSCs, raising the possibility of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism governing SSC homeostasis in humans. Further work following this direction might be of great clinical significance specifically to patients who suffer from infertility. Moreover, the developmental correlation between FOXC2<sup>+</sup> SSCs and other SSC subpopulations proposed previously should be revealed via biological methods such as multiple lineage tracing and live imaging. Collectively, our work here provides new insights into the investigation of adult SSCs and serves as a reference for studying the homeostasis and regeneration of other stem-cell systems.</p>

The cell suspension was pipetted up and down once every 5 minutes and the digestion process was stopped with DMEM (containing 10% FBS). The cell suspension was filtered through a 40-Î¼m nylon mesh, and after centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 8 mL PBS. The 15 mL conical centrifuge tubes were slowly overlayed with 2 mL of 70% Percoll solution, 2 mL of 30% Percoll solution, and then 2 mL of testicular cell suspension and centrifuge at 600 Ã g for 10 min at 4 Â°C without using the centrifuge brake. After centrifugation, the cells at the interface between the 70% and the 30% Percoll solution were carefully removed into the new conical centrifuge tubes, washed with PBS, and then centrifuge at 600 Ã g for 10 min at 4 Â°C. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 360Î¼L MACS buffer, added with 40Î¼L of magnetic microbeads conjugated with anti-Thy-1 antibody (Miltenyi Biotec 130â049â101, Auburn, CA), and mixed well.

Default parameters were used. The UMI counts were analyzed using the Seurat R Package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) (v.3.0.1) following the Seurat pipeline. Cells with more than 200 detected genes or less than 10% mitochondria reads were retained. Genes not detected in at least 10 cells were removed from subsequent analysis. The resulting matrix was normalized, and the most variable genes were found using Seuratâs default settings, then the matrix was scaled with regression against the mitochondria reads. The top 2000 variable genes were used to perform PCA, and Jackstraw was performed using Seuratâs default settings. Variation in the cells was visualized by UMAP for the top principal components. Cell types were determined using marker genes identified from the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kowalczyk et al., 2015</xref>). We used the Seurat function CellCycleScoring to determine the cell cycle phase, as this program determines the relative expression of a large set of G2-M and S-phase genes.

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (v7.0). All experiments were repeated at least three times, and data for evaluated parameters are reported as mean Â± s.e.m. The p-values were obtained using two-tailed unpaired Studentâs t-tests or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test (ns represents p-value &gt; 0.05, * represents p-value &lt; 0.05, ** represents p-value &lt; 0.01, *** represents p-value &lt; 0.001, and **** represents p-value &lt; 0.0001).</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study reports that Foxc2+ cells in the testis represent the quiescent spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). The data supporting this claim are <bold>solid</bold>. The finding is of great significance to reproductive and stem-cell biology as male fertility depends on the fine balance between self-renewal and differentiation activities of the male germline stem cells, i.e., SSCs.</p>

<p>The expression and localization of Foxc2 strongly suggest that its role is mainly confined to As undifferentiated spermatogonia (uSPGs). Lineage tracing demonstrated that all germ cells were derived from the FOXC2+ uSPGs. Specific ablation of the FOXC2+ uSPGs led to the depletion of all uSPG populations. Full spermatogenesis can be achieved through the transplantation of Foxc2+ uSPGs. Male germ cell-specific ablation of Foxc2 caused Sertoli-only testes in mice. CUT&amp;Tag sequencing revealed that FOXC2 regulates the factors that inhibit the mitotic cell cycle, consistent with its potential role in maintaining a quiescent state in As spermatogonia. These data made the authors conclude that the FOXC2+ uSPG may be the true SSCs, essential for maintaining spermatogenesis. The conclusion is supported by the data presented.</p>

<p>The authors found FOXC2 is mainly expressed in As of mouse undifferentiated spermatogonia (uSPG). About 60% of As uSPG were FOXC2+ MKI67-, indicating that FOXC2 uSPG were quiescent. Similar spermatogonia (ZBTB16+ FOXC2+ MKI67-) were also found in human testis.</p>
<p>The lineage tracing experiment using Foxc2CRE/+;R26T/Gf/f mice demonstrated that all germ cells were derived from the FOXC2+ uSPG. Furthermore, specific ablation of the FOXC2+ uSPGs using Foxc2Cre/+;R26DTA/+ mice resulted in the depletion of all uSPG population. In the regenerative condition created by busulfan injection, all FOXC2+ uSPG survived and began to proliferate at around 30 days after busulfan injection. The survived FOXC2+ uSPGs generated all germ cells eventually. To examine the role of FOXC2 in the adult testis, spermatogenesis of Foxc2f/-;Ddx4-cre mice was analyzed. From a 2-month-old, the degenerative seminiferous tubules were increased and became Sertoli cell-only seminiferous tubules, indicating FOXC2 is required to maintain normal spermatogenesis in adult testes. To get insight into the role of FOXC2 in the uSPG, CUT&amp;Tag sequencing was performed in sorted FOXC2+ uSPG from Foxc2CRE/+;R26T/Gf/f mice 3 days after TAM diet feeding. The results showed some unique biological processes, including negative regulation of the mitotic cell cycle, were enriched, suggesting the FOXC2 maintains a quiescent state in spermatogonia.</p>
<p>Lineage tracing experiments using transgenic mice of the TAM-inducing system was well-designed and demonstrated interesting results. Based on all data presented, the authors concluded that the FOXC2+ uSPG are primitive SSCs, an indispensable subpopulation to maintain adult spermatogenesis. The conclusion of the mouse study is supported by the data presented.</p>

<p>By popular single-cell RNA-seq, the authors identified FOXC2 as an undifferentiated spermatogonia-specific expressed gene. The FOXC2+-SSCs can sufficiently initiate and sustain spermatogenesis, the ablation of this subgroup results in the depletion of the uSPG pool. The authors provide further evidence to show that this gene is essential for SSCs maintenance by negatively regulating the cell cycle in adult mice, thus well-established FOXC2 as a key regulator of SSCs quiescent state.</p>
<p>The experiments are well-designed and conducted, the overall conclusions are convincing. This work will be of interest to stem cell and reproductive biologists.</p>

Full spermatogenesis can be achieved through the transplantation of Foxc2+ uSPGs. Male germ cell-specific ablation of Foxc2 caused Sertoli-only testes in mice. CUT&amp;Tag sequencing revealed that FOXC2 regulates the factors that inhibit the mitotic cell cycle, consistent with its potential role in maintaining a quiescent state in As spermatogonia. These data made the authors conclude that the FOXC2+ uSPG may be the true SSCs, essential for maintaining spermatogenesis. The conclusion is largely supported by the data presented, but two concerns should be addressed: 1) terminology used is confusing: primitive SSCs, primitive uSPGs, transit amplifying SSCs... 2) the GFP+ cells used for germ cell transplantation should be better controlled using THY1+ cells.</p>

<p>Thanks for your good comments. According to your suggestions, we have addressed your two concerns as follows:</p>
<p>1&gt;  Overall our work suggest that FOXC2+ SSCs are a subpopulation of SSCs in a quiescent state, thus we have replaced the term âprimitiveâ with âquiescentâ in the revised manuscript. In general, âtransient amplifying SSCsâ is considered to be âprogenitorsâ, thus we have replaced âtransient amplifying SSCsâ with âprogenitorsâ in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>2&gt;  The transplantation experiment was conducted using MACS-sorted THY1+, FACS sorted THY1+, and FACS-sorted GFP+ (FOXC2+) uSPGs simultaneously. To be consistent with the single-cell RNA-seq using the MACS-sorted THY1+ uSPGs, we only presented the results from MACS-sorted THY1+ and FACS-sorted GFP+ (FOXC2+) uSPGs in the previous manuscript. Following the reviewerâs suggestion, we have included the results derived from FACS sorted THY1+ uSPGs as the control. The overall conclusion is still fully supported by the more comprehensive dataset, i.e. FOXC2+ cells generated significant higher numbers of colonies than THY1+ cells after transplantation (Figure 2D, E).</p>

<p>The authors found FOXC2 is mainly expressed in As of mouse undifferentiated spermatogonia (uSPG). About 60% of As uSPG were FOXC2+ MKI67-, indicating that FOXC2 uSPG were quiescent. Similar spermatogonia (ZBTB16+ FOXC2+ MKI67-) were also found in human testis.</p>
<p>The lineage tracing experiment using Foxc2iCreERT2/+;Rosa26LSL-T/G/LSL-T/G mice demonstrated that all germ cells were derived from the FOXC2+ uSPG. Furthermore, specific ablation of the FOXC2+ uSPGs using Foxc2iCreERT2/+;Rosa26LSL-DTA/+ mice resulted in the depletion of all uSPG population. In the regenerative condition created by busulfan injection, all FOXC2+ uSPG survived and began to proliferate at around 30 days after busulfan injection. The survived FOXC2+ uSPGs generated all germ cells eventually. To examine the role of FOXC2 in the adult testis, spermatogenesis of Foxc2f/-;Ddx4Cre/+ mice was analyzed. From a 2-month-old, the degenerative seminiferous tubules were increased and became Sertoli cell-only seminiferous tubules, indicating FOXC2 is required to maintain normal spermatogenesis in adult testes. To get insight into the role of FOXC2 in the uSPG, CUT&amp;Tag sequencing was performed in sorted FOXC2+ uSPG from Foxc2iCreERT2/+;Rosa26LSL-T/G/LSL-T/G mice 3 days after TAM diet feeding. The results showed some unique biological processes, including negative regulation of the mitotic cell cycle, were enriched, suggesting the FOXC2 maintains a quiescent state in spermatogonia.</p>
<p>Lineage tracing experiments using transgenic mice of the TAM-inducing system was well-designed and demonstrated interesting results. Based on all data presented, the authors concluded that the FOXC2+ uSPG are primitive SSCs, an indispensable subpopulation to maintain adult spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the mouse study is mostly supported by the data presented, but to accept some of the authors' claims needs additional information and explanation. Several terminologies define cell populations used in the paper may mislead readers.</p>
<p>1. &quot;primitive spermatogonial stem cell (SSC)&quot; is confusing. SSCs are considered the most immature subpopulation of uSPG. Thus, primitive uSPGs are likely SSCs. The naming, primitive SSCs, and transit-amplifying SSCs (Figure 7K) are weird. In general, the transit-amplifying cell is progenitor, not stem cell. In human and even mouse, there are several models for the classification of uSPG and SSCs, such as reserved stem cells and active stem cells. The area is highly controversial. The authors' definition of stem cells and progenitor cells should be clarified rigorously and should compare to existing models.</p>

<p>Thanks for your good comments. Considering that our results showed that FOXC2+ SSCs are in a quiescent state and that Mechanistically FOXC2 maintained the quiescent state of SSCs by promoting the expression of negative regulators of cell cycle, we have replaced âprimitive SSCsâ with âquiescent SSCsâ in the revised manuscript. We agree with the reviewer that âtransient amplifying SSCsâ is considered to be âprogenitorsâ, thus we have replaced âtransient amplifying SSCsâ with âprogenitorsâ in the revised manuscript. Furtherï¼from our point of view, the FOXC2+Ki67+ SSCs could be regarded as active stem cells, and the FOXC2+Ki67- SSCs could be regarded as reserved stem cells, although further research evidence is still needed to confirm this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. scRNA seq data analysis and an image of FOXC2+ ZBTB16+ MKI67- cells by fluorescent immunohistochemistry are not sufficient to conclude that they are human primitive SSCs as described in the Abstract. The identity of human SSCs is controversial. Although Adark spermatogonia are a candidate population of human SSCs, the molecular profile of the Adark spermatogonia seems to be heterogeneous. None of the molecular profiles was defined by a specific cell cycle phase. Thus, more rigorous analysis is required to demonstrate the identity of FOXC2+ ZBTB16+ MKI67- cells and Adark spermatogonia.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the identity of human SSCs remain elusive even though Adark population demonstrates certain characteristics of SSCs. To acknowledge this notion, we have revised our conclusion as such that only suggests FOXC2+ZBTB16+MKI67- represents a quiescent state of human SSCs.</p>

<p>1. FACS-sorted GFP+ cells and MACS-THY1 cells were used for functional transplantation assay to evaluate SSC activity. In general, the purity of MACS is significantly lower than that of FACS. Therefore, FACS-sorted THY1 cells must be used for the comparative analysis. As uSPGs in adult testes express THY1, the percentage of GFP+ cells in THY1+ cells determined by flow cytometry is important information to support the transplantation data.</p>

<p>1. The lineage tracing experiments of FOXC2+-SSCs in Foxc2iCreERT2/+;Rosa26LSL-T/G/LSL-T/G showed ~95% of spermatogenic cells and 100% progeny were derived from the FOXC2+ (GFP+) spermatogonia (Figure 2I, J) at month 4 post-TAM induction, although FOXC2+ uSPG were quiescent and a very small subpopulation (~ 60% of As, ~0.03% in all cells). This means that 40% of As spermatogonia and most of Apr/Aal spermatogonia, which were FOXC2 negative, did not contribute to spermatogenesis at all eventually. This is a striking result. There is a possibility that FOXC2CRE expresses more widely in the uSPG population although immunohistochemistry could not detect them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your good comments. From our lineage tracing results, over 95% of the spermatogenic cells are derived from the FOXC2+ SSCs in the testes of 4-month-old mice, which means that FOXC2+ SSCs maintain a long-term stable spermatogenesis. In addition, previous studies have shown that only a portion of As spermatogonia belong to SSCs with complete self-renewal ability (PMID: 28087628, PMID: 25133429), which is consistent with our findings. Therefore, we speculate that 40% of As spermatogonia and most of Apr/Aal spermatogonia, which were FOXC2 negative, did contribute to spermatogenesis but cannot maintain a long-term spermatogenesis due to limited self-renewal ability.</p>

<p>1. The CUT&amp;Tag_FOXC2 analysis on the FACS-sorted FOXC2+ showed functional enrichment in biological processes such as DNA repair and mitotic cell cycle regulation (Figure 7D). The cells sorted were induced Cre recombinase expression by TAM diet and cut the tdTomato cassette out. DNA repair process and negative regulation of the mitotic cell cycle could be induced by the Cre/lox recombination process. The cells analyzed were not FOXC2+ uSPG in a normal physiological state.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do appreciate the reviewerâs concern on the possibility of the functions enriched in the analysis as referred might be derived from Cre/lox recombination. However, we think it is unlikely that the Cre/lox recombination process, supposed to be rather local and specific, can trigger such a systemic and robust response by the DNA damage and cell cycle regulatory pathways. The reasons are as follows: First, as far as we are aware, there has been sufficient data to support this suggested scenario. Second, we did not observe any alteration in either the SSC behaviors or spermatogenesis in general upon the TAM-induced genomic changes, suggesting the impact from the Cre/lox recombination on DNA damage or cell cycle was not significant. Third, no factors associated with the DNA repair process were revealed in the differential analysis of single-cell transcriptomes of FOXC2-WT and FOXC2-KO.</p>

<p>1. Wei et al (Stem Cells Dev 27, 624-636) have published that FOXC2 is expressed predominately in As and Apr spermatogonia and requires self-renewal of mouse SSCs; however, the authors did not mention this study in Introduction, but referred shortly this at the end of Discussion. Their finding should be referred to and evaluated in advance in the Introduction.</p>

<p>Thanks for your good comments. According to your suggestion, we have revised the introduction to refer this latest parallel work on FOXC2. We are happy to see that our discoveries are converged to the important role of FOXC2 in regulating SSCs in adult mammals.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>By popular single-cell RNA-seq, the authors identified FOXC2 as an undifferentiated spermatogonia-specific expressed gene. The FOXC2+-SSCs can sufficiently initiate and sustain spermatogenesis, the ablation of this subgroup results in the depletion of the uSPG pool. The authors provide further evidence to show that this gene is essential for SSCs maintenance by negatively regulating the cell cycle in adult mice, thus well-established FOXC2 as a key regulator of SSCs quiescent state.</p>
<p>The experiments are well-designed and conducted, the overall conclusions are convincing. This work will be of interest to stem cell and reproductive biologists.</p>

<p>The experiments are well-designed and conducted, the overall conclusions are convincing. The only concerns are the writing, especially the introduction which was not well-rationalized. Sounds the three subtypes and three models for SSCs' self-renew are irrelevant to the major points of this manuscript. I don't think you need to talk too much about the markers of SSCs. Instead, I suggest you provide more background about the quiescent or activation states of the SSCs. In addition to that, as a nuclear-localized protein, it cannot be used to flow cytometric sorting, I don't think it should be emphasized as a marker. You identified a key transcription factor for maintaining the quiescent state of the primitive SSCs, that's quite important!</p>

<p>Appreciate the positive feedback and constructive suggestions on the writing. We have substantially revised our manuscript to include the relevant advances and understanding from the field as well as highlight the importance of FOXC2 in regulating the quiescent state of SSCs.</p>
