<title>Abstract</title><p>The external granule layer (EGL) is a transient proliferative layer that gives rise to cerebellar granule cell neurons. Extensive EGL proliferation characterises the foliated structure of amniote cerebella, but the factors that regulate EGL formation, amplification within it, and differentiation from it, are incompletely understood. Here, we characterise bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling during cerebellar development in chick and human and show that while in chick BMP signalling correlates with external granule layer formation, in humans BMP signalling is maintained throughout the external granule layer after the onset of foliation. We also show via Immunohistochemical labelling of phosphorylated Smad1/5/9 the comparative spatiotemporal activity of BMP signalling in chick and human. Using <italic>in-ovo</italic> electroporation in chick, we demonstrate that BMP signalling is necessary for subpial migration of granule cell precursors and hence the formation of the external granule layer (EGL) prior to transit amplification. However, altering BMP signalling does not block the formation of mature granule neurons but significantly disrupts that pattern of morphological transitions that accompany transit amplification. Our results elucidate two key, temporally distinct roles for BMP signalling <italic>in vivo</italic> in organising first the assembly of the EGL from the rhombic lip and subsequently the tempo of granule neuron production within the EGL.</p>

<title>Significance statement</title>
<p>Improper development of cerebellar granule neurons can manifest in a plethora of neurodevelopmental disorders, including but not limited to medulloblastoma and autism. Many studies have sought to understand the role of developmental signalling pathways in granule cell neurogenesis, using genetic manipulation in transgenic mice. To complement these insights, we have used comparative assessment of BMP signalling during development in chick and human embryos and <italic>in vivo</italic> manipulation of the chick to understand and segregate the spatiotemporal roles of BMP signalling, yielding important insights on evolution and in consideration of future therapeutic avenues that target BMP signalling.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transit amplification of progenitor cells expands progenitor pools by successive rounds of symmetrical division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fujita, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Espinosa &amp; Luo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Legue <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Legue <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). This allows for rapid assembly of large neural structures in development and is thought to be key for evolutionary adaptation in the development of complex neural circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Borrell &amp; Gotz, 2014</xref>). In both the neocortex and cerebellum, elaboration of specialised, transient laminae supporting transit amplification is associated with increased foliation and complexity. Specialised sub-ventricular cell types which are either diminished or absent in mice, are expanded in the human cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hansen <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Heide &amp; Huttner, 2021</xref>) and, as recently shown in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Haldipur <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), uniquely characterise the progenitor zone of glutamatergic neurons in the cerebellum: the rhombic lip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wingate &amp; Hatten, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Like the cortical subventricular zone, the cerebellar EGL is a site of transient, transit amplification, but only for a single cell type: the glutamatergic cerebellar granule neuron. After migrating from the rhombic lip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wingate &amp; Hatten, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wingate, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Machold &amp; Fishell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) granule progenitors accumulate within the EGL and undergo multiple rounds of symmetric division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Espinosa &amp; Luo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Legue <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), driven by Purkinje cell derived Sonic hedgehog (Shh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dahmane &amp; Altaba, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wallace, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wechsler-Reya &amp; Scott, 1999</xref>) before exiting the cell cycle. Granule cells then transition through a range of morphologies in the outer, middle, and inner EGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hanzel <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), before undergoing radial migration into the internal granule layer (IGL) and extending characteristic T-shaped axons into a now largely cell body-free molecular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cajal, 1890</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">1911</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Leto <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hanzel <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Well-characterised molecular cues guide migration of differentiating granule precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hatten &amp; Heintz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chedotal, 2010</xref>), however regulation of the precise tempo and timing of events is poorly understood.</p>
<p>This current study is prompted by somewhat contradictory observations that urge a clarification of the different roles of Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) signalling <italic>in vivo</italic> at the key points of granule cell specification, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. This is important for not only understanding normal cerebellar development but also the origins of medulloblastoma, a devastating childhood brain tumour which traces its cells of origin to both the rhombic lip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hendrikse <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) and EGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Millard &amp; De Braganca, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Firstly, is BMP acutely required for granule cell precursor specification? Early in cerebellar development, a combination of BMP and Delta/Notch signalling is required to specify the rhombic lip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Machold <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Broom <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), which will then give rise to granule precursors. Correspondingly, exogenous BMP can induce granule cell fate in uncommitted progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alder <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alder <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). However, granule cell specification is not blocked when BMP signalling is attenuated in various transgenic mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Qin <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fernandes <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tong &amp; Kwan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Owa <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Resolving this paradox is important given the recent discovery that the rhombic lip is the origin of the most common Group3 and 4 medulloblastomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hendrikse <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Phoenix, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Williamson <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Secondly, what is the role of BMP in EGL assembly and proliferation? Once granule cell progenitors have assembled an EGL, BMP can act to both suppress proliferation and promote differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ayrault <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>) through its ability to antagonise Shh signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rios <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Upregulation of Shh-dependent granule cell proliferation results in a larger cerebellum experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Corrales <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) and is associated with a specific group of SHH medulloblastomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pietsch <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Raffel <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Vorechovsky <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dahmane &amp; Altaba, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wallace, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wechsler-Reya &amp; Scott, 1999</xref>). However, while BMP has therefore been invoked as a potential treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), the same conditional deletions of BMP pathway elements that fail to block early granule cell specification at the rhombic lip do not result in a larger cerebellum as might be expected, but either have no affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tong &amp; Kwan, 2013</xref>) or generate an EGL that is either smaller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Qin <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fernandes <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>) or disorganised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Owa <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>To address these two questions, we designed experiments to precisely manipulate BMP levels during cerebellum development. We show that BMP signalling has distinct and dynamic activity throughout granule cell development in both human and avian models. Experimental inhibition or activation of receptor pathways show that granule cell precursors do not require BMP for their induction, but that their subpial migration to form an EGL and how long they populate the EGL before migrating into the internal granule cell layer is dependent on appropriate BMP signalling. Our human data reveal modifications to the spatiotemporal dynamics of BMP signalling in development that suggest a role in in sustaining the EGL over protracted development of the human cerebellum.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3">
<title>Results</title>
<p>We first assessed BMP signalling activity during EGL formation and cerebellar foliation in human and chick. We then took advantage of the ability to experimentally manipulate BMP signalling in a targeted manner in the developing avian cerebellum monitoring both the formation of the EGL and an internal granule cell layer.</p>
<p>Changes in BMP signalling in the EGL of the chick correlate with foliation.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows the comparative timeline of morphological development in the chick, mouse, and human cerebellum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), and the planes of sectioning used in this study (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B</xref>). For more in depth comparison between mouse and human, we refer the reader to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Haldipur <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). We monitored BMP signalling by assessing the phosphorylation of the highly conserved serine residues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>) of Smad proteins using an antibody against the phosphorylated forms of Smads 1, 5, and 9 (collectively; pSmad) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andrews <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Owa <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Najas <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). We confirmed that the residues of Smads 1, 5 and 9 that undergo phosphorylation to activated BMP signalling are highly conserved (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>). In chick, at embryonic day 5 (E5), pSmad expression is limited to cells proximal to the interface between the neurogenic neuroepithelium and the non-neurogenic roof plate, the rhombic lip (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>). The expression of pSmad is uniform throughout the EGL during its formation beneath the pial surface of the cerebellum through to E8 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2C</xref>). The expression of pSmad then decreases in the EGL as the cerebellum begins to form folia from E10 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2D</xref>). This is complemented by an increase in expression within the IGL. By E14, expression of pSmad is seen in only a small number of EGL granule cell precursors at the crests of folia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2E</xref>) and is entirely absent from the EGL in the fissures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2F</xref>). A corresponding pattern of maturation is visible in Calbindin-positive Purkinje cells, which display a mature monolayer at the folia troughs and a deep Purkinje cell layer (PCL) that is 3-4 cells deep at the folia crests. The distribution of pSMAD was quantified in the EGL, PCL and IGL (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2G</xref>) relative to folia morphology showing that a varying pattern of expression between tips and troughs is shown only in the EGL (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2G</xref>) as summarised in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2H</xref>. Correspondingly, <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridisation for BMP ligands <italic>Bmp2</italic> and <italic>Bmp4</italic> and receptors <italic>BmpR1a</italic> and <italic>BmpR1b</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2I</xref>) reveals strong expression in the EGL at E10. By E14, BMP expression appears stronger in the folia crests. Similarly, BMP receptors <italic>BmpRIa</italic> and <italic>BmpR1b</italic> also show uniform expression throughout the EGL at E10 but are upregulated within the folia crests at E14.</p>

In the mouse (green), granule cells are derived from embryonic day 12 (E12), are proliferative by E15 with foliation beginning around E19 and continuing until postnatal day 19 (P19). In humans (pink), granule cells start to be generated around 9 post-conception weeks (9PCW), with the cerebella foliation starting between 13-17PCW and continuing until around 8 months (8 mth) postnatally.

<p>To see whether this pattern of signalling is conserved, we assessed pSmad expression during corresponding stages of development in the human embryo.

Expression is also seen in a deeper layer corresponding to the PCL (Fig.3B’ and C’) and IGL Fig.3B’’ and C’’). At 19 pcw (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3D</xref>), the cerebellum has pronounced folia. The expression pSmad remains uniform across the EGL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-F</xref>). The expression of pSmad within the presumptive PCL and IIL is also uniform within cells at crests (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3E</xref>) and troughs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3F</xref>) But with a pronounced thickening of all layers at the base of each folium.</p>

<caption><title>Characterisation of BMP activity, Purkinje cell development and Shh signalling during human cerebellar development.</title>
<p>BMP signalling, here determined by pSmad expression, is observed throughout the 13 pcw human cerebellum (A, n=2) folia crests (B) and fissures (C). BMP activity in the 19 pcw human cerebellum (D, n=2) is observed in the EGL of the folia crests (E) and to a lesser extent in the EGL of the fissures (F). Calbindin expression in the 13 pcw cerebellum (D) folia crests (E) and fissures (F) shows the early migration of Purkinje cell precursors. Calbindin expression in the 19 pcw cerebellum (J) shows a less organised Purkinje cell layer in the folia crests (K) when compared to the fissures (L).

<p>The differences in layer thickness are mirrored by Calbindin staining for Purkinje cells. At 13pcw (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3G</xref>), Purkinje cells are relatively sparsely distributed at a folium crest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3H</xref>) versus trough (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3I</xref>). At 19 pcw (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3J</xref>), the lower density of Purkinje cells at crest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3K</xref>) versus trough (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3L</xref>) is pronounced. The relative numbers of Purkinje cells across folia at each age are quantified in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3M</xref>. As in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lewis <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sudarov &amp; Joyner, 2007</xref>) and chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dahmane &amp; Altaba, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rios <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), the initiation of foliation is coincident with the onset of SHH expression in developing Purkinje neurons. An EGL is apparent in the developing human embryo by 10pcw (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3N</xref>) as a distinctive sub-pial layer of proliferating cells which express the interphase marker, MKi67. There is no expression of Shh in the PCL although expression of PTCH1 in the EGL indicates that granule cell precursors are transducing a Shh signal, possibly from cerebrospinal fluid. At 12 pcw (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3O</xref>), foliation has commenced and Shh is now strongly expressed in the PCL. Both Purkinje cells and proliferative EGL precursors express PTCH1.</p>
<p>These results show that BMP signalling is occurring in the developing EGL and other cell layers within the cerebellum in both chick and human. BMP signal transduction characterises both Purkinje cells and proliferating granule cell precursors and is sustained in human (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3D-F</xref>) compared to chick (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2E</xref>). Given its proposed role in antagonising Shh responses, we next chose to investigate how BMPs influence EGL maturation.</p>

<title>BMP signalling is required for the assembly of the EGL via pial recruitment of granule cell precursors</title>
<p>We investigated the role of BMP signalling in the EGL using electroporation of DNA constructs in chick at the rhombic lip at E4 to selectively target the granule cell precursors. We sought to knock down BMP responses in cells by overexpressing the negative intracellular BMP regulator <italic>Smad6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xie <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). By contrast, we aimed to upregulate BMP responses by overexpressing the constitutively active BMP regulator <italic>Smad1EVE</italic>, which is a variant of the transcription factor <italic>Smad1</italic> where the N-terminal SVS residue that is phosphorylated during activation is mutated to EVE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fuentealba <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Song <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>We first confirmed that our constructs were able to affect BMP signal transduction in a predictable manner by characterising the expression of pSmad two days after overexpression at E3 of the control, Smad1EVE, and Smad6 constructs. In all cases, Smad constructs were co-electroporated with a ‘control’ plasmid encoding a fluorescent reporter protein tdTomato or GFP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A</xref>). Cells were characterised by their expression of GFP and/or pSMAD and the fractions of each quantified following a series of electroporations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4B</xref>). As expected, pSmad expression was either unchanged (control), upregulated in a cell autonomous manner (Smad1EVE) or abolished (Smad6), respectively.</p>

<p>Electroporation of a control tdTomato construct into the cerebellar rhombic lip at E4 results in the labelling of the assembling EGL at E7 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4C</xref>). Upregulation of BMP signal transduction by overexpression of Smad1EVE at E4 resulted in tangential migration of EGL cells in a subpial pattern as seen in control electroporations, albeit with a partial depletion of the EGL distal to the rhombic lip (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4D</xref>). By contrast, the superficial subpial layer was heavily depleted of all cells (by DAPI label) following inhibition of BMP signal transduction by overexpression of Smad6 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). This is the location that a granule precursor-rich EGL would be expected to form. The cell free zone was invaded by axonal processes in a manner that is reminiscent of the adult molecular layer and the entire cell-depleted zone was co-extensive with the anteroposterior breadth of the cerebellum (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4E</xref>).</p>

<p>We next assessed the progression of granule cell morphologies as they mature from the EGL and migrate into the IGL by electroporating tdTomato into the rhombic lip at E4 and examining the cerebellum at E7 and E14. At E7, within the EGL, granule cell precursors exhibit a variety of morphologies consistent with both proliferation and tangential migration of bipolar or unipolar precursors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5C</xref> and C’). At this stage, there is no radial migration of granule cells, and the IGL has yet to form. At subsequent stages, the presumed dilution of cellular plasmid concentration through successive rounds of division after electroporation led to a depletion of label within the EGL (data not shown). Therefore, to examine granule cell morphological maturation we used the Tol2 transposon system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sato <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) to indelibly label granule cell progenitors and their progeny in a mosaic fashion by electroporation of the neural tube at E2. Using this approach, we could visualise mature granule cells with T-shaped axons at E14, within the IGL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>’).</p>
<p>We then asked whether the normal progression of cellular maturation was altered by manipulation of BMP signalling. Overexpression of the constitutively active BMP receptor Smad1EVE within the EGL produced a normal range of cell morphologies at E7 (see Fig.5E’ cells 1-9), interspersed with more mature granule neuron morphologies labelled cells deep to the EGL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5E</xref> cells 10-15), not normally seen at this age (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">C</xref>’). This was consistent with a subset of granule cell progenitors differentiating prematurely into IGL neurons. Overexpression of Smad6 at E4, which results in a loss of EGL (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>), resulted in a population of uniformly mature granule cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5F</xref>) at E7 suggesting that cells generated at the rhombic lip (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5A</xref>), in the absence of transit amplification, develop prematurely into definitive granule neurons. Furthermore, the normal transverse parallel alignment of axons is perturbed such that normally transversely orientated T-shaped axons are visible in the sagittal sections (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). These results indicate that while altered BMP signalling does not affect the specification of granule cells, it impacts tangential migration, the formation of the EGL, and the timing of differentiation and the precision of axonogenesis, consistent with a role in regulation of the tempo of granule cell maturation.</p>

<p>(A) Proliferation, determined by immunolabelling of PH3, at the pial surface greatly increases between E7 and E8, which coincides with the onset of Shh signalling at E8, as determined by expression of Ptch1 mRNA (B). The nuclei density within the EGL (C) significantly increases between E7 and E8, as determined by the number of DAPI-positive nuclei per 20µm bin of the EGL (n=6 bins per sample from n=7 for E7 and n=7 for E8; p&lt;0.0001, mean ± SEM = 30.37 ± 3.556). Quantification of PH3 immunolabelling (D) of the whole-mounted cerebella (A) shows that there is a significant increase in proliferative activity between E7 and E8 (p=0.0465, mean ± SEM = 0.0005322 ± 0.0002344; n=6 for both E7 and E8). In a control cerebellum electroporated with tdTomato at E4 and sagittally sectioned at E8 (E; n=3), granule cell precursors still exhibit migrating or proliferative morphologies (F). In embryos electroporated at E4 with Smad1 and sectioned sagittally at E8 (G; n=4), an anterior-posterior gradient of EGL loss is observed, with a molecular layer forming in place of the EGL (G’), within which fibres can be seen extending (Smad1, cyan) and sparse DAPI labelling.

<p>Upregulation of BMP signal transduction at E4 results in accelerated granule cell development and a partial loss of the EGL at E7 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4D</xref>), consistent with the increase in mature cell morphologies observed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5E</xref>). Examining the results of the same manipulation a day later at E8, we find that the EGL is completely depleted of cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6G</xref>). At high magnification, the EGL has been replaced by a largely cell-free superficial layer containing GFP labelled processes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6G</xref>’). Reconstruction of the morphology of single labelled cells reveals that they bear the hallmarks of mature granule cell morphology: a cell body within the inner granule layer and a T-shaped axon (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5D</xref>’). Thus, BMP upregulation results in the depletion of a short-lived EGL to produce a cell-free superficial layer that is reminiscent of an adult molecular layer. The extent of this loss is comparable to that seen when BMP is down regulated in a cell-autonomous manner (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4E</xref>), where, by contrast, the formation of an EGL is inhibited. Quantification of EGL cell density at E7 and E8 following electroporation at E4 shows that both upregulation and downregulation of cell autonomous BMP signal transduction results in a similar loss of cell density in EGL at E8 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6I</xref>).</p>

<title>Granule cells respond to changes in BMP signalling in a cell-autonomous manner</title>
<p>To assess whether the effects of the manipulations of BMP signalling by electroporation are cell autonomous, we devised a strategy to label control and cells with altered BMP signalling side by side in the same embryo. Embryos were electroporated at E2 with tol2::gfp and tol2-transpose, which results in an indelible fluorescent label of cells that take up both plasmids. The same embryos were then electroporated again at E4 at the rhombic lip with either a control plasmid expressing tomato (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7A-C</xref>), or a control plasmid in conjunction with the inhibitory Smad6 construct (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7D</xref>). This approach was expected to label a large cohort of rhombic lip derived cells that were electroporated at E2 with the control tol2-gfp construct, but only a subset of later-targeted (E4) rhombic lip derived cells due to the expansion in size of the cerebellum. Accordingly, at E7 in sagittal section, whereas E2 GFP-labelled cells fill the cerebellum, E4 tomato co-labelled migratory rhombic lip derivatives are restricted to sub-pial stream (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7B</xref>), within the nuclear transitory zone (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7B</xref>’) and within the nascent EGL (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7B</xref>’’). In the latter, tangentially migrating EGL cells are visible that are either labelled only by the e2 electroporation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7C</xref>, left arrow), or else double labelled (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7C</xref>, right arrow). To assess the effect of BMP signal downregulation, a second group of embryos were electroporated at E4 at the rhombic lip with a combination of tomato and Smad6. This allowed us to distinguish, in sagittal section, cell autonomous and non-autonomous effects of the inhibition of BMP signal transduction (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7D</xref>). Cells expressing GFP only (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7D</xref>’) are distributed throughout cerebellar layers including the superficial, sub-pial migratory layer. By contrast, cells expressing tomato (and hence Smad6) were excluded from this layer (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7D</xref>’’) Reconstruction of cells labelled with GFP only in the sub-pial layer showed unipolar or bipolar cell morphologies consistent with tangential migration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7D</xref>’: red, green, and purple arrows).

<p>In this study we examined the phosphorylation of SMAD during cerebellar development of chick and human revealing contrasting patterns of BMP signalling in the EGL. These findings are summarised in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>. In chick, the cell-autonomous manipulation of BMP signalling revealed that BMP is required for the sub-pial migration of granule cells and regulates the tempo of maturation in the EGL. Downregulation of BMP signal transduction drives granule cells directly into the internal granule cell layer. Upregulation of BMP accelerates the maturation of granule cells in the EGL. Both manipulations thus result in the precocious appearance of post-mitotic granule cell T-shaped axons.\</p>

<caption><title>Tightly regulated spatiotemporal activity of the BMP signalling pathway is required for proper development of the external granule layer.</title>
<p>In control cerebella, granule cell precursors (grey circles) migrate tangentially from the rhombic lip (rl) across the pial surface to form the external granule layer (blue), where they undergo massive transit amplification before they exit the cell cycle, differentiate, and migrate radially towards the inner granule layer, eventually leaving behind a molecular layer (pink) in which their parallel fibres extend. In cerebella with increased levels of BMP signalling (Smad1, BMP ↑), granule cells are initially recruited to the pial surface, however coinciding with the onset of Shh at E8 (in chick), the excess of BMP signalling forces granule cells to exit the cell cycle prematurely and migrate, leaving behind a molecular layer and a depleted cerebellum. Following inhibition of BMP signalling at the rhombic lip (Smad6, BMP ↓) cells fail to be recruited to the pial surface, and instead immediately migrate ventrally and radially, before extending parallel fibres in a disorganised arrangement into the molecular layer that forms at the pial surface.</p></caption>

<title>Granule cell production is independent of both BMP signalling at the rhombic lip</title>
<p>Our observation that granule cell precursors are produced at the rhombic lip regardless of cell autonomous disruption of BMP signalling appears to contradict the prevailing model of cerebellar development: that BMP secreted by the roof plate cells induces rhombic lip. BMP is not only appropriately expressed in cells adjacent to the rhombic lip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Campo-Paysaa et al., 2019</xref>), but addition of BMP to a culture of cells from embryonic rostral hindbrain can also induce granule cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alder <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). This apparent discrepancy can be resolved in a model where BMP signalling is required at early stages to dorsalise the neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alder <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>), but not acutely to produce rhombic lip derivatives. By contrast, induction of rhombic lip derivatives relies on acute notch mediated cell-cell interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Machold <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Broom <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>) between neural progenitors and closely apposed non-neural cells which express BMP, at the edge of the roof plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Campo-Paysaa <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Thus, rhombic lip derivatives can be generated in conditional mouse mutants that interrupt the BMP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Qin <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fernandes <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tong &amp; Kwan, 2013</xref>) but not in conditions where the early dorsalisation of the neural tube is blocked.</p>

<title>Granule cell production can be independent of the formation of an EGL</title>
<p>It has long been presumed that granule cell morphology Is a product of the intricate step-wise developmental choreography within the EGL described by Cajal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cajal, 1894</xref>). In this scheme, T-shape axons are formed as cells first exit the cell cycle in the EGL and then both extend and anchor postmitotic granule neurons as they migrate radially into the IGL. However, the presumed, obligate sequential steps of granule cell maturation have been questioned by recent studies. Not only are the early sequence of events in maturation occasionally reversed in chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hanzel <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), but the granule cell layer can be replenished in the absence of an EGL in regenerating mouse cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wojcinski <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Similarly, our results show that in conditions of attenuated BMP signalling, post-mitotic granule cells develop directly from the rhombic lip, bypassing the formation of a transient amplifying layer (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8</xref>).This is identical to the effects of overexpression of NeuroD1 at the rhombic lip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Butts <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hanzel <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) and mimics the direct development of granule cells in fish, which lack an EGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gona, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chaplin <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Butts <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). These collected observations argue that the EGL is not necessary for granule cell production but is rather an adaptation related to efficiently organising proliferation (both expanding the number and duration of granule cell production) and dispersal of granule cell during the development of amniote cerebella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chaplin <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>BMP signalling regulates the tempo of granule cell maturation in the EGL</title>
<p>Whereas the down regulation of BMP signal transduction suppresses EGL formation, constitutive upregulation appears to shorten the duration of granule cell transit amplification (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8</xref>), such that the EGL is rapidly depleted of cells by E8. The resulting cell free layer is filled with granule cell axons, consistent with the precocious transition of the EGL into a molecular layer that normally appears at E15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bastianelli, 2003</xref>). This corresponds with <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence showing that, in culture, terminal divisions are promoted in granule cell precursors when proliferation rates are upregulated by Shh in a background of constitutively raised BMP signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rios <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). These observations are consistent with a model whereby BMP promotes neurogenic divisions at the expense of self-renewing, transit amplification divisions that characterise the EGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nakashima <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), reviewed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Le Dreau, 2021</xref>). A similar role for BMP signalling appears to drive terminal differentiation and radial migration of upper layer cortical progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Saxena <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>) . As in the cerebellum, the proliferation of transit amplifying cortical glutamatergic progenitors in the cortex is also enhanced in conditions of raised Shh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Thus, BMP antagonism of Shh-driven proliferation may be a general mechanism for regulating terminal differentiation in large neuronal populations in the amniote brain.</p>

<title>BMP signalling as a regulator of the lifespan of the transient EGL</title>
<p>Human cerebellum development is notable for the extremely extended duration of transient amplification in the EGL that lasts over a period of months from 30 days post-conception until two years after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">van Essen <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). This is supported developmentally by the adaptation of the rhombic lip to adopt a subventricular zone (SVZ) that presumably facilitates an extended production of rhombic lip derived progenitors (Haldipur <italic>et al</italic>., 2019), and alteration of transcription factor expression that extends their developmental lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Behesti <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Our results show that BMP signalling in the EGL of the human embryo shows a remarkably uniform distribution that is independent of morphogenic patterns of foliation that correlate to BMP signal variation in the developing chick cerebellum. In the chick, uniform BMP signalling is a hallmark of the early developing EGL. By contrast, in the mouse, BMP upregulation corresponds to the disappearance of the transient EGL (Owa <italic>et al</italic>., 2018). These collected observations suggest that it is the balance of BMP signalling against a background of proliferation that modulates the rates of areal expansion (in foliation) or extinction of the EGL, presumably through regulating the balance of self-renewing versus terminal divisions. In humans, a uniform BMP expression speaks to regulation of a signal that maintains proliferation throughout morphogenic foliation without triggering a depletion of the EGL.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Overall, our results show a central role for BMPs in the formation of the EGL but also show how a balance of BMP signalling regulates the balance of the neurogenic versus self-renewing divisions within the EGL. BMPs are not required acutely for granule cell specification per se, but the scale of granule cell production is intimately dependent on the role of BMP in both forming and then maintaining the transient, transit amplifying EGL. This has implications for understanding the origin and possible treatments of medulloblastoma, where exogenous BMPs that might be effective against SHH-type would not ameliorate the predominant Group 3 and 4 rhombic-lip-derived tumours. In normal development, sustained BMP signalling within the EGL may play an important role in sustaining transit amplification over the protracted developmental time course of the human cerebellum.</p>

<p>Fertilised hen’s eggs (Henry Stewart) were incubated at 38°C at 70% humidity. Electroporations were performed between stages HH10-25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hamburger &amp; Hamilton, 1993</xref>), or between embryonic day 2 (E2) to E4. Eggs were windowed using sharp surgical scissors and the vitelline membrane covering the head removed. DNA was injected into the fourth ventricle at a final concentration of 1-3 µg/µl in addition to trace amounts of fast-green dye (Sigma). Three 50ms square waveform electrical pulses at 5V (E2) or 10V (≥E3) were passed between electrodes that were placed on either side of the hindbrain <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Five drops of Tyrode’s solution containing penicillin and streptomycin (Sigma) was administered on top of the yolk before being resealed and further incubated for the designated number of days. Embryos were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C and then processed for histology. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarises the DNA plasmid constructs used throughout this study.</p>

<p>Cerebella were dissected between E5-E14 and either whole-mounted in glycerol or embedded in 20% gelatine, 4% low-melting point (LMP) agarose or OCT and sectioned at 50µm using a vibratome (Leica) or at 15µm using a cryostat (Microm). For immunolabelling, whole-mount and gelatine sections were washed with PxDA (1x PBS, 0.1% Tween-20, 5% DMSO, 0.02% NaN3), then 3x 30 minutes, blocked (PxDA, 10% goat serum) 2x 1 hour, and incubated in primary antibody (diluted in block) for 48 hours at 4°C on a rocker. Tissue was washed in block for 5 mins then 3x 1 hour. Secondary Alexaflour (Thermofisher) antibodies were diluted in block (1:500) and incubated overnight at 4°C. Samples were washed 3x 1 hour with block, 3x 3 mins with PxDA and 1 hour in 4% PFA. Sections were mounted using Fluoroshield containing DAPI (Abcam). Frozen sections were thawed at room temperature for 1 hour, washed in 1x TBS buffer (2% BSA, 1x TBS, 0.02% NaN3, pH7.6), blocked in 1x TBS buffer for 10 minutes, and incubated in primary (diluted in 1x TBS) overnight at room temperate in a humidity chamber. Slides were washed in 500ml 1x TBS for 10 minutes (with stirring), then incubated in secondary antibody (biotinylated for DAB staining (1:300) or Alexaflour for fluorescence (1:500; diluted in 1x TBS) for 1 hour at room temperature. For DAB staining, The Strept ABC-HRP (1:100 of each A and B in 1x DAB developing buffer) was left to conjugate for 30 mins. Slides were rinsed in 1x TBS and then incubated in the conjugated Strept ABC-HRP solution for 30 minutes. Slides were rinsed in 500ml 1x TBS for 5 minutes, with stirring, and then developed for 10 minutes in DAB solution (DAKO DAB enhancer was used for pSmad1/5/9 at 1:300).

<title>Image analysis</title>
<p>Sections with fluorescent labelling were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope and Z-projections compiled with ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012). Non-fluorescent samples were imaged using a Zeiss Axioscope microscope. To represent the pial migration from the rhombic lip (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>, b) the fluorescence intensity, termed “gray value” in ImageJ, from the rhombic lip towards the midline in an area of abundant electroporation (coloured lines; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>), was plotted as a surface histogram, obtained from the plot profile plugin and a curve of best fit (5th degree polynominal). ImageJ was also used to quantify the number of antigen-expressing cells per area (+ve cells/μm); cells positive for pSmad labelling were manually counted using the cell counter plugin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>) whereas quantification of PH3 labelling (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a,d</xref>) was done automatically by converting a compressed Z-stack to a binary image, watershed function applied and the analyse particles plugin applied to count positive cells in the sample. The area of the tissue being quantified was also measured in ImageJ and the number of +ve positive nuclei per µm was then calculated in Excel and analysed for significance in GraphPad Prism. To measure the density of DAPI +ve nuclei at the pial surface in electroporated samples (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6i</xref>), individual slices from Z-stacks of each sample were processed to binary images, and a line was drawn across the pia in ImageJ and the fluorescent density averaged across this line using the plot profile plugin. To analyse the maturity of the PCL, the number of cells in each dorsal-ventral column of the PCL in the folia vs. troughs were averaged across n=4 (E13 chick) and n=1 (pcw19 human) sections.</p>

<p>This study investigates BMP signaling mechanisms in the developing chick cerebellum to better understand germinal layer formation, cellular amplification and neuronal differentiation. The data from human tissue is <bold>compelling</bold> and lends support to the possible links of these processes to medulloblastoma, although this study does raise exciting questions regarding the generalized role of BMP signaling during normal development and malignant growth. Overall, this is an <bold>important</bold> study with beautifully presented findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Rook et al examined the role of BMP signaling in cerebellum development, using chick as a model alongside human tissue samples. They first examined p-SMADs and found differences between the species, with human samples retaining high p-SMAD after foliation, while in chick, BMP signaling appears to decrease following foliation. To understand the role of BMP during early development, they then used early chick embryos to modulate BMP, using either a constitutively active BMP regulator to increase BMP signaling or overexpressing the negative intracellular BMP regulator to decrease BMP signaling. After validating the constructs in ovo, the authors then examined GNP morphology and migration. They then determined whether the effects were cell autonomous.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments were well-designed and well-controlled. The figures were extremely clear and convincing, and the accompanying drawings help orient the reader to easily understand the experimental set up. These studies also help clarify the role of BMP at different stages of cerebellum development, suggesting early BMP signaling is required for dorsalization, not rhombic lip induction, and that later BMP signaling is needed to regulate the timing of migration and maturation of granule neurons.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While these studies certainly hint that BMP modulation may affect tumor growth, this was not explicitly tested here. Future studies are required to generalize the functional role of BMP signaling in normal cerebellum development to malignant growth.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a fundamental and elegant study showing the role of BMP signaling in cerebellar development. This is an important question because there are multiple diseases, including aggressive childhood cancers, which involve granule cell precursors. Thus understanding of the factors that govern the formation of the granule cell layer is important both from a basic science and a disease perspective.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript is clear and well-written. The figures are extremely clear, wonderfully informative, and overall quite beautiful.</p>
<p>Figures 1-3 show the experimental design and report how BMP activity is altered over development in both the chick and the human developing cerebellum. Both data is very impressive and convincing.</p>
<p>They then go on to modulate BMP activity in the developing chick, using a complex electroporation paradigm that allows them to label cells with GFP as well as with cell-specific reporters of BMP activity levels. They bidirectionally modulate BMP levels and then can look at both cell-specific and non-specific alterations in the formation of the external and internal granule cell layer, across different developmental timepoints. These are really elegant and rigorous experiments, as they look at both sagittal and transverse sections to collect this data. This makes the data extremely compelling. With these rigorous techniques, they show that BMP signaling serves more than one function across development: it is involved in the initial tangential migration from the rhombic lip, but at a later time, both up- and down-regulation of BMP activity reduces density of amplifying cells in the external granule cell layer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, I think the paper is interesting and important and the data is strong. The use of both chick and human tissue strengthens the findings. They are extremely rigorous, analyzing data from multiple planes at multiple ages, which also really strengthens their findings. The dual electroporation approach is extremely elegant, providing beautiful visual representations of their findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I find no significant weaknesses.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1.1) I thought the manuscript was very clear. While I realize the authors included the reference to medulloblastoma in the introduction based on previous reviewer comments, I think this speculation is better left in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Whilst we appreciate the reviewers feedback here, we felt it was important to include a reference to medulloblastoma and developmental disorders associated with the cerebellum to put this work into a broader context.</p>
<p>We removed the sentence “Medulloblastoma can be a consequence of uncontrolled proliferation of granule cell progenitors, with BMP overexpression being a potential therapeutic avenue to inhibit this proliferation” to limit the speculation in this statement.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.2) line 81: It would be better to cite the 2 original papers (Hendrikes et al 2022, Smith et al 2022) rather than the Phoenix commentary article. I'm not sure the Phoenix article needs to be cited at all within this paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have cited the two suggested papers and removed the citation to Phoenix et al.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.3) line 102: confusing sentence with the unexpected separation of do and not: &quot;the same conditional deletions of BMP pathway elements that fail to block early granule cell specification at the rhombic lip do result not in a larger cerebellum as might be expected, but either have no affect&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this error and have corrected the text to “do not result in a larger cerebellum”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.4) line 133: inconsistent acronyms (for example, W9 vs pcw9).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This has been corrected to PCW in all occurrences.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.5) line 139: coronal vs transverse? it seems like you show transverse sectioning but refer to it as coronal in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this and have corrected the text to “transverse”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.6) fig 2C: would it be possible to provide a similar inset as 2D?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have added the insets in 2C. We agree that this is now clearer and more consistent with the rest of the figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.7) line 368/369/435/436 missing arrows.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The arrows have been re-added- it appears that they did not show up on the uploaded PDF.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>(2.1) Fig. 3 M Why are there asterisks both above and below the brackets?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This was a formatting error that has now been corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2.2) Fig. 8. The arrows (BMP up and BMP down) are touching the right &quot;)&quot; in the figure, which makes it hard to read.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This was also a formatting issue which has been corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2.3) Fig. 4 and 8 legends. There are spaces in the text which I believe are for arrows to be inserted &quot;(BMP )&quot;, but the arrows have been omitted in the PDF that I read.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is the same as reviewer 1’s comment- these have been re-added to the text and appears to have been an issue with the PDF upload.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2.4) Fig. 3 legend gets very hard to read at the end, where it seems some punctuation is missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have re-worded the legend for Fig. 3 to make it easier to read.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2.5) Significant figures in some of the text are probably too much given the accuracy at which they can be measured with.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concerns here, however these were added in response to the original reviewer’s request to “provide some additional support to otherwise qualitative observations”.</p>
