<title>Abstract</title><p>The hippocampus is a complex structure critically involved in numerous behavior-regulating systems. In young adults, multiple overlapping spatial modes along its longitudinal and transverse axes describe the organization of its functional integration with neocortex, extending the traditional framework emphasizing functional differences between sharply segregated hippocampal subregions. Yet, it remains unknown whether these modes (i.e., gradients) persist across the adult human lifespan, and relate to memory and molecular markers associated with brain function and cognition. In two independent samples, we demonstrate that the principal anteroposterior and second-order, mid-to-anterior/posterior hippocampal modes of neocortical functional connectivity, representing distinct dimensions of macroscale cortical organization, manifest across the adult lifespan. Specifically, individual differences in topography of the second-order gradient predicted episodic memory and mirrored dopamine D1 receptor distribution, capturing shared functional and molecular organization. Older age was associated with less distinct transitions along gradients (i.e., increased functional homogeneity). Importantly, a youth-like gradient profile predicted preserved episodic memory – emphasizing age-related gradient dedifferentiation as a marker of cognitive decline. Our results underscore a critical role of mapping multidimensional hippocampal organization in understanding the neural circuits that support memory across the adult lifespan.</p>

<p>The hippocampus plays a critical role in human behavior beyond its well-established involvement in memory and spatial navigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Contemporary views hold that its broad involvement in cognition emerges through the combination of its intrinsic circuitry and its widespread neocortical connections – placing it at the interface of multiple behavioral systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Characterizing organizational principles of hippocampal integration with the larger neocortical landscape is therefore key to our understanding of its contribution to cognition and to the many diseases associated with its dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, together with histological and functional descriptions in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, emphasize the hippocampus transverse (mediolateral) and longitudinal (anteroposterior) axes in determining its functional organization, contribution to behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, and vulnerability to neurological disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In humans, functional analogues of the hippocampus canonical internal circuitry and its anatomical connections with neocortical areas have successfully been provided by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, at a coarse scale confirming the anteroposterior differentiation in connectivity observed in the animal literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Despite the consistency by which this anteroposterior organizational dimension emerges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, significant questions however remain regarding its spatial distribution across cortex and its contribution to behavior across the adult human lifespan.</p>
<p>Lack of consensus is especially evident in terms of the hippocampus functional connectivity with the default-mode network (DMN), encompassing core areas of the brain’s system for memory-guided behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Several studies primarily attribute integration with the DMN to the posterior hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, consistent with its anatomical connections to midline posterior parietal areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Other sources emphasize the anterior hippocampus as driving connectivity with the DMN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, on the basis of its anatomical connections with ventromedial prefrontal areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. These inconsistencies ultimately limit our understanding of hippocampal functional specialization, and the impact on cognition of the heterogeneous vulnerability to aging and disease observed along the hippocampus longitudinal axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. We propose that inconsistencies in part stem from overlooking multiple overlapping and complementary functional modes, not discernable through traditional parcellation-based approaches, which assume homogeneous function within distinct, pre-defined, portions of the hippocampus.</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence in young adults indicate that hippocampal neocortical connectivity is indeed fundamentally multidimensional – organized in several overlapping, but distinct, spatial modes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Whereas such gradient-based observations describe a principal anteroposterior mode of neocortical connectivity, they also identify orthogonal modes of long-axis and transverse variation in connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Importantly, these hippocampal gradients appear to reflect well-known gradients of macroscale brain function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, which express functional differentiation across distinct cortical hierarchies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The principal anteroposterior gradient has been linked to functional differentiation along a task-negative/task-positive cortical dimension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, separating neural communities involved in the formation of representations from sensory input (e.g., visual, somatosensory, and DMN areas) and those involved in the modulation of these representations (e.g., frontoparietal areas of attention and control)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. In parallel, a secondary, non-linear, long-axis gradient is suggested to correspond to the principal unimodal-transmodal gradient of cortical function (oppositely anchored in associative DMN areas and in unimodal sensory and motor cortices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. However, the biological underpinnings of this secondary gradient are still unknown, in contrast to the principal gradient, demonstrated also in microstructure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, gray matter covariance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, and gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Differences in the topography (i.e., the spatial layout) of the principal, anteroposterior, hippocampal gradient may predict episodic memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, but current findings are restricted to younger age – and to mainly the same sample (i.e., the Human Connectome Project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Moreover, it remains unknown in which capacity the secondary long-axis gradient contributes to behavior. Yet, a comprehensive model of the spatial properties of hippocampal functional organization should consider that hippocampal functional alterations occur across the adult lifespan, and manifest across the hippocampus in a heterogeneous manner. Specifically, aging has been linked to differential functional isolation of anterior and posterior hippocampal regions from prefrontal areas and large-scale brain networks including the DMN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Such neocortical disconnection of hippocampal subregions has been linked to dysfunction during memory encoding and retrieval<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, and in turn, to episodic memory decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Findings which link hippocampal isolation to increased functional homogeneity within the region, suggest that its disconnection from neocortex is driven by the spatial patterns in which Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology accumulates in cognitively healthy older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Importantly, loss of functional segregation between task-negative and task-positive poles is a functional hallmark of both healthy aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> – introducing overall ambiguity as to whether hippocampal gradients established in young adults persist into older age.</p>
<p>Dopamine (DA) is one of the most important modulators of hippocampus-dependent function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, and influences the brain’s functional architecture through enhancing specificity of neuronal signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Consistently, there is a DA-dependent aspect of maintained functional network segregation in aging which supports cognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Animal models suggest heterogeneous patterns of DA innervation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> and postsynaptic DA receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, across both transverse and longitudinal hippocampal axes, likely allowing for separation between DA modulation of distinct hippocampus-dependent behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Moreover, the human hippocampus has been linked to distinct DA circuits on the basis of long-axis variation in functional connectivity with midbrain and striatal regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Taken together with recent findings revealing a unimodal-transmodal organization of the most abundantly expressed DA receptor subtype, D1 (D1DR), across cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, we tested the hypothesis that the organization of hippocampal-neocortical connectivity partly reflects the underlying distribution of hippocampal DA receptors, predicting predominant spatial correspondence for any hippocampal gradient conveying a unimodal-transmodal pattern across cortex.</p>
<p>Here, we characterize the multidimensional functional organization of the hippocampus in two independent adult-lifespan samples, and map individual differences in fine-scale topographic properties of connectivity gradients onto behavioral and molecular phenotypes. We report three hippocampal gradients displaying distinct correspondence to a) canonical gradients of cortical function, b) the organization of hippocampal DA receptors, and c) individual differences in memory function. Multivariate, data-driven, classification on gradient topography identified older adults exhibiting a youth-like gradient profile and superior memory function as distinct from age-matched older counterparts, emphasizing a behavioral significance of preserved functional hippocampal topography in older age.</p>

<title>Multiple dimensions of hippocampal-neocortical integration across the adult lifespan</title>
<p>Connectopic mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> was applied to resting-state fMRI data (n=180, 90 men/90 women; 20-79 years; mean age = 49.8±17.4) from the DyNAMiC study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. For replication, we used an independent sample of 224 adults (122 men/102 women; 29-85 years mean age = 65.0±13.0) from the Betula project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Connectopic mapping was used to extract the dominant modes of functional cortical connectivity within the hippocampus based on non-linear manifold learning (Laplacian eigenmaps) applied to a similarity matrix derived from connectivity fingerprints computed between each hippocampal voxel and each voxel within neocortex. This identified a set of orthogonal connectopic maps (i.e., eigenvectors) describing overlapping connectivity topographies (i.e., gradients) within the hippocampus. Gradients were computed at subject level, and at group level across the sample, separately for the left and right hippocampus. We analyzed the first three gradients, together explaining 63% and 71% of the variance in left and right-hemispheres, respectively. This number corresponded to a clear elbow in the scree plot (Supplementary Figure 1).</p>
<p>The principal gradient (G1), explaining 44% and 53% of the variance in left and right hemispheres, was organized along the hippocampus longitudinal axis, conveying gradual anterior-to-posterior variation in cortical connectivity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This pattern of connectivity change is illustrated by dividing subject-level G1 connectopic maps into 23 long-axis bins of ∼2mm and plotting the average gradient values as a function of their distance from the most anterior hippocampal voxel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The second-order gradient (G2), explaining 11% of the variance in both hemispheres, expressed a secondary long-axis gradient organized from the middle hippocampus towards anterior and posterior ends (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref>). Finally, the third-order gradient (G3: explaining 8% and 7% of the variance), reflected variation along the hippocampus transverse axis, such that inferior-lateral parts of the hippocampus were separated from medial-superior parts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This pattern was most pronounced in the anterior hippocampus. Inspecting G3 across sample-specific segmentations of cornu ammonis (CA1-3), dentate gyrus (DG/CA4), and subiculum subfields suggested that while CA1-3 expressed the full extent of the gradient, and DG/CA4 variation around its center, the subiculum expressed only the most inferior section of the gradient (Supplementary Figure 2).</p>

<title>Hippocampal gradients reflect distinct dimensions of macroscale cortical organization</title>
<p>The projection of G1 onto cortex conveyed a pattern linking medial orbitofrontal, temporolimbic, and medial parietal regions at the anterior end of the gradient with occipital and frontoparietal regions at the posterior end (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). For further characterization, we computed G1 gradient values within seven cortical networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, and examined their position in gradient space. This placed the DMN, limbic, and somatomotor networks at anterior-to-middle parts of the gradient, whereas visual, ventral attention, and frontoparietal networks toward the posterior end of the gradient (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, G2 exhibited a unimodal-transmodal pattern across cortex, linking the middle hippocampus to frontal and posterior parietal regions, and anterior and posterior hippocampal ends to somatomotor and occipital regions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Consistently, the DMN and frontoparietal network mapped onto G2 at one end, and visual and somatomotor networks at the other (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Across cortex, G3 primarily separated temporal and insular areas from medial parietal and medial frontal areas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Aligning with cortical connectivity previously reported for hippocampal subfields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, areas of the DMN most strongly mapped onto the most inferior end of G3, consistent with the connectivity profile of the subiculum, whereas ventral attention and somatomotor networks had a stronger medial position along G3, aligning with reported connectivity of CA1-3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we linked the cortical patterns of gradients to the established macroscale layout of cortical function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> using Spearman’s rank correlation analyses. G1 showed significant correspondence with the cortical representation-modulation gradient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, differentiating the task-negative DMN and somatomotor networks from task-positive areas of attention and control (left G1: Spearman’s <italic>r</italic> = -0.353, <italic>p</italic><sub>spin</sub> &lt; 0.001; right G1: Spearman’s <italic>r</italic> = -0.406, <italic>p</italic><sub>spin</sub> &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). G1’s correlation with this cortical gradient was greater than its correlations to other cortical gradients (6.3 &lt; Z &lt; 9.6, <italic>ps</italic> &lt; 0.001), as well as significantly stronger than correlations observed for G2 and G3 (1.6 &lt; Z &lt; 6.5, <italic>ps</italic> &lt; 0.05). In contrast, G2 corresponded to the principal unimodal-transmodal gradient of cortical function (left G2: Spearman’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.502, <italic>p</italic><sub>spin</sub> &lt; 0.001; right G2: Spearman’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.536, <italic>p</italic><sub>spin</sub> &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), to a greater extent than G1 and G3 (4.9 &lt; Z &lt; 10.9, <italic>ps</italic> &lt; 0.001) and in comparison to other cortical gradients (5.2 &lt; Z &lt; 9.4, <italic>ps</italic> &lt; 0.001). Finally, the cortical pattern of G3 showed overall weaker correspondence with the canonical cortical gradients. G3’s correlations with the unimodal-transmodal gradient (left G3: Spearman’s <italic>r</italic> = -0.32, <italic>p</italic><sub>spin</sub> = 0.011), and the representation-modulation gradient (right G3: Spearman’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.191, <italic>p</italic><sub>spin</sub> = 0.009), were significantly weaker compared their counterparts of G2 (Z<sub>(998)</sub> = 4.9, p &lt; 0.001) and G1 (Z<sub>(998)</sub> = 5.3, p &lt; 0.001). These multiple lines of evidence contribute to a model of hippocampal functional organization across the adult human lifespan in which G1 and G2 constitute local representations of distinct macroscale cortical motifs.</p>

<title>Topography of G2 reflects distribution of hippocampal dopamine D1 receptors</title>
<p>Our next aim was to investigate to which extent the distribution of hippocampal DA D1 receptors (D1DRs), measured by [<sup>11</sup>C]SCH23390 PET in the DyNAMiC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> sample, may serve as a molecular correlate of the hippocampus’ functional organization. First, to estimate individual differences in gradients’ spatial layout, trend surface modelling (TSM) was applied to each subject-level connectopic map<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. This spatial-statistics approach parameterizes gradients at subject level, yielding a set of model parameters describing the topographic characteristics of each gradient in x, y, z directions (see Methods, and Supplementary Figure 5 for model selection). Unlike voxel-wise statistical inference on gradients, which overlooks the high interdependence between voxels’ gradient values and demands rigorous correction for multiple comparisons, TSM allows for statistical inference across a region’s internal heterogeneity using a concise set of independent parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Moreover, by adjusting the number of polynomial terms, TSM facilitates examination of spatial trends across gradients at coarser-to-finer levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Individual maps of D1DR binding potential (BP) were also submitted to TSM, yielding a set of spatial model parameters describing the topographic characteristics of hippocampal D1DR distribution for each participant. D1DR parameters were subsequently used as predictors of gradient parameters in one multivariate GLM per gradient (in total 6 GLMs, controlled for age, sex, and mean FD). Results are reported with p-values at an uncorrected statistical threshold and p-values after adjustment for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate (FDR). Individual differences in D1DR topography significantly explained topography of right-hemisphere G2 (F = 1.207, <italic>p</italic> = 0.041, <italic>p</italic><sub>FDR</sub> = 0.073; partial η2 = 0.118), but not of G1 nor G3 (F 0.953-1.108, <italic>p</italic> 0.222-0.596) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). This association was robust across multiple TSM model orders (Supplementary Figure 6). Complimentary analyses were then conducted to further evaluate G2 as a dopaminergic hippocampal mode by utilizing additional DA markers at group-level. First, a map of D1DR distribution was formed by averaging the [<sup>11</sup>C]SCH23390 BP images across DyNAMiC participants (n=176), and a map of D2DR distribution was formed by averaging [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride BP images in a subsample of DyNAMiC participants (n = 20). Previously published maps of DAT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> and FDOPA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/spmtemplates">https://www.nitrc.org/projects/spmtemplates</ext-link>) were also analyzed.

<title>Youth-like gradient topography supports memory in older age</title>

In DyNAMiC, we applied data-driven latent class analysis (LCA) to TSM parameters (residualized to account for age, sex, and mean FD) of left-hemisphere G1, which predicted episodic memory performance in younger adults. LCA yielded a two-class solution identifying two subgroups (n=19 vs. n=30) of older adults (60-79 years), which by definition differed in left-hemisphere G1 characteristics (F<sub>(9,37)</sub> = 13.778, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>p</italic><sub>FDR</sub> = 0.003, partial η<sup>2</sup> = 0.770).

<p>Plotting connectivity change along G1 and G2 in the aged and youth-like subgroups revealed that the diminished topographic specificity observed across gradients in older individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) was driven by older adults with an aged gradient profile (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Both older subgroups displayed altered gradient organization across cortex (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-D</xref>). The distribution of cortical networks in G1 space indicated a unimodal-transmodal organization in youth-like older adults, not evident in the aged older group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). The two groups did not differ in terms of age (aged: 70.8±6.0; youth-like: 68.4±4.7; <italic>t</italic> = 1.548, <italic>p</italic> = 0.128, <italic>p</italic><sub>FDR</sub> = 0.189), sex (aged: 9 men/10 women; youth-like: 16 men/14 women; <italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.166, <italic>p</italic> = 0.684, <italic>p</italic><sub>FDR</sub> = 0.746), nor hippocampal gray matter (left hemisphere: aged: 4271.2 ml ±480.9; youth-like: 4246.8 ml ±269.1; <italic>t</italic> = 0.223, <italic>p</italic> = 0.824, <italic>p</italic><sub>FDR</sub> = 0.850; right hemisphere: aged: 3866.2 ml ±446.3; youth-like: 3979.9 ml ±398.1; <italic>t</italic> = 0.929, <italic>p</italic> = 0.357, <italic>p</italic><sub>FDR</sub> = 0.457). Subgroups showed comparable levels of average hippocampal D1DR availability (left: youth-like 0.257±0.06; aged 0.242±0.06; <italic>t</italic> = 0.796, <italic>p</italic> = 0.430, <italic>p</italic><sub>FDR</sub> = 0.525; right: youth-like 0.242±0.06; aged 0.251±0.06 <italic>t</italic> = 0.296, <italic>p</italic> = 0.768, <italic>p</italic><sub>FDR</sub> = 0.817), but displayed a pattern of differences in D1DR TSM parameters in comparison to young adults supporting youth-like and aged profiles (youth-like subgroup vs. young: left: F<sub>(9,74)</sub> = 1.645, <italic>p</italic> = 0.118, <italic>p</italic><sub>FDR</sub> = 0.176, partial η<sup>2</sup> = 0.167; aged subgroup vs. young: left: F<sub>(9,62)</sub> = 3.478, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, <italic>p</italic><sub>FDR</sub> = 0.005, partial η<sup>2</sup> = 0.335; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>).</p>
<p>In line with our hypothesis, we observed superior memory in older adults exhibiting a youth-like gradient profile (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>): at trend-level for the composite episodic measure (aged: 43.2±3.7; youth-like: 46.5±6.6; <italic>t</italic> = 1.958, <italic>p</italic> = 0.056, <italic>p</italic><sub>FDR</sub> = 0.092), driven by a significant group difference on its word recall sub test (aged: 40.9±4.5; youth-like: 43.4±6.8; <italic>t</italic> = 2.600, <italic>p</italic> = 0.012, <italic>p</italic><sub>FDR</sub> = 0.025).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we present a comprehensive multidimensional characterization of functional hippocampal-neocortical integration across the adult human lifespan, and methodically map topography of connectivity gradients onto behavioral and molecular phenotypes. Our findings reveal the presence of two distinct connectivity gradients distributed along the hippocampus longitudinal axis which contribute to episodic memory function across the lifespan. These observations underscore the importance of disentangling multiple dimensions of hippocampal functional organization in advancing our understanding of cortico-hippocampal systems for memory-related behavior. Moreover, we demonstrate in two independent samples, that maintaining a youth-like gradient profile in older age – characterized by preserved distinctiveness of connectivity change along gradients – supports mnemonic functioning, and that increased homogeneity of gradient topography may precede gray matter atrophy.</p>
<p>Despite converging evidence in young adults indicating multiple overlapping modes of functional connectivity across the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, significant questions have remained regarding their spatial distribution across cortex, and their role in behavior. Here, connectopic mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> identified a principal anteroposterior gradient (G1); a second-order gradient of mid-to-anterior/posterior long-axis variation (G2); and a third-order gradient conveying variation across the hippocampus transverse axis (G3). Although we restrict our discussion of G3 given its low proportion of explained variance, we note that it mirrors patterns previously observed in both structure and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Consistently, cortical patterns of G3 matched cortical connectivity profiles previously reported for hippocampal subfields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Our results confirm that functional data favors detection of anteroposterior hippocampal organization in contrast to that determined by its cytoarchitecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, but indicate that higher-order connectivity modes may indeed carry coarse-scale information about subfield-determined organization. Greater anatomical specificity, with more precise characterization of connectivity in relation to subfield boundaries while minimizing effects of inter-individual differences in hippocampal shape and folding, might be achieved by adopting techniques implementing a geodesic coordinate system to represent effects within the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The general organization of neocortical connectivity within the hippocampus showed stability across the lifespan (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), although clear effects of age were evident in the fine-scale topography of connectivity modes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Older age was associated with less distinct transitions in connectivity along G1 and G2, an effect that was exacerbated in a subgroup of older adults exhibiting an aged gradient profile – separated from older adults exhibiting youth-like gradient topography (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref>). This finding constitutes an important addition to evidence highlighting increased homogeneity in hippocampal function in aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Current theories view this loss of specificity as a consequence of its functional isolation from neocortical areas, possibly linked to tau-driven degeneration of the perforant pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Age-related deterioration of this entorhinal-hippocampal pathway has in turn been linked to impaired mnemonic functioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. Importantly, older individuals exhibiting dedifferentiated gradient topography, but comparable hippocampal volumes, displayed less efficient episodic memory compared to older adults maintaining youth-like gradient topography (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>; Supplementary Figure 7). This underscores the potential of gradient-based techniques to capture behaviorally relevant alterations in hippocampal function at a stage preceding structural decline.</p>
<p>Testing the correspondence across cortex of G1 and G2 to canonical gradients of cortical function provided support for G1 reflecting differentiation along a representation-modulation dimension (e.g., task-negative/task-positive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-E</xref>), separating frontoparietal areas of attention and control from sensorimotor and DMN areas. Consistent with age-related loss of segregation between task-positive and task-negative poles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, also evident in numerous diseases involving hippocampal dysfunction (e.g., depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>, schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, and Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>), we observed altered cortical organization of G1 in both older subgroups. A main difference between subgroups, however, included a unimodal-transmodal organization instead emerging in youth-like older adults, whereas not in the aged subgroup (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). A meaningful role of this potential reorganization was indicated by an association between G1 topography and memory in the youth-like older adults only. In terms of G2, we provide support of its characterization as a local representation of the principal unimodal-transmodal cortical gradient (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-E</xref>), widely demonstrated across functional, structural, and molecular modalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Taken together, our observations support a framework of cortico-hippocampal integration in which the DMN is positioned in different neural contexts: in one case at the opposite end from frontoparietal networks of attention and control, and in the other, opposite to sensorimotor and visual networks – indicating that an account of the hippocampus functional connectivity with the DMN is dependent on multiple neurofunctional hierarchies. The overlap of G1 and G2 may potentially reflect the superimposition of gradients and hubs of long-axis anatomical connections indicated in both the human and animal hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. Moreover, the observation that macroscale relationships between distinct cortical systems are mapped out by G1 and G2 in this manner may reflect the hippocampus primordial position in the laminar development of the cerebral cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>, supporting the idea that hippocampal function stands, from a phylogenetic perspective, to inform general principles of brain organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We discovered that G2, specifically, manifested organizational principles shared among function, behavior, and neuromodulation. Meta-analytical decoding reproduced a unimodal-associative axis across G2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), and analyses in relation to the distribution of D1DRs – which vary across cortex along a unimodal-transmodal axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> – demonstrated topographic correspondence both at the level of individual differences and across the group. It should, however, be acknowledged that PET imaging in the hippocampus is associated with resolution-related limitations, although previous research indicate high test-retest reliability of [<sup>11</sup>C]SCH23390 PET to quantify D1DR availability in this region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. As such, mapping the distribution of hippocampal D1DRs at a fine spatial scale remains challenging, and replication of our results in terms of overlap with G2 is needed in independent samples. Here, we evaluated the observed spatial overlap between G2 topography and D1DRs across multiple TSM model orders, showing correspondence between modalities from simple to more complex parameterizations of their spatial properties. Topographic correspondence was additionally observed between G2 and other DA markers from independent datasets (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that G2 may constitute a mode reflecting a dopaminergic phenotype, which contributes to the currently limited understanding of its biological underpinnings.</p>
<p>Results linked both G1 and G2 to episodic memory, suggesting complimentary contributions of these two overlapping long-axis modes. Considered together, analyses in the main and replication datasets indicated a role of G2 topography in memory across the adult lifespan, independent of age. A similar association with G1 was only evident across the entire sample in the replication dataset, whereas results in the main sample seemed to emphasize a role of youth-like G1 topography in memory performance. In line with previous research, memory was successfully predicted by G1 topography in young adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, and similarly predicted by G1 in older adults exhibiting a youth-like functional profile.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that meta-analytical decoding of G2 primarily linked the unimodal connectivity patterns of anterior and posterior subregions to terms of episodic memory, encoding, and navigation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). G2’s role in memory might as such be considered in light of hippocampal integration with the visual system, by which it contributes to complex perceptual processes supporting memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. In humans, there is evidence of direct hippocampal connections to early visual areas, with recent tractography-based work demonstrating connectivity as primarily localized to the posterior hippocampus and to a smaller region in the anterior hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The verbal nature of our memory tasks likely contributed to the left-lateralization of effects, yet, predominant left-hemisphere vulnerability to aging and age-related pathology should not be ruled out as a meaningful contributor to these effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. Average hippocampal D1DR availability did not differ between older subgroups, but a tendency towards youth-like and aged functional profiles being mirrored in D1DR topography was observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). However, longitudinal data is ultimately required to inform the underlying mechanisms of individual differences in hippocampal gradient topography in older age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. Future studies should, furthermore, assess gradients’ modulation by behavioral conditions and extend these methods to clinical samples characterized by hippocampal dysfunction.</p>
<p>This study establishes behavioral relevance of two overlapping long-axis modes of hippocampal-neocortical functional connectivity, shedding light on their age-related dedifferentiation, and its impact on cognition. In sum, this study introduces a multidimensional framework for understanding hippocampal-neocortical integration and its interplay with memory and neuromodulation throughout the adult human lifespan.</p>

<p>The DyNAMiC sample included 180 participants (20-79 years; mean age = 49.8±17.4; 90 men/90 women equally distributed within each decade). Individuals were randomly selected from the population register of Umeå, Sweden, and recruited via postal mail. Exclusion criteria implemented during the recruitment procedure included brain pathology, impaired cognitive functioning (Mini Mental State Examination &lt; 26), medical conditions and treatment that could affect brain functioning and cognition (e.g. dementia, diabetes, and psychiatric diagnosis), and brain imaging contraindications (e.g. metal implants). All participants were native Swedish speakers. A total of 16 participants were excluded from connectopic mapping due to excessive in-scanner motion, leaving resting-state fMRI data for 164 participants (20-78 years; mean age = 48.7±17.3). As a replication data set, we used an independent sample of 224 cognitively healthy and native Swedish-speaking adults (122 men/102 women; 29-85 years mean age = 65.0±13.0) from the population-based Betula project, for which the design and recruitment procedures have been reported in detail elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Episodic memory</title>
<p>Episodic memory was measured using three tasks testing word recall, number-word recall and object-location recall, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. In the word recall task, participants were presented with 16 Swedish concrete nouns that appeared successively on a computer screen. Each word was presented for 6 s during encoding with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 1 s. Following encoding, participants reported as many words as they could recall by typing them using the keyboard. Two trials were completed, yielding a maximum score of 32. In the number-word task, participants encoded pairs of 2-digit numbers and concrete plural nouns (e.g., 46 dogs). During encoding, eight number-word pairs were presented, each displayed for 6 s, with an ISI of 1 s. Following encoding, nouns were presented again, in a re-arranged order, and participants had to report the 2-digit number associated with each presented noun (e.g. How many dogs?). This task included two trials with a total maximum score of 16. The third task was an object-location memory task. Here, participants were presented with a 6 × 6 square grid in which 12 objects were, one by one, shown at distinct locations. Each object-position pairing was displayed for 8 s, with an ISI of 1 s. Following encoding, all objects were simultaneously shown next to the grid for the participant to move them (in any order) to their correct position in the grid. If unable to recall the correct position of an object, participants had to guess and place the object in the grid to the best of their ability. Two trials of this task were completed, making the total maximum score 24.</p>
<p>A composite score of performances across the three tasks was calculated and used as the measure of episodic memory. For each of the three tasks, scores were summarized across the total number of trials. The three resulting sum scores were z-standardized and averaged to form one composite score of episodic memory performance (T score: mean = 50; SD = 10). Missing values were replaced by the average of the available observed scores.</p>

Functional images were slice-timing corrected, co-registered to the anatomical T1-images, and motion corrected, and underwent distortion correction using subject-specific B0-field maps. The functional data were subsequently co-registered to the anatomical T1-images again, temporally demeaned and linear and quadratic effects were removed. Next, a 36-parameter nuisance regression model was applied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>, including mean cerebrospinal, white-matter, and whole-brain signal in addition to six motion parameters, including parameters’ squares, derivatives, and squared derivatives. To further control for in-scanner motion, the model also included a set of spike regressors, defined as binary vectors of motion-contaminated volumes exceeding a volume-to-volume root-mean-squared (RMS) displacement of 0.25 mm. A temporal high-pass filter (with a threshold of 0.009 Hz) was applied simultaneously as nuisance regression in order to not re-introduce nuisance signals.

Binding potential relative to non-displaceable binding in a reference region (BP<sub>ND</sub>; Innis et al., 2007), was used as an estimate of receptor availability (i.e. D1DR) in the hippocampus, for each participant defined using the FreeSurfer segmentation of their anatomical images.

<title>Mapping gradients of functional connectivity</title>
<p>Connectopic mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> was run through the ConGrads toolbox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> implemented in FSL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>. Mapping was conducted on both subject level and group level, for the left and right hippocampus separately, and involved two main steps. First, for every hippocampal voxel, connectivity fingerprints were computed as the Pearson correlation between the voxel-wise time-series and a singular-value decomposition (SVD) representation of all cortical voxels. In a second step, non-linear manifold learning (Laplacian eigenmaps) was applied to a matrix expressing the degree of similarity between the voxel-wise fingerprints. This yields eigenvectors, so called connectopic maps, representing modes of functional connectivity (i.e. functional gradients). Each connectopic map is then projected onto cortex, for which each vertex is color coded according to the voxel in the hippocampus it correlates the most with. Since connectopic mapping at group level involves applying Laplacian eigenmaps to a group-average similarity matrix, group level mapping across the sample was conducted using the hippocampal and cortical masks derived from the FreeSurfer segmentation of a sample-mean structural image. Mapping was specified to compute 20 gradients, and a subsequent scree plot over explained variance indicated meaningful contributions of the three first connectopic maps, together explaining 67% of the variance across hemispheres (Supplementary Figure 1).</p>

Moreover, whereas the sign of connectopic maps is arbitrary, differences therein have an impact on the spatial model parameters describing the topographic characteristics of gradients, derived through TSM in a later step. As such, the sign of subject-level connectopic maps showing negative correlations with the corresponding group-level reference map were inversed.</p>

<title>Trend surface modelling</title>
<p>Using spatial statistics, the topography of a connectopic map can be represented by a small number of spatial model parameters. This parameterization enables analyses of inter-individual differences, and is achieved through trend surface modelling (TSM), implemented in a third step of the ConGrads analysis pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. In this step, the spatial pattern of each subject-level connectopic map is approximated by estimating a spatial statistical model. Model estimation involves fitting a set of polynomial basis functions along canonical axes of the connectopic map. In MNI space, this entails estimation along x, y, and z axes of the hippocampus. Thus, fitting a polynomial of degree 1 yields three TSM parameters (x, y, z), with any increase in model order corresponding to an increase in number of parameters (e.g. 6 parameters for the second model order: x, y, z, x<sup>2</sup>, y<sup>2</sup>, z<sup>2</sup>; 9 parameters for the third model order, etc.). Trend surface models are fitted with an increasing polynomial degree using Bayesian linear regression, which provides likelihood estimates that can be used for subsequent model selection. Here, model selection was based on three information sources: a) the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) across subjects for models estimated at orders 1-10; b) the % explained variance in connectopic maps by each model; and c) visual inspection of group-level gradients reconstructed from TSM parameters at different model orders. The purpose of using multiple information sources, as opposed to simply BIC, was to find a trade-off between high-quality reconstructions of gradients by TSM models, while keeping the number of model parameters sufficiently low for multivariate statistical analyses. A model order of 3 (=9 TSM parameters) was selected for G1, whereas a model order of 4 (=12 TSM parameters) was selected for G2 and G3 (Supplementary Figure 5). Each gradient’s set of TSM parameters were then used as either dependent or independent variables in multivariate GLMs investigating links between gradient topography and variables such as age, episodic memory performance, and D1DR distribution.</p>

<title>Transitions in connectivity as a function of the hippocampal longitudinal axis</title>
<p>To visualize the orthogonal patterns of change in connectivity conveyed by each gradient, and to aid in the interpretation of age effects, we divided each subject-level connectopic map into 23 bins of ∼2mm along the hippocampus anterior-posterior axis and estimated the average gradient value (ranging from 0-1) for each bin. Plotting the values of each bin against their distance in mm from the most anterior voxel in the hippocampus as such demonstrates the pattern of change in connectivity along the anterior-posterior axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Cortical projections and correlations with gradients of cortical function</title>
<p>In ConGrads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, cortical mapping is computed independently for each gradient based on the regression equation: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534115v4_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> where A corresponds to data inside (i.e., hippocampus) and B to data outside (i.e., cortical) the ROI, and X-1 is the pseudo-inverse of the corresponding eigenvector (stacked with a row of ones). For each hippocampal gradient, the volumetric MNI-registered group-level cortical projection map was resampled to the Human Connectome Project 32k_LR midthickness surface mesh, using the volume-to-surface algorithm with enclosing mapping available in Connectome Workbench v.1.5.0. Spearman correlations were computed between the cortical projection of each hippocampal gradient and the three gradients previously established as the main axes of cortical functional organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. To reduce the degree of freedom, each surface projection was resampled by 1000-cortical parcels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>. Statistical significance of correlations was assessed by spin-test permutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>, randomly rotating a spherical projection of the cortical maps 1000 times, with two-tailed statistical significance determined at a 95% confidence level.</p>

<title>Mapping behavioral transitions along gradients using Neurosynth</title>
<p>Transitions in behavioral domains were mapped onto G1 and G2 using meta-analytical decoding in Neurosynth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. We assessed two sets of behavioral terms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), the first was a selection of terms commonly linked to anteroposterior hippocampal functional specialization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, and the second a selection of terms based on a previous report demonstrating behavioral transitions along a unimodal-transmodal cortical axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. For correspondence with meta-analytical maps, we created region of interest masks by projecting the cortical surface of each gradient to the 2-mm volumetric MNI152 standard space. These volumetric images were then divided into five twenty-percentile bins and binarized. The resulting images were used as input to the Neurosynth decoder, yielding an <italic>r</italic> statistic associated with each behavioral term per section of each gradient.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper derives the first three functional gradients in the left and right hippocampus across two datasets. These gradient maps are then compared to dopamine receptor maps obtained with PET, associated with age, and linked to memory. Results reveal links between dopamine maps and gradient 2, age with gradients 1 and 2, and memory performance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper investigates how hippocampal gradients relate to aging, memory, and dopamine receptors, which are interesting and important questions. A strength of the paper is that some of the findings were replicated in a separate sample.</p>
<p>Assessment after revision:</p>
<p>The authors addressed concerns about unclear multiple comparison correction in the revision. The replication sample was primarily used to replicate the topographic organization of functional hippocampal-neocortical connectivity within the hippocampus across the adult lifespan, which was the central goal of this paper. Not all other analyses replicated, which the authors nicely clarified in the revised manuscript. Overall, this work is a thorough and valuable contribution to the literature.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors analyzed the complex functional organization of the hippocampus using two separate adult lifespan datasets. They investigated how individual variations in the detailed connectivity patterns within the hippocampus relate to behavioral and molecular traits. The findings confirm three overlapping hippocampal gradients and reveal that each is linked to established functional patterns in the cortex, the arrangement of dopamine receptors within the hippocampus, and differences in memory abilities among individuals. By employing multivariate data analysis techniques, they identified older adults who display a hippocampal gradient pattern resembling that of younger individuals and exhibit better memory performance compared to their age-matched peers. This underscores the behavioral importance of maintaining a specific functional organization within the hippocampus as people age.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The evidence supporting the conclusions is compelling, based on a unique dataset, a rich set of carefully unpacked results, and a rigorous data analysis that is clearly explained and motivated. Possible confounds are carefully considered and ruled out.</p>
<p>Assessment after revision:</p>
<p>The authors improved the transparency of the statistical analyses by stating explicitly what tests and corrections were performed and clearly justifying the elected statistical approaches. They now also acknowledge and discuss the potential limitations of the presented PET analyses. Overall this is a rigorous and important contribution to the literature that will likely be of broad interest to basic and clinical neuroscience.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors studied how hippocampal connectivity gradients across the lifespan, and how these relate to memory function and neurotransmitter distributions. They observed older age with less distinct transitions and observed an association between gradient de-differentiation and cognitive decline.</p>
<p>This is overall an innovative and interesting study to assess gradient alterations across the lifespan and its associations to cognition.</p>
<p>The paper is well-written, and the methods appear sound and thoughtful. There are several strengths, including the inclusion of two independent cohorts, the use of gradient mapping and alignment techniques, and an overall sound statistical and analysis framework. There are several areas for potential improvements in the paper, and these are listed below:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for their positive assessment and summary of our work. We address each of the Reviewer’s comments below, and outline the revisions we have made to the manuscript based on the Reviewer’s suggestions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) The reported D1 associations appear a bit post-hoc in the current work and I was unclear why the authors specifically focussed on dopamine here, as other transmitter systems are similar present at the level of the hippocampus and implicated in aging.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Other neurotransmitter systems may indeed be relevant in the context of hippocampal function in aging. In this study, however, we included a specific research question about the DA D1 receptor (D1DR) based on previous research 1) emphasizing the role of DA neuromodulation in maintaining functional network segregation in aging to support cognition (Pedersen et al., 2023), 2) reporting heterogeneous distribution of DA markers across the hippocampus, supporting efficient modulation of distinct behaviors (Dubovyk &amp; ManahanVaughan, 2019; Edelmann &amp; Lessmann, 2018; Gasbarri et al., 1994; Kempadoo et al., 2016), and 3) demonstrating the spatial distribution of D1DRs as varying across neocortex along a unimodal-transmodal gradient (Pedersen et al., 2024). To which degree this variation might be reflected in cortico-hippocampal connectivity, however, remained to be investigated. As such, one of the study’s specific aims was to evaluate the spatial distribution of D1DRs as a molecular correlate of the hippocampus’ functional organization. Importantly, we were interested in mapping associations between individual differences in the organization of connectivity and D1DRs. This was uniquely enabled by utilizing the DyNAMiC sample, as it includes structural and functional MRI data in combination with D1DR PET in the same individuals across the adult lifespan (n=180). However, after observing significant spatial correspondence between functional organization and D1DR expressed by the second hippocampal gradient (G2), we did indeed perform complimentary analyses with group-averaged data of additional dopamine markers (D2DR from a subsample of our participants, as well as DAT and FDOPA from open sources) to test the generalizability of the original finding. Taken together, the original analyses based on subject-level data and complimentary group-level analyses provided support for the interpretation of G2 as a dopaminergic mode.</p>
<p>We have updated the manuscript to clarify the focus on the D1 receptor and the contribution of including additional DA markers.</p>
<p>Updated paragraph in the Introduction, pages 5-6:</p>
<p>“Dopamine (DA) is one of the most important modulators of hippocampus-dependent function(47,48), and influences the brain’s functional architecture through enhancing specificity of neuronal signaling(49). Consistently, there is a DA-dependent aspect of maintained functional network segregation in aging which supports cognition(50). Animal models suggest heterogeneous patterns of DA innervation(51,52) and postsynaptic DA receptors(53), across both transverse and longitudinal hippocampal axes, likely allowing for separation between DA modulation of distinct hippocampus-dependent behaviors(47). Moreover, the human hippocampus has been linked to distinct DA circuits on the basis of long-axis variation in functional connectivity with midbrain and striatal regions(54,55). Taken together with recent findings revealing a unimodal-transmodal organization of the most abundantly expressed DA receptor subtype, D1 (D1DR), across cortex(56), we tested the hypothesis that the organization of hippocampal-neocortical connectivity partly reflects the underlying distribution of hippocampal DA receptors, predicting predominant spatial correspondence for any hippocampal gradient conveying a unimodal-transmodal pattern across cortex.”</p>
<p>Updated sections in the Results, page 13-14:</p>
<p>“Our next aim was to investigate to which extent the distribution of hippocampal DA D1 receptors (D1DRs), measured by [<sup>11</sup>C]SCH23390 PET in the DyNAMiC(58) sample, may serve as a molecular correlate of the hippocampus’ functional organization.”</p>
<p>“Complimentary analyses were then conducted to further evaluate G2 as a dopaminergic hippocampal mode by utilizing additional DA markers at group-level.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Moreover, the authors may be aware that multiple PET tracers are somewhat challenged in the mesiotemporal region. Is this the case for the D1 receptor as well? The hippocampus is a small and complex structure, and PET more of a low res technique so one would want to highlight and discuss the limitations of the correlations with PET maps here and/or evaluate whether the analysis adds necessary findings to the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for raising this point. The lower resolution of PET is indeed a relevant aspect to consider when quantifying D1DR availability in the hippocampus, even though previous research indicate high test-retest reliability of [<sup>11</sup>C]SCH23390 PET measurement in this region (Kaller et al., 2017). We have now elaborated on PET limitations in the Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>In our study, we made efforts to reduce potential partial volume effects (PVE) by correcting our PET data, and tested spatial associations between our functional gradients and D1DR maps using trend-surface modelling (TSM), rather than through voxel-wise comparisons. This allowed us to evaluate the spatial correspondence between functional connectivity and D1DRs at a level of spatial trends, estimated using TSM models computed at increasing levels of complexity. The results showed consistent spatial overlap between G2 and D1DRs across these models, that is, across spatial trends described at coarser-to-finer scales. Furthermore, this was replicated across several DA markers with PET and SPECT data from independent samples.</p>
<p>Taken together, we agree with the Reviewer that the spatial correspondence observed between G2 and hippocampal D1DRs should be interpreted in the context of resolution-related limitations inherent to PET imaging. However, we strongly believe that our DA analyses offer valuable insight to the molecular underpinnings of hippocampal functional organization.</p>
<p>Updated paragraph in the Discussion, pages 25-26:</p>
<p>“We discovered that G2, specifically, manifested organizational principles shared among function, behavior, and neuromodulation. Meta-analytical decoding reproduced a unimodalassociative axis across G2 (Figure 3B), and analyses in relation to the distribution of D1DRs – which vary across cortex along a unimodal-transmodal axis(76,77) – demonstrated topographic correspondence both at the level of individual differences and across the group. It should, however, be acknowledged that PET imaging in the hippocampus is associated with resolutionrelated limitations, although previous research indicate high test-retest reliability of [<sup>11</sup>C]SCH23390 PET to quantify D1DR availability in this region(78). As such, mapping the distribution of hippocampal D1DRs at a fine spatial scale remains challenging, and replication of our results in terms of overlap with G2 is needed in independent samples. Here, we evaluated the observed spatial overlap between G2 topography and D1DRs across multiple TSM model orders, showing correspondence between modalities from simple to more complex parameterizations of their spatial properties. Topographic correspondence was additionally observed between G2 and other DA markers from independent datasets (Figure 3B), suggesting that G2 may constitute a mode reflecting a dopaminergic phenotype, which contributes to the currently limited understanding of its biological underpinnings.”</p>

<p>From my (perhaps somewhat biased) perspective, it might be valuable to instead or in addition look at measures of hippocampal microstructure and how these relate to the functional aging effects. This could be done, if available, using data from the same subjects (eg based on quantitative MRI contrasts and/or structural MRI) and/or using contextualization findings as implemented in eg hippomaps.readthedocs.io</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. We performed additional analyses investigating the spatial overlap between our connectivity gradients and estimates of hippocampal microstructure, computed as the ratio of T1- over T2-weighted (T1w/T2w) images (Glasser &amp; Von Essen, 2011; vos de Wael et al., 2018). Analyses of spatial correspondence then followed the TSM-based method used to test the spatial overlap between functional connectivity gradients and D1DR distribution. Applying TSM to the T1w/T2w image computed for each participant yielded subject-level model parameters describing microstructure topography, which were then entered as predictors of connectivity topography in multivariate GLMs (separate models for each gradient and hemisphere, 6 models in total).</p>
<p>Analyses revealed that microstructure of the right hippocampus significantly predicted gradient topography of right-hemisphere G1 (F = 1.325, <italic>p</italic> = 0.034), while no other links between connectivity gradients and microstructure emerged as significant (F 0.930-1.184, <italic>ps</italic> 0.7060.079).</p>
<p>These results, suggesting an association along the anteroposterior axis, deviate from previous findings linking hippocampal microstructure to G3-like, medial-lateral, connectivity organization (vos de Wael et al., 2018). As we believe that comprehensive analyses of our gradients in relation to microstructure across the lifespan would be best addressed in future work, we have not included these analyses of microstructure in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(2) Can the authors clarify why they did not replicate based on cohorts that are more widely used in the community and open access, such as CamCAN and/or HCP-Aging? It might connect their results with other studies if an attempt was made to also show that findings persist in either of these repositories.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that replication in samples such as CamCAN and/or HCP-Aging would provide valuable opportunities to connect our findings with those of other studies using those datasets. Here, we included the Betula dataset (Nilsson et al., 2004) as our replication sample, as it was immediately available to us, included a large sample of adults in a comparable age, and a word recall episodic memory task closely aligned with the one included in DyNAMiC. Importantly, leveraging the Betula dataset as our replication sample allows us to link our findings to a wide range of previous studies central to the understanding of neurocognitive aging in general, and hippocampal aging in particular (Nyberg, 2017; Nyberg et al., 2020). Betula is a large longitudinal project that has been tracking individuals since 1988, and is part of the National E-infrastructure for Aging Research (NEAR: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.near-aging.se">www.near-aging.se</ext-link>), through which data from several Swedish studies are made available to both national and international researchers. While we acknowledge the value of extending replication efforts to datasets like CamCAN and HCP-Aging, we emphasize the significant contribution of having replicated our connectivity gradients in the Betula dataset.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors applied TSM and related these parameters to topographic changes in the gradients. I was wondering whether and how such an approach controls for autocorrelation present in both the PET map and gradients. Could the authors clarify?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer raises an important topic in spatial autocorrelation. The TSM approach used to parameterize the topography of the functional gradients and D1DR distribution, and to test the spatial correspondence between modalities, did not include any specific method to control for autocorrelation. Here, we highlight two aspects of our study in relation to this point. First, we demonstrated in the Supplementary information (S. Figure 4) that autocorrelation induced by spatial smoothing likely has limited effects on overall gradient topography and the ability of TSM parameters to capture meaningful inter-individual differences in terms of age. Second, in the case of spatial overlap effects being significantly impacted by autocorrelation, we would expect the association between right-hemisphere G2 and D1DR topography to similarly emerge for G2 in the left hemisphere. The absence of such an association may speak to a limited effect of spatial autocorrelation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The TSM approach quantifies the gradients in terms of x/y/z direction in a cartesian coordinate system. Wouldn't a shape intrinsic coordinate system in the hippocampus also be interesting, and perhaps even be more efficient to look at here (see eg DeKraker 2022 eLife or Paquola et al 2020 eLife)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a very relevant question and we appreciate the Reviewer’s suggestion. We recognize that there may be several benefits associated with adopting a shape-intrinsic coordinate system when characterizing effects in the hippocampus, given its curved/folded anatomy. Approaches like the ones adopted in DeKraker et al., 2022 and Paquola et al., 2020, utilizes geodesic coordinate frameworks to represent the hippocampus in surface space, enabling mapping of connectivity onto the hippocampal surface while respecting its inherent curvature and topology. We anticipate that quantifying gradients within such a framework would especially benefit identification of connectivity change across the hippocampal surface relative to reference points such as subfield boundaries, while minimizing effects of interindividual differences in hippocampal shape and folding. In our study, hippocampal gradients and their associated cortical patterns were computed in volumetric space, with TSM subsequently used to parameterize the change in connectivity along these gradients. This indeed yields a description of connectivity change within a coordinate system less specific to hippocampal anatomy, but may favor generalizability and integration with previous gradient findings within and beyond the hippocampus (e.g., Przeździk et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020; Katsumi et al., 2023; Navarro-Schröder et al., 2015), as well as connections with broader neuroimaging frameworks through techniques such as meta-analytical decoding. In our view, the different coordinate frameworks offer complimentary insight to hippocampal organization, and while we have opted to not undertake novel analyses to explore our gradients within a geodesic coordinate system for the purposes of this paper, we recognize the importance of such evaluation of our gradients in future analyses. We have made updates to the Discussion in the revised manuscript on this topic (pages 23-24):</p>
<p>“Greater anatomical specificity, with more precise characterization of connectivity in relation to subfield boundaries while minimizing effects of inter-individual differences in hippocampal shape and folding, might be achieved by adopting techniques implementing a geodesic coordinate system to represent effects within the hippocampus(68,69).”</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper derives the first three functional gradients in the left and right hippocampus across two datasets. These gradient maps are then compared to dopamine receptor maps obtained with PET, associated with age, and linked to memory. Results reveal links between dopamine maps and gradient 2, age with gradients 1 and 2, and memory performance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper investigates how hippocampal gradients relate to aging, memory, and dopamine receptors, which are interesting and important questions. A strength of the paper is that some of the findings were replicated in a separate sample.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper would benefit from added clarification on the number of models/comparisons for each test. Furthermore, it would be helpful to clarify whether or not multiple comparison correction was performed and - if so - what type or - if not - to provide a justification. The manuscript would furthermore benefit from code sharing and clarifying which results did/did not replicate.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors analyzed the complex functional organization of the hippocampus using two separate adult lifespan datasets. They investigated how individual variations in the detailed connectivity patterns within the hippocampus relate to behavioral and molecular traits. The findings confirm three overlapping hippocampal gradients and reveal that each is linked to established functional patterns in the cortex, the arrangement of dopamine receptors within the hippocampus, and differences in memory abilities among individuals. By employing multivariate data analysis techniques, they identified older adults who display a hippocampal gradient pattern resembling that of younger individuals and exhibit better memory performance compared to their age-matched peers. This underscores the behavioral importance of maintaining a specific functional organization within the hippocampus as people age.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The evidence supporting the conclusions is overall compelling, based on a unique dataset, rich set of carefully unpacked results, and an in-depth data analysis. Possible confounds are carefully considered and ruled out.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No major weaknesses. The transparency of the statistical analyses could be improved by explicitly (1) stating what tests and corrections (if any) were performed, and (2) justifying the elected statistical approaches. Further, some of the findings related to the DA markers are borderline statistically significant and therefore perhaps less compelling but they line up nicely with results obtained using experimental animals and I expect the small effect sizes to be largely related to the quality and specificity of the PET data rather than the derived functional connectivity gradients.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for the thoughtful summary and positive assessment of our work. To increase transparency of the statistical analyses, we have in the revised manuscript added information regarding statistical tests and corrections for multiple comparisons. In the Results, p-values were reported at an uncorrected statistical threshold, and we have in the revised manuscript included the corresponding p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate (FDR). Finally, in the revised manuscript, we have now elaborated on the potential limitations of our PET analyses and we include the updated paragraph below.</p>

<p>“Individual maps of D1DR binding potential (BP) were also submitted to TSM, yielding a set of spatial model parameters describing the topographic characteristics of hippocampal D1DR distribution for each participant.

<p>(1) All statistical analyses are based on linear regressions using trend surface modeling (TSM) parameters that parameterize gradients at the subject level. These models resulted in 9 parameters for gradient 1 and 12 parameters each for gradients 2 and 3. The text states that 'Effects of age on gradient topography was assessed using multivariate GLMs including age as the predictor and gradient TSM parameters as dependent variables (controlling for sex and mean frame-wise displacement; FD)'. Please clarify whether these GLMs were fitted separately for each TSM parameter (i.e., 9+12+12=33 models for both left and right = 66 total models) or on the overall model?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s request for clarification on this matter. These GLMs were fitted on the overall TSM model, that is, through one GLM per gradient (3) and hemisphere (2), each one including all TSM parameters belonging to a gradient (in total, 6 GLMs).</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we have added more details to the Results section, page 15: “Effects of age on gradient topography were assessed using multivariate GLMs including age as the predictor and gradient TSM parameters as dependent variables (controlling for sex and mean frame-wise displacement; FD). One model was fitted per gradient and hemisphere, each model including all TSM parameters belonging to a gradient (in total, 6 GLMs).”</p>

<p>(3) Although I applaud the authors for their replication efforts, the results do not appear to replicate well. For example, memory was linked to gradient 2 in the whole group but to gradient 1 in the young group. Furthermore, dopamine was linked to gradient 2 in the right but not the left hemisphere. Although the overall group-level gradients were very stable between the two datasets, it is not clear whether the age findings replicated and the memory subgroup findings only replicated at trend level for memory and only partially replicated at the TSM parameter level.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for highlighting the inclusion of a replication dataset as a strength of our study, and we appreciate the recommendation to clarify to which extent results replicated. We provide a response to the Reviewer’s points below, and specify the revisions made to the manuscript in relation to this topic.</p>
<p>The main aim of our study was to characterize the topographic organization of functional hippocampal-neocortical connectivity within the hippocampus across the adult lifespan, as previous studies have limited their focus to younger adults. Given the lack of previous studies for comparison, together with our identification of a novel secondary long-axis connectivity gradient (G2) taking precedence over the previously established medial-lateral G3, we included the Betula sample (Nilsson et al., 2004) for the purpose of replication. There was a high level of consistency between our main dataset and our replication dataset, with gradients 1-3 in left and right hemispheres identified in both samples.</p>
<p>Further use of the replication dataset, beyond the identification of the connectivity gradients, was originally not planned. As such, not all subsequent analyses in the main dataset were conducted in the replication dataset. However, we found it critical to evaluate the observation that older individuals who maintained a youth-like gradient topography also exhibited higher levels of memory performance in an independent sample. This was possible given that the replication dataset included a comparable number of participants in similar ages and a word recall episodic memory task corresponding well to the one used in DyNAMiC. Overall, we conclude that these analyses replicated well across samples. Firstly, topography of lefthemisphere G1 informed the classification of older adults into youth-like and aged subgroups in both samples. Furthermore, in both samples, we observed that the older subgroups identified based on G1 topography also exhibited the youth-like vs. aged pattern in G2 topography. This pattern was, however, evident also in G3 only in the main sample, possibly suggesting a limited contribution of G3 topography in determining overall functional profiles in older age. In terms of the behavioral relevance of maintaining youth-like gradient topography in older age, we observed effects on word recall performance in both samples; although the Reviewer correctly points out that, the difference between subgroups was significant at trend-level (<italic>p</italic> = 0.058) in the replication dataset. While this indeed underscores the importance of replication efforts in additional samples, we argue that the pattern observed in our replication dataset is overall consistent with, and conveys effects in the expected direction based on, the original observations in our main dataset.</p>
<p>In revising the manuscript, we have performed additional analyses for replication purposes in terms of memory. Originally, we observed a significant association between G2 topography and episodic memory across the main sample. However, this effect did not remain significant after FDR adjustment for multiple comparisons. To evaluate this association further, we conducted a corresponding hierarchical multiple regression analysis in the replication dataset, which supported a role of G2 in memory (Adj. R<sup>2</sup> = 0.368, ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 0.081, F= 1.992, <italic>p</italic> = 0.028). Together, these analyses suggest that inter-individual differences in episodic memory performance may in part be explained by the spatial characteristics of G2 across the adult lifespan, although increased statistical power in relation to the large number of TSM parameters included in the hierarchical regression models may be needed to explore this association in smaller, age-stratified, groups. Relatedly, it is worth mentioning that higher levels of memory performance in older age were linked to the maintenance of youth-like G2 topography in both our main and replication datasets.</p>
<p>In parallel, topographic parameters of G1 predicted memory performance in the younger adults, which successfully replicates TSM-based results previously reported in Przeździk et al., 2019. Although similar associations were not evident within the other age groups, a link between G1 topography and memory was demonstrated in older age based on a) the identification of individuals maintaining a youth-like G1 profile and higher levels of memory, within which b) memory performance was, as in young adults, significantly predicted by G1 topography.</p>
<p>The spatial correspondence between G2 topography and distribution of hippocampal D1DRs was lateralized to the right, and as the Reviewer points out, as such did not replicate across hemispheres. To which extent replication across hemispheres should be expected in this case is, however, difficult to determine. Lateralization and/or hemispheric asymmetry is commonly observed in numerous hippocampal features, from the molecular level to its functional involvement in behavior (Nematis et al., 2023; Persson &amp; Söderlund, 2015), including various dopaminergic markers tested in the animal literature (Afonso et al., 1993; Sadeghi et al., 2017). Yet, potential differences between hemispheres in D1DR availability and the spatial distribution of receptors along hippocampal axes remain less studied in humans. More data is therefore needed to determine the nature of this right-hemisphere lateralization.</p>
<p>In sum, we argue that our results show a good level of replication across independent datasets and across analyses in our main dataset. Whereas this study did not attempt replication of all analyses conducted in the main dataset, it has through replication across independent samples provided support for its main findings – the organization of hippocampal-neocortical connectivity along three main hippocampal gradients across the adult lifespan, and the gradient topography-based identification of older individuals maintaining a youth-like hippocampal organization in older age.</p>
<p>The revised manuscript includes edits made to incorporate the new analyses and clarifications of observations in relation to memory.</p>
<p>In the Results, page 17:</p>
<p>“Observing that the association between G2 and memory did not remain significant after FDR adjustment, we performed the same analysis in our replication dataset, which also included episodic memory testing. Consistent with the observation in our main dataset, G2 significantly predicted memory performance (Adj. R<sup>2</sup> = 0.368, ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 0.081, F= 1.992, <italic>p</italic> = 0.028) over and above covariates and topography of G1. Here, the analysis also showed that G1 topography predicted performance across the sample (Adj. R<sup>2</sup> = 0.325, ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 0.112, F= 3.431, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).”</p>
<p>In the Discussion, page 26:</p>
<p>“Results linked both G1 and G2 to episodic memory, suggesting complimentary contributions of these two overlapping long-axis modes. Considered together, analyses in the main and replication datasets indicated a role of G2 topography in memory across the adult lifespan, independent of age. A similar association with G1 was only evident across the entire sample in the replication dataset, whereas results in the main sample seemed to emphasize a role of youthlike G1 topography in memory performance. In line with previous research, memory was successfully predicted by G1 topography in young adults(30), and similarly predicted by G1 in older adults exhibiting a youth-like functional profile.”</p>
