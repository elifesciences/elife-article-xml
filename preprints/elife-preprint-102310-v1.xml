<title>Summary</title><p>Cells must adapt to environmental changes to maintain homeostasis. One of the most striking environmental adaptations is entry into hibernation during which core body temperature can decrease from 37°C to as low at 4°C. How mammalian cells, which evolved to optimally function within a narrow range of temperatures, adapt to this profound decrease in temperature remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted the first genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen in cells derived from Syrian hamster, a facultative hibernator, as well as human cells to investigate the genetic basis of cold tolerance in a hibernator and a non-hibernator in an unbiased manner. Both screens independently revealed glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a selenium-containing enzyme, and associated proteins as critical for cold tolerance. We utilized genetic and pharmacological approaches to demonstrate that GPX4 is active in the cold and its catalytic activity is required for cold tolerance. Furthermore, we show that the role of GPX4 as a suppressor of cold-induced cell death extends across hibernating species, including 13-lined ground squirrels and greater horseshoe bats, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of this mechanism of cold tolerance. This study identifies GPX4 as a central modulator of mammalian cold tolerance and advances our understanding of the evolved mechanisms by which cells mitigate cold-associated damage—one of the most common challenges faced by cells and organisms in nature.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Rapid temperature changes pose a challenge to all clades of life, including endotherms. Homeotherms such as mammals routinely defend a core body temperature set-point, with profound thermal deviations leading to organ dysfunction and death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Indeed, several studies have shown that while homeotherm-derived cells typically possess a capacity for mild cold tolerance in culture, primary cultured cells and cell lines derived from a number of mammalian species, including humans, exhibit high rates of cell death following prolonged severe cold exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Although considerable work has focused on understanding the cellular responses and adaptations to an increased temperature (heat stress and heat-shock)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, little is known about how cell biological processes modulate cell sensitivity to decreased temperatures.</p>
<p>The mechanisms underlying cold-induced death remain poorly understood but have been hypothesized to involve phase transition of cellular membranes, with the resulting membrane damage leading to ion gradient disruption and irrecoverable cellular dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. However, many warm-blooded animals, including some primates, have evolved the ability to enter torpor and hibernation – states during which body temperature can decrease far below its homeostatic set-point<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In many animals, <italic>torpor</italic> is a state of profoundly reduced metabolic rate and body temperature lasting from hours to days, while <italic>hibernation</italic> is a seasonal behavior comprising multiple bouts of <italic>torpor</italic> interrupted by periodic arousals to normal body temperature. During torpor, the core body temperature of many small hibernators including the Syrian golden hamster (<italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic>), the 13-lined ground squirrel (<italic>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</italic>), and the greater horseshoe bat (<italic>Rhinolophus ferrumequinum</italic>), reaches 4-10°C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Animals can remain at these low temperatures for extended periods of time (up to several weeks), indicating that their cells and tissues are either genetically predisposed to cold tolerance, or that they can adapt to tolerate long-term cold exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Although in principle the ability to tolerate cold temperatures could be conveyed by systemic factors present in torpid or hibernating animals, cell lines derived from hibernating rodents maintain high viability when exposed to 4°C for several days, indicating the presence of cell-intrinsic mechanisms of cold tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Several studies have reported distinctive responses of hibernator-derived cells in the cold. For example, Syrian hamster-derived epithelial-like hamster kidney (HaK) cells maintain mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production during cold exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and both HaK and epithelial-like smooth muscle cells derived from the Syrian golden hamster are able to prevent excess reactive oxygen species damage in response to cold exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Similarly, unlike human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons, cultures of iPSC-derived neurons from 13-lined ground squirrels retain microtubule stability in the cold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Despite metabolic and cell biological differences between various hibernator and non-hibernator-derived cells in the context of cold exposure, the underlying genetic modulators of cold tolerance have yet to be systematically explored. Additionally, it is still unknown to what extent the pathways that regulate cold tolerance in one hibernating species are conserved across other evolutionarily distant hibernators and potentially even present in non-hibernators.</p>
<p>Here, we carry out the first unbiased genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens in cells derived from a cold-tolerant hibernator (Syrian hamster) as well as human (non-hibernator) cells to identify genetic pathways required for long-term cold tolerance. Surprisingly, these screens independently identify a common mechanism dependent on the selenocysteine-containing enzyme Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4) as a key mediator of cellular cold tolerance. Employing genetic and pharmacological approaches, we confirm these findings and demonstrate that increased GPX4 activity is sufficient to improve cold tolerance in human cells. We further show that functional GPX4 is required for cold tolerance across several hibernating and non-hibernating mammals, including in distantly related hibernating horseshoe bats (<italic>Rhinolophus ferrumequinum</italic>), and propose that the GPX4 pathway may be a widespread, evolutionarily ancient metazoan mechanism of cold tolerance across endotherms.</p>

<title>Assay for measuring viability of cold-exposed cells</title>
<p>Our initial evaluation of the ability of human K562 leukemia cells to tolerate prolonged exposure to extreme cold (4°C) temperatures led us to establish a new method for assessing viability of cold-exposed cells. To avoid confounding changes in media composition or pH, we transferred cultured cells into incubators cooled to 4°C with the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration calibrated to maintain physiological pH (7.4). Cell survival was assessed based on exclusion of trypan blue, a membrane-impermeable dye, immediately upon removal from 4°C. We observed a 27 ± 3% survival rate for K562 cells following 24 hours at 4°C using this approach. However, recounting live cells after a 24-hour rewarming at 37°C revealed a ∼6-fold increase in live cells, inconsistent with the reported 16-24 hour doubling rate of this cell line (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1a</xref>). Reasoning that a substantial fraction of trypan blue-positive cells at 4°C remain alive and capable of cell division and recovery upon rewarming, we carried out a time course of trypan blue staining shortly after removal from 4°C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). We found that the fraction of trypan blue-positive cells dramatically reduced following a brief rewarming period (30 minutes to 1 hour, either at room temperature or at 37°C), consistent with the number of live cells observed after 24 hours of rewarming (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b,c</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1a,b</xref>). To determine whether this effect was isolated to K562 cells, we measured trypan blue-positive cells at 4°C or following a brief period of rewarming in several human cell lines (HEK 293T, HeLa, and RPE1 cells), as well as Syrian hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK-21 cells) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1c-f</xref>). We consistently observed that, absent a rewarming period, trypan blue staining significantly overestimates cold-induced cell death. We thus adopted this brief rewarming period (∼30-minutes) as a standard assay to measure cell viability of cold-exposed cells in our subsequent studies.</p>

<title>Hibernator-derived cells show enhanced cold tolerance compared to human cells</title>
<p>Using our modified assay for cell viability after cold challenge, we examined the relative cold tolerance of hibernator and non-hibernator cells. We tested four commonly used human cell lines (HT1080, HeLa, RPE1, and K562), as well as two cell lines (BHK-21 and HaK) derived from Syrian hamsters (<italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic>), a hibernating mammal. Cells were placed at 4°C - the lower end of the temperature range which Syrian hamsters reach during hibernation - and we assessed cell survival after 1, 4, and 7 days of cold exposure. Consistent with prior reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, hamster-derived cell lines maintained high levels of viability, whereas human cell lines showed varying degrees of death (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1d-f</xref>), with several exhibiting less than 50% survival following 7 days in the cold. Notably, we observed generally higher cell survival rates than previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, likely owing to our modified method of measuring cell viability. Similar survival trends were also observed using an orthogonal assay based on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from dead cells into the media (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref>).</p>

<title>Genome-scale CRISPR screen in a hibernator-derived cell line identifies suppressors of cold-induced cell death</title>
<p>To investigate the molecular pathways regulating cold resistance in hibernator-derived BHK-21 cells, we designed a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen. Taking advantage of a recent chromosome-level assembly of the <italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic> genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and a modified CRISPOR-based guide selection algorithm (Methods), we generated a library of 218,143 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting all 21,473 annotated genes (∼10 guides per gene), including 2,299 intergenic-targeting and 250 non-targeting sgRNAs as negative controls. The pooled library was introduced into BHK-21 cells via a lentiviral vector expressing the sgRNA along with Cas9, achieving ∼1000-fold library representation with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) &lt; 1.</p>
<p>Considering that many mammalian species, including Syrian hamsters, undergo prolonged periods of cold exposure (deep torpor) and rewarming (interbout arousals) during seasonal hibernation, we sought to recapitulate these temperature changes in our screen. We thus exposed BHK-21 cells to three cycles consisting of 4°C cold exposure (4 days) followed by rewarming at 37°C (2 days) (“4°C Cycling”, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). To isolate genes selectively required upon cold exposure, we also analyzed BHK-21 cultures transduced in parallel that were maintained at 37°C for four passages/cycles (“37°C Control”, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). For both paradigms, genomic DNA was isolated from cells during each cycle/passage to monitor selective sgRNA depletion. To assess our screen performance, we tested whether sgRNAs targeting previously identified human core essential genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> were significantly depleted compared with nontargeting and intergenic sgRNAs and found that we can robustly distinguish between these functional categories at all three cycles and at both 37°C and 4°C (estimated p-value &lt; 2.2e-16) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

<p>To identify genes that selectively modify (suppress or potentiate) cold-induced cell loss, we compared the guides depleted during three cycles of cold exposure and rewarming to controls at 37°C with matched population doublings. Among the 21,473 targeted genes, only one gene, ribosomal protein S29 (Rps29)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, was selectively required in control 37°C conditions and only nine genes appeared selectively required during cold exposure (FDR &lt; 0.1, log2 fold-change [Log2FC] &gt;1, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref><bold>, </bold><xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref><bold>, S2</bold>). Four selectively required genes - <italic>Dld</italic>, <italic>Lias</italic>, <italic>Lipt1</italic>, and <italic>Ybey –</italic> are involved in lipoylation and mitochondrial RNA processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Strikingly, five of the nine required genes - <italic>Gpx4</italic>, <italic>Eefsec</italic>, <italic>Pstk</italic>, <italic>Secisbp2</italic>, and <italic>Sepsecs -</italic> represent known components of the glutathione/Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4) antioxidant pathway, indicating that this pathway functions as a potent suppressor of cold-induced cell death in hibernator-derived BHK-21 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Gpx4</italic> encodes a selenocysteine-containing lipid antioxidant enzyme that acts to suppress lipid peroxidation via the glutathione-mediated reduction of lipid hydroperoxides to non-toxic lipid alcohols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. GPX4 inhibition sensitizes cells to ferroptosis, a distinct form of programmed cell death characterized by iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Notably, cold exposure has previously been associated with increased lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Underscoring the requirement for Gpx4 activity, four of the eight remaining genes selectively required upon cold exposure (<italic>Eefsec, Secisbp2, Pstk, Sepsecs</italic>) are directly or indirectly involved in selenocysteine incorporation into cellular proteins and thus required for Gpx4 activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2d-h</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Given that our initial screen design involved repeated rewarming cycles, we could not exclude the possibility that the Gpx4 pathway confers resistance to rewarming-associated stress rather than cold tolerance per se. To address this issue, we took advantage of the high cold tolerance of BHK-21 cells and included a second screen arm using similar methods in which cells were continuously exposed to 4°C for 15 days (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2i</xref>). Sequencing prior to and following 15 days of cold exposure, followed by a brief rewarming to 37°C, confirmed significant depletion (FDR &lt; 0.1, Log2FC &lt; −0.5) of sgRNAs targeting <italic>Gpx4</italic>, <italic>Eefsec</italic>, and <italic>Secisbp2</italic> (as well as a trend toward depletion for <italic>Sepsecs</italic> and <italic>Pstk</italic>), confirming a critical role for the Gpx4 pathway in BHK-21 cell prolonged cold tolerance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2j,k</xref><bold>, Table S2, </bold><xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">S3</xref>). Thus, two unbiased genome-scale screen arms identified Gpx4 as a major suppressor of cold-induced cell death in hibernator-derived BHK-21 cells in the context of both cyclical and continuous cold exposure.</p>

<p>Together, these genetic experiments strongly implicate the catalytic activity of Gpx4 in BHK-21 cold tolerance. However, the constitutive nature of these interventions precluded a determination of whether Gpx4 functions to actively oppose cell death during cold-exposure or whether loss of its catalytic activity prior to cold exposure sensitizes cells to subsequent cold challenge. To address this issue, we used RSL3 and ML162, two competitive small-molecule Gpx4 inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Acute treatment of cultured BHK-21 cells with these inhibitors during cold exposure yielded dose-dependent increases in cell death. Indeed, by four days of treatment, both RSL3- and ML162-treated BHK-21 cells display significantly increased cold-induced death compared to untreated controls (****<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3d,e</xref>). Importantly, relative to WT cells, <italic>Gpx4</italic> knockout cells exhibited no significant increase in cold-induced cell death upon RSL3 treatment following a short cold exposure (8 hours) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>), confirming the specificity of these inhibitors under the test conditions. We therefore conclude that Gpx4 catalytic activity is required in BHK-21 cells during the course of cold exposure to actively oppose cold-induced cell death.</p>
<p>Given that Gpx4 activity acts as a major endogenous suppressor of ferroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, we tested whether the cold-induced cell death observed under Gpx4 inhibition occurred via the ferroptosis pathway. To this end, we made use of two small molecule inhibitors of ferroptosis, ferrostatin-1, a lipophilic antioxidant, and deferoxamine mesylate (DFO), a Fe<sup>2+</sup> chelator. Both inhibitors effectively rescued cold-induced cell death in the presence of the Gpx4 inhibitor RSL3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>), indicating that acute inhibition of Gpx4 activity in the cold drives cell death via ferroptosis. Together, through a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches, our studies demonstrate that Gpx4 activity confers substantial cold resistance in hibernator-derived cells, protecting cells from cold-induced ferroptosis.</p>

<title>Genome-scale CRISPR screen identifies determinants of cold sensitivity in human cells</title>
<p>In contrast to hibernator-derived cell lines, human cells display varying cold sensitivities in culture, with some exhibiting pronounced intolerance to the cold (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d-g</xref>). Consistent with prior reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, pharmacological experiments in several human cell lines (K562, HT1080, RPE, and HeLa cells) confirmed that cold-induced cell-loss occurred primarily via ferroptosis, with both antioxidant ferroptosis inhibitors (ferrostatin-1 and liproxstatin-1) and iron chelators (DFO and 2’2’-pyridine) increasing the cold survival in all four cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. By contrast, neither the Caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK nor the necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 significantly affected cell viability (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>).</p>
<p>To gain further insight into the genetic modifiers of human cell cold sensitivity and resistance, we designed and performed an additional CRISPR-Cas9 screen in cold-sensitive human K562 cells exposed to cold temperatures. A pooled lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 library targeting 19,381 genes (∼5 sgRNAs per gene) was delivered to K562 cells at an MOI of ∼0.5. Transduced cells were placed at 4°C for five days to allow for cold-induced cell death to occur in approximately 79 ± 1.76% of cells, followed by a three-day rewarming to 37°C to allow for amplification of remaining cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). This cold-rewarming cycle was repeated three times, with cells collected after each cycle to monitor the relative enrichment and depletion of individual sgRNAs. As in our prior screens, separate cultures transduced in parallel were maintained at 37°C for comparative analysis. In addition, to discriminate between ferroptosis-dependent and - independent regulators of cold tolerance, we conducted a parallel screen in cold-exposed K562 cells under continuous ferrostatin-1 treatment. As before, the efficiency and specificity of the screens were assessed based on effective depletion of characterized core essential genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> as well as the lack of depletion of negative control guides (250 nontargeting and 125 intergenic sgRNAs) (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref>).</p>

<p>To our surprise, this screen did not identify any genes whose disruption significantly enhanced K562 cold tolerance. By contrast, we identified 176 genes selectively required during cold cycling relative to constant 37°C control conditions (FDR &lt; 0.1, LFC &lt; −0.1, and requiring &gt;2 sgRNAs, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). It is notable that K562 cold survival was sensitive to the targeting of larger number of genes than the BHK-21 line, potentially indicating increased dependencies on genetic pathways which are not essential in BHK-21 cells (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref><bold>, Table S6</bold>). Among the pathways identified, we honed in on the selenocysteine incorporation pathway and observed <italic>GPX4</italic> and the selenocysteine incorporation genes <italic>PSTK</italic>, <italic>SEPSECS</italic>, and <italic>EEFSEC</italic> within the top-ranked K562 cold-protective genes, suggesting that the GPX4 pathway confers significant resistance to the cold not only in cold-tolerant hibernator cells, but also in cold-sensitive human cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4c-g</xref>). Notably, we identified 11 genes that were no longer essential (Fold enrichment &gt; 0.50, FDR &lt; 0.10) in the presence of Ferrostatin-1, indicating that these genes act to suppress cold-induced ferroptosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4h-n</xref><bold>, </bold><xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table S4</xref><bold>, S5</bold>). Although multiple pathways have been described as suppressors of ferroptosis in other contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, it is notable that 5 of 11 identified genes represent known components of the GPX4 pathway.</p>
<p>To confirm these findings, we generated three clonal <italic>GPX4</italic> knockout K562 cell lines and confirmed the loss of GPX4 via immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). Similar to our findings in BHK-21 cells, K562 <italic>GPX4</italic> knockout clones exhibited stunted growth and were expanded in the presence of liproxstatin-1 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4b</xref>).

These effects were dependent on GPX4 inhibition insofar as the cold tolerance of K562 <italic>GPX4</italic> knockout cells was unaffected by RSL3 treatment (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9</xref>). In addition, RSL3-driven cold-induced cell death was rescued by either ferrostatin-1 or DFO treatment, indicating that RSL3-induced cell loss occurs via the ferroptosis pathway (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>). Increased cold-induced death in the <italic>GPX4</italic> knockout K562 cell lines could be rescued upon lentiviral expression of either the cytosolic human (hs) or hamster (ma) GPX4, but not GFP or catalytically dead GPX4 variants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e</xref>). Together, our genetic and pharmacological studies reveal that K562 cells, despite being significantly less cold-tolerant than hamster BHK-21 cells, also rely on the GPX4 pathway to suppress cold-induced ferroptosis.</p>

<title>GPX4 catalytic activity is limiting for K562 cell cold tolerance</title>
<p>Given that the GPX4 pathway is active during cold exposure and essential for cold survival in both hamster BHK-21 and human K562 cells, it is somewhat surprising that these cell lines exhibit markedly different cold tolerances. In this regard, it has previously been suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> that upon cold exposure human cells, in contrast to hibernator-derived cells, rapidly deplete intracellular glutathione, an essential co-factor for GPX4 function, which could thus account for their increased cold sensitivity. To test this idea, we supplemented K562 growth media with either cell-permeable Glutathione reduced ethyl ester (GSH-MEE), N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), or L-Cystine, a glutathione precursor; however, these interventions failed to significantly increase K562 cells’ cold tolerance under our culture conditions (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Figure S10</xref>). We therefore examined the possibility that GPX4 protein levels in K562 cells are limiting for their cold tolerance. To this end, we generated K562 lines overexpressing either human or hamster GPX4. Both of these overexpression lines exhibited strikingly improved cold tolerance compared to the wild-type K562 parental line and a GFP-overexpressing control cell line (****<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5f</xref>. Indeed, GPX4-overexpressing K562 cells displayed comparable cold tolerance to that of hibernator-derived BHK-21 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d, g</xref>). To confirm that increased GPX4 catalytic activity was responsible for the improved cell cold tolerance, we generated additional K562 lines overexpressing catalytically dead forms of hamster or human GPX4 in which the active site selenocysteine was mutated to serine and found that these GPX4 mutant lines exhibited no increase in cold tolerance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5f</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that GPX4 abundance serve as a key limiting determinant of K562 cell cold tolerance. Moreover, our finding that human and hamster GPX4 overexpression confer comparable increases in K562 cold tolerance may indicate that the intrinsic activity of the hamster and human GPX4 enzymes are similar.</p>

<p>To examine the role of GPX4 in primary cell cold resistance, we transduced cells with Cas9 and sgRNAs targeting human <italic>GPX4</italic> to create a population of <italic>GPX4</italic> knockout human kidney fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>). Consistent with our prior findings in cell lines, GPX4 loss resulted in significantly decreased viability in the cold, which was largely rescued by ferrostatin-1 treatment in fibroblast cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>). Indeed, RSL3 treatment significantly decreased the viability of wild-type cold-exposed human kidney fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6c, d</xref>), and these effects were dependent on GPX4 inhibition as the cold tolerance of human kidney fibroblast <italic>GPX4</italic> knockout cells was largely unaffected by RSL3 treatment (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4c</xref>).</p>
<p>To more widely examine the dependence of primary cell cold tolerance on GPX4 activity, we obtained and tested fibroblasts derived from six mammalian species. We found the GPX4 activity widely contributes to cold tolerance across hibernators and non-hibernators was dependent on GPX4, as RSL3-treated cells showed increased cold-induced cell death that was largely rescued by ferrostatin-1 treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6e, f</xref>). We also extended these findings to a non-fibroblast cell type, obtaining similar results with primary cortical neuronal cultures prepared from neonatal mice and hamsters (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6g, h</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate that primary cell types are strongly sensitive to GPX4 loss in the cold and suggest that their differential cold sensitivities may reflect different levels of GPX4-mediated cold tolerance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Hibernators can lower their body temperature to ∼4°C for several days to weeks, indicating that their cells and tissues possess the ability to survive extended periods of cold. Previous studies have indicated that ferroptosis contributes to cold-induced cell death in cultured human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>; however, the genetic modifiers of cold sensitivity in hibernators and non-hibernators have yet to be systematically explored. Here, we conducted a series of unbiased genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in both hibernator- and non-hibernator-derived cells to investigate the mechanisms controlling cellular cold tolerance. Our findings, further validated using stable genetic knockout lines and pharmacological inhibitors, identify the GPX4 pathway as a critical suppressor of cold-induced cell death. Indeed, overexpression studies in human K562 cells suggest that GPX4 abundance can serve as a key limiting determinant of cellular cold tolerance. Notably, Sone et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> recently also identified GPX4 as a strong regulator of cold tolerance through overexpression screening. These independent findings further support the current study identifying GPX4 as a conserved suppressor of cold-induced cell death. The consistency of our observations across diverse cell lines and primary cells, including cells derived from six different mammalian species, argues that GPX4 serves as an essential and evolutionarily conserved mechanism to protect cells from cold-induced ferroptotic cell death.</p>
<p>During the course of our studies, we made the surprising observation that cells stained with the commonly employed membrane-impermeable dye trypan blue exhibit increased dye retention immediately after cold exposure, an artifact not reflecting genuine cell death. Rather, cell counting following brief rewarming yields more accurate results, in some cases reflecting significantly higher cell viability than previously appreciated. Employing this modified approach to measure cold-induced cell death across sixteen cell lines and primary cell types points to more nuanced variations in cold survival across cell types. These differences are highlighted by the pronounced contrast between the poor cold viability of human HT1080 cells and the robust cold tolerance observed in human fibroblasts. The underlying basis of this transient cell permeability for trypan blue following cold exposure remains unclear; however, it is noteworthy that in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> heat and chemical insults have been found to induce a brief window of membrane permeability to PI prior to membrane repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Likewise, uptake of propidium ions across intact cell membranes has been previously observed in bacteria showing high membrane potentials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Our observations suggest that further investigation into the mechanisms underlying transient membrane permeability in different cell types and stress conditions could lead to improved methods for accurately measuring cell viability, ultimately enhancing our understanding of cellular stress.</p>
<p>We report, to our knowledge, the first genome-scale hibernator CRISPR-Cas9 screen in cells derived from Syrian hamster. To create a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 library, we implemented a CRISPOR-based computational pipeline for sgRNA selection and benchmarked its success by carrying out the hamster and human screens described here. Our validated sgRNA libraries and associated algorithms should serve as a valuable resource to the hibernation community, as well as other scientific communities developing CRISPR-based tools for non-model organisms.</p>
<p>While our data point to GPX4 levels as a major determinant of cellular cold tolerance, whether endogenous levels of functional Gpx4 across various cell types correlates with their cold tolerance remains to be tested. It also remains possible that other factors such as GPX4 subcellular localization, the abundance of the cellular selenocysteine incorporation machinery, the abundance of glutathione, as well as GPX4-pathway independent factors all play important roles in limiting cold tolerance across various cell types. Although we did not see an increase in cold cell viability upon treatment of K562 cells with GSH-MEE, it is notable that in our screens, sgRNAs targeting genes involved in the glutathione biosynthesis (e.g. <italic>GCLC</italic>, <italic>GSS</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>) showed increased depletion in cold-exposed K562 versus BHK-21 cells (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Figure S10</xref>, <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Figure S11</xref>). This suggest a reduced dependency on the conventional glutathione biosynthetic pathway in cold-exposed BHK-21 cells. In addition, while our data points to a key cellular need to reduce cold-associated lipid hydroperoxides, the mechanisms that drive peroxide accumulation in the cold remain unclear. Specifically, the roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels, and free iron concentration should be further explored to understand the specific drivers of cold-induced ferroptotic cell death. Such insights have the potential to inform the development of more effective strategies for managing conditions exacerbated by cold exposure, such as ischemic injuries and organ transplantation.</p>
<p>We limited our current investigations to cell culture paradigms. However, future <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in hibernating organisms that naturally undergo profound drops in core body temperature could yield further insight into the adaptive mechanisms that govern cellular survival during periods of hibernation and torpor, while also allowing for the study of cold tolerance mechanisms in cell types that cannot presently be maintained in culture. Similarly, a <italic>Gpx4</italic> conditional knockout mouse line has been generated and used to show that <italic>Gpx4</italic> is essential for mitochondrial integrity and neuronal survival in adult animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>; however, these animals have not yet been used to evaluate the contribution of <italic>Gpx4</italic> to <italic>in vivo</italic> cellular and tissue cold tolerance.</p>
<p>The ability to hibernate and survive long-term cold exposure is present in many mammalian species from rodents to bats to primates, raising the possibility that the ability to enter hibernation and tolerate cold was an ancestral trait present in protoendotherms. Our observation that a single pathway centered around GPX4 is required across diverse mammalian species to protect cells from cold-induced cell death, raises a question whether GPX4 has a role in protection from cold-induced ferroptosis in other cold-tolerant vertebrates including fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds that also enter torpor. Such studies will advance our understanding of the evolved mechanisms by which cells mitigate cold-associated damage— one of the most common challenges faced by cells and organisms in nature.</p>

<title>Cell viability assay</title>
<p>Cells were seeded on 24-well culture plates at 50,000 cells per well and allowed to adhere for 24 hours at 37°C. Cells were then placed at 4°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for varying time periods (1, 4, or 7 days), with a 30-minute rewarming at 37°C before assessing cell viability via trypan blue (TB) (Thermo Fisher Scientific #15250061) staining. To assess cell viability using the TB assay, cells were washed with PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific #10010023), trypsinized and centrifuged at 300 x g for 3 minutes. The resulting pellet was resuspended in media, TB was added to a final concentration of 0.2%, and cells were manually counted using a hemocytometer.</p>

<title>Genome-wide library design</title>
<p>sgRNAs targeting the hamster genome build GCF_017639785.1 (BCM_Maur_2.0) were designed based on NCBI Refseq gene annotations. Protein-coding regions of all gene exons were filtered to retain only the most constitutively expressed exons and extended 20 nt on each end. These regions were provided as input for CRISPOR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> to pick and score all potential guides. For each gene, guides were filtered by potential problem flags and then ranked by an overall score derived from its efficiency (the Doench16/Fusi score), a custom motif penalty, a fractional frameshift (from the Lindel score and the fractional distance to the beginning of the region), and its specificity (derived from the MIT specificity score). For each gene, after the guide with the best score was chosen, subsequent guides were also penalized by a location score, adding a penalty for presence in the same exon and proximity to previously selected guides for the same gene. If more than ten potential guides were identified for a gene, the ten with the highest scores were selected.</p>
<p>For the human genome-wide library, we obtained a list of protein-coding genes in human based on Ensembl release 98. The top five sgRNAs were picked for protein-coding genes and controls, for a total of 102223 sgRNAs. Human intergenic sgRNAs were chosen by first subsetting the list of all designed intergenic-region-targeted sgRNAs by Rank = 1, then requiring the sgRNAs to target only one genomic locus. This list of 465 sgRNAs was ranked by MIT specificity score in descending order, and the top 449 sgRNAs were chosen.</p>

The vector was digested overnight at 37 °C with FastDigest Esp3I and FastAP (ThermoFisher Scientific), gel purified using a Zymoclean gel DNA recovery kit (ZymoResearch), and concentrated. NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs) was used in 2 x 40-80 µL bulk assembly reactions, for a combined total reaction volume of 160 µL containing 4 µg of vector and 160 ng of PCR amplicon (hamster) or 120 µL total containing 3 µg of vector and 120 ng of PCR amplicon (human). Each bulk reaction was distributed in 5 µL aliquots and incubated for 10 minutes at 52.2 °C, pooled, concentrated, introduced into Endura Electrocompetent DUO cells (Lucigen) by electroporation, and plated on 8-16 LB agar with 75 µg/mL carbenicillin in 245 mm x 245 mm square bioassay dishes. A dilution series was also plated to assess electroporation efficiency. Cells were incubated overnight at 30 °C, collected, and DNA was isolated using a ZymoPURE II Plasmid DNA Maxiprep kit (ZymoResearch). Plasmid from separate electroporations was combined proportionally based on electroporation efficiency for a combined total library coverage of &gt; 50-fold for each library.

<p>Cells were plated at 6×10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in a 6-well plate and maintained overnight at 37°C. Cells were then collected when wells were confluent. The media was aspirated, and cells were washed with ice-cold PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific #10010023). Cells were scraped in 100 µL of RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Na-Dexycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 8) with protease inhibitors (MilliporeSigma #04693159001) and collected in microcentrifuge tubes. The contents were then vortexed for 30 minutes at 4°C and centrifuged at 16000 x g for 20 minutes at 4°C.

<title>Primary neuron isolation and culture</title>
<p>Primary Syrian golden hamster and C57BL/6 mouse cortical neurons were isolated at postnatal day 0. The day before isolation, standard tissue culture treated plates were coated with 3 µg/mL Poly-L-Ornithine (MilliporeSigma #P4957) and warmed at 37°C for 24 hours. The morning of isolation, wells were washed with 1X PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific #10010023). To isolate neurons, pups were placed on ice for 2-5 minutes until movement ceased. Afterwards, they were washed with 10% ethanol, decapitated, and their heads placed in a 10x dissociation media bath (10.16 g MgCl<sub>2</sub> hexahydrate and 11.915 g HEPES in 450 mL HBSS brought to a pH of 7 using NaOH with subsequent addition of 1.182 g of kynurenic acid heated to 65% while stirring until the solution was fully dissolved and cooled to room temperature and adjusted to a pH of 7.2. The dissociation media was then diluted from 10X to 1X in HBSS and filtered through a 0.22-µm vacuum filter). Dissected brains were placed in fresh dissociation media, where the cortices were dissected out and transferred to 50 mL Falcon tubes on ice containing 1X dissociation media. Afterwards, the dissociation media was removed from the cortices and replaced with papain solution (5 mL 1x dissociation media, 5-7 grains of L-Cyteine, and 172 µL Worthington papain [crystalline suspension in 50mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5 incubated in 1.1mM EDTA, 0.067mM mercaptoethanol and 5.5mM cysteine-HCl at 37°C.

Afterwards, the papain solution was replaced with trypsin inhibitor solution (10 mg of trypsin inhibitor dissolved in 10 mL of 1X dissociation media, preheated to 37°C) and incubated subsequently at 37°C for 3-5 minutes, repeated 3 times. Afterwards, the trypsin inhibitor solution was carefully removed and replaced with 6 mL of preheated complete neurobasal media (5 mL of GlutaMAX5, 10 mL of B-27, 5 mL of penicillin/streptomycin in neurobasal media filtered through a 0.22-µm vacuum filter). Using a 5 mL pipette tip, corticies were triturated until no tissue clumps were present. The cortices were then passed through a 100-µm cell strainer to remove large debris and centrifuged at 300 x g for 3 minutes before resuspension in 5 mL of complete neurobasal media before plating at a density of 50,000 mixed cortical neuron isolated cells per well of a 24 well plate. Subsequently, 50% of the media was replaced every second day with fresh 37°Ç pre-warmed media.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Through a series of CRISPR-Cas9 screens, the GPX4 antioxidant pathway was identified as a critical suppressor of cold-induced cell death in hibernator-derived cells. Hamster BHK-21 cells exposed to repeated cold and rewarming cycles revealed five genes (Gpx4, Eefsec, Pstk, Secisbp2, and Sepsecs) as critical components of the GPX4 pathway, which protects against cold-induced ferroptosis. A second screen with continuous cold exposure confirmed the essential role of GPX4 in prolonged cold tolerance. GPX4 knockout lines exhibited complete cell death within four days of cold exposure, and pharmacological inhibition of GPX4 further increased cell death, underscoring the necessity of GPX4's catalytic activity in cold conditions.</p>
<p>An additional CRISPR screen in human cold-sensitive K562 cells identified 176 genes for cold survival. The GPX4 pathway was found to confer significant resistance to cold in hibernators and human cells, with GPX4 loss significantly increasing cold-induced cell death.</p>
<p>Comparing hamster and human GPX4, overexpression of GPX4 in human K562 cells, whether hamster or human GPX4, dramatically improved cold tolerance, while catalytically dead mutants showed no such effect. These findings suggest that GPX4 abundance is a key limiting factor for cold tolerance in human cells, and primary cell types show strong sensitivity to GPX4 loss, highlighting that differences in cold tolerance across species may be due to varying GPX4-mediated protection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Innovative Approach: The study employs a series of unbiased genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in both hibernator- and non-hibernator-derived cells to investigate the mechanisms controlling cellular cold tolerance. Notably, this is the first genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen conducted in cells derived from a hibernator, the Syrian hamster.</p>
<p>(2) Identification of the GPX4 Pathway: Identifying glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) as a critical suppressor of cold-induced cell death significantly contributes to the field. Recently, GPX4 was also reported as a potent regulator of cold tolerance through overexpression screening (Sone et al.) in hamsters, which further supports this finding.</p>
<p>(3) Improved Cold Viability Assessment: The study identifies an important technical artifact in using trypan blue to assess cell viability following cold exposure. It reveals that cells stained immediately after cold exposure retain the dye, inaccurately indicating cell death. By introducing a brief rewarming period before viability assessment, the authors significantly improve the accuracy of detecting cold-induced cell death. This refinement in methodology ensures more reliable results and sets a new standard for future research on cold stress in cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Mechanisms Regulating GPX4 Levels: While the study highlights GPX4 levels as a major determinant of cellular cold tolerance, it does not discuss how these levels are regulated or why they differ between hibernators and non-hibernators. This omission leaves an important aspect of GPX4's role in cold tolerance unexplored.</p>
<p>(2) Generalizability Across Species: Although the study demonstrates the role of GPX4 in several mammalian species, it does not investigate whether this mechanism extends to other vertebrates (e.g., fish and amphibians) that also face cold challenges. This limitation could restrict the broader evolutionary claims made by the study.</p>
<p>(3) Variability in Cold Sensitivity Across Human Cell Lines: The study observes significant variability in cold tolerance among different human cell lines but does not explain these differences clearly. This leaves a key aspect of human cell cold sensitivity insufficiently addressed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Lam et al., present a very intriguing whole genome CRISPR screen in Syrian Hamster cells as well as K562 cells to identify key genes involved in hypothermia-rewarming tolerance. Survival screens were performed by exposing cells to 4C in a cooled CO2 incubator followed by a rewarming period of 30 minutes prior to survival analysis. In this paradigm, Syrian hamster-derived cell lines exhibit more robust survival than human cell lines (BHK-21 and HaK vs HT1080, HeLa, RPE1, and K562). A genome-wide Syrian hamster CRISPR library was created targeting all annotated genes with 10 guides/gene. LV transduction of the library was performed in BHK-21 cells and the survival screen procedures involved 3 cycles of 4C cold exposure x4 days followed by 2 days of re-warming.</p>
<p>When compared to controls maintained at 37C, 9 genes were required for BHK-21 survival of cold cycling conditions and 5 of these 9 are known components of the GPX4 antioxidant pathway. GPX4 KO BHK-21 cells had reduced cell growth at 37C and profoundly worse cold tolerance which could be reduced by GPX4 expression. GPX4 inhibitors also reduced survival in cold. CRISPR KO screens and GPX4 KO in K562 cells revealed comparable results (though intriguingly glutathione biosynthesis genes were more critical to K562 cells than BHK-21 cells). Human or Syrian hamster GPX4 overexpression improved cold tolerance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a very nicely written paper that clearly communicates in figures and text complicated experimental manipulations and in vitro genetic screening and cell survival data. The focus on GPX4 is interesting and relatively novel. The converging pharmacologic, loss-of-function, and gain-of-function experiments are also a strength.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A recently published article (Reference 43, Sone et al.) also independently explored the role of GPX4 in Syrian hamster cold tolerance through gain-of-function screening. Further exploration of the GPX4 species-specific mechanisms would be of great interest, but this is considered a minor weakness given the already very comprehensive and compelling data presented.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work aims to address a fundamental biological question: how do mammalian cells achieve/lose tolerance to cold exposure? The authors first tried to establish an experimental system for cell cold exposure and evaluation of cell death and then performed genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening on immortalized cell lines from Syrian Hamster (BHK-21) and human (K562) for key genes that are associated with cell survival during prolonged cold exposure. From these screenings, they focused on glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Using genetic modifications or pharmacological interventions, and multiple cell models including primary cells from various mammalian species, they showed that GPX4 proteins are likely to retain their activities at 4 {degree sign}C, functioning to prevent cold-induced cell ferroptosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This paper is neatly written and hence easy to follow.</p>
<p>(2) Experiments are well designed.</p>
<p>(3) The data showing the overall good cell survival after a prolonged cold exposure or repeated cold-warm cycles are helpful to show the advantages of the experimental instruments and methods the authors used, and hence the validity of their results.</p>
<p>(4) The CRISPR-Cas9 screening is a great attempt.</p>
<p>(5) Multiple cell types from hibernating mammals (cold tolerant) and cold-intolerant species are used to test their findings.</p>
<p>(6) Although some may argue that other labs have published works with different approaches that have pointed out the importance of GPX4 and ferroptosis in hamster cell survival from anoxia-reoxygenation or cold exposure models, hence hurting the novelty of this work, this reviewer thinks that it is highly valuable to have independent research groups and different methods/systems to validate an important concept.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Only cell death was robustly surveyed; though cell proliferation was evaluated too in some experiments, other cellular functions, such as mitochondrial ATP production vs. glycolysis, and the extent of lipid peroxidation, could have been measured to reflect cellular physiology.</p>
<p>Validations on complex tissues or in vivo systems would have further strengthened the work and its impact.</p>
<p>CRISPR-Cas9 screening may have technical limitations as knock-out of some essential genes/pathways may lead to cell lethality during screening, and hence the relevance of these genes/pathways to cell cold tolerance may not be noted. From the data presented in this study, this reviewer thinks that the GPX4 pathway is likely a conserved mechanism for long-term cold survival, but not for cold sensitivity or acute cell death from cold exposure. In line with my such speculation, their CRISPR-Cas9 screening revealed genes in the GPX4 pathway from a relatively cold-sensitive human cell line, but the endogenous GPX4 pathway is seemingly operational in this cold-sensitive cell line. Also, these cells are viable after GPX4 knock-out. Dead cells from the acute cold exposure phase may detached, or their genomic DNAs have been severely damaged by the time of sample collection, hence not giving any meaningful sequencing reads. Crippling other factors/pathways such as FOXO1 (PMID: 38570500) or 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) metabolism (PMID: 35401816) have been shown to severely aggravate cold-induced cell death, including TUNEL-revealed DNA damage, within a much shorter time scale, whilst loss-function knockouts of FOXO1 or ALA Synthase 1 (ALAS1) are usually cell lethal. Thus, they and other possible essential genes may not be screenable from the current experimental protocol. These important points need to be taken into consideration by the authors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Through a series of CRISPR-Cas9 screens, the GPX4 antioxidant pathway was identified as a critical suppressor of cold-induced cell death in hibernator-derived cells. Hamster BHK-21 cells exposed to repeated cold and rewarming cycles revealed five genes (Gpx4, Eefsec, Pstk, Secisbp2, and Sepsecs) as critical components of the GPX4 pathway, which protects against cold-induced ferroptosis. A second screen with continuous cold exposure confirmed the essential role of GPX4 in prolonged cold tolerance. GPX4 knockout lines exhibited complete cell death within four days of cold exposure, and pharmacological inhibition of GPX4 further increased cell death, underscoring the necessity of GPX4's catalytic activity in cold conditions.</p>
<p>An additional CRISPR screen in human cold-sensitive K562 cells identified 176 genes for cold survival. The GPX4 pathway was found to confer significant resistance to cold in hibernators and human cells, with GPX4 loss significantly increasing cold-induced cell death.</p>
<p>Comparing hamster and human GPX4, overexpression of GPX4 in human K562 cells, whether hamster or human GPX4, dramatically improved cold tolerance, while catalytically dead mutants showed no such effect. These findings suggest that GPX4 abundance is a key limiting factor for cold tolerance in human cells, and primary cell types show strong sensitivity to GPX4 loss, highlighting that differences in cold tolerance across species may be due to varying GPX4-mediated protection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Innovative Approach: The study employs a series of unbiased genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in both hibernator- and non-hibernator-derived cells to investigate the mechanisms controlling cellular cold tolerance. Notably, this is the first genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen conducted in cells derived from a hibernator, the Syrian hamster.</p>
<p>(2) Identification of the GPX4 Pathway: Identifying glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) as a critical suppressor of cold-induced cell death significantly contributes to the field. Recently, GPX4 was also reported as a potent regulator of cold tolerance through overexpression screening (Sone et al.) in hamsters, which further supports this finding.</p>
<p>(3) Improved Cold Viability Assessment: The study identifies an important technical artifact in using trypan blue to assess cell viability following cold exposure. It reveals that cells stained immediately after cold exposure retain the dye, inaccurately indicating cell death. By introducing a brief rewarming period before viability assessment, the authors significantly improve the accuracy of detecting cold-induced cell death. This refinement in methodology ensures more reliable results and sets a new standard for future research on cold stress in cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Mechanisms Regulating GPX4 Levels: While the study highlights GPX4 levels as a major determinant of cellular cold tolerance, it does not discuss how these levels are regulated or why they differ between hibernators and non-hibernators. This omission leaves an important aspect of GPX4's role in cold tolerance unexplored.</p>
<p>(2) Generalizability Across Species: Although the study demonstrates the role of GPX4 in several mammalian species, it does not investigate whether this mechanism extends to other vertebrates (e.g., fish and amphibians) that also face cold challenges. This limitation could restrict the broader evolutionary claims made by the study.</p>
<p>(3) Variability in Cold Sensitivity Across Human Cell Lines: The study observes significant variability in cold tolerance among different human cell lines but does not explain these differences clearly. This leaves a key aspect of human cell cold sensitivity insufficiently addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive evaluation and thoughtful comments on the manuscript. We acknowledge that our study does not delve into the mechanisms regulating GPX4 levels, including differences between hibernators and non-hibernators, differences between cell types, or the possibility that GPX4 levels are dynamically regulated by environmental conditions. We consider these as interesting open questions that could be addressed in future studies.</p>
<p>While our study focused entirely on mammalian species, we agree that examining cold tolerance mechanisms across a broader range of vertebrates, including fish and amphibians, could enhance our evolutionary perspective. Interestingly, previous work has indicated that C.elegans adapt to cold temperatures through ferritin mediated Fe2+ detoxification. This suggests that cold induces Fe2+-mediated toxicity in C.elegans as well as mammalian cells, but that the mechanisms through which distantly related species counteract cold-mediated cell death may vary.</p>
<p>Finally, we agree that the variability in cold sensitivity across human cell lines could be further explored, and we will strongly consider conducting follow up experiments to examine the extent to which this variability is driven by levels of GPX4.</p>
<p>We are grateful for these insightful comments, as they highlight important avenues for future research. Addressing these questions will enable a more comprehensive understanding of GPX4's role in cold tolerance and its evolutionary significance across diverse organisms.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Lam et al., present a very intriguing whole genome CRISPR screen in Syrian Hamster cells as well as K562 cells to identify key genes involved in hypothermia-rewarming tolerance. Survival screens were performed by exposing cells to 4C in a cooled CO2 incubator followed by a rewarming period of 30 minutes prior to survival analysis. In this paradigm, Syrian hamster-derived cell lines exhibit more robust survival than human cell lines (BHK-21 and HaK vs HT1080, HeLa, RPE1, and K562). A genome-wide Syrian hamster CRISPR library was created targeting all annotated genes with 10 guides/gene. LV transduction of the library was performed in BHK-21 cells and the survival screen procedures involved 3 cycles of 4C cold exposure x4 days followed by 2 days of re-warming.</p>
<p>When compared to controls maintained at 37C, 9 genes were required for BHK-21 survival of cold cycling conditions and 5 of these 9 are known components of the GPX4 antioxidant pathway. GPX4 KO BHK-21 cells had reduced cell growth at 37C and profoundly worse cold tolerance which could be reduced by GPX4 expression. GPX4 inhibitors also reduced survival in cold. CRISPR KO screens and GPX4 KO in K562 cells revealed comparable results (though intriguingly glutathione biosynthesis genes were more critical to K562 cells than BHK-21 cells). Human or Syrian hamster GPX4 overexpression improved cold tolerance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a very nicely written paper that clearly communicates in figures and text complicated experimental manipulations and in vitro genetic screening and cell survival data. The focus on GPX4 is interesting and relatively novel. The converging pharmacologic, loss-of-function, and gain-of-function experiments are also a strength.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A recently published article (Reference 43, Sone et al.) also independently explored the role of GPX4 in Syrian hamster cold tolerance through gain-of-function screening. Further exploration of the GPX4 species-specific mechanisms would be of great interest, but this is considered a minor weakness given the already very comprehensive and compelling data presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s compliments and thoughtful comments on our manuscript. We agree with the reviewer that our approach (dual unbiased genome-scale screens in human and hamster cells) and the recent investigation by Sone et al (gain-of-function screening involving the insertion of hamster cDNA into human cells) mutually strengthen the importance of GPX4 in cold tolerance across cell types and species.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work aims to address a fundamental biological question: how do mammalian cells achieve/lose tolerance to cold exposure? The authors first tried to establish an experimental system for cell cold exposure and evaluation of cell death and then performed genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening on immortalized cell lines from Syrian Hamster (BHK-21) and human (K562) for key genes that are associated with cell survival during prolonged cold exposure. From these screenings, they focused on glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Using genetic modifications or pharmacological interventions, and multiple cell models including primary cells from various mammalian species, they showed that GPX4 proteins are likely to retain their activities at 4 {degree sign}C, functioning to prevent cold-induced cell ferroptosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This paper is neatly written and hence easy to follow.</p>
<p>(2) Experiments are well designed.</p>
<p>(3) The data showing the overall good cell survival after a prolonged cold exposure or repeated cold-warm cycles are helpful to show the advantages of the experimental instruments and methods the authors used, and hence the validity of their results.</p>
<p>(4) The CRISPR-Cas9 screening is a great attempt.</p>
<p>(5) Multiple cell types from hibernating mammals (cold tolerant) and cold-intolerant species are used to test their findings.</p>
<p>(6) Although some may argue that other labs have published works with different approaches that have pointed out the importance of GPX4 and ferroptosis in hamster cell survival from anoxia-reoxygenation or cold exposure models, hence hurting the novelty of this work, this reviewer thinks that it is highly valuable to have independent research groups and different methods/systems to validate an important concept.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Only cell death was robustly surveyed; though cell proliferation was evaluated too in some experiments, other cellular functions, such as mitochondrial ATP production vs. glycolysis, and the extent of lipid peroxidation, could have been measured to reflect cellular physiology.</p>
<p>Validations on complex tissues or in vivo systems would have further strengthened the work and its impact.</p>
<p>CRISPR-Cas9 screening may have technical limitations as knock-out of some essential genes/pathways may lead to cell lethality during screening, and hence the relevance of these genes/pathways to cell cold tolerance may not be noted. From the data presented in this study, this reviewer thinks that the GPX4 pathway is likely a conserved mechanism for long-term cold survival, but not for cold sensitivity or acute cell death from cold exposure. In line with my such speculation, their CRISPR-Cas9 screening revealed genes in the GPX4 pathway from a relatively cold-sensitive human cell line, but the endogenous GPX4 pathway is seemingly operational in this cold-sensitive cell line. Also, these cells are viable after GPX4 knock-out. Dead cells from the acute cold exposure phase may detached, or their genomic DNAs have been severely damaged by the time of sample collection, hence not giving any meaningful sequencing reads. Crippling other factors/pathways such as FOXO1 (PMID: 38570500) or 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) metabolism (PMID: 35401816) have been shown to severely aggravate cold-induced cell death, including TUNEL-revealed DNA damage, within a much shorter time scale, whilst loss-function knockouts of FOXO1 or ALA Synthase 1 (ALAS1) are usually cell lethal. Thus, they and other possible essential genes may not be screenable from the current experimental protocol. These important points need to be taken into consideration by the authors.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the novelty of using genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens and the validation of GPX4 function across cell types and mammalian species.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that our study primarily focused on measuring cell death using Trypan Blue dye exclusion. To validate the Trypan Blue assay, cell survival data was orthogonally measured using the LDH release assays (Fig. 1g). The proliferation potential of putatively live cells was assessed by counting the increase in live cells following 24 h at 37°C (Fig. 1b). Prompted by your question, we will add additional data to the final version of the manuscript in which we show that following 1 day at 4°C, K562 cells rapidly restarted their cell cycle and double in numbers every 21 hours (Author response image 1). This rate is indistinguishable from the replication rate of cells that were not previously exposed to 4°C, suggesting that the cells following cold exposure are both alive and functionally capable of replicating.</p>

<p>We agree that assessing additional cellular functions, such as mitochondrial ATP production, glycolysis, lipid metabolism and peroxidation could provide a more comprehensive understanding of cellular physiology under cold stress and would be valuable future studies. Similarly, we appreciate the suggestion to validate our findings in complex tissues or in vivo models. We recognize that such validation could strengthen the implications of our study and enhance its translational potential; however, due to their complexity, we believe that these additional studies are beyond the scope of our current study.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that CRISPR-Cas9 screens have limitations. For example our screen was designed to identify genes that are preferentially required for cellular fitness at 4°C versus 37°C. There are many genes that are required for cellular survival at 4°C as well as 37°C that are not discussed (Table S2, S5). Also, given that the screen is designed to disrupt a single gene per cell, genes that have redundant functions in cold-tolerance will likely be missed. Given the reviewer’s questions, we will expand the discussion of the paper to highlight limitations of the screen.</p>
<p>We apologize for any lack of clarity about the methods we employed during the screen and will expand the methods section to provide further details. For example, for the BHK-21 screen we eliminated dead cells by sequencing cells that reattached after rewarming to 37°C for either 30 minutes (15 day cold exposure screen) or 24 hours (4°C cycling screen). Indeed, at the point of cell collection for both BHK-21 and K562 screens, the fraction of live cells was greater than 92% and 95%, respectively.  We respectfully disagree with the reviewer that our screens would miss genes that affect acute cold tolerance. Any cells that would have died either early or late during cold exposure would have not been sequenced, and thus the sgRNAs targeting a specific gene in those cells would appear depleted, regardless of whether these cells died early/acutely or later during cold exposure.</p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out two additionally highly relevant studies. Interestingly, the genes implicated in cold tolerance in these studies, FOXO1 and ALAS1, did not appear essential for survival at 37°C or 4°C  in BHK-21 or K562 cells. There are several possibilities that could explain this finding: 1) our screen may not have successfully knocked out these genes, 2) other proteins may have compensated for their loss, or 3) these pathways may regulate cold tolerance in some but not all cell types. We apologize that in the current version of the manuscript we did not reflect on these recent studies. We will expand our discussion to include their findings.</p>
<p>Once again, we are grateful for the reviewer’s insights, which have highlighted key areas for further exploration as well as pointed to specific ways to improve our manuscript.</p>
