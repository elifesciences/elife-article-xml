<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Current in vitro models of developmental blood formation lack spatio-temporal accuracy and weakly replicate successive waves of hematopoiesis. Herein, we describe a mouse embryonic stem cell (SC)-derived 3D hemogenic gastruloid (hGx) that captures multi-wave blood formation, progenitor specification from hemogenic endothelium (HE), and generates hematopoietic SC precursors capable of short-term engraftment of immunodeficient mice upon maturation in an adrenal niche. We took advantage of the hGx model to interrogate the origins of infant acute myeloid leukemia (infAML). We focused on MNX1-driven leukemia, representing the commonest genetic abnormality unique to the infant group. Enforced MNX1 expression in hGx promotes the expansion and in vitro transformation of yolk sac-like erythroid-myeloid progenitors (EMP) at the HE-to-hematopoietic transition to faithfully recapitulate patient transcriptional signatures. By combining phenotypic, functional and transcriptional profiling, including at the single-cell level, we establish the hGx as a useful new model for the study of normal and leukemic embryonic hematopoiesis</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Blood formation in the embryo is a multi-stage process that develops across multiple cellular niches, reflecting a complex hierarchy of tissue interactions. It involves sequential production of distinct cell types in so-called hematopoietic waves, separated in time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lacaud and Kouskoff, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Costa, Kouskoff and Lacaud, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Medvinsky, Rybtsov and Taoudi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Dzierzak and Bigas, 2018</xref>). The first wave of hematopoiesis produces unipotent red blood cell and macrophage precursors in the yolk sac (YS) from an angioblast precursor which can also form endothelium; it occurs at mouse embryo day (E)7-E7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Fujimoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">McGrath and Palis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Moore and Metcalf, 1970</xref>). The subsequent wave, known as definitive, produces: first, oligopotent erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) in the YS (E8-E8.5); and later myelo-lymphoid progenitors (MLPs – E9.5-E10), multipotent progenitors (MPPs – E10-E11.5), and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs – E10.5-E11.5), in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region of the embryo proper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ivanovs <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">McGrath <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Palis <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Medvinsky and Dzierzak, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Medvinsky, Rybtsov and Taoudi, 2011</xref>). Definitive blood waves are characteristically specified from a specialised hemogenic endothelium (HE) through a process of endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Zovein <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Li, W. <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). HSC specification from HE is the last event in hematopoietic development and occurs in characteristic cell clusters found on the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ivanovs <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boisset <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). All blood cell types enter circulation from their original locations and migrate to the fetal liver (FL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ciriza <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ghiaur <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Most embryonic blood progenitors are transient and sustain blood production exclusively during embryonic development, through differentiation. In contrast, HSCs make little or no contribution to embryonic and fetal blood: instead, they proliferate (i.e. self-renew) to expand their numbers. At least a subset of HSC migrates to the bone marrow (BM) niche at the end of gestation and balances self-renewal and differentiation to maintain blood production throughout the entire post-natal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bowie <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kikuchi and Kondo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ganuza <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Yokomizo <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Blood progenitors and HSCs can be targeted by genetic alterations that confer clonal advantage and/or drive initiation and development of leukemia. Leukemia is the most common malignancy and the most common cause of cancer-related death in the paediatric age group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Steliarova-Foucher <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dong <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Several paediatric leukemias originate <italic>in utero</italic>, and a subset of these are driven by mutations exclusive to the paediatric group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Masetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cazzola <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Such pediatric-exclusive mutations target blood cell types restricted to development or depend on signals that are specific to embryonic hematopoietic niches, effectively defining distinct biological entities to adult malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cazzola <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bolouri <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chaudhury <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Dissection of these forms of developmental leukemia is confounded by the inability to robustly identify and isolate their embryonic cells of origin, and/or to fully recapitulate the disease in post-natal cells, which leads to failure in generating relevant targeted therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alexander and Mullighan, 2021</xref>). One such example is t(7;12)(q36;p13) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) driven by rearrangement and overexpression of the <italic>MNX1</italic> gene locus: <italic>MNX1</italic>-rearranged (MNX1-<italic>r</italic>) AML is restricted to infants under the age of 2 and carries a high risk of relapse and poor survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ragusa <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). <italic>MNX1</italic> is a developmental gene required for specification of motor neurons and pancreatic acinar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Thaler <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Harrison <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). MNX1 is not known to participate in embryonic haematopoiesis, however it has been discordantly described to be expressed in some subsets of adult haematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Deguchi and Kehrl, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nagel <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Wildenhain <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Taketani <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). It is ectopically expressed in AML cells carrying one of a variable set of t(7;12) translocations which place the normally silent <italic>MNX1</italic> gene under the control of <italic>ETV6</italic> regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Weichenhan <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bousquets-Muñoz <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ragusa <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ballabio <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). <italic>ETV6</italic> is required for hematopoietic cell specification from HE via VEGF signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ciau-Uitz <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), potentially positioning <italic>MNX1</italic> within a critical embryonic hemogenic regulatory network.</p>
<p>Faithful <italic>in vitro</italic> recapitulation of developmental blood cell types and their embryonic niches has the potential to dissect the cellular and molecular mechanisms presiding at initiation of developmental leukemia, reveal prognostic biomarkers, and indicate therapeutic vulnerabilities which are otherwise challenging to test in the embryo. Despite widespread use of embryonic stem (ES) cell and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-based models of blood specification, a system which recapitulates the spatial and temporal complexity of embryonic blood formation within the respective time-dependent niches is still lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dijkhuis <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). In the last few years, gastruloid models have emerged as robust avatars of early development, self-organising processes of symmetry breaking, elongation, multi-axis formation, somitogenesis and early organogenesis, with remarkable similarity to embryo processes in space and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">van den Brink, Susanne C and van Oudenaarden, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beccari <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">van den Brink, Susanne C <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Gastruloids are grown individually in a multi-well format that facilitates tracking and screening of developmental processes. Relevant to blood formation, a variant gastruloid culture system, which successful organises a heart primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Rossi <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), was also able to recapitulate YS blood formation with erythroid and myeloid cellularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Rossi <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Rossi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Herein, we describe a new protocol of gastruloid formation, i.e. hemogenic gastruloids (hGx), that captures YS and AGM-like waves of definitive blood progenitor specification from HE. The AGM-like wave includes cells capable of short-term hematopoietic engraftment of the spleen and BM of immunodeficient mice, overall suggesting nearly full EMP-to-MPP/HSC recapitulation of embryonic blood development. We harnessed the embryonic haematopoietic context provided by hGx for modelling MNX1-<italic>r</italic> infant leukemia by proxy of <italic>MNX1</italic> overexpression. MNX1-overexpressing hGx showed expansion of cells at the HE-to-EMP transition, which became susceptible to transformation <italic>in vitro</italic> and recapitulated MNX1-<italic>r</italic> AML patient signatures, placing <italic>MNX1</italic>’s leukemogenic effects at a very early stage of developmental blood formation.</p>

<title>HGxs capture cellularity and topography of developmental blood formation</title>
<p>With the aim of recapitulating embryonic haematopoiesis with spatial and temporal accuracy, we modified existing gastruloid formation protocols to promote the specification of hemogenic mesoderm derivatives and extend developmental time beyond the E8.0-equivalent of early developmental gastruloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Van den Brink, Susanne C <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>) and the E9.0 timepoint of cardiogenic gastruloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Rossi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). We established a 216h hGx protocol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) using a <italic>Flk1-GFP</italic> mouse ES cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jakobsson <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), which allows the tracking of early hemato-endothelial specification by expression of the <italic>Flk1</italic> (i.e. <italic>Kdr</italic>) <italic>locus</italic>. Activation of the <italic>Flk1</italic> expression, visible by fluorescence of the GFP tag, necessitated induction of the TGF-β signalling pathway by Activin A, in addition to the characteristic gastruloid patterning via WNT activation by CHI99021 supplementation at 48h (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1A</xref>). We sought to promote hemato-endothelial programmes through addition of VEGF and FGF2 at 72h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Sroczynska <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), and observed extension of a polarised <italic>Flk1-GFP</italic>-expressing cellular network (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), which included VE-cadherin<sup>+</sup> C-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells suggestive of EHT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-D</xref>). This process of HE specification and EHT peaked at 120-144h; it was followed by a surge in CD41<sup>+</sup> candidate hematopoietic cells at 144h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). In our experience, observation of early polarised activation of the <italic>Flk1 locus</italic> at 96h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) was predictive of CD41<sup>+</sup> detection 2 days later, suggesting that TGF-β activation in early patterning is required for later hematopoietic development, putatively by modifying mesoderm specification. We extended the protocol by incorporation of a 24-hour pulse of sonic hedgehog (Shh) between 144-168h to mimic the aortic patterning that precedes cluster formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Rybtsov <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Continued exposure to VEGF after the Shh pulse resulted in specification of CD45<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic cells progenitors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-E</xref>), which increased after 168h. The proportion of CD45<sup>+</sup> cells was enhanced by the addition of SCF, FLT3L and TPO (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1B-C</xref>), a combination of cytokines normally used for HSC maintenance; conversely, it did not require continued addition of FGF2 after 168h (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1D</xref>), which was omitted. CD45<sup>+</sup> cells appeared in a small number of ‘cluster’-like structures adjacent to CD31<sup>+</sup> endothelium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), which were reminiscent of HSC and progenitor cell budding from the aortic HE, and suggested recapitulation of hemogenic tissue architecture. Time-dependent specification of C-Kit<sup>+</sup>, CD41<sup>+</sup> and CD45<sup>+</sup> cells in hGxs could be obtained with other mouse ES cell lines, including commonly used E14Tg2a (E14) cells (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1E-G</xref>), with successful specification of comparable frequencies of CD45<sup>+</sup> progenitors (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1H</xref>), attesting to the reproducibility of the protocol.</p>

<p>Overall, our extended hGx model could capture successive specification of HE, CD41<sup>+</sup> and CD45<sup>+</sup> cells, with temporal and spatial congruence relative to the embryo, thus showing initial promise as a tool for the exploration of normal and perturbed developmental hematopoiesis.</p>
<p>To better characterize the extent and progression of developmental hematopoiesis in hGx, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) time-course analysis of gastruloid cell specification. We sorted cells from 2 independent hGx cultures at 120, 144, 168, 192 and 216h, and profiled a total of 846 cells using the Smart-Seq2 protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Picelli <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>) (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2A</xref>). We analysed unfractionated live single hGx cells at 120-192h and enriched the dataset with sorted CD41<sup>+</sup> cells at their peak time of 144h, and sorted CD45<sup>+</sup> cells at 192 and 216h. At timepoints of significant enrichment in CD41<sup>+</sup> (144h) and CD45<sup>+</sup> cells (192h) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), we also sorted C-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells. Library preparation and sequencing generated an average of 120000 reads/cell, which were mapped to an average of 4000 genes/cell, with minimal signs of cell stress / death as measured by mitochondrial DNA fraction (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2B</xref>). Read and gene counts were similar between biological replicates, cell types and at different time points (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2C</xref>). The exception was 120h unfractionated hGx cells, which despite similar sequencing depth (average read counts), were mapped to twice the number of genes (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2C</xref>), possibly reflecting multi-gene program priming at the onset of hemogenic specification. We selected highly varying genes (HVG) before principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction and retained the most relevant dimensions. In the PCA reduced space, we constructed a KNN graph and used uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) to visualize the data on 2 dimensions, looking for cell communities using Leiden clustering (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We identified 12 cell clusters of which 2 (clusters 0 and 5) almost exactly mapped to C-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells (also Sca-1<sup>+</sup>), 2 (clusters 1 and 8) contained CD45<sup>+</sup> sorted cells, and cluster 4 uniquely captured the CD41<sup>+</sup> cells observed at 144h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Although some unfractionated cells overlapped with the hemogenic cell clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> - center), most occupied different transcriptional spaces, reflecting the frequency of hematopoietic cells and suggesting the presence of potential hemogenic niches.</p>

<p>To explore tissue and lineage affiliation of the different clusters, we performed differential gene expression against all other cells using Wilcoxon ranking test, and established cluster classifier gene lists (<xref rid="d1e2818" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental File S1</xref>). Top classifier genes for clusters 0 and 5 had endothelial affiliation (<xref rid="d1e2818" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental File S1</xref>), and the cellular composition of the clusters broadly reflected their time signature (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>): cluster 5 comprised 144h cells and cluster 0 included most C-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells at 192h. Cluster 5 occupied the vicinity of 144h-CD41<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), which carried an erythroid-biased signature (<xref rid="d1e2818" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental File S1</xref>). On the other hand, 192/216h-CD45<sup>+</sup> cells in cluster 8 expressed myeloid and lymphoid genes (<xref rid="d1e2818" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental File S1</xref>). The remaining clusters largely corresponded to time-restricted unfractionated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> - right), with clusters of cells present at later time-points matching mesenchymal stromal cell and autonomic neuron signatures (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2D</xref>), potentially configuring incipient formation of niches relevant to production of HSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kapeni <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Fitch <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>To further characterise the identity of hGx cells, we interrogated lineage priming in individual hemato-endothelial cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>), to probe the presence of putative multilineage YS (EMP) and AGM (MLP/MPP) progenitors, and HE cells. The heatmaps (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>) show expression of lineage markers and regulators, with unsupervised clustering of cells (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2E-F</xref>) and genes. The gene list used was identical in both analyses, with only expressed genes shown. Concordance between sorting antigens and expression of the respective genes (<italic>Kit</italic>, <italic>Itga2b</italic> [CD41] and <italic>Ptprc</italic> [CD45]) was partial potentially reflecting low levels of transcript expression in the hGx system. Summary of endothelial, co-expressing erythro-myeloid (EM) and co-expressing myelo-lymphoid (ML) programs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) clearly associates the first with C-Kit<sup>+</sup> and the latter with CD45<sup>+</sup> cells; CD41<sup>+</sup> cells capture a heterogeneous population, which includes a proportion of cells co-expressing erythroid and myeloid genes that constitute candidate EMPs.</p>
<p>Clustering of cells sorted as C-Kit<sup>+</sup> did not separate the 144h and 192h time-points (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2E</xref>), indicating that the relative separation on the global UMAP was not based on endothelial identity genes. We observed widespread expression of arterial genes (e.g. <italic>Flt1</italic>, <italic>Efnb2</italic>) with relative reciprocity with venous endothelial genes (e.g. <italic>Flt4</italic>) supporting specification of both types of endothelia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). There was limited co-expression of hematopoietic genes, but genes associated with endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT), e.g. <italic>Gata2</italic>, <italic>Notch1</italic>, and <italic>Procr</italic>, were significantly more frequent within the C-Kit<sup>+</sup> population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Specific associations of <italic>Cd44</italic> and <italic>Procr</italic> with the 192h time-point (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>) putatively represent aorta-like EHT.</p>
<p>Clustering of CD41<sup>+</sup> and CD45<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2F</xref>) more clearly separates unique hematopoietic signatures. A subset of cells, predominantly CD41<sup>+</sup>, expresses high levels of globin genes. While embryonic β-globin chains are highly expressed, there is a gain in fetal <italic>Hbb-y</italic> and adult <italic>Hbb-bt</italic> and <italic>Hbb-bs</italic> (C57Bl/6 strain-specific β major and β minor, respectively) in CD45<sup>+</sup> cells at 216h, indicative of AGM-like progenitor identity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). 192 and 216h cells with high expression of <italic>Ptprc</italic> have an MLP profile (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-D</xref>), co-expressing myeloid and lymphoid genes including immunoglobulin chains. There is progression of the lymphoid signature between 192 and 216h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2G</xref>). Other CD45<sup>+</sup> cells have low-frequency expression of HSC-associated transcription factors, including <italic>Myb</italic>, <italic>Hlf</italic> and <italic>Hoxa9</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref> and <xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2I-J</xref>), suggesting incipient specification of AGM-like MPP and pre-HSC, albeit with incomplete programming.</p>
<p>Altogether, single-cell RNA-seq data suggest that hGx specifies YS-like and AGM-like progenitors in a time-dependent manner, with concomitant emergence of hematopoietic-supporting niche cells. The data suggested putative incipient specification of rare candidate MPP or pre-HSC, which we investigated further in comparison with mouse AGM datasets and at a functional level.</p>
<p>We made use of a dataset recently published by one of us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Thambyrajah <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>) that interrogates the mouse AGM at the point of HSC emergence from the dorsal aorta HE. In this study, a combination of surface markers and <italic>Gfi1</italic> locus reporting of EHT, tested functionally through transplantation, identified HE and HSC-enriched clusters (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3A</xref> - clusters 1 and 2, respectively, with cluster 4 a putatively heterogenous cluster at the transition between the 2 states). We projected cell transcription profiles from hGx to AGM using a version of scmap algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kiselev, Yiu and Hemberg, 2018</xref>) with 1-cell and 3-cell neighbourhoods for lower and higher levels of confidence on similarity projections (respectively gray and black circles on <xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3A</xref> - left). The numbers of cluster-specific hGx cells projected onto AGM clusters is quantified in <xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3B</xref>. Top differentially expressed genes (DEG) between AGM HE and HSC-projected hGx cells are represented in Fig. <xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3C</xref> and <xref rid="d1e2825" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental File S2</xref>.</p>
<p>With respect to HE specification, we observed that a subset of hGx C-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells present in endothelial clusters 5 and 0 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) projected onto the AGM HE-identity cluster 1 (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3A</xref>), with more frequent similarity amongst hGx 192h cluster 0 (41%) than 144h cluster 5 (21%). Overall, this supports the notion that specification of endothelial and HE cells in hGx follows with time-dependent developmental progression into putative AGM-like HE. Lineage identity genes supported the nature of HE-projected hGx cells (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3D</xref>), which expressed <italic>Gata2</italic> but not <italic>Runx1</italic>, <italic>Myb</italic>, or <italic>Gfi1b</italic>, indicating that EHT occurs downstream of these cells. We then asked if any of the hGx cells in hemopoietic clusters bore resemblance to cells from the HSC-enriched AGM cluster 2. We observed that most (85%) hGx CD45<sup>+</sup> cells in cluster 8 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) projected onto the HSC-enriched cluster 2, which also showed similarity with 76% of CD41<sup>+</sup>-enriched hGx cluster 4 cells. The relative positioning of hGx cells cluster 4 and cluster 8 progressively further away from the AGM HE cluster was in line with the time-dependent specification in the hGx. However, the lineage marker programs (Fig. <xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3D</xref>) expressed by the hGx cells, although definitive in nature (e.g. there is expression of immunoglobulin chains and adult β-globins), lacked detection of HSC genes like <italic>Hlf</italic>, <italic>Gfi1</italic>, or <italic>Hoxa9</italic>. On the other hand, <italic>Mllt3</italic> was present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Calvanese <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), even in the absence of an erythroid signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Pina <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), suggesting a developing pre-HSC program compatible with the co-expression of multi-lineage markers (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3D</xref>).</p>

<p>As an ultimate test of the presence of pre-HSC, we tested whether late-stage 216h hGx contained cells capable of hematopoietic engraftment of immunodeficient mice. In early experiments, we transplanted dissociated hGx cells into irradiated immunocompetent C57Bl/6 recipients, sub-lethally irradiated immunodeficient NSG mice, or non-conditioned NSGW41 hosts, but failed to detect signs of engraftment of peripheral blood, spleen (Spl) or bone marrow (BM) at 12 days (including absence of spleen colony formation), at 4-6 weeks (short-term engraftment), or beyond 8-10 weeks (long-term engraftment) by either flow cytometry detection of CD45.2 or by genomic DNA (gDNA) PCR analysis of the <italic>Flk1-GFP</italic> locus. However, given the absence of clear HSC-like transcriptional programs in 216h CD45<sup>+</sup> cells, as analysed by scRNA-seq (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>), and in light of the late specification of mesenchymal or sympathetic neuronal cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2D</xref>) putatively supportive of HSC formation, we hypothesized that hGx pre-HSC required additional maturation in a relevant supportive niche. We thus tested implantation of undissociated hGx in the adrenal gland of <italic>Nude</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), a topography commonly used to support tumor development, and recently shown to support adult haematopoietic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Schyrr <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Given the coincidence of CD45 isoform between <italic>Flk1-GFP</italic> mouse ES cells and <italic>Nude</italic> mice, we made use of the <italic>Rosa26-BFP::Flk1-GFP</italic> mES cell line (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3A</xref>). We implanted 3 hGx each unilaterally in the adrenal gland of unconditioned recipient mice. Control mice were injected with an equivalent volume of PBS. Animals were sacrificed at 24 hours, 12 days, and 4 weeks after implantation, with 5 experimental animals and 1 control collected at each timepoint. We checked Spl and BM BFP engraftment at the different timepoints and analyzed the morphology of adrenal glands receiving implants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). We did not observe BFP engraftment, spleen enlargement or colony development, or macroscopic changes in the adrenal gland at the earlier timepoints. However, 3 of 5 adrenal glands were enlarged, and their histology suggested <italic>in situ</italic> development of the hGx (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>), particularly mesodermal tissues – somite derivatives (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref> - left, red box), and lateral plate and intermediate mesoderm derivatives, respectively blood cells and renal tubules (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref> - left, green box). The control, PBS-injected glands showed normal tissue architecture (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref> - right). It should be noted that none of the specimens contained glomeruli in addition to the renal tubules, pointing to an origin from the hGx, and not from the adjacent kidney tissue. BFP engraftment of the Spl and BM by flow cytometry was very low level albeit consistently above control (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4E</xref>), and we opted for analysing engraftment by PCR analysis of gDNA using primers directed against the BFP insert (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4A</xref>). We measured the sensitivity of the amplification through serial dilution of <italic>Flk1-GFP Rosa26-BFP</italic> mES cell gDNA into that of human K562 cells, and determined detection of 10pg/100ng gDNA, equivalent to 2-3 cells (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4F</xref>). PCR analysis of spleen and BM gDNA detected <italic>BFP</italic> amplicon in both tissues in 3 of the 5 samples (#11, 12 and 15) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). We sampled the gDNA of each recipient 4-5 times and detected the presence of the amplicon in only a fraction of the replicate samples of the positive animals, reflecting the low-level detection by flow cytometry. Replicate sampling of the control was consistently negative (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Sorting of erythroid Ter119<sup>+</sup> and lympho-myeloid CD45<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4G</xref>) showed PCR engraftment in both lineage fractions (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4H</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, the data suggest that 216h hGx generate AGM-like pre-HSC capable of at least short-term multilineage engraftment upon maturation. The low-level production of engrafting cells recapitulates their rarity <italic>in vivo</italic>, in agreement with the embryo-like qualities of the gastruloid system, which accommodates modular qualitative bias, but not quantitative changes in tissue specification.</p>
<p>The ability of hGx to reconstitute YS and AGM-like HE and hemopoietic progenitors with temporal coherence lends itself as an attractive model to understand developmental leukemia. In particular, forms of AML unique to the first 2 years of life – infant (inf)AML – have been shown to transform fetal liver (FL) but not adult haematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Waraky <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mercher <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen, W. <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ragusa <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), compatible with targeting of a transient embryonic cell.

These cell enrichments are compatible with an early hemogenic cell derivative, capturable in the hGx model. Other cell type-enrichments reflect MNX1 functions in pancreatic and neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Ragusa <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5A</xref>).</p>

<p>We overexpressed <italic>MNX1</italic> (MNX1-OE) in <italic>Flk1-GFP</italic> mouse ES cells by lentiviral transduction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) and analyzed progression of hGx generation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). We used human <italic>MNX1</italic> cDNA to distinguish from the endogenous gene, but the degree of homology is nevertheless high (84%), supporting functional equivalence. We confirmed that <italic>MNX1</italic> overexpression in hGx is maintained at endpoint (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig S5B</xref>). MNX1-OE hGx activated polarized <italic>Flk1-GFP</italic> expression and elongated with similar kinetics to empty-vector (EV) control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), but consistently produced larger hGx (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>) denoting increased cellularity (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5C</xref>). From 192h onwards, MNX1-OE hGx had a higher frequency of spontaneously contractile structures (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5D</xref>), compatible with the cardiogenic cell association of patients’ transcriptomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). We interrogated the time-dependent hemogenic cell composition of hGx by flow cytometry, quantifying C-Kit, CD41 and CD45 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-G</xref> and <xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5E-F</xref>). We observed a significant expansion of the C-Kit<sup>+</sup> compartment specifically at 144h (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref> and <xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5E</xref>). All cell markers were relatively unchanged at later timepoints, although absolute cell numbers were higher in MNX1-OE hGx (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5C</xref>).</p>
<p>To better understand the consequences of MNX1-OE on hemogenic development, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of hGx at 144h and 216h, matching YS and AGM-like hemopoietic waves, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). We confirmed expression of the human <italic>MNX1</italic> transgene in the sequenced reads (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6A</xref>); in contrast, we could not detect endogenous mouse <italic>Mnx1</italic> in any of the samples (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6A</xref>), confirming that it does not normally play a role in hemogenic development. DEGs between MNX1-OE and EV (<xref rid="d1e2832" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental File S3</xref>) configured distinct MNX1-driven programs at 144h and 216h, with &gt;80% genes timepoint-specific (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). Both programs include up-regulation of hematopoietic-associated genes, capturing EHT and progenitor regulators (e.g. <italic>Runx1</italic>, and <italic>Epor</italic> and <italic>Zfpm1</italic>, respectively) at the earlier timepoint, and more differentiated effectors, e.g. <italic>Hba-a1</italic>, <italic>Hbb-bh1</italic> and <italic>Il3ra</italic> at 216h, compatible with selective targeting and/or expansion of newly specified progenitors at the YS-like stage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). An overview of transcriptional regulatory programs at both timepoints denotes a clearer hemogenic enrichment at 144h, with over-representation of GATA2, GATA1 and RUNX1 binding targets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>), putatively capturing an expansion of the HE-to-EMP transition, also represented in enriched GO categories related to VEGF signalling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>). Compatible with the increase in contractile foci in MNX1-OE late hGx, there was an enrichment in cardiogenic gene ontologies (GO) at the 216h timepoint (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>). No hemogenic transcription factors (TF)-ChIP or GO categories were enriched in MNX1-OE hGx at 216h (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J-I</xref>).</p>
<p>We attempted to deconvolute the cellular heterogeneity underlying bulk RNA-seq DEGs by interrogating the cluster signatures obtained from the single-cell analysis of hGx development (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6B-C</xref>; refer to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In support of enhanced YS-stage hemato-endothelial specification, MNX1-OE transcriptomes showed enrichment of hGx HE cluster 5 and 0 signatures, and of the EMP-like cluster 4 (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6B</xref>). MNX1-OE DEGs at both timepoints also enriched for the relatively less differentiated cluster 10, which predominantly captures unfractionated hGx cells at 120h (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6B-C</xref>; refer to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Significantly, clusters 5 and 0 HE signatures were enriched in <italic>MNX1</italic>-r infAML patient signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Ragusa et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5B-C</xref>), positioning MNX1-OE at early stages of hemogenic specification. MNX1-OE DEGs at 216h show enrichment in late-stage clusters 7 and 8 (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6B-C</xref>), denoting enhancement of hGx development, including MLP/MPP in cluster 8, but diverging from <italic>MNX1</italic>-r infAML signatures. Projection of infAML subtype-specific gene signatures onto hGx development separates the lineage affiliations of <italic>MNX1</italic>-r from, for example, the most frequent infAML driver – <italic>KMT2A (MLL)</italic> rearrangements (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6B-C</xref>), which carries myelo-monocytic and/or mixed-lineage affiliation, highlighting the utility of the hGx system for interrogating infAML biology.</p>
<p>We further interrogated the <italic>MNX1</italic>-r-like leukemia-initiating potential of MNX1-OE hGx through serial replating of CFC assays, a classical <italic>in vitro</italic> assay of leukemia transformation. We compared 144h and 216h hGx to match functional and transcriptome data, and plated unfractionated hGx, given the transient nature of C-Kit<sup>+</sup> enrichment. Both 144h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-B</xref>) and 216h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-D</xref>) MNX1-OE hGx replated for at least 5 plates, with significant differences to control (EV) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B,D</xref>). EV-hGx replating could not be sustained beyond plate 3 in most experiments started from 216h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>); 144h EV-hGx exhibited some low-level replating until plate 5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), but the colonies were formed by few scattered cells clearly distinct from the well-demarcated colonies obtained from MNX1-OE hGx. We analyzed early-stage (plate 1) and late-stage (plate 5) colonies by flow cytometry to identify the nature of the replating cells. Cells selected through replating were C-Kit<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>), matching the cell phenotype transiently enriched at 144h. Early replating of MNX1-OE hGx also enriched for erythroid-affiliated Ter119<sup>+</sup> cells particularly from the 144h time-point (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>), reflecting the differential erythroid potential of EMP and MLP/MPP at 144h and 216h, respectively. This enrichment is not sustained upon replating, compatible with the undifferentiated nature of <italic>MNX1</italic>-r infAML, which is also reflected by the low levels of CD11b, a marker affiliated with the myelo-monocytic lineages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Notably, the cells obtained are not CD45<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>), suggesting perpetuation of an early hemogenic state.</p>

<p>We performed RNA-seq analysis of MNX1-OE hGx CFC cells obtained through re-plating and integrated the data with the 144h and 216h hGx time-points to identify genes enriched through the process of transformation. We observed relative enrichment in Hs<italic>MNX1</italic> reads in MNX1-OE CFC samples, supporting selective expansion of transduced cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Hierarchical clustering of all DEGs in pairwise comparisons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>), identified a subgroup of genes up-regulated upon CFC replating which was also up-regulated at MNX1-OE hGx at 144h (K14), thus matching the putative time-dependent enrichment of the MNX1-OE propagating population. To understand the relevance of these genes in <italic>MNX1</italic>-r leukemia, we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of <italic>MNX1</italic>-r patients in comparison to other AML in the same infant (0-2) age group. K14-genes were enriched in MNX1-<italic>r</italic> all comparisons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), with considerable overlap between leading-edge (i.e. significantly-enriched) genes (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6D</xref>). Interrogation of cell-type-specific signatures within the K14 MNX1-<italic>r</italic> leading edge genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>) against the single-cell PanglaoDB atlas captured similarities to hemogenic and non-hemogenic cell types, including interneuron, and other neural, signatures, which reflect MNX1 biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Harrison <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Thaler <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Ragusa <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). The most highly significant hemogenic signatures capture early developmental components, such as ‘endothelial cells’, which were specifically up-regulated within MNX1-OE hGx (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6B</xref>). ‘Erythroid cell precursors’ also reflect MNX1-OE hGx effects (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-J</xref>). We were intrigued by the ‘mast cells’ affiliation of <italic>MNX1</italic>-r AML signatures within the hGx K14 cluster, which was more specifically aligned with MNX1-OE hGx isolated at 144h (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6E</xref>). Given the characteristic morphology of these cells, we analysed Giemsa-Wright-stained cytospins of CFC replating assays (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref> and <xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6F</xref>). Consecutive plates of 144h MNX1-OE-initiated <italic>in vitro</italic> transformation showed a shift from blast-like at plate 3 to precursor cell morphology with some differentiated mast cells at plate 5 (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6F</xref>). However, the extent of differentiation was greater, and apparent earlier, in 216h-MNX1-OE initiated colonies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). This suggests that the MNX1-OE-responsive hemogenic C-Kit<sup>+</sup> progenitor may experience maturation between 144h and 216h, and is more likely targeted for transformation at the YS EMP stage. The data support the utility of the hGx in dissecting ontogeny of embryonic origin in hematological cancers, allowing us to specifically narrow down the initiating cellular targets of MNX1-<italic>r</italic> AML.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we developed and characterized a hGx model from mouse ES cells, which successfully recapitulates YS-like and AGM-like waves of definitive blood progenitor specification, and can engraft adult hematopoietic tissues upon <italic>in vivo</italic> maturation. We took advantage of the hGx’s nearly full recapitulation of embryonic hemogenic specification, including critical early stages of HE production and EHT to EMP and MLP/MPPs, to interrogate the biology of <italic>MNX1</italic>-r AML, a poorly characterized form of leukemia exclusive to the infant age group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ragusa <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). We showed that MNX1-OE transiently expanded a C-Kit<sup>+</sup> cell with hemato-endothelial characteristics at the YS-like stage, and could selectively sustain the phenotype through serial replating of CFC assays. Replating CFCs could be initiated beyond the YS-like stage, albeit at the relative expense of an early differentiation state and of the similarity to patient transcriptome, putatively defining a window of susceptibility to MNX1-driven transformation. The hGx MNX1-OE propagating cell bears transcriptional resemblance to patient <italic>MNX1</italic>-r AML, overall positioning the hGx as an attractive tractable model in which to study developmental leukemias.</p>
<p><italic>MNX1</italic>-r has been difficult to characterize due to a combination of rarity, diagnostic difficulty (the underlying t(7;12) can be missed if not specifically looked for) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Tosi <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), and the lack of a fusion protein that can be ectopically expressed and tracked through development, as is the case for other translocations unique to infAML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alexander and Mullighan, 2021</xref>). However, a recent paper using MNX1-OE has shown that MNX1 can initiate a transplantable leukemia in immunodeficient mice by targeting FL, but not BM, cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Waraky <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). This suggests that ectopic expression of <italic>MNX1</italic> transforms an embryonic cell, rather than depends on an embryonic niche. It also suggests that MNX1-OE can cause leukemia as a single genetic hit, although it cannot be excluded that other mutations are required for, and may indeed have contributed to, full transformation <italic>in vivo</italic>, as observed in a recent report confirming the <italic>in utero</italic> origin of the leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bousquets-Muñoz <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). However, the mouse model does not address the nature of the embryonic cell targeted by MNX1-OE. Like the MNX1-OE hGx cells selected through serial replating, MNX1-OE mouse leukemia are also C-Kit<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Waraky <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). Interestingly, clusters of genes up-regulated in the mouse MNX1-OE leukemia (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7A</xref> – K1, 2, 5, 6, and 9) do not robustly separate <italic>MNX1</italic>-r from other infAML by GSEA analysis (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7B</xref>), and have diverged more from the patient data in their cell-type signature analysis than the original MNX1-OE cells in the FL (<xref rid="d1e2811" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7C</xref>), putatively selecting a more generic program of leukemia transformation. We propose that the divergence from <italic>MNX1</italic>-r infAML signatures increases from MNX1-OE hGx 144h (YS-like), to 216h (AGM-like) to FL, positioning the origin of the AML at the YS stage, likely at the HE-to-EMP transition. This cell may persist in the hGx culture system to the 216h AGM-like time-point, and migrate to the FL in the embryo, eventually extinguishing through differentiation, as suggested by the MNX1-OE hGx CFC assays. Persistence of the original MNX1-OE target cell will determine the sensitivity to MNX1-OE, and can be addressed in the hGx system through lineage tracing. Whether additional mutations, namely a reported association between <italic>MNX1</italic>-r and tri(19) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Espersen <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ragusa <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), contribute to prolonging the undifferentiated state of the candidate YS target cell with increased probability of transformation, or otherwise expand the targeted cell in a more classical second-hit fashion, can potentially also be screened in the hGx system, in combination with transplantation experiments. Finally, although our study has positioned the MNX1-OE target cell within the YS-EMP stage, the exact nature of the cell requires better definition. The mast cell affiliation, transcriptional and by CFC morphology, is more likely to reflect the period of susceptibility to MNX1 and the multilineage potential of the target cell, than the lineage commitment of the latter. Indeed, blast cells in the leukemia mouse model are morphologically undifferentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Waraky <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>) and a mast cell morphology has not been described in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ragusa <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Espersen <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Although adult HSC have mast cell potential <italic>in vitro</italic>, this is not employed <italic>in vivo</italic> under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chia <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Tissue resident mast cells are formed in the embryo at 2 periods: the YS EMP stage, which we propose to have targeted with MNX1-OE in the hGx model; and a transient AGM FL-HSC population which does not persist in post-natal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chia <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Yoshimoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), and that may be incipiently specified at the end of the current hGx protocol. Prospective isolation of these cell types from embryos and over-expression of <italic>MNX1</italic> followed by transformation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, will precisely define the embryonic time-window of susceptibility to <italic>MNX1</italic>-r and the nature the leukemia-initiating cell. Harnessing the high-throughput nature of the hGx culture system will help identifying therapeutic vulnerabilities that can improve the prognosis of this often-fatal disease.</p>
<p>The hGx model furthermore constitutes an advanced platform to probe physiological development of the hematopoietic system. Currently, <italic>in vitro</italic> platforms do not recapitulate <italic>in vivo</italic> blood formation sufficiently faithfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dijkhuis <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fidanza and Forrester, 2021</xref>). Establishment of a tractable <italic>in vitro</italic> model of hematopoietic development which faithfully recapitulates time-dependent emergence of hematopoietic progenitors in their physiological niche would propel translational applications by enabling high-throughput studies of HSC emergence. Most ESC-based models of blood specification do not achieve concomitant recapitulation of the surrounding microenvironment. Protocols typically remove ESC-derived hemogenic cells from an early embryonic-like niche to direct differentiation through genetic manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sugimura <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) and/or empirically-determined growth factor addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lis <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Vo and Daley, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fowler <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Nafria <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Sroczynska <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Piau <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), with minimal probing of intermediate steps. When hematopoietic waves have been specifically inspected, emergence of YS and AGM-like stages were conflated in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pearson <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Murry and Keller, 2008</xref>), suggesting a bias towards intrinsic hematopoietic cell potential, at the expense of cell fate modulation by time-coherent extrinsic physiological cues, affecting the nature of cellular output. The present hGx system, in contrast, successfully deconvolutes YS-like and AGM-like stages of blood production, including capturing differences in the HE generation, suggesting a level of organisation amenable to further development into an integrated hemogenic niche. Although the system is shy of achieving HSC maturation <italic>in situ</italic>, it can mature in a supportive microenvironment, in this case provided by the adrenal gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Schyrr <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), to produce engrafting multilineage progenitors, and potentially HSCs. This suggests that access to the relevant hematopoietic molecular programs is preserved. Incipient specification of non-hematopoietic tissues shown to support HSC emergence, including PDGFRA<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chandrakanthan <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) and neuro-mesenchymal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Miladinovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>) cells, and neural-crest derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kapeni <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Fitch <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), occurs in sync with development of AGM-like hematopoiesis, to indicate the presence of cues that with further maturation may facilitate HSPC specification at the appropriate developmental time.</p>
<p>We have observed that the nature of the symmetry-breaking pulse affects the specification of hemato-endothelial programs, with a more robust <italic>Flk1</italic>/<italic>Kdr</italic> activation in the presence of Activin A, potentially balancing mesodermal derivatives and the anterior-posterior axis. The hematopoietic output of cardiogenic gastruloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Rossi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) does not seem to require Activin A, but their blood formation is of lower efficiency, at least at the comparable timepoints of 144 and 168h, and apparently biased towards erythroid formation, reflecting its YS, and potentially primitive, nature. In the absence of additional cytokines after the CHI99021 pulse, standard gastruloid protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beccari <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>) capture a similar transcriptional erythrogenic wave. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Rossi <italic>et al</italic>. (2022)</xref> reported the formation of spleen colonies, these are difficult to ascertain from the data published, and the engraftment capacity of cardiogenic gastruloid-derived blood remains uncertain. Our hGx system has more robust CD41<sup>+</sup> cell production at 144-168h, which may reflect distinct tissue induction by the CHI99021+Activin A pulse. Interestingly, through extending the hGx culture, and in addition to AGM-like hematopoiesis, we also captured the potential to form renal tubular structures upon <italic>in vivo</italic> maturation, suggesting induction of lateral plate and intermediate mesoderm from which the AGM region derives, and putative reconstitution of the intra-embryonic hematopoietic niche. An additional challenge is tissue organisation: non-hematopoietic gastruloid models benefitted from mechanical, or chemo-mechanical, support of artificial ECM embedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Veenvliet <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">van den Brink, Susanne C <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), to match temporal coherence and tissue polarisation, with detailed tissue architecture illustrated by somite formation. Prior to HSC emergence in the AGM, critical signals such as SCF and Shh, which we have delivered to the cultures, are secreted by different cells on opposite dorsal-ventral locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Souilhol <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>), indicating the potential relevance of tissue organisation to improve and potentially extend hematopoietic formation. Moreover, HSPC formation in the AGM is facilitated by circulatory shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">North <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Diaz <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lundin <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), suggesting that introduction of flow may improve hemato-endothelial organization and boost blood production.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, the effort to achieve robust hematopoietic production from PSC, mouse and human, has been centred on the generation of HSC, a critical translational need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chang <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dijkhuis <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fidanza and Forrester, 2021</xref>). There are good indications that this is achievable, both with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Vo and Daley, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dang <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) and without (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Piau <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) genetic manipulation. However, success remains episodic, mainly because mechanistic understanding of processes underpinning blood generation during development is limiting, exacerbated by limiting access to human embryonic and fetal material. On-going optimization of gastruloid models and the success at integration of organoid cultures in microfluidic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Saorin, Caligiuri and Rizzolio, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Quintard <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>) will allow us to further optimize hGx culture. In conclusion, the hGx represents a faithful <italic>in vitro</italic> reference to replace and complement embryo studies, holding promise to understand the biology of healthy and malignant developmental haematopoiesis and advance blood production for clinical use.</p>

<p>mES were maintained in ES+LIF medium and transferred to 2i+LIF (containing Chiron and MEK inhibitor PD03) for 24 hours prior to the assembly into gastruloids. 250 untransduced mES cells (or 400 for GX-MNX1 and GX-EV) were seeded in each well of a U-bottom, cell-repellent 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One, Stonehouse, UK) in 40 μl of N2B27 medium [Takara Bio or home-made as Cold Spring Harbour Protocols ‘N2B27 Medium’ (2017)]. The plate was centrifuged at 750 rpm for 2 minutes to promote deposition and aggregation of the cells and was then incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 48 hours. After 48 hours, 150 μl of N2B27 medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml Activin A (QKine, Cambridge, UK) and 3 μM chiron (Peprotech) was added to each well. At 72 hours, 150 μl of medium were removed, without disrupting the gastruloids in the wells. 100 μl of N2B27 with 5 ng/ml of Vegf and Fgf2 each (Peprotech) were added to each well. From 72 h to 144 h, each day 100 μl of medium were removed and replaced with N2B27 + Vegf + Fgf2. At 144 h, the medium was further supplemented with Shh at 20 ng/ml. From 168 h to 216 h, the medium was N2B27 + 5 ng/ml Vegf, plus 20 ng/ml mTpo, 100 ng/ml mFlt3l, and 100 ng/ml mScf (Peprotech). To dissociate cells from the gastruloid structures, medium was removed and individual gastruloids were collected using a pipette and precipitated at the bottom of a microcentrifuge tube. The remaining medium was aspirated and the bulk of gastruloids was washed in PBS. 50 μl of TrypLE express was added to pelleted gastruloids to be incubated at 37°C for 2 minutes to dissociate cells.</p>

<title>Single cell RNA sequencing of time-resolved hemogenic gastruloids</title>
<p>Gastruloids were collected at different timepoints of the protocol, disassembled and FACS deposited into 96-well plates, either as unsorted (global) or sorted by CD45, CD41 and C-Kit/ScaI markers (sorted). RNA from the cells were extracted from single cells using Smart-seq2 technology at 500Kb and depth of 151 bases. Sequencing reads were quality-checked using FastQC (v0.11.9). We trimmed the samples using trimGalore! (0.6.6) with a cutoff of 30, clipping 15 base pairs and retaining reads of more than 100 bases. Alignment was performed on STAR (2.7.8a) and Mus musculus annotations from GENCODE vM26. Aligned BAM files were annotated using featureCounts (v2.0.1) and count matrices were computed in python by directly accessing the BAM files with gtfparse packages and collapsing lanes.</p>
<p>For quality control, based on the histogram of counts and multimodality distributions, we set a minimum count threshold of 200000 counts, a minimum threshold of 1000 expressed genes, and a maximum threshold of 20% mitochondrial fraction per cell. We performed the same procedure of the second dataset with a more restrictive threshold of 400000 counts and similar expressed genes and mitochondrial thresholds. Cells that did not pass the quality control metrics were omitted from analysis. We normalized the cells to the mean count number per dataset and applied a plus-one-log transformation of the data before proceeding to the downstream analysis.</p>
<p>Dimensionality reduction was performed on feature selection of the gene space using the function scanpy.highly_varying_genes with default parameters. Selection of principal components in principal component analysis (PCA) was performed by heuristic elbow method. Nearest neighbor analysis was constructed by KNN graphs using a correlation metric and 10 nearest neighbors. Data was projected for low dimensional visualization using the UMAP algorithm with default parameters as implemented in scanpy.tl.umap. We used the leiden algorithm as implemented in scanpy.tl.leiden to partition the data into clusters. In order to assess the election of the resolution parameter we used Newman-Girvan modularity as a metric of clustering quality. Differential expressed genes were computed comparing each cluster against the rest using the Wilcoxon test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction.</p>

We implemented the scmap algorithm to compare our scRNA sequencing of gastruloids with the available datasets. We reduced the dimensionality of the space by selecting highly varying genes from the annotated dataset. Then, we constructed a KNN classifier with correlation metric and computed the nearest neighbors of the target data. If neighbors with correlation metrics below 0.7 default standards, the projected cells were not projected onto any cell from the annotated dataset. To visualize the cells over the UMAP plots of the other datasets, we constructed a KNN regressor with three neighbors and a correlation metric.

<p>Summary</p>
<p>The authors describe a method for gastruloid formation using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to study YS and AGM-like hematopoietic differentiation. They characterise the gastruloids during nine days of differentiation using a number of techniques including flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. They compare their findings to a published data set derived from E10-11.5 mouse AGM. At d9, gastruloids were transplanted under the adrenal gland capsule of immunocompromised mice to look for the development of cells capable of engrafting the mouse bone marrow. The authors then applied the gastruloid protocol to study overexpression of Mnx1 which causes infant AML in humans.</p>
<p>In the introduction, the authors define their interpretation of the different waves of hematopoiesis that occur during development. 'The subsequent wave, known as definitive, produces: first, oligopotent erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) in the YS (E8-E8.5); and later myelo-lymphoid progenitors (MLPs - E9.5-E10), multipotent progenitors (MPPs - E10-E11.5), and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs - E10.5-E11.5), in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region of the embryo proper.' Herein they designate the yolk sac-derived wave of EMP hematopoiesis as definitive, according to convention, although paradoxically it does not develop from intra-embryonic mesoderm or give rise to HSCs.</p>
<p>General comments</p>
<p>The authors make the following claims in the paper:</p>
<p>(1) The development of a protocol for hemogenic gastruloids (hGx) that recapitulates YS and AGM-like waves of blood from HE.</p>
<p>(2) The protocol recapitulates both YS and EMP-MPP embryonic blood development 'with spatial and temporal accuracy'.</p>
<p>(3) The protocol generates HSC precursors capable of short-term engraftment in an adrenal niche.</p>
<p>(4) Overexpression of MNX1 in hGx transforms YS EMP to 'recapitulate patient transcriptional signatures'.</p>
<p>(5) hGx is a model to study normal and leukaemic embryonic hematopoiesis.</p>
<p>There are major concerns with the manuscript. The statements and claims made by the authors are not supported by the data presented, data is overinterpreted, and the conclusions cannot be justified. Furthermore, the data is presented in a way that makes it difficult for the reader to follow the narrative, causing confusion. The authors have not discussed how their hGx compares to the previously published mouse embryoid body protocols used to model early development and hematopoiesis.</p>
<p>Specific points</p>
<p>(1) It is claimed that HGxs capture cellularity and topography of developmental blood formation. The hGx protocol described in the manuscript is a modification of a previously published gastruloid protocol (Rossi et al 2022). The rationale for the protocol modifications is not fully explained or justified. There is a lack of novelty in the presented protocol as the only modifications appear to be the inclusion of Activin A and an extension of the differentiation period from 7 to 9 days of culture. No direct comparison has been made between the two versions of gastruloid differentiation to justify the changes.</p>
<p>The inclusion of Activin A at high concentration at the beginning of differentiation would be expected to pattern endoderm rather than mesoderm. BMP signaling is required to induce Flk1+ mesoderm, even in the presence of Wnt. FACS analysis of the hGx during differentiation is needed to demonstrate the co-expression of Flk1-GFP and lineage markers such as CD34 to indicate patterning of endothelium from Flk1+ mesoderm. The FACS plots in Figure 1 show c-Kit expression but very little VE-cadherin which suggests that CD34 is not induced. Early endoderm expresses c-Kit, CXCR4, and Epcam but not CD34 which could account for the lack of vascular structures within the hGx as shown in Figure 1E.</p>
<p>(2) The protocol has been incompletely characterised, and the authors have not shown how they can distinguish between either wave of Yolk Sac (YS) hematopoiesis (primitive erythroid/macrophage and erythro-myeloid EMP) or between YS and intraembryonic Aorta-Gonad-Mesonephros (AGM) hematopoiesis. No evidence of germ layer specification has been presented to confirm gastruloid formation, organisation, and functional ability to mimic early development. Furthermore, differentiation of YS primitive and YS EMP stages of development in vitro should result in the efficient generation of CD34+ endothelial and hematopoietic cells. There is no flow cytometry analysis showing the kinetics of CD34 cell generation during differentiation. Benchmarking the hGx against developing mouse YS and embryo data sets would be an important verification.</p>
<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to compare hGx with mouse AGM. The authors incorrectly conclude that ' ..specification of endothelial and HE cells in hGx follows with time-dependent developmental progression into putative AGM-like HE..' And, '...HE-projected hGx cells.......expressed Gata2 but not Runx1, Myb, or Gfi1b..' Hemogenic endothelium is defined by the expression of Runx1 and Gfli1b is downstream of Runx1.</p>
<p>(3) The hGx protocol 'generates hematopoietic SC precursors capable of short-term engraftment' is not supported by the data presented. Short-term engraftment would be confirmed by flow cytometric detection of hematopoietic cells within the recipient bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood that expressed the BFP transgene. This analysis was not provided. PCR detection of transcripts, following an unspecified number of amplification cycles, as shown in Figure 3G (incorrectly referred to as Figure 3F in the legend) is not acceptable evidence for engraftment. Transplanted hGx formed teratoma-like structures, with hematopoietic cells present at the site of transplant only analysed histologically. Indeed, the quality of the images provided does not provide convincing validation that donor-derived hematopoietic cells were present in the grafts.</p>
<p>There is no justification for the authors' conclusion that '... the data suggest that 216h hGx generate AGM-like pre-HSC capable of at least short-term multilineage engraftment upon maturation...'. Indeed, this statement is in conflict with previous studies demonstrating that pre-HSCs in the dorsal aorta of the mouse embryo are immature and actually incapable of engraftment.</p>
<p>The statement '...low-level production of engrafting cells recapitulates their rarity in vivo, in agreement with the embryo-like qualities of the gastruloid system....' is incorrect. Firstly, no evidence has been provided to show the hGx has formed a dorsal aorta facsimile capable of generating cells with engrafting capacity. Secondly, although engrafting cells are rare in the AGM, approximately one per embryo, they are capable of robust and extensive engraftment upon transplantation.</p>
<p>(4) Expression MNX1 transcript and protein in hematopoietic cells in MNX1 rearranged acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is one cause of AML in infants. In the hGX model of this disease, Mnx1 is overexpressed in the mESCs that are used to form gastruloids. Mnx1 overexpression seems to confer an overall growth advantage on the hGx and increase the serial replating capacity of the small number of hematopoietic cells that are generated. The inefficiency with which the hGx model generates hematopoietic cells makes it difficult to model this disease. The poor quality of the cytospin images prevents accurate identification of cells. The statement that the kit-expressing cells represent leukemic blast cells is not sufficiently validated to support this conclusion. What other stem cell genes are expressed? Surface kit expression also marks mast cells, frequently seen in clonogenic assays of blood cells. Flow cytometric and gene expression analyses using known markers would be required.</p>
<p>(5) In human infant MNX1 AML, the mutation is thought to arise at the fetal liver stage of development. There is no evidence that this developmental stage is mimicked in the hGx model.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors develop an exciting new hemogenic gastruloid (hGX) system, which they claim reproduces the sequential generation of various blood cell types. The key advantage of this cellular system would be its potential to more accurately recapitulate the spatiotemporal emergence of hematopoietic progenitors within their physiological niche compared to other available in vitro systems. The authors present a large set of data and also validate their new system in the context of investigating infant leukemia.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The development of this new in vitro system for generating hematopoietic cells is innovative and addresses a significant drawback of current in vitro models. The authors present a substantial dataset to characterize this system, and they also validate its application in the context of investigating infant leukemia.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The thorough characterization and full demonstration that the cells produced truly represent distinct waves of hematopoietic progenitors are incomplete. The data presented to support the generation of late yolk sac (YS) progenitors, such as lymphoid cells, and aortic-gonad-mesonephros (AGM)-like progenitors, including pre-hematopoietic stem cells (pre-HSCs), by this system are not entirely convincing. Given that this is likely the manuscript's most crucial claim, it warrants further scrutiny and direct experimental validation. Ideally, the identity of these progenitors should be further demonstrated by directly assessing their ability to differentiate into lymphoid cells or fully functional HSCs. Instead, the authors primarily rely on scRNA-seq data and a very limited set of markers (e.g., Ikzf1 and Mllt3) to infer the identity and functionality of these cells. Many of these markers are shared among various types of blood progenitors, and only a well-defined combination of markers could offer some assurance of the lymphoid and pre-HSC nature of these cells, although this would still be limited in the absence of functional assays.</p>
<p>The identification of a pre-HSC-like CD45⁺CD41⁻/lo c-Kit⁺VE-Cadherin⁺ cell population is presented as evidence supporting the generation of pre-HSCs by this system, but this claim is questionable. This FACS profile may also be present in progenitors generated in the yolk sac such as early erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs). It is only within the AGM context, and in conjunction with further functional assays demonstrating the ability of these cells to differentiate into HSCs and contribute to long-term repopulation, that this profile could be strongly associated with pre-HSCs. In the absence of such data, the cells exhibiting this profile in the current system cannot be conclusively identified as true pre-HSCs.</p>
<p>The engraftment data presented are also not fully convincing, as the observed repopulation is very limited and evaluated only at 4 weeks post-transplantation. The cells detected after 4 weeks could represent the progeny of EMPs that have been shown to provide transient repopulation rather than true HSCs.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors employ a mouse ES-derived &quot;hemogenic gastruloid&quot; model which they generated and which they claim to be able to deconvolute YS and AGM stages of blood production in vitro. This work could represent a valuable resource for the field. However, in general, I find the conclusions in this manuscript poorly supported by the data presented. Importantly, it isn't clear what exactly are the &quot;YS&quot; and the &quot;AGM&quot;-like stages identified in the culture and where is the data that backs up this claim. In my opinion, the data in this manuscript lack convincing evidence that can enable us to identify what kind of hematopoietic progenitor cells are generated in this system. Therefore, the statement that &quot;our study has positioned the MNX1-OE target cell within the YS-EMP stage (line 540)&quot; is not supported by the evidence presented in this study. Overall, the system seems to be very preliminary and requires further optimization before those claims can be made.</p>
<p>Specific comments below:</p>
<p>(1) The flow cytometric analysis of gastruloids presented in Figure 1 C-D is puzzling. There is a large % of c-Kit+ cells generated, but few VE-Cad+ Kit+ double positive cells. Similarly, there are many CD41+ cells, but very few CD45+ cells, which one would expect to appear toward the end of the differentiation process if blood cells are actually generated. It would be useful to present this analysis as consecutive gating (i.e. evaluating CD41 and CD45 within VE-Cad+ Kit+ cells, especially if the authors think that the presence of VE-Cad+ Kit+ cells is suggestive of EHT). The quantification presented in D is misleading as the scale of each graph is different.</p>
<p>(2) The imaging presented in Figure 1E is very unconvincing. C-Kit and CD45 signals appear as speckles and not as membrane/cell surfaces as they should. This experiment should be repeated and nuclear stain (i.e. DAPI) should be included.</p>
<p>(3) Overall, I am not convinced that hematopoietic cells are consistently generated in these organoids. The authors should sort hematopoietic cells and perform May-Grunwald Giemsa stainings as they did in Figure 6 to confirm the nature of the blood cells generated.</p>
<p>(4) The scRNAseq in Figure 2 is very difficult to interpret. Specific points related to this:</p>
<p>
- Cluster annotation in Figure 2a is missing and should be included.</p>
<p>
- Why do the heatmaps show the expression of genes within sorted cells? Couldn't the authors show expression within clusters of hematopoietic cells as identified transcriptionally (which ones are they? See previous point)? Gene names are illegible.</p>
<p>
- I see no expression of Hlf or Myb in CD45+ cells (Figure 2G). Hlf is not expressed by any of the populations examined (panels E, F, G). This suggests no MPP or pre-HSC are generated in the culture, contrary to what is stated in lines 242-245. (PMID 31076455 and 34589491).</p>
<p>
Later on, it is again stated that &quot;hGx cells... lacked detection of HSC genes like Hlf, Gfi1, or Hoxa9&quot; (lines 281-283). To me, this is proof of the absence of AGM-like hematopoiesis generated in those gastruloids.</p>
<p>(5) Mapping of scRNA-Seq data onto the dataset by Thambyrajah et al. is not proof of the generation of AGM HE. The dataset they are mapping to only contains AGM cells, therefore cells do not have the option to map onto something that is not AGM. The authors should try mapping to other publicly available datasets also including YS cells.</p>
<p>(6) Conclusions in Figure 3, named &quot;hGx specify cells with preHSC characteristics&quot; are not supported by the data presented here. Again, I am not convinced that hematopoietic cells can be efficiently generated in this system, and certainly not HSCs or pre-HSCs.</p>
<p>
- FACS analysis in 3A is again very unconvincing. I do not think the population identified as c-Kit+ CD144+ is real. Also, why not try gating the other way around, as commonly done (e.g. VE-Cad+ Kit+ and then CD41/CD45)?</p>
<p>
- The authors must have tried really hard, but the lack of short- or long-engraftment in a number of immunodeficient mouse models (lines 305-313) really suggests that no blood progenitors are generated in their system. I am not familiar with the adrenal gland transplant system, but it seems like a very non-physiological system for trying to assess the maturation of putative pre-HSCs. The data supporting the engraftment of these mice, essentially seen only by PCR and in some cases with a very low threshold for detection, are very weak, and again unconvincing. It is stated that &quot;BFP engraftment of the Spl and BM by flow cytometry was very low level albeit consistently above control (Fig. S4E)&quot; (lines 337-338). I do not think that two dots in a dot plot can be presented as evidence of engraftment.</p>
<p>(7) Given the above, I find that the foundations needed for extracting meaningful data from the system when perturbed are very shaky at best. Nevertheless, the authors proceed to overexpress MNX1 by LV transduction, a system previously shown to transform fetal liver cells, mimicking the effect of the t(7;12) AML-associated translocation. Comments on this section:</p>
<p>
- The increase in the size of the organoid when MNX1 is expressed is a very unspecific finding and not necessarily an indication of any hematopoietic effect of MNX1 OE.</p>
<p>
- The mild increase of cKit+ cells (Figure 4E) at the 144hr timepoint and the lack of any changes in CD41+ or CD45+ cells suggests that the increase in Kit+ cells % is not due to any hematopoietic effect of MNX1 OE. No hematopoietic GO categories are seen in RNA seq analysis, which supports this interpretation. Could it be that just endothelial cells are being generated?</p>
<p>(8) There seems to be a relatively convincing increase in replating potential upon MNX1-OE, but this experiment has been poorly characterized. What type of colonies are generated? What exactly is the &quot;proportion of colony forming cells&quot; in Figures 5B-D? The colony increase is accompanied by an increase in Kit+ cells; however, the flow cytometry analysis has not been quantified.</p>
<p>(9) Do hGx cells engraft upon MNX1-OE? This experiment, which appears not to have been performed, is essential to conclude that leukemic transformation has occurred.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>The authors describe a method for gastruloid formation using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to study YS and AGM-like hematopoietic differentiation. They characterise the gastruloids during nine days of differentiation using a number of techniques including flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. They compare their findings to a published data set derived from E10-11.5 mouse AGM. At d9, gastruloids were transplanted under the adrenal gland capsule of immunocompromised mice to look for the development of cells capable of engrafting the mouse bone marrow. The authors then applied the gastruloid protocol to study overexpression of Mnx1 which causes infant AML in humans.</p>
<p>In the introduction, the authors define their interpretation of the different waves of hematopoiesis that occur during development. 'The subsequent wave, known as definitive, produces: first, oligopotent erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) in the YS (E8-E8.5); and later myelo-lymphoid progenitors (MLPs - E9.5-E10), multipotent progenitors (MPPs - E10-E11.5), and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs - E10.5-E11.5), in the aorta-gonadmesonephros (AGM) region of the embryo proper.' Herein they designate the yolk sac-derived wave of EMP hematopoiesis as definitive, according to convention, although paradoxically it does not develop from intraembryonic mesoderm or give rise to HSCs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The apparent perplexity of the Reviewer with our definition of primitive and definitive waves is somewhat surprising, as it is widely used in the field (e.g. PMID: 18204427; PMID: 28299650; PMID: 33681211). Definitive haematopoiesis, encompassing EMP, MLP, MPP and HSC, highlights their origin from haemogenic hendothelium, generation of mature cells with adult characteristics from progenitors with multilineage potential and direct and indirect developmental contributions to the intra-embryonic and time-restricted generation of HSCs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>General comments</p>
<p>The authors make the following claims in the paper:</p>
<p>(1) The development of a protocol for hemogenic gastruloids (hGx) that recapitulates YS and AGM-like waves of blood from HE.</p>
<p>(2) The protocol recapitulates both YS and EMP-MPP embryonic blood development 'with spatial and temporal accuracy'.</p>
<p>(3) The protocol generates HSC precursors capable of short-term engraftment in an adrenal niche.</p>
<p>(4) Overexpression of MNX1 in hGx transforms YS EMP to 'recapitulate patient transcriptional signatures'.</p>
<p>(5) hGx is a model to study normal and leukaemic embryonic hematopoiesis.</p>
<p>There are major concerns with the manuscript. The statements and claims made by the authors are not supported by the data presented, data is overinterpreted, and the conclusions cannot be justified. Furthermore, the data is presented in a way that makes it difficult for the reader to follow the narrative, causing confusion. The authors have not discussed how their hGx compares to the previously published mouse embryoid body protocols used to model early development and hematopoiesis. the data is presented in a way that makes it difficult for the reader to follow the narrative, causing confusion. The authors have not discussed how their hGx compares to the previously published mouse embryoid body protocols used to model early development and hematopoiesis.</p>
<p>Specific points</p>
<p>(1) It is claimed that HGxs capture cellularity and topography of developmental blood formation. The hGx protocol described in the manuscript is a modification of a previously published gastruloid protocol (Rossi et al 2022). The rationale for the protocol modifications is not fully explained or justified. There is a lack of novelty in the presented protocol as the only modifications appear to be the inclusion of Activin A and an extension of the differentiation period from 7 to 9 days of culture. No direct comparison has been made between the two versions of gastruloid differentiation to justify the changes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer paradoxically claims that the protocol is not novel and that it differs from a previous publication in at least 2 ways – the patterning pulse and the length of the protocol. Of these, the patterning pulse is key. As documented in Fig. S1, we cannot obtain Flk1-GFP expression in the absence of Activin A. Expression of Flk1 is a fundamental step in haemato-endothelial specification and, accordingly, we do not see CD41 or CD45+ cells in the absence of Activin A. Also, in our hands, there is a clear time-dependent progression of marker expression, with sequential acquisition of CD41 and CD45, with the latter not detectable until 192h (Fig. 1C-D), another key difference relative to the Rossi et al (2022) protocol. The 192h-timepoint, we argue in the manuscript, and present further evidence for in this rebuttal, corresponds to the onset of AGM-like haematopoiesis. We have empirically extended the protocol to maximise the CD45+ cell output (Fig. S1B-D).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The inclusion of Activin A at high concentration at the beginning of differentiation would be expected to pattern endoderm rather than mesoderm. BMP signaling is required to induce Flk1+ mesoderm, even in the presence of Wnt.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Again, we call the Reviewer’s attention to Fig. S1 which clearly shows that Activin A (with no BMP added) is required for induction of Flk1 expression, in the presence of Wnt. Activin A in combination with Wnt, is used in other protocols of haemato-endothelial differentiation from pluripotent cells, with no BMP added in the same step of patterning and differentiation (PMID: 39227582; PMID: 39223325). In the latter protocol, we also call the Reviewer’s attention to the fact that a higher concentration of Activin A precludes the need for BMP4 addition. Finally, one of us has recently reported that Activin A, on its own, will induce FLK1, as well as other anterior mesodermal progenitors (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.11.632562v1).">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.11.632562v1).</ext-link> In addressing the Reviewer’s concerns with the dose of Activin A used, we titrated its concentration against activation of Flk1, confirming optimal Flk1-GFP expression at the 100ng/ml dose used in the manuscript.</p>

<p>FACS analysis of the hGx during differentiation is needed to demonstrate the co-expression of Flk1-GFP and lineage markers such as CD34 to indicate patterning of endothelium from Flk1+ mesoderm. The FACS plots in</p>
<p>Fig. 1 show c-Kit expression but very little VE-cadherin which suggests that CD34 is not induced. Early endoderm expresses c-Kit, CXCR4, and Epcam, but not CD34 which could account for the lack of vascular structures within the hGx as shown in Fig. 1E.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We were surprised by the Reviewer’s comment that there are no endothelial structures in our gastruloids. The presence of a Flk1-GFP+ network is visible in the GFP images in Fig.1B, from 144h onwards, also shown in Author response image 2A. In addition, our single-cell RNA-seq data, included in the manuscript, confirms the presence of endothelial cells with a developing endothelial, including arterial, programme. This can be seen in Fig. 2B, F of the manuscript and is represented in Author response image 2B. In contrast with the Reviewer’s claims that no endothelial cells are formed, the data show that Kdr (Flk1)+ cells co-express Cdh5/VE-Cadherin and indeed Cd34, attesting to the presence of an endothelial programme. Arterial markers Efnb2, Flt1, and Dll4 are present. A full-blown programme, which also includes haemogenic markers including Sox17, Esam, Cd44 and Mecom is clear at early (144h) and, particularly at late (192h) timepoints in cells sorted on detection of surface c-Kit (Author response image 2B). Further to the data shown in B, already present in the manuscript, we also document co-expression of Flk1-GFP and CD34 by flow cytometry (Author response image 2C).</p>

<p>(2) The protocol has been incompletely characterised, and the authors have not shown how they can distinguish between either wave of Yolk Sac (YS) hematopoiesis (primitive erythroid/macrophage and erythro-myeloid EMP) or between YS and intraembryonic Aorta-Gonad-Mesonephros (AGM) hematopoiesis. No evidence of germ layer specification has been presented to confirm gastruloid formation, organisation, and functional ability to mimic early development. Furthermore, differentiation of YS primitive and YS EMP stages of development in vitro should result in the efficient generation of CD34+ endothelial and hematopoietic cells. There is no flow cytometry analysis showing the kinetics of CD34 cell generation during differentiation. Benchmarking the hGx against developing mouse YS and embryo data sets would be an important verification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer is correct that we have not provided detailed characterisation of the different germ layers, as this was not the focus of the study. In that context, we were surprised by the earlier comment assuming co-expression of c-kit, Cxcr4 and Epcam, which we did not show, while overlooking the endothelial programme reiterated above, which we have presented.</p>
<p>Given our focus on haemato-endothelial specification, we have started the single-cell RNA-seq characterisation of the haemogenic gastruloid at 120h and have not looked specifically at earlier timepoints of embryo patterning.</p>
<p>This said, we show the presence of neuroectodermal cells in cluster 9; on the other hand, cluster 7 includes hepatoblast-like cells, denoting endodermal specification. We are happy to include this characterisation, to the extent that it is present, in a revised version of the manuscript. However, in the absence of earlier timepoints and given the bias towards mesodermal specification, we expect that specification of ectodermal and endodermal programmes may be incomplete.</p>
<p>In respect of the contention regarding the capture of YS-like and AGM-like haematopoiesis, we have presented evidence in the manuscript that haemogenic cells generated during gastruloid differentiation, particularly at late 192h and 216h timepoints project onto highly purified c-Kit+ CD31+ Gfi1-expressing cells from mouse AGM (PMID: 38383534), providing support for the recapitulation of the corresponding developmental stage. In distinguishing between YS-like and AGM-like haematopoiesis, we call the Reviewer’s attention to the replotting of the single-cell RNA-seq data already in the manuscript, which we provided in response to point 1 (Author response image 2B), which highlights an increase in Sox17, but not Sox18, expression in the 192h haemogenic endothelium, which suggests an association with AGM haematopoiesis (PMID: 20228271). A significant association of Cd44 and Procr expression with the same time-point (Fig. 2F in the manuscript), further supports an AGM-like endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition at the 192h timepoint.</p>
<p>Following on the Reviewer’s comments about CD34, we also inspected co-expression of CD34 with CD41 and CD45, the latter co-expression present in, although not necessarily exclusive to, AGM haematopoiesis.</p>
<p>Reassuringly, we observed clear co-expression with both markers (Author response image 3), in addition to a CD41+CD34-population, which likely reflects YS EMP-independent erythropoiesis. Interestingly, marker expression is responsive to the levels of Activin A used in the patterning pulse, with the 100ng/ml Activin A used in our protocol superior to 75ng/ml.</p>

<p>We agree that it remains challenging to identify markers exclusive to AGM haematopoiesis, which is operationally equated with generation of transplantable haematopoietic stem cells. While HSC generation is a key event characteristic of the AGM, not all AGM haematopoiesis corresponds to HSCs, an important point in evaluating the data presented in the manuscript, and indeed acknowledged by us.</p>

<p>Given the centrality of this point in comments by all the Reviewers, we have conducted projections of our single-cell RNA-seq data against two studies which (1) capture arterial and haemogenic specification in the para-splanchnopleura (pSP) and AGM region between E8.0 and E11 (Hou et al, PMID: 32203131), and (2) uniquely capture YS, AGM and FL progenitors and the AGM endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition (EHT) in the same scRNA-seq dataset (Zhu et al, PMID: 32392346).</p>
<p>Focusing the analysis on the subsets of haemogenic gastruloid cells sorted as CD41+ (144h) CKit+ (144h and 192h) and CD45+ (192h and 216h) (Author response image 4AC), we show:</p>
<p>(1) That a subset of haemato-endothelial cells from haemogenic gastruloids at 144h to 216h project onto intra-embryonic cells spanning E8.25 to E10 (Author response image 5A-B). This is in agreement with our interpretation that 216h are no later than the MPP/pre-HSC state of embryonic development, requiring further maturation to generate long-term engrafting HSC.</p>
<p>(2) That haemogenic gastruloids contain YS-like (including EMP-like) and AGM-like haematopoietic cells (Author response image 6A-B). Significantly, some of the cells, particularly c-Kit-sorted cells with a candidate endothelial and HE-like signature project onto AGM pre-HE and HE, as well as IAHC, and later, predominantly 216h cells, have characteristics of MPP/LMPP-like cells from the FL.</p>
<p>Altogether, the data support the notion that haemogenic gastruloids capture YS and AGM haematopoiesis until E10, as suggested by us in the manuscript. We thought it was important to share this preliminary data with the Editors at an early stage, and we will incorporate a deeper analysis in a revised version of the manuscript.</p>

<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to compare hGx with mouse AGM. The authors incorrectly conclude that ' ..specification of endothelial and HE cells in hGx follows with time-dependent developmental progression into putative AGM-like HE..' And, '...HE-projected hGx cells.......expressed Gata2 but not Runx1, Myb, or Gfi1b..' Hemogenic endothelium is defined by the expression of Runx1 and Gfli1b is downstream of Runx1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As a hierarchy of regulation, Gata2 precedes and drives Runx1 expression at the specification of HE (PMID: 17823307; PMID: 24297996), while Runx1 drives the EHT, upstream of Gfi1b in haematopoietic clusters (PMID: 34517413).</p>

<p>(3) The hGx protocol 'generates hematopoietic SC precursors capable of short-term engraftment' is not supported by the data presented. Short-term engraftment would be confirmed by flow cytometric detection of hematopoietic cells within the recipient bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood that expressed the BFP transgene. This analysis was not provided. PCR detection of transcripts, following an unspecified number of amplification cycles, as shown in Figure 3G (incorrectly referred to as Figure 3F in the legend) is not acceptable evidence for engraftment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We provide the full flow cytometry analysis of spleen engraftment in the 5 mice which received implantation of 216h-haemogenic gastruloids in the adrenal gland; an additional (control) animal received adrenal injection of PBS (Author response image 7). The animals were analysed at 4 weeks. In this experiment, the bone marrow collection was limiting, and material was prioritised for PCR.</p>
<p>We had previously provided only representative plots of flow cytometry analysis of bone marrow and spleen in Fig. S4E, which we described as low-level engraftment. The analysis was complemented with genomic DNA PCR, where detection was present in only some of the replicates tested per animal. We confirm that PCR analysis used conventional 40 cycles; the sensitivity was shown in Fig. S4F. As shown in Fig. 3 A-C, no more than 7 CD45+CD144+ multipotent cells are present per haemogenic gastruloid, with 3 haemogenic gastruloids implanted in the adrenal gland of each transplanted animal. We argue that the low level of cytometric and molecular engraftment at 4 weeks, from haemogenic gastruloid-derived progenitors that have not progressed beyond a stage equivalent to E10 Author response image 5A-B) and that we have described as requiring additional maturation in vivo, are not surprising.</p>

<p>Transplanted hGx formed teratoma-like structures, with hematopoietic cells present at the site of transplant only analysed histologically. Indeed, the quality of the images provided does not provide convincing validation that donor-derived hematopoietic cells were present in the grafts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As stated in the text, the images mean to illustrate that the haemogenic gastruloids developed in situ. The observation of donor-derived blood cells in the implanted haemogenic gastruloids would not correspond to engraftment, as we have amply demonstrated that they have generated blood cells in vitro. There is no evidence that there are remaining pluripotent cells in the haemogenic gastruloid after 9 days of differentiation, and it is therefore not clear that these are teratomas</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There is no justification for the authors' conclusion that '... the data suggest that 216h hGx generate AGM-like pre-HSC capable of at least short-term multilineage engraftment upon maturation...'. Indeed, this statement is in conflict with previous studies demonstrating that pre-HSCs in the dorsal aorta of the mouse embryo are immature and actually incapable of engraftment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have clearly stated that we do not see haematopoietic engraftment through transplantation of dissociated haemogenic gastruloids, which reach the E10 state containing pre-HSC (Author response image 5). Instead, we observed rare myelo-erythroid (in the manuscript) and myelo-lymphoid (Author response image 9 below, in response to Reviewer 2) engraftment upon in vivo maturation of haemogenic gastruloids with preserved 3D organisation. These statements are not contradictory.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The statement '...low-level production of engrafting cells recapitulates their rarity in vivo, in agreement with the embryo-like qualities of the gastruloid system....' is incorrect. Firstly, no evidence has been provided to show the hGx has formed a dorsal aorta facsimile capable of generating cells with engrafting capacity. Secondly, although engrafting cells are rare in the AGM, approximately one per embryo, they are capable of robust and extensive engraftment upon transplantation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are happy to rephrase the statement to simply say that “…the data suggest that 216h haemogenic gastruloids contain candidate AGM-like progenitors with some short-term engraftment potential but incomplete functional maturation.” To be clear, with our existing statement we meant to highlight that the production of definitive AGM-like haematopoietic progenitors (not all of which are engrafting) in haemogenic gastruloids does not correspond to non-physiological single-lineage programming. We did not claim that we achieved production of HSC, which would be long-term engrafting.</p>

<p>(4) Expression MNX1 transcript and protein in hematopoietic cells in MNX1 rearranged acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is one cause of AML in infants. In the hGX model of this disease, Mnx1 is overexpressed in the mESCs that are used to form gastruloids. Mnx1 overexpression seems to confer an overall growth advantage on the hGx and increase the serial replating capacity of the small number of hematopoietic cells that are generated. The inefficiency with which the hGx model generates hematopoietic cells makes it difficult to model this disease. The poor quality of the cytospin images prevents accurate identification of cells. The statement that the kit-expressing cells represent leukemic blast cells is not sufficiently validated to support this conclusion. What other stem cell genes are expressed? Surface kit expression also marks mast cells, frequently seen in clonogenic assays of blood cells. Flow cytometric and gene expression analyses using known markers would be required.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The haemogenic gastruloid model generates haematopoietic and haemato-endothelial cells. MNX1 expands Kit+ cells at 144h, which we show to have a haemato-endothelial signature (manuscript Fig. 2B, which we replotted in Author response image 2B).</p>
<p>Serial replating of CFC assays is a conventional in vitro assay of leukaemia transformation. Critically, colony replating is not maintained in EV control cells, attesting to the transformation potential of MNX1.</p>
<p>Although we have not fully-traced the cellular hierarchy of MNX1-driven transformation in the haemogenic gastruloid system, the in vitro replating expands a Kit+ cell (Fig. 5E), which reflects the surface phenotype of the leukaemia, also recapitulated in the mouse model initiated by MNX1-overexpressing FL cells. Importantly, it recapitulates the transcriptional profile of MNX1-leukaemia patients (Fig. 6C), which is uniquely expressed by MNX1144h and replated colony cells, but not to MNX1 216h gastruloid cells, arguing against a generic signature of MNX1 overexpression (Fig. 6B). Importantly, the MNX1-transformation of haemogenic gastruloid cells is superior to the FL leukaemia model at capturing the unique transcriptional features of MNX1-driven leukaemia, distinct from other forms of AML in the same age group (Fig S7). It is possible that this corresponds to a preleukaemia event, and we will explore this in future studies, which are beyond the proof-of-principle nature of this paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In human infant MNX1 AML, the mutation is thought to arise at the fetal liver stage of development. There is no evidence that this developmental stage is mimicked in the hGx model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We never claim that the haemogenic gastruloid model mimics the foetal liver. We propose that susceptibility to MNX1 is at the HE-to-EMP transition. Moreover, and importantly, contrary to the Reviewer’s statement, there is no evidence in the literature that the mutation arises in the foetal liver stage, just that the mutation arises before birth (PMID: 38806630), which is different. In a mouse model of MNX1 overexpression, the authors achieve leukaemia engraftment upon MNX1 overexpression in foetal liver, but not in bone marrow cells (PMID: 37317878). This is in agreement with a vulnerability of embryonic / foetal, but not adult cells to the MNX1 expression caused by the translocation. However, haematopoietic cells in the foetal liver originate from YS and AGM precursors, so the origin of the MNX1-susceptible cells can be in those locations, rather than the foetal liver itself.</p>

<p>
Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, the authors develop an exciting new hemogenic gastruloid (hGX) system, which they claim reproduces the sequential generation of various blood cell types. The key advantage of this cellular system would be its potential to more accurately recapitulate the spatiotemporal emergence of hematopoietic progenitors within their physiological niche compared to other available in vitro systems. The authors present a large set of data and also validate their new system in the context of investigating infant leukemia.</p>
<p>
Strengths:</p>
<p>
The development of this new in vitro system for generating hematopoietic cells is innovative and addresses a significant drawback of current in vitro models. The authors present a substantial dataset to characterize this system, and they also validate its application in the context of investigating infant leukemia.</p>
<p>
Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The thorough characterization and full demonstration that the cells produced truly represent distinct waves of hematopoietic progenitors are incomplete. The data presented to support the generation of late yolk sac (YS) progenitors, such as lymphoid cells, and aortic-gonad-mesonephros (AGM)-like progenitors, including pre-hematopoietic stem cells (pre-HSCs), by this system are not entirely convincing. Given that this is likely the manuscript's most crucial claim, it warrants further scrutiny and direct experimental validation. Ideally, the identity of these progenitors should be further demonstrated by directly assessing their ability to differentiate into lymphoid cells or fully functional HSCs. Instead, the authors primarily rely on scRNA-seq data and a very limited set of markers (e.g., Ikzf1 and Mllt3) to infer the identity and functionality of these cells. Many of these markers are shared among various types of blood progenitors, and only a well-defined combination of markers could offer some assurance of the lymphoid and pre-HSC nature of these cells, although this would still be limited in the absence of functional assays.</p>
<p>
The identification of a pre-HSC-like CD45⁺CD41⁻/lo c-Kit⁺VE-Cadherin⁺ cell population is presented as evidence supporting the generation of pre-HSCs by this system, but this claim is questionable. This FACS profile may also be present in progenitors generated in the yolk sac such as early erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs). It is only within the AGM context, and in conjunction with further functional assays demonstrating the ability of these cells to differentiate into HSCs and contribute to long-term repopulation, that this profile could be strongly associated with pre-HSCs. In the absence of such data, the cells exhibiting this profile in the current system cannot be conclusively identified as true pre-HSCs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>At this preliminary response stage, we present 2 additional pieces of evidence to support our claims that we capture YS and AGM stages of haematopoietic development. In future experiments, we can complement these with functional assays, including co-culture with OP9 and OP9-DL stroma.</p>

<p>In Author response images 5 and 6, we project our single-cell RNA-seq data onto (1) developing intra-embryonic pSP and AGM between E8 and E11 (Author response image 5) and (2) a single-cell RNA-seq study of HE development which combines haemogenic and haematopoietic cells from the YS, the developing HE and IAHC in the AGM, and FL (Author response image 6). Our data maps E8.25-E10 (Author response image 5) and captures YS EMP and erythroid and myeloid progenitors, as well as AGM pre-HE, HE and IAHC, with some cells matching HSPC and LMPP (Author response image 6), as suggested by the projection onto the Thambyrajah et al data set (Fig. S3 in the manuscript).</p>
<p>Given the difficulty in finding markers that specifically associate with AGM haematopoiesis, we inspected the possibility of capturing different regulatory requirements at different stages of gastruloid development mirroring differential effects in the embryo. Polycomb EZH2 is specifically required for EMP differentiation in the YS, but does not affect AGM-derived haematopoiesis; it is also not required for primitive erythroid cells (PMID: 29555646; PMID: 34857757). We treated haemogenic gastruloids from 120h onwards with either DMSO (0.05%) or GSK126 (0.5μM), and inspected the cellularity of gastruloids at 144h, which we equate with YS-EMP, and 216h – putatively AGM haematopoiesis (Author response image 8). We show that EZH2 inhibition / GSK126 treatment specifically reduces %CD41+ cells at 144h (Author response image 8A), but does not reduce %CD41+ or %CD45+ cells at 216h (Author response image 8B).</p>
<p>Although preliminary, these data, together with the scRNA-seq projections described, provide evidence to our claim that 144h haemogenic gastruloids capture YS EMPs, while CD41+ and CD45+ cells isolated at 216h reflect AGM progenitors. We cannot conclude as to the functional nature of the AGM cells from this experiment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The engraftment data presented are also not fully convincing, as the observed repopulation is very limited and evaluated only at 4 weeks post-transplantation. The cells detected after 4 weeks could represent the progeny of EMPs that have been shown to provide transient repopulation rather than true HSCs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We clearly state that there is low level engraftment and do not claim to have generated HSC. We describe cells with short-term engraftment potential. Although the cells we show in the manuscript at 4 weeks could be EMPs (Author response image 7 and Fig. 3 and S3), we now have 8-week analysis of implant recipients, in which we observed, again low-level, engraftment of the recipient bone marrow in 1:3 animals (Author response image 9). This engraftment is myeloid-lymphoid and therefore likely to have originated in a later progenitor. To be clear, we do not claim that this corresponds to the presence of HSC. It nevertheless supports the maturation of progenitors with engraftment potential.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold>  </p>
<p>
In this study, the authors employ a mouse ES-derived &quot;hemogenic gastruloid&quot; model which they generated and which they claim to be able to deconvolute YS and AGM stages of blood production in vitro. This work could represent a valuable resource for the field. However, in general, I find the conclusions in this manuscript poorly supported by the data presented. Importantly, it isn't clear what exactly are the &quot;YS&quot; and the &quot;AGM&quot;-like stages identified in the culture and where is the data that backs up this claim. In my opinion, the data in this manuscript lack convincing evidence that can enable us to identify what kind of hematopoietic progenitor cells are generated in this system. Therefore, the statement that &quot;our study has positioned the MNX1-OE target cell within the YS-EMP stage (line 540)&quot; is not supported by the evidence presented in this study. Overall, the system seems to be very preliminary and requires further optimization before those claims can be made.</p>
<p>
Specific comments below:</p>
<p>
(1) The flow cytometric analysis of gastruloids presented in Figure 1 C-D is puzzling. There is a large % of c-Kit+ cells generated, but few VE-Cad+ Kit+ double positive cells. Similarly, there are many CD41+ cells, but very few CD45+ cells, which one would expect to appear toward the end of the differentiation process if blood cells are actually generated. It would be useful to present this analysis as consecutive gating (i.e. evaluating CD41 and CD45 within VE-Cad+ Kit+ cells, especially if the authors think that the presence of VE-Cad+ Kit+ cells is suggestive of EHT). The quantification presented in D is misleading as the scale of each graph is different.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Fig. 1C-D provide an overview of haemogenic markers during the timecourse of haemogenic gastruloid differentiation, and does indeed show a late up-regulation of CD45, as the Reviewer points out would be expected. The %CD45+ cells is indeed low. However, we should point out that the haemogenic gastruloid protocol, although biased towards mesodermal outputs, does not aim to achieve pure haematopoietic specification, but rather place it in its embryo-like context. Consecutive gating at the 216h-timepoint is shown and quantified in Fig. 3A-B. We refute that the scale is misleading. It is a necessity to represent the data in a way that is interpretable by the reader: the gates (in C) are truly representative and annotated, as are the plot axes (in D).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The imaging presented in Figure 1E is very unconvincing. C-Kit and CD45 signals appear as speckles and not as membrane/cell surfaces as they should. This experiment should be repeated and nuclear stain (i.e. DAPI) should be included.</p>

<p>(3) Overall, I am not convinced that hematopoietic cells are consistently generated in these organoids. The authors should sort hematopoietic cells and perform May-Grunwald Giemsa stainings as they did in Figure 6 to confirm the nature of the blood cells generated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is factual that the data are reproducible and complemented by functional assays shown in Fig. 3, which clearly demonstrate haematopoietic output. The single-cell RNA-seq data also show expression of a haematopoietic programme. Nevertheless, we include Giemsa-Wright’s stained cytospins obtained at 216h to illustrate haematopoietic output (Reviewer Fig. 11). Inevitably, the cytospins will be inconclusive as to the presence of endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition or the generation of haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, as these cells do not have a distinctive morphology.</p>

<p>(4) The scRNAseq in Figure 2 is very difficult to interpret. Specific points related to this:</p>
<p>
- Cluster annotation in Figure 2a is missing and should be included.</p>
<p>
- Why do the heatmaps show the expression of genes within sorted cells? Couldn't the authors show expression within clusters of hematopoietic cells as identified transcriptionally (which ones are they? See previous point)? Gene names are illegible.</p>
<p>
- I see no expression of Hlf or Myb in CD45+ cells (Figure 2G). Hlf is not expressed by any of the populations examined (panels E, F, G). This suggests no MPP or pre-HSC are generated in the culture, contrary to what is stated in lines 242-245. (PMID 31076455 and 34589491).</p>
<p>
Later on, it is again stated that &quot;hGx cells... lacked detection of HSC genes like Hlf, Gfi1, or Hoxa9&quot; (lines 281-283). To me, this is proof of the absence of AGM-like hematopoiesis generated in those gastruloids.</p>

<p>For a combination of logistic and technical reasons, we performed single-cell RNA-seq using the Smart-Seq2 platform, which is inherently low throughput. We overcame the issue of cell coverage by complementing whole-gastruloid transcriptional profiling at successive time-points with sorting of subpopulations of cells based on individual markers documented in Fig. 1. We clearly stated which platform was used as well as the number and type of cells profiled (Fig. S2A and lines 172-179 of the manuscript), and our approach is standard. We will review our representation of the data in a revised manuscript. Nevertheless, at this stage, we provide plots of the expression of key haematopoietic markers over UMAPs of haemogenic gastruloid timecourse (Author response image 12). We also show preliminary qRT-PCR data with increased Hlf expression upon extension of the protocol to 264h (Author response image 13), further confirming haematopoietic specification, including of candidate definitive progenitor cells, in the haemogenic gastruloid model.</p>

<p>(5) Mapping of scRNA-Seq data onto the dataset by Thambyrajah et al. is not proof of the generation of AGM HE. The dataset they are mapping to only contains AGM cells, therefore cells do not have the option to map onto something that is not AGM. The authors should try mapping to other publicly available datasets also including YS cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have done this and the data are presented in Author response image 5 and 6. As detailed in response to Reviewer 1, we have conducted projections of our single-cell RNA-seq data against two studies which (1) capture arterial and haemogenic specification in the para-splanchnopleura (pSP) and AGM region between E8.0 and E11 (Hou et al, PMID: 32203131) (Author response image 5), and (2) uniquely capture YS, AGM and FL progenitors and the AGM endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition (EHT) in the same scRNA-seq dataset (Zhu et al, PMID: 32392346) (Author response image 6). Specifically in answering the Reviewers’ point, we show that different subsets of haemogenic gastruloid cells sorted on haemogenic surface markers c-Kit, CD41 and CD45 cluster onto pre-HE and HE, intra-aortic clusters and FL progenitor compartments, and to YS EMP and erythroid and myeloid progenitors. This lends support to our claim that the haemogenic gastruloid system specifies both YS-like and AGM-like cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Conclusions in Figure 3, named &quot;hGx specify cells with preHSC characteristics&quot; are not supported by the data presented here. Again, I am not convinced that hematopoietic cells can be efficiently generated in this system, and certainly not HSCs or pre-HSCs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have provided evidence, both in the manuscript and in this response to Reviewers, that there is haematopoietic specification, including of progenitor cells, in the haemogenic gastruloid system (Fig. 3 and Author response image 7,9). We have added data in this response that supports the specification of YS-like and AGM-like cells (Author response image 5-6, 8). Importantly, we have never claimed that haemogenic gastruloids generate HSC. We accept the Reviewer’s comment that we have not provided sufficient evidence for the specification of pre-HSC-like cells. We will re-phrase Fig. 3 conclusion as “Haemogenic gastruloids specify cells with characteristics of definitive haematopoietic progenitors”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- FACS analysis in 3A is again very unconvincing. I do not think the population identified as c-Kit+ CD144+ is real. Also, why not try gating the other way around, as commonly done (e.g. VE-Cad+ Kit+ and then CD41/CD45)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There is nothing unconventional about our gating strategy, which was done from a more populated gate onto the less abundant one to ensure that the results are numerically more robust. In the case of haemogenic gastruloids, unlike the AGM preparations the Reviewer may be referring to, CD41 and CD45+ cells are more abundant as there is no circulation of more differentiated haematopoietic cells away from the endothelial structures. This said, we did perform the gating as suggested (Author response image 14), indeed confirming that most VE-cad+ Kit+ cells are CD45+. Interestingly VE-cad+Kit- are predominantly CD41+, reinforcing the true haematopoietic nature of these cells.</p>

<p>- The authors must have tried really hard, but the lack of short- or long-engraftment in a number of immunodeficient mouse models (lines 305-313) really suggests that no blood progenitors are generated in their system. I am not familiar with the adrenal gland transplant system, but it seems like a very non-physiological system for trying to assess the maturation of putative pre-HSCs. The data supporting the engraftment of these mice, essentially seen only by PCR and in some cases with a very low threshold for detection, are very weak, and again unconvincing. It is stated that &quot;BFP engraftment of the Spl and BM by flow cytometry was very low level albeit consistently above control (Fig. S4E)&quot; (lines 337-338). I do not think that two dots in a dot plot can be presented as evidence of engraftment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have presented the data with full disclosure and do not deny that the engraftment achieved is low-level and short-term, indicating incomplete maturation of definitive haematopoietic progenitors in the current haemogenic gastruloid system. However, we call the Reviewer’s attention to the fact that detection of BFP+ cells by PCR and flow cytometry in the recipient animals at 4 weeks is consistent between the 2 methods (Author response image 7).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have now also been able to detect low-level myelo-lymphoid engraftment in the bone marrow 8 weeks after adrenal implantation, again suggesting the presence of a small number of definitive haematopoietic progenitors that potentially mature from the 3 haemogenic gastruloids implanted (Author response image 9).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Given the above, I find that the foundations needed for extracting meaningful data from the system when perturbed are very shaky at best. Nevertheless, the authors proceed to overexpress MNX1 by LV transduction, a system previously shown to transform fetal liver cells, mimicking the effect of the t(7;12) AML-associated translocation. Comments on this section:</p>
<p>
- The increase in the size of the organoid when MNX1 is expressed is a very unspecific finding and not necessarily an indication of any hematopoietic effect of MNX1 OE.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer on this point; it is nevertheless a reproducible observation which we thought relevant to describe for completeness and data reproducibility.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The mild increase of cKit+ cells (Figure 4E) at the 144hr timepoint and the lack of any changes in CD41+ or CD45+ cells suggests that the increase in Kit+ cells % is not due to any hematopoietic effect of MNX1 OE. No hematopoietic GO categories are seen in RNA seq analysis, which supports this interpretation. Could it be that just endothelial cells are being generated?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer is correct that the MNX1-overexpressing cells have a strong endothelial signature, which is present in the patients (Fig. 4A). We investigated a potential link with c-Kit by staining cells from the replating colonies during the process of in vitro transformation with CD31. We observed that 40-50% of c-Kit+ cells (20-30% total colony cells) co-expressed CD31(Author response image 15), at least at early plating. These cells co-exist with haematopoietic cells, namely Ter119+ cells, as expected from the YS-like erythroid and EMP-like affiliation of haematopoietic output from 144h-haemogenic gastruloids (Fig. 5F).</p>
