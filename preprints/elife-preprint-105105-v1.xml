<title>Abstract</title>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 infection poses a major threat to public health, and understanding the mechanism of viral replication and virion release would help identify therapeutic targets and effective drugs for combating the virus. Herein, we identified E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Itchy homolog (ITCH) as a central regulator of SARS-CoV-2 at multiple steps and processes. ITCH enhances the ubiquitination of viral envelope and membrane proteins and mutual interactions of structural proteins, thereby aiding in virion assembly. ITCH-mediated ubiquitination also enhances the interaction of viral proteins to the autophagosome receptor p62, promoting their autophagosome-dependent secretion. Additionally, ITCH disrupts the trafficking of the protease furin and the maturation of cathepsin L, thereby suppressing their activities in cleaving and destabilizing the viral spike protein. Furthermore, ITCH exhibits robust activation during the SARS-CoV-2 replication stage, and SARS-CoV-2 replication is significantly decreased by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of ITCH. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and identify a potential target for developing treatments for the virus-related diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has affected the lives of almost everyone around the world, is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Despite the remarkable vaccination programs that protect people at high risk for complications, new infection cases are still occurring. As of February 2024, over 774 million people have been confirmed to be infected, and over 7.03 million confirmed deaths have been reported (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covid19.who.int">https://covid19.who.int</ext-link>). Emerging evidence indicates that the virus can have long-lasting effects on various organ systems, a condition often referred to as long COVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). It is estimated that at least 65 million individuals worldwide have long COVID, with the number of cases steadily rising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The development of novel, effective treatment strategies that benefit public health relies on detailed knowledge of molecular and cellular mechanisms of viral replication and virion release.</p>
<p>The SARS-CoV-2 virion consists of the positive-sense RNA genome and four structural proteins: nucleocapsid protein (N), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and spike protein (S). The genome-bound N proteins comprise the virion core, which is surrounded by the virion membrane containing E, M, and S proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). The E protein, the smallest among the structural proteins, is integrated into the virion membrane and participates in virion assembly and budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The M glycoprotein, embedded in the virion membrane and being the most abundant structural protein, interacts with all the other structural proteins and plays an essential role in viral proliferation and immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The S protein, which forms a homotrimeric complex in the virion, plays a critical role in viral entry, assembly, and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins are known to play a crucial role in protein functions.</p>
<p>One form of PTMs observed for virion structural proteins is ubiquitination, which plays essential roles in the budding, egress, and infection of retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), parainfluenza viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), Nipah viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), influenza A virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), and Zika virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Growing evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins are also modified by ubiquitination, which may have functional consequences. E3 ligases NEDD4 and WWP1 were reported to promote S protein ubiquitination and viral egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Furthermore, ubiquitinated peptides of other structural proteins (N, M and E) were also observed through proteomic analysis and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). However, it remains unclear how ubiquitination or other forms of posttranslational processing of these structural proteins influence the life cycle of these viruses.</p>
<p>Here, we identified the HECT ubiquitin E3 ligase ITCH as a central regulator of the functions of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. The functions of ITCH in the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 life cycle are mediated not only by the ubiquitination of the structural proteins but also by other cellular changes that alter the post-translational cleavage of specific structural proteins. ITCH was found to promote the ubiquitination of E and M, enhancing their interactions with other structural proteins. The ubiquitination of the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins also promotes their release by targeting the viral proteins to the autophagosome as a secretory mechanism. Meanwhile, ITCH stabilizes S protein by suppressing the activities of S cleavage proteases via changes in several cellular processes. The critical role of ITCH in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 is confirmed by the significant decrease in the virus proliferation as a result of ITCH inhibition. Furthermore, ITCH is activated in host cells infected by SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the virus can hijack this central regulator for its proliferation. Together, this study reveals critical and multi-faceted roles of the E3 ligase ITCH in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<title>ITCH ubiquitinates and interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins E and M</title>
<p>S, E, and M proteins are sufficient for the formation of the SARS-CoV2 infectious virus-like particle (VLP) (Figure 1-figure supplement 1A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). To identify host proteins that interact with SARS-CoV2 VLP components, we performed proteomic analysis of the co-immunoprecipitates pulled down by the structural proteins expressed in HEK293 cells (S/E/M, E or M) (Figure 1-figure supplement 1B). The analysis revealed a group of proteins functioning in ubiquitination that interact with the structural proteins (Figure 1-figure supplement 1C, raw data details were included in materials and methods). Among the identified E3 ligases, ITCH had the highest number of peptides and was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation to interact with the structural proteins (Figure 1-figure supplement 1D).</p>
<p>To test the E3 ligase activity of ITCH on these structural proteins, Flag-tagged S/E/M proteins were co-expressed in HEK293 cells together with wild-type (WT) ITCH, or an inactivated form of ITCH (ITCH-CS) with the C<sub>830</sub>S mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), followed by ubiquitin immunoblotting analysis of the Flag-immunoprecipitated S/E/M proteins under denaturing conditions. Compared with the inactive mutant control, ITCH promoted the ubiquitination of these structural proteins (Figure 1-figure supplement 1E). Subsequent analysis revealed the presence of Lys63 (K63) linkages in the polyubiquitin chains (Figure 1-figure supplement 11F), which mainly mediate protein-protein interactions or conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Analysis of the individual structural proteins in the presence of all three structural proteins indicated that ITCH did not regulate the ubiquitination of S (Figure 1-figure supplement 1G) but promoted the ubiquitination of both E and M (Figure 1-figure supplement 1H, I). The ubiquitination of E and M by ITCH involved K63-linked polyubiquitin chains (Figure 1-figure supplement 1J, K), and the ubiquitination of either E or M could occur in the absence of the other two structural proteins, suggesting that formation of S/E/M-containing VLPs was not required for ITCH-mediated ubiquitination of E or M (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref> and Figure 1-figure supplement 2A, B). The role of ITCH in the ubiquitination of E and M was further verified by deleting ITCH in Vero-E6-TMPRSS2 (vT2) cells, a monkey cell line expressing TMPRSS2, a transmembrane protein critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Figure 1-figure supplement 2C, D).</p>

<p>To examine the association of ITCH with E or M, we performed ITCH immunoprecipitation assays and observed the pull-down of E or M (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and Figure 1-figure supplement 2E). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation of E or M confirmed their interactions with endogenous ITCH (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and Figure 1-figure supplement 2F). To provide evidence of the colocalization of the structural proteins and ITCH <italic>in situ</italic>, we performed the proximity ligation assays (PLA) in HEK293. As expected, strong PLA signals in the cytoplasm were observed using paired Flag (E or M) and ITCH antibodies, while little background signal was detected in the control groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> and Figure 1-figure supplement 2G). Lastly, the interaction between ITCH and E or M in virally infected cells was confirmed via endogenous E and M immunoprecipitation assays, and clear ITCH signals were observed in the E- and M-based precipitates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> and Figure 1-figure supplement 2H). Furthermore, ITCHâs role in the ubiquitination of E and M was substantiated in vT2 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, where immunoprecipitation of endogenous E and M revealed a significant reduction in ubiquitinated E and M in ITCH-ablated cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref> and Figure 1-figure supplement 2I).</p>

<title>ITCH promotes the assembly of SARS-CoV-2 structural protein complexes</title>
<p>To investigate whether ITCH regulates virion assembly, we examined the effects of ITCH on the association of E or M with other structural proteins. First, to assess the association of E and M, we carried out immunoprecipitation assay using E as the bait to pull down M and found that ITCH did not alter the interaction between unmodified E and M (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Next, to examine the effect of ITCH on the interaction between E and S proteins, we conducted an affinity precipitation assay using agarose beads to capture tagged E protein as bait and measured the amount of co-precipitated S. Ectopic expression of ITCH led to a increase in the level of S (both intact and cleaved S proteins) co-precipitated by E, indicating that ITCH enhances the interaction between E and S (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Since ITCH promotes the ubiquitination of E, we examined the level of ubiquitinated E in the S/E complexes. We carried out serial precipitation assays using immunoprecipitation to isolate S protein-containing complexes, followed by the use of agarose beads to extract E protein from the precipitates obtained in the previous step under denaturing conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Indeed, ubiquitinated E was found to be present in the S/E complexes, and the level was increased by ITCH (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that ITCH may enhance the interaction between E and S by promoting the E ubiquitination (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2J).</p>

<p>To investigate the effect of ITCH on the association of M and S, we performed an immunoprecipitation assay using M as a bait to pull down S. Immunoblotting of the precipitates showed that the binding of M with S was not affected by ITCH (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). In comparison when the association between M and E was examined, we found that the level of E immunoprecipitated by M was increased by ITCH, indicating that ITCH had a positive effect on the association between M and E (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Given that ITCH is associated with M and enhances its ubiquitination, it is possible that ITCH may promote the interaction of M and E via M ubiquitination (Figure 2-figure supplement 2J). The following serial precipitation assays were carried out using immunoprecipitation to pull down E protein-containing complexes and subsequently using agarose beads to pull down M protein from the obtained precipitates under denaturing conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). The results showed that ITCH increased the level of ubiquitinated M in the E/M complexes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Together, these data reveal that ITCH promotes the interactions among the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, likely through the augmentation of E/M ubiquitination mediated by ITCH.</p>

<title>ITCH promotes the secretion of E and M proteins by facilitating their trafficking to autophagosome</title>
<p>Since ubiquitination plays a crucial role in viral protein secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), we investigated the role of ITCH in regulating the secretion of E and M. We immunoprecipitated the secreted forms of these proteins from the culture media of both WT and ITCH knockout vT2 cells. We observed a significant decrease in the levels of E and M secreted from ITCH knockout cells compared to those from the WT cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and Figure 3-figure supplement 3A), suggesting that ITCH promotes the secretion of these viral proteins. To understand how ITCH might influence the secretion of E and M, we analyzed the protein partners of these viral proteins identified in our proteomic analysis. Autophagy-related membrane protein 9A (ATG9A) was found to interact with SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (Figure 3-figure supplement 3B). Many autophagy receptors, such as p62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), NBR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), OPTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), NDP52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), and NIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), possess ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifier binding activity, which is required for the formation of autophagosomes, a process known to promote virion egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that autophagy may be involved in ITCH-mediated secretion of E and M. To test this hypothesis, we performed precipitation assays of E and M followed by immunoblot analysis of various co-precipitated autophagic cargo receptors. Our results showed that the level of the ubiquitin-associated autophagy receptor p62 precipitated by E was increased in the presence of ectopically expressed ITCH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The levels of M-precipitated RTN3 and NDP52 were unchanged with or without the expression of ITCH or inactive ITCH-CS, whereas p62 precipitated by M was increased by ITCH (Figure 3-figure supplement 3C). Together, these data suggested that ITCH-ubiquitinated E and M interact specifically with the autophagic cargo receptor p62.</p>

<p>To examine whether the ITCH-dependent interaction between p62 and the viral proteins led to the formation of autophagosomes, we performed immunofluorescence analysis of p62 and the viral proteins for their cellular localizations. Both E and M exhibited marked colocalization with p62 in cellular puncta in the presence of ITCH but not the inactive ITCH-CS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and Figure 3-figure supplement 3D). To confirm that the increased p62-E or p62-M puncta corresponded to autophagosomes, we performed immunofluorescence analysis of the autophagosome-associated LC3B marker protein. The results showed increased fluorescent signals reflecting colocalization of E and M with LC3B in ITCH-overexpressing cells as compared to the control cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and Figure 3-figure supplement 3). Our data, taken together, indicate that ITCH enhances, in an E3 ligase-dependent manner, the autophagosome-associated formation of p62-E or p62-M complexes.</p>
<p>Further immunofluorescence assays were undertaken using an antibody against lysosome-associated LAMP1 to investigate the possible trafficking of ITCH-dependent p62-E/M complexes to lysosomes for degradation. The fluorescent signals of E and M showed little or no colocalization with LAMP1 even in the presence of overexpressed ITCH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and Figure 3-figure supplement 3F), indicating that ITCH-dependent p62-E and p62-M complexes in autophagosomes are not targeted to the lysosome for degradation of the E and M.</p>
<p>To assess whether autophagosomes containing p62-E or p62-M complexes are involved in E/M secretion, we constructed cell lines with stable knockdown of p62 and then performed immunoprecipitation of E and M protein in lysates and culture media to measure their intracellular and secreted levels, respectively. Compared with those in the WT cells, both intracellular levels of ubiquitinated and non-modified E and M proteins were found to be increased in the p62 deficient cells, while extracellular E and M levels were significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> and Figure 3-figure supplement 3G). Finally, to confirm ITCHâs role in mediating the colocalization of E with p62 or LC3B in virally infected cells, we performed immunofluorescence analysis of endogenous E and p62 or LC3B in WT and ITCH-KO cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Consistently, ITCH ablation resulted in a significant decrease in the colocalization of E with p62 or LC3B (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H, I</xref>). A similar result was observed with the M protein colocalizing with p62 or LC3B in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (Figure 3-figure supplement 3H, I). These data suggested that the E and M proteins, once ubiquitinated by ITCH, utilize autophagosomes for their secretion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>).</p>

<title>ITCH protects S protein from cleavage at PPC site by reducing TGN-localized furin</title>
<p>Proteolysis of S protein (S cleavage) is critical in several stages of the viral life cycle, including viral entry, virion assembly, viral transmission, and cell-cell fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). We noticed that cells with heightened expression of ITCH exhibit much lower levels of intracellularly cleaved S protein (Figure 1-figure supplement 1E, H, G, I and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2B-D</xref>). Since ITCH is not involved in S protein ubiquitination, we asked whether ITCH regulates the intracellular cleavage process of the S protein, which produces the surface subunit S1 and the transmembrane subunit S2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). The cleavage of S protein occurs at a proprotein convertase cleavage (PPC) site, which harbors multiple arginine residues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The analysis of S cleavage revealed that heightened expression of ITCH, but not the inactive ITCH-CS, led to an increase in the level of intact S protein, while the levels of the S1/S2 subunits were significantly reduced, indicating a negative effect of ITCH on S protein cleavage (ratio of cleaved S/intact S, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). By contrast, when the PPC site was mutated to render the S protein non-cleavable (Figure EV5A), the level of the S mutant (S MUT) protein was no longer affected by ITCH (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, the effect of ITCH on S cleavage and secretion was further studied in vT2 cells, where ITCH significantly increased the level of intact S in both intracellular and extracellular fractions while negatively affecting the levels of S1/S2 subunits, with the S MUT variant showing no changes in protein levels or secretion in response to modulations of ITCH activities (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To gain a better understanding of ITCHâs role in S protein cleavage, we first tested whether ITCH interacts with the S protein. However, unlike with E and M proteins, we did not observe any ITCH signal in S immunoprecipitates (Figure 4-figure supplement 4A). Further immunofluorescence assays showed that there was no alteration in the subcellular localization of the S protein in cells ectopically expressing ITCH (Figure 4-figure supplement 4B). S can be cleaved by several host serine proteases or cysteine proteases, including furin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), cathepsin L (CTSL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), transmembrane protease serine protease-2 (TMPRSS-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), TMPRSS-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), TMPRSS11D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), and trypsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). To determine whether ITCH affects the localization and expression of S-related proteases, vectors encoding C-terminally s-tag-labeled furin and N-terminally Flag-tagged versions of these proteases were constructed (Figure 4-figure supplement 5A). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the distribution patterns of furin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) and CTSL (see below) were significantly altered by the expression of ITCH but not the inactive ITCH-CS, whereas subcellular localization of the other proteases did not show any significant changes (Figure 4-figure supplement 5B-F). Furin had a restricted and clustered distribution pattern in untreated cells; however, upon ITCH ectopic expression, the distribution of furin was transformed into a dispersed pattern in the cytoplasm, while the inactive ITCH-CS had no such effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>Intracellular furin is localized to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it cleaves the intracellular S protein into the S1 and S2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). To determine whether ITCH affects the TGN distribution of furin, we performed immunofluorescence assays. In control cells, furin was observed to colocalize with the TGN. However, heightened expression of ITCH but not the inactive ITCH-CS led to a significant decrease in TGN-localized furin signals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). To confirm the involvement of ITCH in regulating subcellular localization of furin in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, we generated stable vT2 cells expressing flag-tagged furin. Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunofluorescence assays were conducted to visualize the subcellular localization of furin and TGN46. As expected, SARS-CoV-2 infection led to a marked reduction in TGN-localized furin signals; however, this reduction was significantly rescued in cells with ITCH ablation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Further analysis showed that the protein level of furin was not affected by ITCH overexpression (Figure 4-figure supplement 6A) or ITCH ablation (Figure 4-figure supplement 6H). Additionally, the levels of TMPRSS and trypsin proteases were not affected by ITCH overexpression (Figure 4-figure supplement 6B-F) or ablation (Figure 4-figure supplement 6I-M). Together, these results indicate that ITCH does not change the expression or stability of these proteases but regulates the TGN localization of furin to influence S cleavage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>).</p>

<title>ITCH stabilizes S protein against degradation by inhibiting CTSL maturation</title>
<p>Among the S-associated proteases, CTSL efficiently degrades the S protein into smaller fragments after its initial cleavage by furin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). As mentioned above, ITCH also regulates the cellular distribution of CTSL. In untreated cells, ectopically expressing ITCH led to a disruption of the cytoplasmic distribution of CTSL, while the catalytically dead mutant ITCH-CS had no impact on its distribution (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). CTSL is synthesized as a preproenzyme, which is processed into a proenzyme and subsequently a mature form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). We asked whether the ITCH-dependent distribution of CTSL was associated with the maturation of CTSL protein. In cells overexpressing ITCH, the proenzyme form (pro-form) of endogenous CTSL was increased relative to the levels seen in control cells, while the double-chain (DC) mature form was decreased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The levels of CTSL were also assessed in WT and ITCH knockout cells. The pro-form of CTSL was nearly undetectable in the absence of ITCH, while the signal of the mature form was increased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). A similar analysis was performed with cells ectopically expressing CTSL for further confirmation. Consistent with the previous data, ITCH significantly increased the levels of the pro-form of CTSL and decreased the mature form (Figure 5-figure supplement 6N), indicating that ITCH inhibits CTSL maturation. To study the regulation of CTSL by ITCH under SARS-CoV-2 infection, we measured endogenous CTSL levels in vT2-WT and vT2-ITCH-KO cells with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection. We did not observe significant difference in CTSL protein levels between WT and ITCH-KO cells without SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, at 48 hpi with SARS-CoV-2, the level of the mature form of CTSL was significantly increased, while that of pro-CTSL was decreased in ITCH-KO relative to WT cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating that ITCH significantly inhibits CTSL maturation in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.</p>

<p>Since ITCH inhibits CTSL maturation, we hypothesized that ITCH may provide protection against further cleavage of S1/S2. When ITCH and S1 or S2 subunits were co-expressed, a significant increase in the levels of S1 and S2 was observed, suggesting that ITCH enhances the stability of these two subunits (Figure 5-figure supplement 6O and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). The level of non-cleaved S2 was increased by ITCH overexpression, while the formation of S2 fragments was significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Consistently, overexpression of ITCH led to lower levels of proteolytic cleavage products of the S protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). For further confirmation, S cleavage in WT and ITCH-ablated cells with SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected. We found that both intact S and S subunits were decreased by ITCH ablation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Taken together, our data show that in addition to its effect on furin, ITCH promotes CTSL trafficking and disrupts the processing of CTSL proenzyme, thereby protecting S and S1/S2 from further proteolysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>).</p>

<title>Loss of ITCH suppresses SARS-CoV-2 virus proliferation</title>
<p>In view of the multiple important roles of ITCH in the processing of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, we postulated that ITCH could be a target for antiviral therapy. To test the effect of ITCH on the egress of native SARS-CoV-2 and the cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by SARS-CoV-2, we infected vT2-WT and vT2-ITCH-KO cells with SARS-CoV-2 at various multiplicities of infection (MOI). When vT2-WT cells were infected at an MOI of only 0.01, most cells died at 48 hours post-infection (hpi), while progressively less cell death was observed at MOIs of 0.001 and 0.0001. ITCH ablation effectively inhibited CPE at all three MOIs (data not shown). Next, we measured the virus infectious titer and copy number in the culture medium of vT2-WT and vT2-KO cells at 0.0001 MOI. Consistent with the observed CPE phenotype, SARS-CoV-2 production was strongly inhibited by ITCH ablation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). As phosphorylation of ITCH at T222 greatly enhances its enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), we examined the level of phosphorylated ITCH (p-ITCH). Immunoblot analysis showed a robust increase in the level of p-ITCH in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells at 48 hpi despite a lower level of ITCH, possibly due to enhanced self-ubiquitination (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">D</xref>), indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly augmented the ITCH activity. Since the phosphorylation of ITCH-T222 is mediated by phosphorylated active JNK1 (p-JNK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), we examined the level of p-JNK1 and found it significantly upregulated in both vT2-WT and vT2-ITCH-KO cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Therefore, the observed robust activation of ITCH in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated, in whole or part, by activation of JNK1.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we examined the level of p-ITCH during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The level of phosphorylated ITCH did not show significant changes at the onset of infection (2 hpi) but exhibited an increase at 24 hpi, followed by a robust rise during the later stage of the viral life cycle (48 hpi) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). These findings indicate that the majority of ITCH exhibits weak activation during the initial virus infection stage but demonstrates robust activation during the replication stage of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>To test the role of ITCH in SARS-CoV-2 proliferation and its potential as an antiviral target, we used a known ITCH inhibitor, clomipramine (Clom) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), for further analysis. First, we evaluated the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Clom in vT2 cells. vT2 cells with ectopic expression of ITCH and ubiquitin were treated with Clom at various concentrations, and the E3 ligase activity of ITCH was measured through the level of self-ubiquitination. Immunoblotting showed that, at the concentration of 15 Î¼M, Clom significantly inhibited ITCH self-ubiquitination (Figure 6-figure supplement 7A). To test the effect of Clom on SARS-CoV-2 replication in vT2 cells, the drug was added to the culture medium one hour before SARS-CoV-2 infection. The CPE and virus titer were assessed and measured at 48 hpi. Clom-treated cells were substantially protected against SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE, and the virus copy numbers were reduced by thousands of folds in the presence of Clom (Figure 6-figure supplement 7B). As Clom inhibits multiple HECT E3 ligases, including ITCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), the observed inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 production may result from its broader inhibition of E3 ligases. We then tested Clomâs effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication in vT2-ITCH-KO cells. In these cells, Clom strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE as well (Figure 6-figure supplement 7C). However, unlike in wild-type vT2 cells, viral copy numbers were reduced by hundreds of folds (Figure 6-figure supplement 7C), suggesting that Clomâs inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 production is partly due to its specific inhibition of ITCH E3 ligase activity.</p>
<p>Given that the lungs are the primary target of SARS-CoV-2 and lung failure is a leading cause of mortality in COVID-19 patients, we analyzed ITCH expression across various lung cell types. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from a published database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), which includes over 116,000 nuclei from the lungs of nineteen individuals who died from COVID-19 and seven control individuals, we found that ITCH is ubiquitously expressed in lung cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increases ITCH mRNA levels in specific lung cell types, including B cells, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H-K</xref> and Figure 6-figure supplement 7D-H). Recognizing that the ubiquitous expression and upregulation of ITCH in natural SARS-CoV-2 infection cells, we lastly examined viral replication under ITCH-depleted conditions in Calu-3-ACE2 cells, a human epithelial cell line engineered for SARS-CoV-2 research. Consistent with the phenotype observed in vT2-ITCH-KO cells, ITCH depletion in Calu-3 cells led to a significant decrease in viral copy number in the culture medium compared to wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6L</xref>). Altogether, our data show that ITCH positively regulates SARS-CoV-2 replication and represents a potentially useful target for antiviral therapy and suppression of the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we have identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH as a central regulator influencing various stages and processes of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). The functions of ITCH in the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 virion assembly, egress, and virus proliferation are mediated not only by the ubiquitination of the structural proteins but also by the post-translational cleavage of specific structure proteins. We found that ITCH promotes the ubiquitination of E and M, enhancing their interactions with other structure proteins, which would aid in virion assembly. The ubiquitination of the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins also promotes the release of virion by targeting the viral proteins to the autophagosome as a secretory mechanism. Furthermore, ITCH stabilizes the S protein by inhibiting the activities of S cleavage proteases, including furin and CTSL. Notably, ITCH is activated in host cells by SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the virus can hijack this central regulator for its proliferation. Indeed, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of ITCH significantly decreased the replication of SARS-CoV-2, indicating that ITCH may be a promising target for the development of treatments for the viral disease.</p>

<p>The activation of JNK1 occurs during the late stage of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, which in turn activates the E3 ligase activity of ITCH (pink arrows). ITCH promotes ubiquitination of the E and M proteins, resulting in increased virion formation and p62-dependent autophagosome targeting (blue arrows), aiding SARS-CoV-2 egress. ITCH disrupts furin and CTSL protease activities, resulting in increased incorporation of intact S protein into the virion and enhanced virion infectivity and stability (black arrows).</p></caption>

<p>PTMs such as ubiquitination may play an important role in the life cycle of coronaviruses. Here we identified that the E3 ligase ITCH associates with SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins and promotes their ubiquitination and mutual interactions, thereby enhancing the virion assembly. In addition, ITCH-dependent ubiquitination of E and M is necessary for their recognition by p62 and subsequent sequestration into autophagosomes. Interestingly, the enhanced sequestration of E and M proteins to the autophagosomes did not lead to increased localization of these proteins to the lysosome but facilitated the secretion of these structural proteins. Autophagosomes have been observed to mediate exosome secretion as they fuse with multi-vesicular bodies for intraluminal vesicle secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Accordingly, p62, the autophagosome ubiquitin receptor, plays a crucial role in promoting the ITCH-dependent secretion of E and M proteins, which ultimately facilitates virion egress. These findings reveal a previously undescribed mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 virion assembly and egress and provide new insights into the function of ubiquitination of viral proteins.</p>
<p>In addition, our studies showed that ITCH does not regulate S ubiquitination but instead inhibits S proteolytic cleavage by reducing TGN-associated furin and inhibiting CTSL maturation. Although the S1/S2 cleavage is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection, recent studies suggest that enhanced cleavage may be disadvantageous for the virus. For instance, in Vero cells lacking TMPRSS2, virions with cleaved S1 and S2 are less stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Moreover, the D614G substitution, which renders the S protein more resistant to cleavage, reduces the release of the S1-domain and increases the incorporation of intact S protein into the virion, leading to enhanced virion infectivity and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Therefore, a high degree of intracellular S cleavage plays a negative role in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. In the present study, we observed that ITCH inhibits S cleavage by reducing TGN-associated furin. This finding suggests that ITCH may promote the production of infectious virions during the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle via inhibition of S cleavage.</p>
<p>We also observed that ITCH inhibits the maturation of CTSL, which cleaves S into smaller fragments. Although the CTSL-dependent S cleavage facilitates the release of the SARS-CoV-2 genome from the endosome into the cytosol following endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), being a lysosomal protease, it serves as a mechanism to limit SARS-CoV-2 egress as Î²-coronaviruses exploit lysosomal trafficking for egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Overall, during the virus replication stage, the inhibition of CTSL maturation by ITCH would promote the assembly and egress of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions. Additionally, ITCH is found to protect targets of certain proteases from proteolytic degradation. Multiple virus families, including Borna-, Bunya-, Corona-, Filo-, Flavi-, Herpes-, Orthomyxo-, Paramyxo-, Pneumo-, Retro- and Togaviridae, have been reported to utilize furin for envelope glycoprotein cleavage, a crucial step in their viral life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). In addition, CTSL-mediated proteolysis has been observed for envelope glycoproteins, such as the S protein of SARS/MERS-CoV and the GP protein of Ebolavirus (EBOV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Taken together, ITCH may play a significant role in the viral life cycles of these viruses.</p>
<p>After the SARS-CoV-2 infection stage, the expression of p-JNK1 is induced. As one important activator of ITCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), the induction of p-JNK1 would enhance the E3 ligase activity of ITCH. Indeed, the activation of ITCH is low in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Consistently, without SARS-CoV-2 infection, ITCH ablation does not exhibit involvement in the maturation of CTSL processing in vT2 cells, further implying that ITCH does not affect the CTSL-dependent virus infection process. After the stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, ITCH-dependent inhibition of CTSL maturation occurs, indicating a significant increase in the E3 ligase activity of ITCH that corresponds with the induction of p-JNK1 and the activation of p-ITCH at the T222 site. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the induction in p-JNK1 and its potential impact on the immune response and overall clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>The knockout of ITCH in vT2 cells inhibited SARS-CoV-2 production by 10â¼20-fold. Interestingly, the presence of the ITCH inhibitor Clom reduced virus production by a thousand-fold. It is possible that the observed inhibitory effect is partially due to drug cytotoxicity. Clom has the ability to inhibit other HECT E3 ligases besides ITCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), and there is evidence that other HECT-type E3 ligases, such as NEDD4 and WWP1, play important roles in promoting S ubiquitination and virus egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the observed inhibitory effect of Clom on SARS-CoV-2 production may be due to its inhibition of multiple HECT-type E3 ligases, including ITCH, NEDD4, and WWP1.</p>
<p>Based on the data obtained in this study, we propose a model for the multiple activities of ITCH related to the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Given the role of ITCH in SARS-CoV-2 proliferation, the findings of the present study provide the basis for the development of antiviral and therapeutic strategies to alleviate the SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated disease.</p>

<p>This study highlights ITCH as a regulator of SARS-CoV-2 replication by promoting K63-linked ubiquitination of M and E proteins. While the findings are potentially <bold>useful</bold>, the approaches are overly reliant on ectopic expression models and lack direct mechanistic evidence that ubiquitination of M and E has functional relevance.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigated the role of an E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH in regulating the viral life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. The authors showed that ITCH mediates ubiquitination of the membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Ubiquitination of E and M results in enhanced interactions between the structural proteins and redistribution of the structural proteins into autophagosomes. The authors claim that the enhanced interactions between structural proteins and trafficking of the structural proteins into autophagosomes contribute to SARS-CoV-2 replication and egress, prompting ITCH as a potential antiviral target. ITCH also alters the cellular distribution of host proteases important for spike cleavage which protect and stabilize spike with cleavage. The authors also demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 replication is augmented by ITCH in which virus replication is significantly impaired in cells lacking ITCH expression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provided high-quality data with appropriate experimental controls to justify their claims and conclusions. The mechanistic analyses are excellent and presented in a logical manner. The investigation of the role of ubiquitination in coronavirus assembly and egress is novel as most previous studies focused on its role in mediating innate immune responses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the authors showed that ITCH ubiquitinates E and M proteins, the claim that such ubiquitination promotes virion assembly and egress is circumstantial. The enhanced interaction between the structural proteins and targeting of ubiquitinated structural proteins into autophagosomes does not necessarily result in increased virion production and release as suggested by the authors. There is a disconnect between the ubiquitination of structural proteins and the role of ITCH in augmenting virus replication as shown in Fig. 6A and B. In addition, the authors showed that the catalytic activity of ITCH is important for the localization and maturation of host proteases. However, the mechanism behind is unknown. Also, it is unclear how protection of spike from cleavage conferred by ITCH explains its role in promoting replication as a lack of spike cleavage would inevitably compromise entry. The major weakness of the manuscript is the lack of experimental data that explains the molecular role of ITCH in relation to its phenotype observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript Qiwang Xiang et al. investigated the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. They claim the following:</p>
<p>
i) ITCH promotes virion assembly by interacting with E and M proteins and enhancing their K63-linked ubiquitination</p>
<p>
ii) ITCH-mediated ubiquitination promotes autophagosome-dependent secretion of viral particles.</p>
<p>
iii) ITCH stabilizes the viral spike protein by impairing its processing by furin and catepsin L proteases.</p>
<p>
The manuscript provides an interesting exploration of ITCH's role in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle but requires additional work to strengthen key claims and address potential confounding factors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments are sufficiently clear in documenting that ITCH activity is critical for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication and for M and E proteins K63-linked ubiquitination</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>â¢ The manuscript does not convincingly demonstrate how ITCH-mediated ubiquitination of E and M impacts virus assembly and release. Identifying the specific lysine residues in M and E targeted by ITCH, and generating mutant VLPs or recombinant viruses, would strengthen the conclusions.</p>
<p>
â¢ Most of the conclusions rely on ITCH overexpression data, which may have off-target effects on Golgi integrity and vesicular trafficking. For instance, figure 4F provides evidence of altered Golgi morphology and TGN46 fragmentation raising concerns that ITCH overexpression could indirectly mislocalize furin, affecting S1/S2 cleavage of the spike protein. In addition, inhibition of furin activity may also lead to off-target effects, given its role in processing numerous host proteins.</p>
<p>
â¢ Similarly, ITCH overexpression is likely to indirectly affect cathepsin-L maturation. In addition, the manuscript does not clarify how impaired cathepsin L activity would influence virus assembly or release.</p>
<p>
â¢ A major concern is also the lack of quantification and statistical analysis of immunofluorescence images throughout the manuscript, which undermines the reliability of these observations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Xiang et al. investigated the role of ubiquitin E3 ligase ITCH in SARS-CoV-2 replication. First, they described the role of ITCH on the structural proteins. Here, the ubiquitination of E and M (but not S) leads to an enhanced interaction and presumably virion assembly. In addition, E and M ubiquitination seems to be necessary for p62-guided sequestration into autophagosomes for secretion. Furthermore, ITCH regulates S proteolytic cleavage by changing furin localization and inhibiting CTSL protease maturation. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulates ITCH phosphorylation, whereas knockout of ITCH reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The proposed study is of interest to the virology community because it aims to elucidate the role of ubiquitination by ITCH in SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Understanding these mechanisms will address broadly applicable questions about coronavirus biology and enhance our knowledge of ubiquitination's diverse functions in cell biology.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>The involvement of ubiquitin ligases in SARS-CoV-2 replication is not entirely new (see E3 Ubiquitin Ligase RNF5; Yuan et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023). While the data generally support the conclusions, additional work is needed to confirm the role of ITCH in SARS-CoV-2 replication in a biologically relevant context. The vast majority of data is based on transient overexpression experiments of ITCH, which ultimately leads to massive ubiquitination of several viral and host cell factors, including potentially low-affinity substrates not typically recognized under physiological conditions. In addition to that, nearly all experiments were done in cells co-overexpressing ITCH and the viral structural proteins (or cellular proteases) in HEK293T cells. Therefore, a proteomic analysis of protein ubiquitination in a) SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (ideally several cell types) and b) SARS-CoV-2-infected v2T-ITCH-KO cells would verify the ITCH-related ubiquitination of e.g., E and M and would strengthen the whole manuscript. In addition, the few key experiments using SARS-CoV-2 infected cells were performed in VeroE6 cells, which are neither human nor lung-derived. Only in one experiment were lung-derived Calu3 cells included.</p>
<p>
Moreover, the manuscript names ITCH as a central regulator of SARS-CoV-2 replication. If ITCH is beneficial for E and M interaction and thereby aids virion assembly, showing its effect on VLP production would be desirable. Clarifications regarding data acquisition and data analysis could strengthen the manuscript and its conclusions.</p>
