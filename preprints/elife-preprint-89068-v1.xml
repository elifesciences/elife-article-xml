<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Polymorphisms in genes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region comprise the most important inherited risk factors for many autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD): both diseases are positively associated with the HLA-DR3 haplotype (<italic>DRB1*03:01-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:01</italic>). Studies of two different populations have recently documented that T1D susceptibility in HLA-DR3 homozygous individuals is stratified by a haplotype consisting of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (“tri-SNP”) in intron 1 of the <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> gene. In this study, we use a large cohort from the longitudinal “The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young” (TEDDY) study to further refine the tri-SNP association with T1D and with autoantibody-defined T1D endotypes. We found that the tri-SNP association is primarily in subjects whose first-appearing T1D autoantibody is to insulin. In addition, we discovered that the tri-SNP is also associated with celiac disease (CD), and that the particular tri-SNP haplotype (“101”) that is negatively associated with T1D risk is positively associated with risk for CD. The opposite effect of the tri-SNP haplotype on two DR3-associated diseases can enhance and refine current models of disease prediction based on genetic risk. Finally, we investigated possible functional differences between the individuals carrying high and low-risk tri-SNP haplotypes, and found that differences in complement system genes C4A and C4B may underlie the observed divergence in disease risk.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that results from destruction of pancreatic islet β cells by autoreactive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Clinical onset is preceded by a prodrome of β-cell autoimmunity, usually marked by the appearance of autoantibodies directed principally at insulin (IAA), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA), and islet antigen-2 (IA-2A). T1D is a non-Mendelian polygenic disorder involving the interaction of multiple gene variants, environmental factors, and immunoregulatory dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Only about 12% of persons with T1D have a first-degree relative (FDR) with the disease, a percentage that has remained unchanged despite increasing incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dahlquist et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Parkkola et al., 2013</xref>). The environmental factors that may precipitate disease in genetically susceptible individuals and the mechanisms by which they act have not been completely identified.</p>
<p>Gluten enteropathy, or celiac disease (CD), is also an autoimmune disorder. It results in atrophy of intestinal villi in the context of intestinal T cell inflammation and is associated with the presence of transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Husby et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Leonard et al., 2017</xref>). Although gluten is necessary for the disease it is not by itself sufficient, and CD is likely triggered by other environmental exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andren Aronsson et al., 2019</xref>). Clinical disease is characterized by a range of symptoms and signs including abdominal discomfort, disordered intestinal motility, and nutrient malabsorption. Like T1D, CD is a non-Mendelian polygenic disorder involving interaction of multiple gene variants, environmental factors, and immunoregulatory dysfunction. On average, about 7.5% of persons with CD have a first-degree relative with the disorder, but the prevalence varies with the relationship, sex, and geographic location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Singh et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The major genetic loci for both T1D and CD susceptibility encode major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II cell surface antigens; they are encoded by the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex genes on chromosome 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gutierrez-Arcelus et al., 2016</xref>) Together with the T cell receptor (TCR) and an autoantigenic peptide, these glycoproteins form the “tri-molecular complex” that is central to cell-mediated immune and autoimmune responses.</p>
<p>T1D susceptibility is most strongly associated with polymorphisms in HLA class II genes. The major HLA class II genes that predispose to T1D are <italic>HLA-DRB1, DQA1,</italic> and <italic>DQB1,</italic> which encode the HLA DR and DQ heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Polychronakos &amp; Li, 2011</xref>). Most T1D patients bear genetic haplotypes known as HLA-DR3 (<italic>DRB1*03:01-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:01</italic>) and HLA-DR4 (<italic>DRB1*04:01-, *04:02-, *04:04-</italic> or <italic>*04:05-DQA1*03:01-DQB1*03:02</italic>). The DR3 haplotype can also be abbreviated as DR3-DQ2, with DR3 referring to presence of the <italic>DRB1*03:01</italic> gene and DQ2 referring to the heterodimeric protein product of the <italic>DQA1*05:01</italic> and <italic>DQB1*02:01</italic> genes. The DR4 haplotype represents any of the <italic>DRB1*04</italic>-encoded allotypes with DQ8, the heterodimeric protein product of the <italic>HLA-DQA1*03:01</italic> and <italic>DQB1*03:02</italic> genes (DR4-DQ8). T1D is also associated with HLA class I genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Noble et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Polychronakos &amp; Li, 2011</xref>) and with class II <italic>HLA-DPB1</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bradfield et al., 2011</xref>). Genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed &gt;50 non-MHC loci associated with the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bradfield et al., 2011</xref>) and more recent analyses have extended that number to &gt;75 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Robertson et al., 2021</xref>). Because their individual contribution to total risk is small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baranzini, 2009</xref>), the analysis of non-MHC risk loci has not improved our ability to predict disease based on genotype alone.</p>
<p>In CD, about 90% of patients carry DR3-DQ2, and most of the remaining CD patients carry the DR4-DQ8 haplotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brown et al., 2019</xref>). Fine mapping of the HLA region in persons with CD has identified additional associations that account for approximately 18% of the genetic risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gutierrez-Achury et al., 2015</xref>). These loci, together with the &gt;50 known non-MHC susceptibility loci identified by GWAS, are thought to explain up to 48% of overall CD heritability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gutierrez-Achury et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The DQ2 and DQ8 haplotypes positively associated with CD are carried on the DR3-DQ2 and DR4-DQ8 haplotypes, respectively, that are predisposing for T1D. The occasional presence of both T1D and CD in the same individual is therefore not surprising. The rate at which CD occurs in persons with T1D varies substantially among various populations and reportedly ranges from 2.5% to 16.4% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">De Vitis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Szaflarska-Poplawska, 2014</xref>). In the HLA-selected TEDDY study T1D autoimmunity usually preceded CD autoimmunity in cases that had both (W. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hagopian et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>In the case of T1D, HLA genotyping can identify persons at risk for the disease, but only about 1 in 15 (∼7%) individuals with even the highest-risk HLA genotype identified in Europeans (HLA-DR3/DR4 heterozygotes) develop the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rewers et al., 1996</xref>). Similarly, only about 3% of persons with DQ2 or DQ8 develop celiac disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brown et al., 2019</xref>). Recent studies that coupled genetic analysis with phenotypic markers have improved our ability to predict islet autoantibodies and T1D in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bonifacio et al., 2018</xref>), but additional genetic risk remains to be discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Pierce et al., 2013</xref>). Understanding of the detailed genetic risk conferred by HLA-DR and -DQ-encoding genes remains incomplete and provided the impetus for these studies.</p>
<p>We have previously reported that susceptibility to T1D among persons homozygous for the high-risk DR3-DQ2 haplotype is powerfully modulated by variation within intron-1 of the <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aydemir et al., 2019</xref>), a gene that, unlike most HLA-encoding genes, is considered essentially invariant and largely ignored in HLA association studies. This variation comprises three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): rs3135394, rs9268645, and rs3129877 (referred to here as the “tri-SNP”) in a 100 bp interval within intron 1. We called the T1D risk haplotype (nucleotides AGG) “010” using (1) to designate the reference and (0) alternate alleles, respectively. T1D protection was conferred by the “101” haplotype (GCA). The effect of the tri-SNP on T1D susceptibility was discovered in an analysis of samples drawn from the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC), the Swedish Better Diabetes Diagnosis (BDD) study, and the Swedish Diabetes Prediction in Skåne (DiPiS) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aydemir et al., 2019</xref>). The relative T1D risk of the 010/010 genotype, compared to the homozygous 101/101 genotype, was substantial in both the T1DGC and Swedish DR3/3 cohorts (odds ratio 4.65, p=1.69 × 10<sup>−13</sup>). This association was later independently replicated in a separate cohort of DR3-DQ2/DR3-DQ2 individuals from Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nygard et al., 2021</xref>). These investigators reported that the 010/010 (AGG/AGG) or 010/x (AGG/x) tri-SNP haplotypes were significantly more common in patients with T1D (OR = 1.70, CI 95%=1.15–2.51, p = 0.007) than in non-diabetic controls.</p>
<p>Here we report an expanded analysis of the effect of the tri-SNP on the appearance of islet autoimmunity and the subsequent progression to T1D using data from the large population enrolled in The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Teddy Study Group, 2008</xref>). In addition, because CD is also documented in the TEDDY study, the novel and unexpected discovery was made that the tri-SNP 101 genotype that confers T1D protection was associated with increased susceptibility to CD.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>Data were obtained from participants in the TEDDY prospective cohort study whose primary goal is to identify environmental causes of T1D. It includes three clinical research centers in the United States (Colorado, Georgia/Florida, Washington) and three in Europe (Finland, Germany, and Sweden), and has been described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Teddy Study Group, 2007</xref>, 2008). Briefly, participation in the study was offered to the parents of all newborns at each research center. Inclusion criteria were based on HLA genotype and are described below. Separate written informed consents were obtained for all study participants from a parent or primary caretaker for genetic screening and for participation in prospective follow-up. The study was approved by local Institutional Review Boards and is monitored by an external advisory board formed by the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<sec id="s2a1">
<title>Inclusion Criteria and HLA Typing</title>
<p>Genotype screening (W. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hagopian et al., 2011</xref>) was conducted using either a dried blood spot punch or a small volume whole blood lysate specimen as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dantonio et al., 2010</xref>). Infants were eligible for the study if they had 2 high-risk HLA genotypes or had a first degree relative with T1D and at least one high-risk HLA genotype. Inclusion criteria and the HLA nomenclature used is detailed in the Supplementary Methods. Screening blood samples were generally obtained at birth from cord blood. Other potential participants, especially first-degree relatives of T1D participants at the Washington site, were screened using heel stick capillary samples up to the age of 4 months. This exception was made to maximize the number of newborn relatives participating in this study. After polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of exon 2 of the HLA Class II gene (DRB1, DQA1 or DQB1), alleles are identified either by direct sequencing, oligonucleotide probe hybridization, or other genotyping techniques as described (W. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hagopian et al., 2011</xref>). Additional typing to sufficiently identify certain DR-DQ haplotypes was specific to each clinical center.</p>
<p>When a TEDDY participant was 9–12 months of age, HLA status was confirmed by genotyping at increased resolution of HLA-DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1 at the central HLA reference laboratory at Roche Molecular Systems, Oakland, CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Erlich et al., 1991</xref>). SNPs from the Illumina Immuno BeadChip (manifest file: Immuno_BeadChip_11419691.bpm from Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) were also assessed by the Center for Public Health Genomics at University of Virginia as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Krischer et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>Primary Outcome Definition</title>
<p>The primary TEDDY outcome variable was development of persistent, confirmed islet autoimmunity (IA). IA was assessed every 3 months through four years of age. Persistent autoimmunity was defined by the confirmed (two reference labs in agreement) presence of any one of three islet autoantibodies: autoantibody to insulin (IAA), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA), or insulinoma antigen-2 (IA-2A) on two or more consecutive visits. Date of persistent autoimmunity was defined as the draw date of the first sample of the two consecutive autoantibody-positive samples.</p>

<title>Islet Autoantibodies</title>
<p>Islet autoantibodies were the first primary end-point in the TEDDY study. Islet autoantibodies to insulin, GAD65, and IA-2 were measured in two laboratories by radiobinding assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Babaya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bonifacio et al., 2010</xref>). In the U.S., all sera were assayed at the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes at the University of Colorado Denver; in Europe, all sera were assayed at the University of Bristol, the U.K. Assays in both laboratories have previously demonstrated high sensitivity, specificity and concordance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Torn et al., 2008</xref>). All positive islet autoantibodies and 5% of negative samples were re-tested in the other reference laboratory and deemed confirmed if concordant. To optimize concordance, harmonized assays for GADA and IA-2A replaced earlier assays in January, 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref></sup> To distinguish maternal antibodies from IA in the child, the IA status of the mother was measured when the child was aged 9 months, and the child’s IA status was measured at 3 months of age and then every three months until 18 months of age. If the child had positive IA during this time, the status was listed as ‘pending’ until 18 months of age, at which time the child’s IA status was determined based on both maternal and child IA over the first 18 months of the study. If maternal antibodies were present, the child was not considered persistently IA positive until positive at/after 18 months unless the child had a negative sample prior to their first positive sample. A recognized limitation of this approach is that true IA positivity during the first 18 months of life that waned could have been masked by maternal antibodies.</p>

<title>Diagnosis of T1D and CD</title>
<p>T1D and CD were the second primary end-points in the TEDDY study. At the time of clinical diagnosis of diabetes, data were collected outside the TEDDY clinics (care providers or clinics) using a standardized case report form requiring documentation to fulfill American Diabetes Association criteria for classification of T1D (Elding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Larsson et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>TEDDY children were screened for tTGA using radiobinding assays from 2 years of age and annually thereafter. TEDDY samples from the US sites were analyzed at the Barbara Davis Center and samples from the European sites at the Bristol University, which was chosen as the reference laboratory as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). All samples from US children with a tTGA level &gt;0.01 units were sent to the Bristol laboratory for analysis. Children with a positive tTGA had additional samples collected at three-month intervals to 48 months of age, and at 6 month intervals after the 48-month visit. In addition, all tTGA positive children had previously collected samples analyzed to find the closest time-point to conversion. Children with a positive tTGA result in two consecutive samples were defined as having celiac disease autoimmunity (CDA) (i.e., primary outcome) and referred to local health care providers for follow-up and clinical evaluation of CD. The decision to perform a diagnostic intestinal biopsy was outside the TEDDY protocol, but it was recommended by the TEDDY investigators of Celiac Disease Committee to biopsy CDA children with tTGA levels 30 units or greater in CDA children with gastrointestinal symptoms regardless of tTGA level. Diagnosis of CD per se was defined as an intestinal biopsy showing a Marsh score &gt;1, or if a biopsy was not performed, having a mean tTGA level of 100 units or greater in two consecutive samples (i.e., secondary outcome), respectively.</p>

<title>Genetic ancestry inference</title>
<p>Out of 7759 individuals 5277 (68.0%) had self-reported race/ethnicity information as African American (65), Hispanic (558) and White non-Hispanic (4654). These were assigned to AFR, AMR and EUR superpopulation groups, respectively. The remaining 2482 individuals’ population membership was inferred using the software Kinship-based INference for Gwas (KING v2.2.7, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Manichaikul et al., 2010</xref>)) ancestry inference commands (<monospace>king -b reference.bed,samples.bed --pca --projection</monospace>). Briefly, the program uses 2409 samples from the 1000 genomes project with known population information to create Principal Components (PCs) and projects the study samples onto these PCs based on their genetic variation data (from ImmunoChip and Whole Genome Sequencing for TEDDY samples). Python sklearn library’s (v0.24.2) RandomForestClassifier module was used to assign population membership using the PCs generated by KING. The classifier’s performance was assessed by splitting the 2409 individuals from 1000 genomes project with known ancestry into training (70%) and test (30%) sets which showed an accuracy of 99.6%. For ancestry assignment of study samples, all 2409 samples from 1000 Genomes Project were used as the training data and all 7903 TEDDY samples (all samples with genetic data including those that were not in the final data set. e.g. with ineligible HLA types) as test data. Study samples where the ancestry information was reported were compared to the classifier predictions which showed 95.6% concordance. The inferred population information was used only for the 2482 samples that did not have the self-reported ancestry data.</p>

<title>Statistical model</title>
<p>The Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) method was used to analyze the impact of tri-SNP haplotypes on primary and secondary T1D and CD disease outcomes. T1D diagnosis, islet autoimmunity (IA), first-appearing islet autoantibody, celiac diagnosis (CD) and celiac disease autoantibody (CDA) status were defined as events in separate models; age of the subject (in months) was used as the time component. When the event was not observed, age at the latest clinic visit (for CD or T1D) or at the last negative serum sample collection (for IA and CDA) was used as the right-censor time. In the first appearing autoantibody models, samples were right-censored if any other antibody than the one in the model outcome first appeared.</p>

Tri-SNP 101 allele was modeled as a numerical variable (0, 1 or 2 alleles) representing an additive genetic effect, and hence, its hazard ratio values should be interpreted as HR per each additional allele. Similarly, the known GWAS loci were encoded numerically (0, 1, 2 alternate alleles). For the categorical covariates HLA type, sex, country and genetic ancestry the baselines were assigned to DR4/DR8, female, USA and EUR, respectively.

<title>Study Population Demographics</title>
<p>The TEDDY database analyzed here was frozen as of 31 October 2021 and the present analysis represents a median follow up of 12.7 years (IQR=10.9-14.4). 382 (5.0%) children had been diagnosed with T1D and 617 (8.0%) with CD. The TEDDY study is ongoing and about 75% of the research subjects have still to age out (15 years of age) of the study.</p>
<p>There were 7759 study subjects with HLA and tri-SNP typing data available. Ancestry distribution was 89.6% European (EUR, N=6953), 9.1% Ad Mixed American (AMR, N=707), 1% African (AFR, N=82), 0.2% South Asian (SAS, N=14) and &lt;0.1% East Asian (EAS, N=3).</p>
<p>The distribution of tri-SNP haplotypes and HLA genotypes is shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. As anticipated, given the study inclusion criteria, most (N=7503) participants were homozygous for either DR3 or DR4, heterozygous for DR3/DR4, or heterozygous for DR4/DR8. With respect to the distribution of tri-SNP haplotypes in this population, nearly all subjects had at least one 101 or 010 tri-SNP; only 22 (0.3%) did not. The 101 tri-SNP haplotype was observed almost exclusively coupled to the DR3-DQ2 haplotype; 99.6% (2357/2366) of the chromosomes from 101/101 homozygous individuals carried the DR3-DQ2 haplotype. Similarly, 101 is highly enriched in the DR3 population; 84% (2716/3232) of the chromosomes from DR3 homozygous individuals had 101, in line with our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aydemir et al., 2019</xref>). Approximately 99% of the DR3 homozygous population carried either 010 or 101 (3203/3232). We also observed that 98.2% of the DR4/DR4 homozygous population carried 010 (3007/3062).</p>

Our model showed a significantly reduced independent risk associated with the tri-SNP 101 haplotype (HR=0.71,CI=0.58-0.87, p=0.001), each protective allele conferring 29% reduction in risk of developing islet autoantibodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).

<title>First Appearing Islet Autoantibody</title>

Although tri-SNP-101 trended towards protection against GADA-first outcome, this effect did not reach statistical significance either in the entire dataset (HR=0.87, CI=0.64-1.17, p=0.34, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, Supplementary Data Table 5) or in DR3-DQ2 homozygotes (HR=0.71, CI=0.47-1.07, p=0.10, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, Supplementary Data, Supplementary Data Table 6).

We note that since the incidence of IAA-first among DR3-DQ2 homozygotes at 1.8% (29/1578) is relatively low, samples from African genetic background (N=32, incidence=0), and one low frequency GWAS locus (Supplementary Data) were excluded from this analysis to accommodate the model requirements.</p>

Reads mapping to these regions were used to estimate C4A (left column) and C4B (right column) copy numbers per sample. Samples were sorted based on C4A copy numbers. A maximum value of 4 was used for the heatmap to moderate high outlier values.</p></caption>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report confirmation of the tri-SNP association with T1D in a much larger, independent cohort. In addition, we show that the 101 tri-SNP haplotype is also associated with reduced risk of developing IA. Although the primary outcome of the TEDDY study was IA, it has been recognized in multiple studies that there may be two distinct “endotypes” of T1D autoimmunity based on the timing of emergence of specific autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Battaglia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Krischer et al., 2015</xref>). One of the proposed endotypes is characterized by the appearance of insulin autoantibody (IAA) early on as the first marker of IA, termed “IAA-first”, and it is associated with HLA DR4-DQ8 haplotype. The second endotype is marked by the emergence at a later time of GAD autoantibodies as the first IA marker, termed “GADA-first”, is associated with DR3-DQ2 haplotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Krischer et al., 2015</xref>). We show that the tri-SNP is significantly associated with protection from the IAA-first outcome but not the GADA-first outcome, indicating that the main T1D protective effect of tri-SNP may be due to delay or prevention of insulin autoantibody generation. This may explain the low incidence of the IAA-first endotype among DR3-DQ2 carrying individuals, given the enrichment of the protective tri-SNP allele on the DR3-DQ2 chromosomes.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, we discovered that the T1D-protective tri-SNP 101 haplotype is associated with <italic>increased</italic> risk for both autoantibody development (CDA) and clinical CD. This finding is surprising because CD and T1D are thought to share genetic risk factors not only because of the increased co-occurrence of the two pathologies but also because DR3-DQ2 and DR4-DQ8 are major genetic loci for susceptibility for both disorders. An extended HLA-DR3 haplotype (B8) was described in literature as having a differential impact on T1D and CD development in a small sample set of Basque population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bilbao et al., 2006</xref>) but this was not replicated in our sample set. Therefore, the opposite effects of the tri-SNP haplotype on the risk of T1D and CD in our cohort are novel and independent of extended B8 haplotype.</p>
<p>Tri-SNP is a valuable addition to the collection of known genetic and environmental factors that are in use to predict T1D and CD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bonifacio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Romanos et al., 2014</xref>). Knowing whether a high risk HLA child is more likely to develop T1D or CD may aid in decisions about early therapeutic or preventive interventions, such as strict gluten-free diet or preventive anti-CD3 antibody treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Herold et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings advance our understanding of complex polygenic diseases and should provide a more precise risk/benefit assessment of potential treatments based on data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we investigated potential mechanisms underlying the differential association of tri-SNP with T1D and CD by analyzing gene expression differences based on the tri-SNP genotype. Complement system genes C4A and C4B emerged as intriguing candidates whose expression changed in opposite direction with respect to tri-SNP genotype. C4 locus has been reported to have frequent copy number variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we explored whether the gene expression changes we observe may be due to changes in gene copy numbers (GCN). Indeed, tri-SNP 101, which is associated with decreased C4A and increased C4B gene expression, was also associated with frequent C4A gene deletions and increased C4B GCN. We also observed that close to 90% of our samples were missing at least one C4 gene. Reduced C4 GCN have been associated with the development of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pereira et al., 2016</xref>), juvenile dermatomyositis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lintner et al., 2016</xref>) and rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rigby et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, lower serum levels of C4 protein have been suggested to predispose to T1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Vergani et al., 1983</xref>). Taken together, reduced total C4 GCN frequent in our high risk HLA cohort is inline with the reports of increased susceptibility of low C4 to autoimmune diseases, and the different disease outcomes based on the tri-SNP haplotype may be, in part, due to the absence of specific C4 genes carried on that haplotype. Although the link between tri-SNP and C4 GCN is intriguing, independent association analyses for C4 genes and diseases were not possible due to the small number of samples with the GCN data. In addition, given the presence of other differentially expressed genes in the MHC locus, it is possible that the differential risk marked by tri-SNP is due to multiple factors.</p>

<p>This study presents <bold>valuable</bold> findings on genetic risk factors for type 1 diabetes and celiac disease using a large cohort from the Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is <bold>solid</bold>, although the inclusion of the genetic effect of this locus on individuals with different genetic backgrounds would have strengthened the study. The work will be of interest to population geneticists working on diabetes and celiac disease.</p>

<p>Polymorphisms in genes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region comprise the most important inherited risk factors for many autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD). The paper focuses on the novel triad ((SNPs): rs3135394, rs9268645, and rs3129877) finding quite interesting results. The paper suggests further studies at the molecular and structural level to increase our fundamental knowledge of the etiology of autoimmune deceases.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Aydemir et al. utilized the large TEDDY study and examined the effect of previously identified tri-SNP in the HLA-DRA gene on the risk of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD). They confirmed the protective effect of the tri-SNP haplotype &quot;101&quot; on T1D development. Meanwhile, the same haplotype appeared to be positively associated with risk for CD and the development of CD autoimmunity. The authors further explored the molecular effect of different tri-SNP haplotypes. They proposed that C4A and C4B might be the downstream target.</p>
<p>Overall, the study is rigorously conducted with proper statistical methods applied. The tri-SNP could be used as an additional risk factor when estimating T1D and celiac disease susceptibility in genetic screening. However, how this locus be incorporated into the current scheme of genetic screening is not discussed and is unlikely to be straightforward.</p>
