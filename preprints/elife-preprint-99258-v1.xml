<title>Abstract</title><p>Understanding how the brain controls nutrient storage is pivotal. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are conserved from insects to humans. They serve in detecting environmental shifts and in acting as internal sensors. Here, we found that a TRPγ mutant exhibited in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> are required for maintaining normal lipid and protein levels. In animals, lipogenesis and lipolysis control lipid levels in response to food availability. Lipids are mostly stored as triacylglycerol in the fat bodies (FBs) of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Interestingly, <italic>trpγ</italic> deficient mutants exhibited elevated TAG levels and our genetic data indicated that <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons are indispensable for normal lipid storage but not protein storage. The <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants also exhibited reduced starvation resistance, which was attributed to insufficient lipolysis in the FBs. This could be mitigated by administering lipase or metformin orally, indicating a potential treatment pathway. Gene expression analysis indicated that <italic>trpγ</italic> knockout downregulated <italic>brummer</italic>, a key lipolytic gene, resulting in chronic lipolytic deficits in the gut and other fat tissues. The study also highlighted the role of specific proteins, including neuropeptide DH44 and its receptor DH44R2 in lipid regulation. Our findings provide insight into the broader question of how the brain regulates nutrient storage.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nutrient storage is not a simple matter of accumulation but involves a sophisticated network of signals and receptors, feedback loops, and hormonal influences, all choreographed by the brain. The mechanisms involve various tissues and organs, including the liver, muscles, and adipose tissue, each playing a distinct role in the storage and release of vital nutrients like glucose, fats, and proteins in mammals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Key to this regulation are specialized cells and molecular pathways that respond to dietary intake, energy expenditure, and changes in the internal and external environment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. For instance, the brain receives and interprets signals about the body’s energy status through hormones such as insulin and leptin, and nutrients themselves, which inform decisions on whether to store or mobilize energy reserves in mammals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Moreover, the role of Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels as molecular sensors that detect changes in the environment and internal metabolic status highlights the level of molecular sophistication involved in nutrient storage and energy balance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. These channels bridge external stimuli with internal responses, ensuring the body adapts efficiently to maintain homeostasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. This concert of mechanisms, from the molecular to the systemic level, exemplifies the elegance with which the brain ensures our energy needs are met in a changing environment, highlighting the intricate interplay of biological process that sustains life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Understanding these processes opens up new vistas in our approach to diet, disease management, and overall health optimization.</p>
<p>The use of a genetically tractable model organism such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> could provide fundamental insights into the potential relationship between TRP channels and metabolic syndrome. This study delves into the function of TRPγ channels, specifically their role in managing lipid and protein levels. Through genetic manipulation, we explored the consequences of TRPγ mutations on the metabolic processes, revealing critical insights into the regulation of lipid storage and breakdown. Our investigation sheds light on the balance between lipogenesis and lipolysis, processes that respectively synthesize and degrade lipids based on the availability of food, and how these processes are affected by TRPγ activity. By examining the metabolic anomalies in <italic>trpγ</italic> deficient mutants, including alterations in lipid storage and the consequent impact on starvation resistance, this study advances our understanding of metabolic regulation. Furthermore, we uncover the potential therapeutic benefits of lipase and metformin in counteracting the metabolic deficiencies caused by TRPγ mutations. Through detailed gene expression analysis, we identify the downregulation of crucial genes involved in lipid metabolism, offering new perspectives on the genetic underpinnings of nutrient storage regulation. The implications of this research are far-reaching, not only enhancing our comprehension of basic biological functions but also providing avenues for therapeutic interventions in metabolic disorders.</p>

<title>TRPγ mutants exhibit reduced sugar level alongside elevated lipid and protein levels</title>
<p>In order to understand how <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> regulates the maintenance of major nutrient levels, including carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, TRP channel mutants were examined as potential candidates. A recent study revealed that among these mutants, the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant displayed only reduced carbohydrate levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, suggesting the involvement of additional TRP channels in regulating major nutrients. <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> possesses 13 members of the TRP channel family. Flies with mutations in <italic>trpM</italic>, <italic>trpML</italic>, and <italic>nompC</italic> showed high mortality rates with minimal survival, whereas those with mutations in the remaining 10 TRP superfamily genes were viable and healthy when homozygous. Investigation into the lipid and protein levels of other available TRP superfamily mutants revealed that, apart from the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant, all tested mutants exhibited normal levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref><bold><italic> and </italic></bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Specifically, the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant showed 1.3 times higher triacylglycerol (TAG) levels and 1.5 times higher protein levels compared to the control. These metabolic changes were unique and specific to the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants among the evaluated TRP superfamily mutants. Previous observations indicated that <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants had lower cellular sugar levels and stored glycogen. Consistently, <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants exhibited reduced levels of cellular sugars (glucose and trehalose), stored glycogen, and sugar levels in the hemolymph (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C–E</xref>). In conclusion, it was found that <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants displayed lower carbohydrate levels but higher lipid and protein levels compared to the control. Importantly, the increased TAG and protein levels observed in <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants were confirmed with a second <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> allele (<italic>trpγ<sup>G4</sup></italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref><bold><italic> and </italic></bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). Furthermore, we restored the deficiency in lipid and protein levels using a genomic <italic>trpγ</italic><sup>+</sup> transgene, <italic>g</italic>(<italic>trpγ</italic>), and by introducing a <italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>trpγ</italic> cDNA, controlled by <italic>GAL4</italic>, into the <italic>trpγ</italic> locus (<italic>trpγ<sup>G4</sup></italic> flies; +).</p>

<title>TRPγ regulates lipid metabolism through Dh44 neuroendocrine cells in the pars intercerebralis</title>
<p>We recently proposed that TRPγ expression in the six DH44 neuroendocrine cells in the pars intercerebralis (PI) located in the dorsal medial area of the brain is essential to maintain normal carbohydrate levels in tissues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref><italic>–<bold>figure supplement 1A1</bold>–<bold>A3</bold></italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Therefore, we next sought to determine whether protein and lipid levels can be regulated by the same neuroendocrine cells. To test this, we used a transgenic fly encoding an inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel (<italic>UAS-Kir2.1</italic>) to inactivate specific neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref><bold><italic> and </italic></bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Interestingly, inactivating the <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons significantly increased the lipid levels but not protein levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref><bold><italic> and </italic></bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Approximately 16 neurons in the PI express dILP2, which are also overlapped by two DH44-positive neurons in 5 to 10 days old adult male flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref><italic>–<bold>figure supplement 1B1</bold>–<bold>B3</bold></italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. However, inactivation of <italic>dILP2</italic> neurons did not impair either lipid or protein levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref><bold><italic> and </italic></bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). In conclusion, our findings indicated that DH44 neuroendocrine cells contribute to lipid regulation but not protein regulation.</p>

<p>To assess whether <italic>trpγ</italic> expression in <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons is sufficient to restore normal lipid and protein levels in <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant flies, we expressed the <italic>UAS-trpγ</italic> under the control of <italic>Dh44</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> in the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant background (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref><bold><italic> and </italic></bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Our findings indicated that the increased lipid levels in the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant background decreased to normal levels via the expression of the <italic>trpγ</italic> transgene in the DH44 neuroendocrine cells but not in its parent strains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Again, the expression of the <italic>trpγ</italic> transgene in the dILP2 neurons had no appreciable effects (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, the expression of the <italic>trpγ</italic> transgene did not decrease the protein levels in either the DH44 or the dILP2 neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). This indicates that TRPγ is sufficient for the regulation of lipid levels in the DH44 cells. Next, RNAi-mediated knockdown experiments were conducted to further examine the role of <italic>trpγ</italic> in <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons. Interestingly, <italic>trpγ</italic> knockdown in <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons significantly increased lipid levels, whereas flies harboring only the <italic>Dh44-GAL4</italic> or the <italic>UAS-trpγ</italic><sup>RNAi</sup> transgenes displayed normal lipid levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). This indicated that TRPγ is needed for the regulation of lipid levels. Furthermore, the total TAG level in the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> flies was higher in both males and females (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref><italic>–<bold>figure supplement 1C</bold></italic>), meaning that the functions of <italic>trpγ</italic> are not sex-specific.</p>
<p>In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, lipids are mainly stored in the form of TAG and cholesterol ester in the adipose tissue [i.e., fat bodies (FBs)] as lipid droplets (LDs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Consistent with the increased TAG in tissues, Nile red staining of the FBs of <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>trpγ<sup>G4</sup></italic> flies exhibited larger lipid mass compared to control animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>–<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">I</xref>). These LDs returned to their normal size through the expression of <italic>trpγ</italic> in <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons but not <italic>dILP2</italic> neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref><bold><italic> and </italic></bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2J</xref><bold><italic>–L</italic></bold>). Additionally, inactivating the <italic>Dh44</italic> cells (<italic>Dh44</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic>/<italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>Kir2.1</italic>) recapitulated the enlarged LD phenotype of the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>–<bold><italic>figure supplement 1D</italic></bold>–<bold><italic>G</italic></bold>). Overall, our findings indicated that <italic>trpγ</italic> expression regulates lipid and carbohydrate homeostasis but not protein levels in DH44 neuroendocrine cells in the PI.</p>

<title>TRPγ mutants exhibit starvation susceptibility and deficits in lipolysis</title>
<p>Higher lipid cellular levels may decrease lifespan <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, we measured the lifespan of control and <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> flies fed with a standard cornmeal diet (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). However, the lifespans of control and <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> flies were not significantly different under normal conditions.

<p>The starvation sensitive phenotype in the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants may have been due to decreased carbohydrate storage in tissues, including glucose, trehalose, and glycogen. However, we previously demonstrated that <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants could utilize carbohydrates under starved conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the elevated whole-body TAG levels in the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant flies might suggest that they were unable to break down stored lipids even under starving conditions. Metazoans must coordinate the metabolism of glycogen, lipid, and protein to maintain metabolic homeostasis during fasting periods, thus providing an appropriate energy supply across tissues. Therefore, the total TAG levels of the control and <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant flies were assessed under sated and starved (starvation for 24 h) conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>–<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). When the control flies were deprived of food for 24 h, their TAG levels decreased significantly (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants exhibited no changes in whole-body TAG levels before and after starvation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). To further confirm that lipolysis was restricted in the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants under starvation conditions, LDs were stained, after which we measured the sizes of individual LDs accumulated throughout the whole fat bodies of the flies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>–<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Despite considerable variations, the sizes of the LDs in the control flies were significantly reduced after starvation. In contrast, no significant differences in LD sizes were identified between the sated and starved conditions in the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> flies. We examined how overexpression and knockdown of <italic>trpγ</italic> in <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons affect the starvation phenotype. Overexpressing <italic>trpγ</italic> in <italic>Dh44</italic> cells resulted in similarity to the wild-type in both sated and starved conditions, as well as normal survival time under starvation conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref><bold><italic> and </italic></bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref><italic>–<bold>figure supplement 1A</bold></italic>). Conversely, <italic>trpγ<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> knockdown flies in <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons reproduced phenotypic traits observed in TRPγ mutants, including decreased lipid levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>–<bold><italic>figure supplement 1B</italic></bold>) and reduced survival time under starvation conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as the master controller for maintaining energy balance in cells, coordinating metabolic pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. It regulates the balance between building up and breaking down substances to ensure cellular stability during metabolic stress. AMPK is a key target for treating metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and obesity, as its activation increases fatty acid oxidation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. We wonder if activating AMPK in <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons serves as a rescue mechanism for lipolysis. The expression of AMPK<sup>TD</sup>, activated form of AMPK <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> in <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons indeed restored the elevated TAG levels observed in <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). This suggests that AMPK functions as a downstream component of <italic>Dh44</italic> neuronal activation.</p>

<title>Recovery of the starvation resistance of the TRPγ mutant via metformin treatment</title>
<p>Metformin is widely used to treat many metabolic diseases such as type II diabetes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. We previously demonstrated that 1 to 5 mM metformin can induce hypoglycemia, in addition to suppressing fat storage in flies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Therefore, we next sought to test whether the increased lipid levels of the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant can be reduced to a normal level via oral administration of metformin. First, we measured TAG levels at 0, 7, and 14 days after dietary administration of 1 mM or 5 mM of metformin (the treatments were prepared by mixing the appropriate metformin concentrations into standard cornmeal diets) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref><bold><italic> and </italic></bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). The high TAG levels in the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant (41.91 ±4.56) were decreased to levels similar to those of the control at 7 and 14 days (30.03 ±4.34 and 33.79 ±3.20, respectively) after treatment with 1 mM metformin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, although oral administration of 1 mM metformin did not affect the TAG level in the control, the 5 mM metformin treatment significantly reduced the TAG level of the control flies at 14 days (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, the 5 mM metformin treatment was more effective in reducing the TAG level in the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant. These findings indicated that oral administration of metformin can either suppress lipogenesis or enhance lipolysis in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. To further confirm the effects of metformin treatment, LDs were analyzed under the same condition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref><bold><italic> and </italic></bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). The sizes of the LDs in the control and <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant flies were significantly reduced after treatment with 1 mM metformin at 14 days or 5 mM metformin at 7 and 14 days (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we sought to assess whether metformin could increase starvation resistance in the control and <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant flies. To test this hypothesis, the starvation resistance of the flies was measured with or without metformin. Neither of the metformin concentrations appeared to affect the starvation resistance of the control flies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref><bold><italic> and </italic></bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). However, although metformin did not restore the starvation resistance of the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant flies to the level of the controls, it did significantly extend their survival (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref><bold><italic> and </italic></bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>; LT<sub>50</sub> of the control at 1 mM and 5 mM: 56.06 ±1.40 h and 52.39 ±2.09 h, respectively; LT<sub>50</sub> of the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant at 1 mM and 5 mM: 50.35 ±3.34 h and 46.42 ±1.54 h, respectively).

<title>Recovery of the TRPγ mutant through oral lipase administration or lipid absorption</title>
<p>The intestine is a key organ for lipid absorption and metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> and disturbances in intestinal lipid metabolism are associated with hyperlipidemia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Therefore, we next sought to determine whether <italic>trpγ</italic> mutation reduces lipase production in the abdomen by comparing lipid accumulation in the intestine. The Drosophila midgut is divided into R1–R5 regions, each with distinct functions in nutrient processing and absorption. Notably, the R2 region serves as a critical interface between the fly’s diet and metabolic processes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. To assess lipid distribution, we conducted Nile red staining in control and mutant animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>–<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Mutant flies displayed elevated lipid deposits on the intestinal wall of the R2 region (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), a phenotype restored to normal levels by expressing <italic>trpγ</italic> in its own cells or <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>–<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Consequently, we quantified lipid droplets specifically within the intestinal wall of the R2 region in <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> flies, with no such accumulation observed in control or rescued flies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). These findings indicate that TRPγ plays a crucial role in the brain-gut axis, specifically in controlling lipid metabolism in the intestine, as evidenced by the lipid accumulation observed in the gut region of <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic>. To clarify if our observations were due to insufficient activity of lipase in the gut, lipase enzyme mixed with 1% agar food was supplied to both control and mutants flies. Given that the brief activity of lipase in the intestine, lipase-containing agar food was provided to the flies every 12 h. Surprisingly, supplementation with lipase, but not denatured lipase, under starvation conditions increased the survival of <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant flies to levels comparable to those of the control flies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>; LT<sub>50</sub> of lipase treated-control and <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic>: 50.35 ±0.93 h and 44.94 ±1.33 h, respectively). To support the hypothesis that the extended lifespan of mutant flies during starvation is associated with dietary lipase intake, we examined lipid accumulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref><italic>–<bold>figure supplement 1A</bold></italic>–<bold><italic>E</italic></bold>). Lipase treatment resulted in the breakdown of lipid deposits in the mutant R2 region of intestine. Importantly, only active lipase showed an enhanced survival time under starvation conditions in mutant flies, while denatured lipase did not exhibit this effect. Therefore, our findings suggest that lipase may play a role in digesting accumulated lipid in the intestine, though the mechanisms of lipase absorption remain unclear.</p>

<p>Next, we sought to assess the involvement of each of the components of TAG in the recovery of starvation susceptibility. TAG is composed of glycerol and three fatty acids. Therefore, we first fed the flies with 1% glycerol only. Glycerol extended the survival of the control and <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> flies by 3–4-fold (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). However, the LT<sub>50</sub> of the control and <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> were still significantly different (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>; LT<sub>50</sub> of control and <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic>: 244.5 ± 20.10 h and 117.75 ± 3.32 h, respectively). Next, the flies were fed with 0.2% and 0.5% hexanoic acid (HA) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref><bold><italic> and </italic></bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref><italic>–<bold>figure supplement 1F</bold></italic>; 0.2% HA, LT<sub>50</sub> of control and <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic>: 65.44 ± 1.94 h and 52.32 ±2.05 h, respectively; 0.5% HA, LT<sub>50</sub> of control and <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic>: 56.27 ±1.30 h and 46.27 ±1.47 h, respectively). Additionally, we also tested the effects of 0.2% and 0.5% concentrations of a TAG mixture (combination of mono-, di-, and tri- acylglycerol) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref><bold><italic> and </italic></bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref><bold><italic>–figure supplement 1G</italic></bold>; 0.2% TAG, LT<sub>50</sub> of control and <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic>: 52.93 ±5.12 h and 50.1 ±3.74 h, respectively; 0.5% TAG, LT<sub>50</sub> of control and <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic>: 65.1 ±2.6 h and 57.75 ±3.32 h, respectively). The HA and mixed TAG treatments significantly extended the survival of the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants, albeit not to levels similar to those of the control. This indicated that the TRPγ mutants could not fully absorb and burn the digested lipid. Furthermore, lipid-only dietary supplementation markedly limited the LT<sub>50</sub> of the control. Importantly, supplementation with lipolytic drugs, lipase, TAG, and free fatty acids effectively rescued the survival of <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants under starvation conditions. This observation was consistent with our finding that <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants are unable to degrade lipid stores under starvation conditions. The dietary rescue of <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants suggests that although the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutation increases the levels of stored lipids, the flies were not able to utilize them when starved. Taken together, these observations indicate that TRPγ plays an important role in maintaining systemic lipid levels through proper expression of triglyceride lipase.</p>

<title>Downregulation of the lipolytic gene <italic>brummer</italic> in <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants</title>
<p>The <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants exhibited marked alterations in the levels of major nutrients. Therefore, we next sought to analyze the transcriptional levels of genes related to gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and lipolysis. Gluconeogenesis is a metabolic process that produces glucose from non-carbohydrate carbon substrates. The genome of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> harbors two gluconeogenic genes: <italic>fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase</italic> (<italic>fbp</italic>) and <italic>phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1</italic> (<italic>pepck1</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The results of our real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses indicated that the transcription levels of <italic>fbp</italic> and <italic>pepck1</italic> were not significantly different between control flies under sated and starved conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Next, we analyzed two lipogenic genes: <italic>acetyl–CoA carboxylase</italic> (<italic>acc</italic>) and <italic>desaturase 1</italic> (<italic>desat1</italic>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. No significant differences were identified between the control and <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> flies under both conditions. Finally, we investigated the expression of the lipolytic gene <italic>brummer</italic> (<italic>bmm</italic>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Under starved conditions, the transcriptional level of <italic>bmm</italic> was highly increased in the control. In contrast, <italic>bmm</italic> was downregulated in <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> under sated and starved conditions. Therefore, the transcriptional regulation of <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> and <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> during starvation was markedly and significantly different. Brummer, a homolog of human adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL), is associated with lipid storage in the form of LDs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. These results suggest that the lipolytic process is not sufficient to deplete stored lipids in the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant, resulting in excessive lipid storage. Therefore, the survival time of the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant during starvation was significantly shorter than that of the control.</p>

<p>Transgenic flies expressing <italic>bmm</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic> (<italic>bmm</italic> promoter <italic>GFP</italic>) in their FB cells were used to examine <italic>bmm</italic> expression in LDs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.

<title>Assessment of the role of DH44 and its receptors (DH44R1 and DH44R2) in relation to the utilization of fat</title>
<p>In Drosophila, two receptors have been identified for DH44 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Sugars such as D-glucose, D-trehalose, and D-fructose are commonly detected in DH44 neurons in the PI due to the inherent nature and functions of these cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Here, we found that the function of TRPγ, one of the TRPC channels of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, in DH44 neuroendocrine cells plays an essential role in lipid regulation, which is linked to alterations in membrane lipids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant exhibited clear signs of metabolic syndrome, as demonstrated by reduced carbohydrate level coupled with much higher protein and lipid levels in the body. More importantly, we found that the expression of <italic>trpγ</italic> was necessary and sufficient to regulate the carbohydrate and lipid levels in the DH44 neurons of <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants. However, we failed to identify the specific cells required for regulating protein homeostasis because the increased protein levels in the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants were not recovered by pilot screening (data not shown) except in the <italic>trpγ</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic>. In conclusion, our findings suggested that the DH44 system has important roles in regulating the metabolic homeostasis of carbohydrates and lipids. Recent studies have suggested that corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is the mammalian homolog of DH44 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Therefore, we propose that CRH neurons may also regulate lipid levels.</p>
<p>The metabolic dysregulation of carbohydrates and lipids observed in the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants was phenocopied by the cellular inactivation of DH44 cells. Compared to the controls, the <italic>Dh44</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic>/<italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>Kir2.1</italic> flies exhibited lower carbohydrate levels and increased lipid levels. We previously proposed that TRPγ holds DH44 neurons in a state of afterdepolarization, thus reducing firing rates by inactivating voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. At the physiological level, this induces the consistent release of DH44 and depletion of DH44 stores, resulting in nutrient utilization and storage malfunctions. Likewise, our findings revealed that <italic>Dh44</italic> mutant and its receptor mutant, <italic>Dh44R2</italic>, displayed defects analogous to those observed in the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant. Finally, it would also be interesting to investigate the potential roles of TRPC members in humans, especially the involvement of TRPC4 and TRPC5 in metabolic syndrome.</p>
<p>Multiple lines of evidence have suggested that DH44 neurons communicate with the intestine. First, DH44 at the PI in the brain is an incretin-like hormone that acts as a hemolymph nutrient sensor. The secretion of DH44 is highly dependent on the calorie value of a given diet, as DH44 secretion is only mediated by nutritional sugars but not non-nutritional sugars <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Second, the expression of TRPγ in the PI is sufficient to recover any metabolic defects such as reduced carbohydrate and increased lipid levels, as well as related phenomena such as starvation resistance. DH44 and kinin neuropeptides influence desiccation and starvation tolerance in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Although <italic>Dh44<sup>Mi</sup></italic>exhibited normal TAG levels, the presence of larger LDs indicated that DH44 plays a regulatory role in lipid metabolism. LDs consist of a hydrophobic core of neutral storage fats, such as triglycerides or cholesterol esters, encased by a protein-coated phospholipid monolayer. From our findings, it is suggested that DH44 and its receptor DH44R2, but not DH44R1, are involved in the control of lipid storage, indicating a specific pathway through which DH44 influences lipid metabolism distinct from its role in carbohydrate metabolism and overall energy homeostasis. Third, <italic>trpγ</italic> gene knockdown through RNAi in the DH44 neurons is enough to phenocopy all of the metabolic defects observed in the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants. Fourth, <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants exhibit low expression of <italic>brummer</italic> lipase, which results in accumulation of LDs in the body, which is a reciprocal process regulated by DH44 neurons. Fifth, the activation of AMPK in the DH44 neurons can recover the defects of lipid level of <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic>. Sixth, the reduced starvation resistance can be significantly recovered through dietary lipase supplementation. These findings support the assertion that the sugar-sensing DH44 neurons send downward signals to the intestine by absorbing the carbohydrates and lipids derived from dietary intake. However, DH44 neurons do not regulate protein levels in the body because the increased protein levels of <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants were not recovered by the expression of <italic>trpγ</italic> in the DH44 neurons. Nevertheless, it is also known that DH44 neurons mediate the influence of dietary amino acids on promoting food intake in flies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. These findings confirm that <italic>trpγ</italic> regulates <italic>bmm</italic> expression in the adult bowel, enabling dietary lipid digestion and maintaining systemic lipid homeostasis.</p>
<p>Treatment with metformin, a lipolytic agent, at two different concentrations (1 mM and 5 mM) decreased the total TAG levels and reduced the size of the LDs in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Similarly, metformin increased the starvation resistance of the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants but not the controls. These findings were consistent with the widely acknowledged anti-obesity properties of metformin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our results were in agreement with the evidence that metformin helps to reduce lipid accumulation caused by diets rich in saturated fatty acids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Although the exact target of metformin is not known, its lipolytic effect is significant and widely documented. Oral administration of 5 mM of metformin reduced normal TAG levels of wild-type flies, whereas the 1 mM dose had no significant effect. Therefore, low metformin doses were effective at decreasing stored lipid levels in flies. The accumulation of intracellular LDs is regulated by autophagy. Metformin improves autophagic flux through AMPKα-mediated mechanisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In the Drosophila context, we propose a mechanism involving AMPK activation within DH44 neurons as a rescue mechanism for starvation resistance in <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic>, highlighting its crucial role in this process. AMPK activation is known to enhance an organism’s ability to endure environmental stresses by facilitating autophagy-mediated cellular cleanup, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis for increased energy production, and optimizing metabolic pathways for enhanced energy efficiency <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. While the precise nature of the connection between TRPγ, DH44 neuronal activity, and AMPK activation remains unspecified, it is conceivable that TRPγ influences AMPK activation or regulation within DH44 neurons, contributing to stress responses, ATP supply, and metabolic adaptations. Metformin can influence lipid metabolism through various mechanisms, one of which is the promotion of lipolysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. This effect results in a gradual reduction of stored lipid levels over time. Orally administering metformin to flies led to a significant reduction in lipid levels, accompanied by an increase in survival. Subsequent qPCR analysis post-metformin feeding revealed a significant upregulation in the expression level of the lipolytic gene (<italic>bmm</italic>). These results strongly support our hypothesis that metformin induces lipolysis when orally administered.</p>
<p>The exact mechanism through which orally administered lipase leads to gastric lipolysis remains unclear. However, our experimental data indicated that 0.1% lipase increased the survival time of <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> under starvation. Lipase exhibits a high degree of chemical selectivity and has the ability to catalyze triglyceride into glycerol ester, monoglycerides, glycerol, and fatty acids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Free fatty acids, HA, and glycerol at concentrations of 0.2%–0.5% can be utilized as energy sources and increase survival time under starvation conditions, suggesting that <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> participates in the utilization of HA and glycerol under starvation conditions.</p>
<p>The therapeutic properties of metformin as a lipolytic and anti-diabetic drug have been widely documented in humans. However, additional studies are needed to identify the exact target of metformin. In this context, our findings demonstrate that <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> can be an excellent model to study the mode of action and biosafety of metformin.</p>

<p>Nile Red is a dark purplish-red powder (Sigma N-3013), the stock solution must be prepared in acetone (1000 µg/mL) and kept in a tightly sealed, lightproof container at 4 °C. Briefly, 5–10 day-old male flies were fixed in a sagittal position on a glass slide and submerged in a 1 X PBS solution. FBs were gently dissected from a dorsal abdominal region along with thorax or the gut under a stereomicroscope. The dissected tissues were fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution for 15 minutes at room temperature. The fixed tissues were gently washed three times with 1X PBS (5 min for each wash). Nile Red (1:1000 dilution) were added to the tissue samples for 5 minutes. Finally, the stained tissues were washed with 1 mL 1X PBS and mounted in 50% glycerol on a glass slide. LD deposition exhibits greater density in the upper abdominal region compared to the lower abdominal area. This comparison was meticulously conducted within the identical segments 2-3 of the abdomen to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>For intestinal lipid staining, 5-10 days old male flies were fixed on a glass slide and submerged in 1X PBS solution. Full intestine was dissected very carefully.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This research article by Nath et al. from the Lee Lab addresses how lipolysis under starvation is achieved by a transient receptor potential channel, TRPγ, in the neuroendocrine neurons to help animals survive prolonged starvation. Through a series of genetic analyses, the authors identify that TRPγ mutations specifically lead to a failure in lipolytic processes under starvation, thereby reducing animals' starvation resistance. The conclusion was confirmed through total triacylglycerol levels in the animals and lipid droplet staining in the fat bodies. This study highlights the importance of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in the fly brain to modulate energy homeostasis and combat metabolic stress. While the data is compelling and the message is easy to follow, several aspects require further clarification to improve the interpretation of the research and its visibility in the field.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study identifies the biological meaning of TRPγ in promoting lipolysis during starvation, advancing our knowledge about TRP channels and the neural mechanisms to combat metabolic stress. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the potential of the TRP channel as a target to develop new therapeutic strategies for human metabolic disorders by showing that metformin and AMPK pathways are involved in its function in lipid metabolisms during starvation in Drosophila.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some key results that might strengthen their conclusions were left out for discussion or careful explanation (see below). If the authors could improve the writing to address their findings and connect their findings with conclusions, the research would be much more appreciated and have a higher impact in the field.</p>
<p>Here, I listed the major issues and suggestions for the authors to improve their manuscript:</p>
<p>(1) Are the increased lipid droplet size and the upregulated total TAG level measured in the starved or sated mutant in Figure 1? This information might be crucial for readers to understand the physiological function of TRP in lipid metabolism. In other words, clarifying whether the upregulated lipid storage is observed only in the starved trp mutant will advance our knowledge of TRPγ. If the increase of total TAG level is only observed in the starved animals, TRP in the Dh44 neurons might serve as a sensor for the starvation state required to promote lipolysis in starvation conditions. On the other hand, if the total TAG level increases in both starved and sated animals, activation of Dh44 through TRPγ might be involved in the lipid metabolism process after food ingestion.</p>
<p>(2) It is unclear how AMPK activation in Dh44 neurons reduces the total triacylglycerol (TAG) levels in the animals (Figure 3G). As AMPK is activated in response to metabolic stress, the result in Figure 3G might suggest that Dh44 neurons sense metabolic stress through AMPK activation to promote lipolysis in other tissues. Do Dh44 neurons become more active during starvation? Is activation of Dh44 neurons sufficient to activate AMPK in the Dh44 neurons without starvation? Is activation of AMPK in the Dh44 neurons required for Dh44 release and lipolysis during starvation? These answers would provide more insights into the conclusion in Lines 192-193.</p>
<p>(3) It is unclear how the lipolytic gene brummer is further downregulated in the trpγ mutant during starvation while brummer is upregulated in the control group (Figure 6A). This result implies that the trpγ mutant was able to sense the starvation state but responded abnormally by inhibiting the lipolytic process rather than promoting lipolysis, which makes it more susceptible to starvation (Figure 3B).</p>
<p>(4) There is an inconsistency of total TAG levels and the lipid droplet size observed in the Dh44 mutant but not in the Dh44-R2 mutant (Figures 7A and 7F). This inconsistency raises a possibility that the signaling pathway from Dh44 release to its receptor Dh44-R2 only accounts for part of the lipid metabolic process under starvation. Adding discussion to address this inconsistency may be helpful for readers to appreciate the finding.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the function of trpγ in lipid metabolism was investigated. The authors found that lipid accumulation levels were increased in trpγ mutants and remained high during starvation; the increased TAG levels in trpγ mutants were restored by the expression of active AMPK in DH44 neurons and oral administration of the anti-diabetic drug metformin. Furthermore, oral administration of lipase, TAG, and free fatty acids effectively restored the survival of trpγ mutants under starvation conditions. These results indicate that TRPv plays an important role in the maintenance of systemic lipid levels through the proper expression of lipase. Furthermore, authors have shown that this function is mediated by DH44R2. This study provides an interesting finding in that the neuropeptide DH44 released from the brain regulates lipid metabolism through a brain-gut axis, acting on the receptor DH44R2 presumably expressed in gut cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Using Drosophila genetics, careful analysis of which cells express trpγ regulates lipid metabolism is performed in this study. The study supports its conclusions from various angles, including not only TAG levels, but also fat droplet staining and survival rate under starved conditions, and oral administration of substances involved in lipid metabolism.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Lipid metabolism in the gut of DH44R2-expressing cells should be investigated for a better understanding of the mechanism. Fat accumulation in the gut is not mechanistically linked with fat accumulation in the fat body. The function of lipase in the gut (esp. R2 region) should be addressed, e.g. by manipulating gut-lipases such as magro or Lip3 in the gut in the contest of trpγ mutant. Also, it is not clarified which cell types in the gut DH44R2 is expressed. The study also mentioned only in the text that bmm expression in the gut cannot restore lipid droplet enlargement in the fat body, but this result might be presented as a figure.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors demonstrated the significance of the TRPγ channel in regulating internal TAG levels. They found high TAG levels in TRPγ mutant, which was ascribed to a deficit in the lipolysis process due to the downregulation of brummer (bmm). It was notable that the expression of TRPγ in DH44+ PI neurons, but not dILP2+ neurons, in the brain restored the internal TAG levels and that the knockdown of TRPγ in DH44+ PI neurons resulted in an increase in TAG levels. These results suggested a non-cell autonomous effect of Dh44+PI neurons. Additionally, the expression of the TRPγ channel in Dh44 R2-expressing cells restored the internal TAG levels. The authors, however, did not provide an explanation of how TRPγ might function in both presynaptic and postsynaptic cells in the non-cell autonomous manner to regulate the TAG storage. The authors further determined the effect of TRPγ mutation on the size of lipid droplets (LD) and the lifespan and found that TRPγ mutation caused an increase in the size of LD and a decrease in the lifespan, which were reverted by feeding lipase and metformin. These were creative endeavors, I thought. The finding that DH44+ PI neurons have non-cell autonomous functions in regulating bodily metabolism (mainly sugar/lipid) in addition to directing sugar nutrient sensing and consumption is likely correct, but the paper has many loose ends. I would like to see a revision that includes more experiments to tighten up the findings and appropriate interpretations of the results.</p>
<p>(1) The authors need to provide interpretations or speculations as to how DH44+ PI neurons have non-cell autonomous functions in regulating the internal TAG stores, and how both presynaptic DH44 neurons and postsynaptic DH44 R2 neurons require TRPγ for lipid homeostasis.</p>
<p>(2) The expression of TRPγ solely in DH44 R2 neurons of TRPγ mutant flies restored the TAG phenotype, suggesting an important function mediated by TRPγ in DH44 R2 neurons. However, the authors did not document the endogenous expression of TRPγ in the DH44R2+ gut cells. This needs to be shown.</p>
<p>(3) While Dh44 mutant flies displayed normal internal TAG levels, Dh44R2 mutant flies exhibited elevated TAG levels (Figure 7A). This suggested that the lipolysis phenotype could be facilitated by a neuropeptide other than Dh44. Alternatively, a Dh44 neuropeptide-independent pathway could mediate the lipolysis. In either case, an additional result is needed to substantiate either one of the hypotheses.</p>
<p>(4) While the authors observed an increased area of fat body lipid droplets (LD) in Dh44 mutant flies (Figure 7F), they did not specify the particular region of the fat body chosen for measuring the LD area.</p>
<p>(5) The LD area only accounts for TAG levels in the fat body, whereas TAG can be found in many other body parts, including the R2 area as demonstrated in Figure 5A-D using Nile red staining. As such, measuring the total internal TAG levels would provide a more accurate representation of TAG levels than the average fat body LD area.</p>
<p>(6) In Figure 5F-I, the authors should perform the similar experiment with Dh44, Dh44R1, and Dh44R2 mutant flies.</p>
<p>(7) The representative image in Figure 6B does not correspond to the GFP quantification results shown in Figure 6C. In trpr1;bmm::GFP flies, the GFP signal appears stronger in starved conditions than in satiated conditions.</p>
<p>(8) In Figure 6H-I, fat body-specific expression of bmm reversed the increased LD area in TRPγ mutants. The authors also showed that Dh44+PI neuron-specific expression of bmm yielded a similar result. The authors need to provide an interpretation as to how bmm acts in the fat body or DH44 neurons to regulate this.</p>
<p>(9) The authors should explain why the DH44 R1 mutant did not represent similar results as the wild type.</p>
<p>(10) It would be good to have a schematic that represents the working model proposed in this manuscript.</p>
