<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is an NAD<sup>+</sup> dependent histone H3 deacetylase that is prominently found associated with chromatin, attenuates transcriptionally active promoters and regulates DNA repair, metabolic homeostasis and lifespan. Unlike other sirtuins, it has low affinity to free histone tail but demonstrates strong binding to nucleosomes. It is poorly understood how SIRT6 docking on nucleosomes stimulates its histone deacetylation activity. Here we present the structure of human SIRT6 bound to a nucleosome determined by cryogenic electron microscopy. The zinc finger domain of SIRT6 associates tightly with the acidic patch of the nucleosome through multiple arginine anchors. The Rossmann fold domain binds to the terminus of the looser DNA half of the nucleosome, detaching two turns of the DNA from the histone octamer and placing the NAD<sup>+</sup> binding pocket close to the DNA exit site. This domain shows flexibility with respect to the fixed zinc finger and moves with, but also relative to, the unwrapped DNA terminus. We apply molecular dynamics simulations of the histone tails in the nucleosome to show that in this mode of interaction, the active site of SIRT6 is perfectly poised to catalyze deacetylation of the H3 histone tail and that the partial unwrapping of the DNA allows even lysines close to the H3 core to reach the enzyme.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The state of lysine acetylation in histones, as well as in several other proteins, is determined by the balancing act of acetyltransferases and deacetylases. Sirtuin is an evolutionarily conserved family of lysine deacetylases that comprises seven members in humans and plays an important role in regulating numerous physiological and pathological processes including aging, cancer, inflammation and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Vitiello et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Watroba et al., 2017</xref>). Unlike other lysine deacetylases sirtuins carry out their enzymatic reaction by transferring the acetyl group to an essential NAD<sup>+</sup> cofactor before acetylating the target protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Imai et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Human Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is a multitasking enzyme implicated in diverse pathways. Through its histone H3 deacetylation at gene promoters, it is a transcription repressor attenuating inter-alia ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sebastian et al., 2012</xref>), glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Taylor et al., 2022</xref>) and the expression of various transcription factors, including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kawahara et al., 2009</xref>) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhong et al., 2010</xref>). Its H3K9 deacetylation of telomericchromatin maintains telomere integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Michishita et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, via its second enzymatic activity, ADP-ribosylation of PARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mao et al., 2011</xref>) and by stabilizing DNA-PK on chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">McCord et al., 2009</xref>), SIRT6 also fosters DNA double-strand break repair.</p>
<p>These activities position SIRT6 as a key regulator of longevity as indeed shown by several lines of evidence. In mice, knockout of SIRT6 leads to a shortened lifespan and a premature aging-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kanfi et al., 2012</xref>). Similar observations were made in monkeys deficient for the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of SIRT6 extends lifespan and diminishes frailty in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Roichman et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, a study with several rodent species found a positive correlation between SIRT6 ability to promote DNA double-strand break repair and longevity -in other words, more active SIRT6 leads to longer lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tian et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The development of cancer can also be regulated by SIRT6. However, whereas in some malignancies SIRT6 plays a role as a tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Marquardt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Min et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sebastian et al., 2012</xref>), in others it acts as an oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Khongkow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). The molecular mechanisms underlying SIRT6 effects on longevity or on the two contradictory roles in cancer development are not well understood, limiting the search for medically useful drugs that target the enzyme.</p>
<p>SIRT6 is a 37 KDa protein composed of two globular parts, a Rossmann fold domain that harbors the NAD<sup>+</sup> binding site and a zinc finger domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). A striking difference between SIRT6 and other members of the sirtuin family is the presence of a splayed zinc finger and the lack of a stabilizing helix bundle linking the two globular domains. This absence probably endows SIRT6 with a unique flexibility between the domains (Supplemental Figure 1).</p>
<p>These structural differences are manifested in function. Unlike other sirtuins, SIRT6 has very low activity on acetylated free H3 histones or histone peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>). This seemed to contradict findings concerning the function of SIRT6, in particular data demonstrating its activity <italic>in vivo</italic> as H3 deacetylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Michishita et al., 2008</xref>) as well as the fact that SIRT6 is nuclear and found mainly associated with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Michishita et al., 2005</xref>). The conundrum was settled when it was revealed that nucleosomes, the <italic>in vivo</italic> cognate substrate of SIRT6, dramatically enhance the enzyme activity towards acetylated H3 histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gil et al., 2013</xref>). Further biochemical analysis showed that SIRT6 binds nucleosomes with high affinity via multiple interacting sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>However, a mechanistic understanding of SIRT6 binding to nucleosomes and how this association promotes higher enzyme efficacy is currently lacking.</p>
<p>Here we present the structure of human SIRT6 bound to the nucleosome. We identify interactions between the zinc finger domain and the acidic patch of the nucleosome as well as between the Rossmann fold and the DNA terminus, positioning the NAD<sup>+</sup> binding pocket close to the nucleosome DNA exit site and partially detaching the DNA from the histone octamer. We use molecular dynamics simulations of the nucleosome to show that in this position the enzyme active site is perfectly poised to bind the H3 tail for deacetylation and that due to the unwrapping of the DNA even lysines close to the core of H3 can reach the enzyme. Furthermore, we find conformational changes, facilitated by the flexibility in SIRT6 between the zinc finger and the Rossmann fold, that could serve to fine-tune the position of the active site with respect to the H3 tail in order to trap its target acetylated residues.</p>

<title>Overall structure</title>
<p>To investigate how nucleosomes stimulate the activity of SIRT6 we prepared nucleosome with the Widom-601 positioning sequence and reconstituted its complex with full-length recombinant human SIRT6 that was overexpressed in and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>. The complex was stabilized via mild crosslinking before its deposition on cryo-EM grids.</p>
<p>We obtained a single particle cryogenic electron microscopy structure showing the nucleosome at 2.9 Å overall resolution and a protein density bound to its disc-like surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and Supplemental Fig. 2 and 3). SIRT6 could be fitted into this density with its zinc finger domain (resolved at 3.0 Å resolution), associated with the acidic patch of the nucleosome and its Rossmann fold domain (4.0-6.0 Å resolution) interacting with the DNA terminus at superhelix locations (SHL) 6 and 7 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and Supplemental Fig. 4). The active site of SIRT6 is thus positioned just above where the H3 tail enters the nucleosome disc between the two DNA gyres. pseudosymmetric orientations of the Widom-601 DNA (Supplemental Fig. 5a). We find that SIRT6 is bound predominantly at the “right” TA-poor arm of the Widom-601 sequence where DNA interactions with the histone octamer are looser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ngo et al., 2015</xref>). We detect however a small population with a second SIRT6 bound at the “left” TA-rich tight arm (Supplemental Fig. 2).</p>

<p>Conformational heterogeneity analyses in cryoDRGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhong et al., 2021</xref>) reveal two principle large movements within the structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,c</xref>). First, we find that where the SIRT6 Rossmann fold binds, DNA is pulled away and detached from the histone octamer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Particles greatly vary in the extent of this shift that therefore probably represents a continuous movement of the DNA (compare <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b1</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2b2</xref>). The Rossmann fold moves with and is attached to the DNA whereas the zinc finger domain remains fixed at the acidic patch of the nucleosome. In the full extent of the DNA movement, two turns from SHL 6 and 7 are detached from the histone octamer. This alters the path of the terminus DNA by 37° and breaks DNA interactions with histones H2A, H2B, and H3 (Supplemental Fig. 5b). Such a large change in DNA trajectory is reminiscent of the chromatin remodelling ATPases or pioneer transcription factors binding to nucleosome but was not observed in other histone modifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dodonova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Farnung et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, the DNA terminus without bound SIRT6 or free nucleosomes in our dataset did not show any deviation from the canonical conformations (Supplemental Fig. 5c). In addition, our MD simulations indicate higher flexibility of the DNA termini when SIRT6 is bound to the nucleosome (Supplemental Fig. 6). All together these findings strongly suggest that the DNA movement we observed is coupled to SIRT6 interactions. Second, in particles where the SIRT6-bound DNA remains in its canonical position, we observe shifts by up to 20 Å in the position of the Rossmann fold domain of SIRT6, partially loosening its association with the DNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). We show that this shift could be involved in fine tuning the position of the active site relative to the H3 tail.</p>

<title>Zinc finger domain binds the acidic patch</title>
<p>An important feature of the nucleosome surface is a cluster of acidic residues (E56, E61, E64, D90, E91, E92 of H2A and E102, E110 of H2B) that forms a negatively charged ‘acidic patch’ and takes the shape of a narrow groove. It serves as a docking site for many nucleosome-binding proteins. Four side chains of the SIRT6 zinc-finger domain extend into different sections of the acidic patch groove and interact with the negatively charged residues. <bold>R175</bold> packs against H2B L103 and serves as a classical “arginine anchor motif” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">McGinty and Tan, 2016</xref>), binding to the acidic triad of E61, D90 and E92 from H2A. SIRT6 presents two other arginines, <bold>R172</bold>, to contact E56 and Q24 of H2A as well as Q44 and E110 of H2B and <bold>R178</bold> to contact H2A E91 and E102 from H2B. Finally, <bold>K170</bold> interacts with E64 and N68 from H2A (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Substituting these four positively charged residues to alanines (SIRT6-4A) significantly weakened the interaction of SIRT6 with the nucleosomes as shown by electrophoretic gel-shift assay (Supplemental Fig. 7a). To test also the activity of SIRT6-4A we first acetylated the H3 tails of the nucleosomes with purified SAGA complex. The mutant protein showed strongly diminished activity in deacetylating H3K9Ac, further corroborating the role of the four basic residues R175, R172, R178 and K170, in binding to the nucleosome (Supplemental Fig. 7b).</p>
<p>All four SIRT6 positive residues are located in a loop that makes a sharp turn, due to a conserved glycine at position 173, connecting two beta strands and penetrates the acidic patch. Interestingly, this loop appears to be flexible in crystal structures of SIRT6 but rendered stable by its association with the acidic patch. Binding to different sections of the acidic patch maintains a strong hold of the zinc finger at the surface of the nucleosome and orients the Rossmann fold domain towards the DNA terminus. This strong hold is maintained throughout the movements of the Rossmann fold domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to note that the four positive residues of SIRT6 that bind the nucleosome acidic patch are conserved among vertebrates but in contrast are not present in other human sirtuins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). This probably reflects the fact that SIRT6 is the only sirtuin predominantly associated with chromatin.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Rossmann fold domain binds nucleosome DNA exit site</title>
<p>Due to its flexibility with respect to the fixed zinc finger domain, the resolution of the Rossmann fold domain is not sufficiently high to distinguish most individual side chains. However secondary structure elements, mostly helices, are clearly visible and guided the precise fitting of the crystal structure of this domain.</p>
<p>We find that three highly conserved arginines from the Rossmann fold domain (R220, R231, R248) bind the phosphate backbone at SHL 6 and 7 of the nucleosomal DNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). These interactions are mostly maintained throughout the movement of the DNA terminus with the Rossmann fold domain bound. However, by comparison to dedicated DNA binding proteins such as transcription factors or TBP, the number of observed DNA-protein interactions is low in SIRT6. A biochemical study suggests that the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of SIRT6 is necessary for establishing tight interaction of SIRT6 with the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Liu et al., 2020</xref>) via its ability to bind DNA. Our maps do show an additional isolated protein density that we could not assign with confidence to SIRT6 but associates with the DNA terminus Supplemental Fig. 8a). We propose however that the three arginines are required to correctly position the Rossmann fold, and hence the catalytic site, with respect to the H3 tail. Indeed, applying SAGA-acetylated nucleosomes as substrates, we find that a SIRT6 mutant, where the three arginines are substituted to alanines (SIRT6-3A), has severely diminished H3K9Ac deacetylase activity (Supplemental Fig. 7b). These findings confirm the importance of the three lysines R220, R231 and R248 to the enzymatic function.</p>
<p>Unlike other sirtuins, SIRT6 binds NAD<sup>+</sup> in the absence of an acetylated substrate. This is attributed to the fact that crystal structures of SIRT6 describe a rigid helix (α3) where other sirtuins contain a flexible cofactor binding loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). In our map, we do not observe helix α3 (Supplemental Figure 8b) and we speculate that in the context of the nucleosome, this helix assumes a flexible loop conformation that like in other sirtuins will bind the cofactor only after stabilization by the acetyl lysine substrate.</p>
<p>In addition, we find that the N-terminal part of the Rossmann fold domain associates with the C-terminal tail of histone H2A at residue K119 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). This observation suggests that monoubiquitination of H2A at this position, a major histone modification in mammalian cells, could interfere with the binding of SIRT6 or regulate its activity. Furthermore, we used electrophoretic mobility shift assay to follow the binding of SIRT6 to nucleosomes harboring the histone variant H2A.Z which deviates considerably from the canonical H2A in its C-terminal tail but not in other residues that contact SIRT6. Surprisingly, we find that binding of SIRT6 to nucleosomes is mildly (but statistically significant) stronger when H2A.Z is incorporated instead of H2A (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref> and Supplemental Fig. 9). This finding could be related to SIRT6’s role in repressing gene expression because H2A.Z is enriched in nucleosomes that flank the transcription start site.</p>

<title>SIRT6 is poised to deacetylate the H3 tail</title>
<p>The classical model of the nucleosome posits an elongated and disordered histone H3 N-terminal tail that freely roams and extends away from the core. However recent NMR studies and molecular dynamics predictions show that the tail actually collapses onto the nucleosome core, driven by robust interactions with DNA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ikebe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Stutzer et al., 2016</xref>). The tail adopts multiple structurally heterogeneous, but energetically similar, states. It dynamically transitions between these conformations that all interact with the last superhelix location of nucleosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Morrison et al., 2018</xref>). We used a published set of 15 predicted H3-tail conformations resulting from end-states of molecular dynamics simulations of the whole nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Morrison et al., 2018</xref>), to analyze whether the position of SIRT6 on the nucleosome serves the enzyme’s role in trapping residues of histone H3 tail. The nucleosome from each molecular dynamics simulation was superposed on our model of SIRT6 bound to a nucleosome with the DNA terminus at the canonical position. To represent the full range of movement of the Rossmann fold domain relative to the DNA we used two endpoints of this movement namely fully bound to DNA and partially dissociated from it (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">b</xref>, respectively). We then examined the position of the SIRT6 active site with respect to the predicted paths of the histone H3 tail.</p>

</fig>
<p>We find that in several H3 conformations, the tail is located in close proximity (&lt;15Å) to the SIRT6 active site. In some of these cases, H3K9 or H3K18, the main target residues of SIRT6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), are practically situated in the active site. Furthermore, when analyzing the two endpoints of the Rossmann fold domain shift with respect to the DNA, we observe that in some H3 conformations, this shift draws the active site closer to the target residues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). We conclude that the high-affinity binding of SIRT6 to the nucleosome poises the active site to trapping its main target residues. In addition, the flexibility of the Rossmann fold domain serves as a fine-tuning mechanism that allows for short-range scanning of the tail in order to locate the acetylated residues. We note also that except H3 no other histone is present at the vicinity of the SIRT6 active site. This gives rise to selectivity of SIRT6 towards the H3 tail.</p>
<p>To shed light on possible benefits offered by SIRT6-mediated DNA unwrapping we conducted molecular dynamic simulations of a nucleosome with bound SIRT6. Strikingly, new H3 tail conformations appear in the simulations that are absent from a control run with nucleosome alone. These pathways have the H3 tail protruding out of the histone core through the space between the DNA and the octamer that is formed via partial unwrapping of the DNA by SIRT6. Importantly, in these additional conformations H3 tail does not need to circle around the DNA to reach SIRT6 and therefore lysines that are closer to the core of H3 (e.g., K27) could also be accessible to the enzyme (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). To lend support to this claim we tested whether SIRT6 can deacetylate residue H3K27 that was first acetylated by SAGA (Supplemental Fig. 7c). We find that indeed SIRT6 could efficiently deacetylate H3K27Ac, although at a somewhat slower rate than H3K9Ac. We conclude that partial DNA unwrapping by SIRT6 allows H3-tail conformations that make lysines that are close to the core of H3 accessible to the enzyme.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most histone-modifying enzymes, including sirtuin family members such as SIRT1, show significant activity on isolated target peptides and form multiple interactions with the residue to be modified as well as with flanking amino acids to provide selectivity. It is therefore striking that the measured turnover rate for SIRT6 on isolated H3K9 peptides is 1000 slower than for other sirtuins. Moreover, unlike SIRT1, the activity of SIRT6 is dramatically stimulated by binding to its cognate nucleosome substrate.</p>
<p>We solved the structure of SIRT6 bound to a nucleosome and used heterogeneity analysis to uncover the main conformational changes in the complex. Examining these findings in the context of molecular dynamics studies of the nucleosome that produce putative paths of histone tails, shed light on the unique properties of SIRT6.</p>
<p>We find that multiple interactions of SIRT6 with the nucleosome position its active site at the putative path of relatively long-lived conformations of H3 so that residues K9 and K18 of the tail spend significant time very close to, or even at, the enzyme active site. In addition, SIRT6 moves with respect to the nucleosomal DNA allowing it to fine-tune the position of the active site to trap the target residue. Hence it is the binding of SIRT6 to the nucleosome and an intrinsic scanning capability that account for its much higher enzymatic efficiency on nucleosomes. Importantly, the position of SIRT6 also ensures high selectivity because the space surrounding the active site is devoid of any other tails apart from H3.</p>
<p>The recognition mode of nucleosomal H3 employed by SIRT6 is reminiscent of that used by the PRC1 complex in the specific ubiquitylation of H2A Lys119 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">McGinty et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to SIRT6, PRC1 requires a nucleosome substrate, showing no activity on an H2A-H2B dimer, and multiple interactions with the nucleosome position an active site in close proximity to its target residue. However, the flexibility and scanning capacity we observed for SIRT6 is lacking in PRC1 perhaps echoing the fact that its target residue is rather stable in the nucleosome compared to the H3 tail.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the flexibility of SIRT6 that is at the root of its scanning mechanism was suggested to be, at least in part, responsible for its nearly undetected activity on isolated peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). It is only when it is constrained to the proximity of the target residues, through binding to the nucleosome, that this capacity facilitates the function of the enzyme.</p>
<p>A second major conformational change observed in our 3D reconstructions is the detachment of the DNA terminus, with a bound Rossmann fold domain, from the octamer. Our molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the space formed between DNA and octamer allows for additional conformations of the H3 tail that protrudes towards SIRT6. These new pathways do not require circling around the DNA gyre and therefore lysines that are closer to the core of H3 (e.g., K27) can reach in this way the active site of SIRT6. We note that K56 which lies at the core of H3 within a stable helix was also reported to be a target for SIRT6. It is therefore possible that the enzyme employs additional recognition modes of its targets.</p>
<p>Because the position of the SIRT6 active site seems to be well suited for modifying the H3 tail, it stands to reason that other H3 modifying enzymes, such as the GCN5 HAT module of SAGA and ATAC, would place their active site in a position similar to the one of SIRT6 and possibly also displace the DNA from the histone octamer. Gcn5 deviates from SIRT6 in having significant affinity for the H3 tail and therefore might pose a less stringent requirement for precise positioning of the active site or for specific conformations of the H3 tail. Thus, we speculate the Gcn5 recognition mode will be similar to SIRT6 but will also include some sequence specific binding. While this manuscript was under review two studies describing the structure of SIRT6-nucleosome appeared in press (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chio et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). The conclusion of these papers regarding the position of SIRT6 on the nucleosome and the unwinding of DNA by the enzyme are similar to our findings. We however dissected in addition the movements of SIRT6 on the nucleosome and analyzed via molecular dynamics the conformations of the H3 tail with respect to the SIRT6 active site. Our results point to the importance of the flexibility between the globular domains of SIRT6 and also explain how SIRT6 can access lysines that are much closer to the histone core than H3K9.</p>

<p>Plasmid (AddGene #28271) was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21-RIL. Cells in 1L TB (with 50 μg/ml Kanamycin and 25 μg/ml Chloramphenicol) grew at 37C degrees till OD<sub>260</sub> reached 0.8 when they were rapidly cooled on ice to 18C. Over-expression was induced by the addition 0.5 mM IPTG and cells continued to grow at 18C over-night. All subsequent steps were performed at 0-4C and solutions were always supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (PMSF, Peptstatin, E-64). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8250g for 20 minutes, suspended in buffer A200 (20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 5% glycerol v/v, 2 mM beta-mercaptoethanol and 200 mM NaCl) and treated with lysosyme (1 mg/ml) for 30 minutes on ice. Salt concentration was increased to 0.5M and cells were then lysed by sonication (6*10sec). Debris were pelleted by centrifugation 45,000g*20minutes. The supernatant was incubated with 0.5 ml of Ni beads (1 ml slurry, Roche), equilibrated in buffer A500, for 1h. The solution was poured into a gravity column (CliniScience). Beads were then washed by 10 ml of buffer A500 with 5mM imidazole before elution by 2ml of buffer B300 (20 mM Hepes pH 7.2, 5% glycerol v/v, 2 mM beta-mercaptoethanol and 300mM NaCl) with 150mM imidazole. The eluted protein was diluted with two volumes of buffer D (20 mM Hepes pH 7.0, 5% glycerol v/v, 2 mM beta-mercaptoethanol), loaded on a 1ml Heparin column and eluted with 0.1M-1M salt gradient in buffer D. Fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and those containing SIRT6 were pooled and dialyzed against buffer E (20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 2% glycerol v/v, 0.5 mM TCEP and 150 mM NaCl.

<title>Cloning of SIRT6 mutants</title>
<p>SIRT6 mutants were created as follows: the region of AddGene plasmid #28271 between SacI and HindIII sites were synthetized by SynBio company with changes in DNA sequence leading to K170A, R172A, R175A, R178A, R220A, R231A and R248A mutations in amino acid sequence. A NheI restriction site was also introduced between the first four and last three mutations without changes in amino acid sequence in order to facilitate cloning. A plasmid expressing SIRT6-7A that incoporates all seven mutations was created via ligation of the synthetic DNA fragment into the original expression plasmid between the SacI and HindIII sites. Fragments of the original expression plasmid corresponding to the regions between HindIII and NheI or NheI and SacI were amplified with PCR and were cloned separately through corresponding restriction sites into the plasmid expressing SIRT6-7A to yield plasmids expressing SIRT6 with the first four mutations (SIRT6-4A) or the last three mutations (SIRT6-3A), respectively.</p>

<p>The minimization of the energy was carried out in 5 steps, each one alternated with a 20ps NVT equilibration step at 100K to ensure a very smooth optimization of the starting geometry. Each minimization run included 5,000 steps in steepest descent and 5,000 steps in conjugate gradient, with decreasing restraints on the protein and nucleic atoms from 20kcal/mol to 5kcal/mol that were kept in the associated equilibration step. The last minimization step was released of any constraints and followed by a final NVT equilibration run at 300K. The time step was then switched from 2 to 4fs as allowed by the use of the SHAKE bond length constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kräutler et al., 2001</xref>) and the Hydrogen Mass Repartioning algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hopkins et al., 2015</xref>).

The temperature was kept constant using the Langevin thermostat with a 2ps<sup>-1</sup> collision frequency, and the Berendsen barostat was used to maintain the pressure at 1 atm in the NTP runs. Electrostatic interactions were treated using the Particle Mesh Ewald approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Darden et al., 1993</xref>) with an 8Å cut-off.

<p>Smirnova et al. present a cryo-EM structure of human SIRT6 bound to a nucleosome as well as the results from molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that the combined conformational flexibilities of SIRT6 and the N-terminal tail of histone H3 limit the residues with access to the active site, partially explaining the substrate specificity of this sirtuin-class histone deacetylase. Two other groups have recently published cryo-EM structures of SIRT6:nucleosome complexes; this manuscript confirms and complements these previous findings, with the addition of some novel insights into the role of structural flexibility in substrate selection.</p>
<p>This manuscript is the third in a recent series of reports of cryo-EM structures of Sirt6:nucleosome complexes. The main conclusions of the three studies are similar, but this manuscript from Smirnova et al. includes additional molecular dynamics analysis of the histone tails. These studies suggest that part of the specificity for sites on the H3 tail is the result of only this tail having significant access to the active site. The results are partially validated by showing that H3-K27Ac is sometimes found near the active site in the simulations, and is a weak substrate for the deacetylase in vitro. All of the structures show Sirt6 contacting the acidic patch of H2A-H2B, partial displacement of the H2A C-terminal tail, and displacement of the DNA at the entry-exit site to &quot;unclamp&quot; the H3 N-terminal tail. This manuscript provides additional support for the conclusions drawn in the first two published structures, adds molecular dynamics simulations that provide further insight and includes a biochemical assay that helps to resolve an apparent conflict regarding the deacetylation of H3-K27Ac from the other two papers.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We are grateful to the reviewers for their remarks which significantly improved the paper. Following these remarks we completed the analysis and validation of our cryo-EM data and peformed several biochemical tests to support our conclusions, lending credbility to the paper. Please find our detailed answers bellow each recommendation of the reviewers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Major recommendations</bold></p>
<p>1. Errors and omissions in the presentation make the manuscript difficult to access.</p>
<p>a) The text should be edited for grammatical errors more carefully</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>We corrected the grammatical errors.</p>
</list-item></list>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b) Figures should be labeled to allow the reader to follow the logic of the presentation and identify the features being discussed. Identification through the color coding (the identity of the histones, the location of zinc fingers, the active site, and so on) would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>We labeled the Rossman fold and Zn-finger domains in Figure 1 and described the histone color codes. The active site of SIRT6 is depicted in Figure 4.</p>
</list-item></list>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The recent publications from the Farnung/Cole and Peterson/Tan/Armache labs need to be cited and the results from Smirnova et al. compared and contrasted with those publications explicitly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>We added the following paragraph to the discussion section:</p>
<p>
“While this manuscript was under review two studies describing the structure of SIRT6-NCP appeared in press (Wang et al., 2023 ; Chio et al., 2023). The conclusion of these papers regarding the position of SIRT6 on the nucleosome and the unwinding of DNA by the enzyme are similar to our findings. We however dissected in addition the movements of SIRT6 on the nucleosome and analyzed via molecular dynamics the conformations of the H3 tail with respect to the SIRT6 active site. Our results point to the importance of the flexibility between the globular domains of SIRT6 and also explain how SIRT6 can access lysines that are much closer to the histone core than H3K9.”</p>
</list-item></list>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>a) Notably, the Peterson/Tan/Armache labs suggest that H3K27 cannot be deacetylated by SIRT6 whereas the Farnung/Cole labs show deacetylation of H3K27 by SIRT6. Do the results of the Smirnova et al. structure help to resolve this situation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>We performed deacetylation tests of H3K27Ac nucleosomes and show that SIRT6 deacetylate H3K27Ac albeit at somewhat lower efficiency than H3K9Ac. Our molecular dynamics simulations explain how H3K27, which is close to the histone core, can still be reached by SIRT6 active site. We added the following text to the paper: “To lend support to this claim we tested whether SIRT6 can deacetylate residue H3K27 that was first acetylated by SAGA (Supplemental Fig. 7c). We find that indeed SIRT6 could efficiently deactylate H3K27Ac, although at a somewhat slower rate than H3K9Ac. We conclude that partial DNA unwrapping by SIRT6 allows H3-tail conformations that make lysines that are close to the core of H3 accessible to the enzyme.”</p>
</list-item></list>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b) The Farnung/Cole labs have visualized an intermediate state of deacetylation. How does this compare to the structure presented in this manuscript? Addressing these points would facilitate further research and discussion in the community.</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>We believe the resolution of the SIRT6 Rossmann fold precludes addressing these points.</p>
</list-item></list>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>c) Can the authors exclude the possibility that the additional density observed in Supplemental Figure 6 is not coming from the H3 tail, as observed in the two other structures?</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>One density is the continuation of the H2A histone tail. We strongly believe that this density corresponds to this tail. The other density indeed can originate from the H3 tail. Therefore, we didn’t model anything inside it.</p>
</list-item></list>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>d) It would be useful to comment on how much flexibility has been observed in the other structures for the SIRT6 interaction with the acidic patch, and also how other acidic-patch binding proteins compare with the results here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>We refrain from estimating the flexibility observed in the other structures as no such analysis is provided by these papers. Regarding the interaction with the acidic patch we mention that R175 packs against H2B L103 and serves as a classical “arginine anchor motif” and refer the reader to a review on the topic.</p>
</list-item></list>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>e) Does the presence or absence of NAD+ affect the comparisons among the structures?</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>NAD+ binding might affect the fine structure of the active site although NAD+ was not observed in crystal stuctures of SIRT6 in its presence. The resolution of this part precludes further addressing this issue.</p>
</list-item></list>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The lack of biochemical validation of conclusions should be acknowledged and the reasoning behind this choice discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>We added experiments to validate our conclusions with biochemical tests. We produced nucleosomes with acetylatexd histone H3 by employing purified SAGA acetyltransferase complex. We isolated SIRT6 where the four residues implicated in interactions with the acidic patch are mutated to alanines (SIRT6-4A). We show that this mutant has very weak interaction with the nucleosome and much lower H3K9Ac deacetylation activity than WT. Similarly SIRT6-3A with mutations in the residues we suggest involved in binding to nucleosomal DNA also shows weak activity and binding to the nucleosome. We added Supplement Figure 7 that depicts the results of these experiments and embedded reference to these results in the approporiate sections of the text.
Furthermore, we also show that SIRT6 is active in deacetylating H3K27Ac. This supports our molecular dynamics simulations showing that when SIRT6 binds the nucleosome, H3 tail can assume conformations where H3K27 is accessible by the enzyme’s active site. These results also appear in Supplement Figure 7.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors nicely analyze and discuss the conformational flexibility of SIRT6 binding. This is an interesting finding, but Fig. 2 does not adequately convey this flexibility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>We now considerably improved Figure 2. We added panels c and f which depict clearly the movements we observe.</p>
</list-item></list>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors need to explain why two cryo-EM datasets were collected but were not merged, and the labeling of the datasets in the Supplemental Table appear to be switched.</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The two datasets were collected with two very different pixel spacing therefore merging the two was possible only in Relion. This process, however, did not improve the resolution of the SIRT6’s Rossmann fold domain. We thank the reviewer to notice the discrepancy in the text and the Supplemental Table 1, it was corrected.</p>
</list-item></list>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Supplemental Figure 4 should be expanded to show additional representative densities with the respective fit of the model. This will allow the reader to better judge the quality of the data. At least the acidic patch interaction, the DNA-SIRT6 interactions, and the H2A should be shown in this context.</p>

<p>1. Standard elements of data analysis and validation should be included (angular distribution plots for cryo-EM reconstructions, a 3D FSC sphericity plot, a Q-score and EMRinger score for the cryo-EM data and atomic model, a model-to-map FSC curve). In general, model building is poorly described as it is unclear which maps (or to what degree different maps) were used for this process. This should be clarified in the methods section and in the Supplemental Table 1.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The provided maps also do not fully recapitulate the path of the H2A tail. The various density maps and PDB provided for this review do not support the final modeled residues of H2A between residues #118/119-123. This affects the validity of figure 3E and the discussion of the proximity of the potential substrates to the active site. The authors should clarify how they inferred that this is the H2A tail rather than the loosely bound SIRT6 Nterminal loop (whose stability could be altered by the presence or absence of NAD+) as suggested by overlaying the relevant crystal structures.</p>

<p>1. The authors should explain how the data produced an asymmetrically oriented complex with a single SIRT6 molecule bound to one face. Were complexes with two SIRT6 molecules excluded? Is supplementary figure 4A the basis for the orientation and is this sufficient for this purpose?</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Complexes with two SIRT6 molecules were present but only at around 1.5 percent of the whole dataset. These images were excluded from the refinement (shown in Supplementary Figure 2). The DNA orientation is depicted in Supplementary Figure 5A. The resolution obtained at the dyad (~2.5Å) allowed us to distinguish purine and pyrimidine bases. The Widom 601 sequence is asymmetric and the densities clearly show that there is only one orientation of the DNA observed with respect to SIRT6.</p>
</list-item></list>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors should clarify how supplemental figure 4B supports the conclusion that DNA is unwrapped. The density is not readily visible and docking of a simple DNA model in the ZN-focused map does not clearly rule out the possibility that this density comes from the H3 N-terminal tail.</p>
