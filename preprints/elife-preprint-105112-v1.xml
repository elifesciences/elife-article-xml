<title>Abstract</title><p>Spiking activity along synaptic circuits linking primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) areas is fundamental for sensorimotor integration in cortex. Circuits along the ascending somatosensory pathway through mouse hand/forelimb S1 and M1 were recently described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we characterize the peripherally evoked spiking dynamics in these two cortical areas in the same system. Brief (5 ms) optogenetic photostimulation of the hand generated short (∼25 ms) barrages of activity first in S1 (onset latency 15 ms) then M1 (10 ms later). The estimated propagation speed was 20-fold faster from hand to S1 than from S1 to M1. Response amplitudes in M1 were strongly attenuated to approximately a third of those in S1. Responses were typically triphasic, with suppression and rebound following the initial peak. Parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory interneurons were involved in each phase, accounting for three-quarters of the initial spikes generated in S1, and their selective photostimulation sufficed to evoke suppression and rebound in both S1 and M1. Partial silencing of S1 by PV activation during hand stimulation reduced the M1 sensory responses. These results provide quantitative measures of spiking dynamics of cortical activity along the hand/forelimb-related transcortical loop; demonstrate a prominent and mechanistic role for PV neurons in each phase of the response; and, support a conceptual model in which somatosensory signals reach S1 via high-speed subcortical circuits to generate characteristic barrages of cortical activity, then reach M1 via densely polysynaptic corticocortical circuits to generate a similar but delayed and attenuated profile of activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Somatosensory signals reach primary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Goldring et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Strick and Preston, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Swadlow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Naito et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ferezou et al., 2007</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hatsopoulos and Suminski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Murray and Keller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alonso et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Reddy et al., 2024</xref>). To do so, signals from mechanoreceptor afferents ascend primarily via lemniscal pathways and somatosensory thalamus to arrive in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), which sends corticocortical projections to primary motor cortex (M1). The thalamus→S1→M1 circuits are well-studied in model systems such as the rodent vibrissal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ferezou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Petersen, 2019</xref>). We recently confirmed and extended these findings for the corresponding circuits of mouse hand/forelimb S1 and M1, using slice-based optogenetic and electrophysiological methods to delineate synaptic circuit connections along the transcortical sensorimotor loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>A salient feature of the hand/forelimb circuits is the transition, on reaching S1 cortex, from a “streamlined” organization of the ascending subcortical circuits via thalamus to a “densely polysynaptic” organization of the local and interareal cortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we sought to characterize the timing, amplitude, and related properties of the cortical dynamics in the same S1 and M1 circuits, evoked by stimulating hand mechanoreceptors. We developed an optogenetic-electrophysiological approach guided by the desiderata of delivering brief stimuli to awake animals during simultaneous recordings of spiking activity in both areas, leveraging a mouse line enabling cortical as well as peripheral optogenetic manipulations. This approach enabled quantitative characterization of fundamental properties of the spiking dynamics of hand/forelimb S1 and M1 in response to brief peripheral stimulation.</p>

<title>Brief stimulation of the hand evokes barrages of spiking activity in S1 and M1</title>
<p>To study cortical responses to hand stimulation, we aimed to develop a paradigm for delivering short-duration stimuli while electrophysiologically sampling spiking activity in hand/forelimb S1 and M1 cortical areas of awake mice. The rationale for using brief stimuli was to obtain the equivalent of an impulse response function of the system. For example, with millisecond-scale stimulation, essentially all activity, including any longer-lasting responses extending in time well after the initial pulse of input, can be ascribed to the initial input alone. We adopted an optogenetic approach for delivering “phototactile” somatosensory stimuli to the mouse’s hand with millisecond precision, combining this with cortical electrophysiological recordings of evoked spiking activity (<bold>Methods</bold>). Motivations for this approach included the ease of precisely controlling stimulus timing and intensity, and compatibility with awake animals.</p>
<p>Crossing a proprioceptor-specific driver line of mice (PV-Cre) with a channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) reporter line (Ai32) yielded expression of ChR2 in peripheral mechanoreceptor afferents, particularly around the palm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<bold>Methods</bold>). We chose this line because it fortuitously also labels parvalbumin-type GABAergic neurons in the cortex, enabling cortical optogenetic manipulations as well. To sample stimulus-evoked cortical responses, we recorded from multi-channel linear arrays inserted in S1 and M1 of awake, head-fixed mice as they rested their hands on holding bars harboring an optical fiber through which light stimuli were delivered to the palm. As shown in an example recording, photostimulation of the hand with 5-ms pulses of blue light elicited barrages of cortical spiking activity in both areas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Although hand stimulation evoked activity in forelimb M1, it did not evoke movements of the forelimb (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Following experiments, brains were sectioned and inspected to stereotaxically localize the fluorescent tracks of the dye-coated linear arrays to confirm the recording locations (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). This approach thus provides a way to record and analyze S1 and M1 cortical activity evoked by brief photostimulation of the hand in awake mice.</p>

<title>Evoked cortical responses follow a triphasic peak-suppression-rebound pattern</title>
<p>To characterize the cortical responses, we recorded from hand/forelimb S1 and M1 in a cohort of animals and analyzed the evoked activity; except where otherwise indicated, results reported below are all based on this sample (13 recordings from 9 animals), and analyses focused on stimulus-responsive units (<bold>Methods</bold>). Responses to hand photostimulation in multiple (generally 25) trials were analyzed based on alignment to the onset of photostimulation, to generate average peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) for each responsive unit on each probe, as shown for one example recording (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-E</xref>), for each experiment as average PSTHs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>), and as grand average PSTHs across all recordings (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). In trials where the mouse’s hand was not resting on the light-delivery bar, no responses were observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E, G</xref>). This also served as a control for potential visual responses to the flashing light. As seen in the individual experiments as well as in the grand averages, peripheral stimulation evoked a triphasic response in both areas, with an initial short-latency large-amplitude peak followed by an interval of suppressed activity and a subsequent late lower-amplitude rebound. We proceeded to analyze the multiple components of the evoked responses to hand stimulation in greater detail.</p>

<title>Initial peak responses in M1 are delayed and attenuated relative to S1</title>
<p>Focusing first on the short-latency initial peak, we calculated basic response parameters for individual responsive units for each experiment, and as averages over responsive units (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Prior to stimulus onset, baseline firing rates were low in S1 and even lower in M1. Following stimulus onset, S1 activity rapidly peaked, followed by M1 activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Only a subset of units was stimulus responsive in both areas, on average more in S1 (36.7%) than in M1 (25.6%) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Responses differed substantially in onset latency (14.7 ms in S1, 24.3 ms in M1) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Smaller peak amplitudes were found in M1 (25.8 Hz) compared to S1 (83.0 Hz) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). The average ratio of M1 over S1 peak amplitude was 0.36 ± 0.16 (mean ± s.d.). Response durations were brief and slightly longer in S1 (27.0 ms) than in M1 (22.4 ms) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). These patterns were consistent across experiments.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>We explored which response features may be correlated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Perhaps unsurprisingly, both in S1 and M1, peak amplitude strongly correlated with onset latency (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>) and peak latency (S1: <italic>ρ</italic> = −0.69, p = 0.01; M1: <italic>ρ</italic> = −0.71, p = 0.01); the faster the onset, the larger the amplitude. Few other significant correlations were found, however. Response durations were not significantly correlated with peak amplitudes in S1, where responses were generally strongest, and only relatively weakly correlated in M1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). Thus, larger responses terminated just as quickly as smaller ones. Although response amplitudes were consistently bigger in S1 than in M1 they were not significantly correlated with each other. This may reflect variability in probe placements, the numbers and types of units recorded, and other factors contributing to animal-to-animal variability.</p>
<p>Having measured the latencies of the evoked spiking activity reaching S1 and M1, we also estimated the corresponding effective propagation speeds. To do so, we estimated the hand-to-S1 and S1-to-M1 pathway distances and divided these by the latencies (<bold>Methods</bold>). The hand-to-S1 distance was estimated as 44.3 ± 1.1 mm, and the hand-to-S1 propagation speed was accordingly 3.0 ± 0.1 m/s based on onset latencies (2.1 ± 0.1 m/s based on peak latencies). The S1-to-M1 distance, measured as the Euclidean distance between the probes, was 0.92 ± 0.12 mm (mean ± s.d.), and the estimated S1-to-M1 propagation speed was accordingly 0.14 ± 0.11 m/s based on the difference (M1 minus S1) in onset latencies (0.14 ± 0.10 m/s based on peak latencies). Thus, the propagation speed for the entire subcortical leg of the ascending pathway was approximately 20-fold faster than for the short corticocortical leg, from S1 to M1.</p>
<p>These results quantify basic properties of the initial component of the evoked cortical spiking activity in S1 and M1. In S1, responses begin ∼15 ms after stimulus onset and reach peak amplitude ∼6 ms later. In M1, responses have a similar temporal profile but with a ∼10 ms lag and approximately one-third of the S1 amplitude. Thus, M1 receives a slightly delayed and substantially attenuated short-latency somatosensory response from brief hand stimulation. In both areas, responses self-terminate, extinguishing within ∼25 ms.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Post-peak activity is suppressed in S1 and rebounds in both S1 and M1</title>
<p>Focusing next on the later phases of the evoked responses, we noted that the initial burst of evoked activity was self-terminating, and particularly in S1 often then fell below the pre-stimulus baseline level as well (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The fraction of all stimulus-responsive units that showed post-peak suppression was relatively small (22.3% in S1, 8.4% in M1), but activity of these units was greatly suppressed (to 8.2% of baseline activity level in S1, and 5.6% in M1) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, C</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In both areas, activity also tended to rebound following suppression, more prominently in S1 than in M1 and approximately simultaneously (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-F</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Rebound activity in S1 was observed in 30.9% of stimulus-responsive units, firing on average at 31.4 Hz, while rebound activity in M1 involved 8.1% of units firing at 20.2 Hz.</p>
<p>We explored correlations and scaling relationships among the components of the triphasic responses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Rebound amplitude and initial peak amplitude were strongly correlated in both S1 and M1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). In S1, the proportion of units showing suppression correlated with the amplitude of the initial peak (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>) but not with the rebound (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>). Rebound timing (latency) was not strongly correlated with any parameters, except for rebound amplitude in M1 only (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Other correlations were weaker.</p>
<p>This triphasic peak-suppression-rebound pattern implies that after the initial sensory response the cortex becomes inhibited, and then disinhibited as inhibition self-terminates, as observed in other studies of sensory cortex (see Discussion). To explore this, we tested the sensitivity of the cortex to a second photostimulus, timed to coincide with the intervals of either the suppressed or rebound activity, or later (i.e., a paired-pulse paradigm, with variable lag) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K-N</xref>). In both S1 and M1, responses to the second stimulus fell to approximately half the amplitude of the first during the suppressed interval, returning to normal during the rebound interval and after (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M, N</xref>).</p>
<p>These results show that both S1 and M1 excitability recovers by 250 ms after hand photostimulation. This implies that somatosensory input generates in S1, and to a lesser extent in M1, a sequence of excitation, inhibition, and disinhibition, with the two later stages scaling in proportion to the initial response amplitude. The self-terminating property of the initial large-amplitude response together with the ensuing suppression of activity suggests strong initial recruitment of inhibitory interneurons. Therefore, we next investigated the response properties of cortical interneurons, using cell-type-specific methods to identify them in the recordings and manipulate their activity.</p>

<title>PV neurons in S1 are strongly recruited by hand stimulation</title>
<p>In the same recordings, in nearly every experiment (12 recordings from 8 mice) we also used opto-tagging to identify a subset of inhibitory neurons within the population, focusing on recordings in S1, where the suppression effects were strongest, as described above. Conveniently, in the same PV-Cre x Ai32 mice in which peripheral mechanoreceptor afferents are labeled, cortical parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons are also labeled. Thus, application of blue-light photostimuli to S1 while recording local population spiking activity enabled detection of activated PV neurons based on short-latency sustained firing responses (<bold>Methods; </bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, B</xref>).

<p>Analysis of this data set showed that peripheral stimulation activates a population comprising a larger proportion of PV (64.4% of all activated units) than non-PV units (35.6%) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). The proportion of stimulus-responsive units among the PV units (64.0%) was also higher than among non-PV units (31.1%) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Furthermore, PV units collectively accounted for most of the evoked spikes (76.1%) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Further analysis showed an interesting mix of differences and similarities in key parameters across the three phases of the stimulus-evoked responses. The initial peak responses arrived with ∼5-ms shorter latency for PV than for non-PV units (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>), consistent with the initial positive deflection in the difference PSTH (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, bottom). The PV units also reached ∼2-fold higher peak amplitude (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). During the suppression phase, the percentage of units exhibiting significant suppression was higher for PV (30.4%) and lower for non-PV units (18.0%) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>), and consistent with the intermediate value (22.3%) observed for all units, as noted above (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). The activity of these units, both PV and non-PV, was greatly suppressed (to 7.3% of baseline activity level for PV and to 9.2% for non-PV units) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>). In the subsequent rebound phase, a higher fraction of PV (37.6%) than non-PV (27.3%) units showed rebound activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K</xref>). No differences were found in rebound amplitudes or latencies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L,M</xref>).</p>
<p>These results show that PV-type interneurons in S1 are recruited strongly and rapidly during the initial cortical response to hand stimulation. Indeed, the evoked firing of PV units even leads that of non-PV units by several milliseconds, consistent with prior observations of vibrissal S1 cortical responses to whisker deflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). Following the suppression phase of the response, in the rebound phase the PV units are again robustly engaged, with a temporal profile similar to the non-PV units. The prominent role of PV neurons in all phases of the responses raises the possibility that activation of PV neurons alone might emulate some or all aspects of the responses evoked by hand stimulation, which we next explored.</p>

<title>Selective activation of PV neurons generates suppression and rebound</title>
<p>Using the same mice and cortical photostimulation methods that were used in the opto-tagging experiments described above, we analyzed the effect of focally activating PV units in S1 cortex (12 recordings from 8 mice). As above, we used opto-tagging to parse PV versus non-PV units in S1, and examined their activity along with that of all units recorded simultaneously in M1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Following the selective activation of PV units, the fraction of S1 units exhibiting significant post-peak suppression was similar for PV (18.1%) and non-PV (19.6%) units (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). During this interval, the firing rate diminished more for PV (to 7.3% of baseline) than for non-PV (to 10.9%) units (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). In the subsequent phase, 20.0% of PV and 14.9% of non-PV units exhibited rebound activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>); no differences were found in rebound amplitudes and minor differences were found in the latencies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E, F</xref>).

<p>Similarly, in a subset of experiments (4 recordings from 3 mice), we selectively activated PV neurons in M1. This was also able to induce suppression and rebound locally (in M1), involving both PV and non-PV units (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). In both areas, focal stimulation at progressively lower stimulus intensities resulted in reduced responses, and at 25% stimulus intensity the main effect was local activation of PV units in the stimulated area, with little suppression and rebound locally and none in the other (non-stimulated) area (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
<p>These results show that the selective activation of PV neurons in both S1 and M1 cortex can generate a pattern of suppression and rebound closely resembling that observed with hand stimulation.</p>

<title>Partial silencing of S1 reduces M1 responses to hand stimulation</title>
<p>If M1 responses to hand stimulation depend on S1, then manipulations that reduce S1 activity during hand stimulation should also cause a reduction in the M1 responses. To test this, we performed focal stimulation of S1 PV neurons as above, in this case pairing it with simultaneous hand stimulation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). As before, hand stimulation alone evoked strong responses in S1 and weaker and delayed responses in M1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). We used low-intensity laser stimulation of the cortex (at 25% of the intensity used for the opto-tagging and cortical silencing experiments above) to isolate the effects of locally activating PV neurons in S1 without suppressing ongoing activity in M1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). When hand stimulation was paired with S1 silencing, the activity in S1 followed a hybrid pattern (reflecting the combined effect of activating the PV units and partially suppressing the sensory-evoked response), and the activity in M1 was reduced (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C, D</xref>). A significant reduction of M1 activity was consistently observed within and across experiments (4 recordings from 4 mice; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). When S1 was partially silenced during hand stimulation, responses in S1 fell to 69.7% of control levels overall, with reduced activity of both PV (to 74.2%) and non-PV units (to 58.8%). At the same time, M1 responses also fell, to 76.2% overall. These results thus indicate that the responsiveness of M1 to peripheral stimulation of the hand depends at least in part on propagation of sensory-evoked activity via S1.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To characterize the propagation of somatosensory activity along the previously characterized forelimb S1 and M1 cortical circuits in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>), we developed an optogenetic approach for delivering brief photostimuli to the hand while recording and in some cases manipulating population activity in the two cortical areas. The findings identify basic properties and mechanisms of population spiking dynamics in this model system for investigating neural mechanisms of sensorimotor integration in transcortical loops.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Methodological considerations</title>
<p>The optogenetic method for peripheral stimulation used here, though artificial, closely mimics basic features of natural somatosensory stimulation, as shown in numerous prior studies involving related approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">O’Connor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Millard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Prsa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Emanuel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lehnert et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schorscher-Petcu et al., 2021</xref>). Like electrical stimulation, which is also used in somatosensory experiments, a key advantage is the ability to deliver temporally precise (i.e., brief) stimuli to the hand. However, electrical stimulation non-specifically activates somatosensory afferents, including pain fibers, and while tolerated by human subjects usually requires general anesthesia for studies in non-human mammalian model species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zaforas et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Another advantage of the optogenetic approach is the ability to restrict labeling to particular somatosensory afferents of interest. A potential disadvantage of the particular approach used here, based on using a Cre line to drive expression, is that ChR2 may be expressed in the cortex as well, potentially constraining options for cortical optogenetic manipulations. However, in this case, we specifically chose the PV-Cre line because ChR2 is also expressed in cortical PV neurons, enabling cortical opto-tagging and silencing in the same experiments. A related point is that the particular Cre line used here (PV-Cre) is one that labels proprioceptor afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hippenmeyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wu et al., 2021</xref>); other lines are available for labeling diverse somatosensory subtypes of DRG neurons; e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Neubarth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Our approach relied on repeated stimulation of the hand as it rested on the bar during each ∼30 s block of trials, which was unproblematic in these experiments where the goal was to broadly stimulate a large but not necessarily identical population of mechanoreceptors distributed across the palm. However, for other experimental goals such as receptive field mapping, this configuration would need to be modified.</p>

<title>M1 responses reflect S1→M1 corticocortical activity</title>
<p>To what extent do the evoked responses reflect propagation of activity along S1→M1 corticocortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>)? In principle, other pathways to M1 could be involved. For example, somatosensory thalamus projects not only to S1 but also S2, which projects to M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Suter and Shepherd, 2015</xref>). However, thalamocortical projections to S2 arise mainly from caudal whisker-related thalamic nuclei, while the forelimb-related pathways, including those for proprioception, are concentrated in rostral nuclei projecting to S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Francis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alonso et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rubio-Teves et al., 2024</xref>). As another possibility, activity in S1 might drive M1 via thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mo and Sherman, 2019</xref>). However, in the mouse hand/forelimb system, cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways are primarily organized as recurrent loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guo et al., 2020</xref>), which may recurrently drive corticocortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Shepherd and Yamawaki, 2021</xref>). The reduction in M1 responses when S1 activity was partially silenced directly implicates S1 in driving M1 responses, and the non-PV silenced neurons in S1 likely included corticocortical neurons. Technical limitations, relating to the proximity of M1 and S1 and the spatial resolution of focal silencing, precluded even stronger silencing of S1 activity. Although residual M1 activity was most likely driven by remaining upstream activity within forelimb S1, other, albeit more circuitous, pathways may secondarily contribute. Overall, however, our findings indicate that M1 responses arise primarily from feedforward propagation of activity along S1→M1 circuits.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Response latencies reflect fast subcortical and slow corticocortical circuits</title>
<p>In S1, the evoked activity developed quickly following hand stimulation, with onset latencies of 15 ms on average, consistent with those found previously using related approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Emanuel et al., 2021</xref>). For comparison, in the rat, whisker deflection generates cortical responses with an even shorter latency of ∼10 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahissar et al., 2000</xref>), consistent with the shorter pathway distance for the whisker-barrel system. We estimated the effective propagation speed along the ascending pathway, from the periphery to S1, to be 3 m/s. Interestingly, in humans the hand-to-S1 latency is similarly short, ∼20 ms, with correspondingly much higher conduction velocities for the ascending pathways; e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Desmedt and Cheron, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>In M1, the evoked activity also developed quickly, lagging S1 by 10 ms. However, although the latencies were brief, the effective corticocortical propagation speed was slow, estimated at 0.14 m/s. This speed is comparable to the conduction velocity of thin unmyelinated cortical axons, estimated to be ∼0.2 m/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Raastad and Shepherd, 2003</xref>), and to inter-areal propagation speeds in other corticocortical circuits in mouse cortex, estimated to be approximately 0.3 m/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Both the hand-to-S1 and S1-to-M1 pathways are polysynaptic, and the estimated propagation speeds thus reflect multiple biophysical properties (axonal conduction velocities, synaptic transmission delays, and more).</p>
<p>This 20-fold difference in subcortical versus corticocortical propagation speeds is consistent with previous characterizations of the synaptic circuit organization of the same pathways as “streamlined” for the subcortical ascending pathways to S1 and “densely polysynaptic” for the corticocortical pathway from S1 to M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, sensorimotor transformations in this system appear designed for signal propagation that is fast from periphery to the cortex, then slows drastically from S1 to M1 (and other areas). The slowness of corticocortical dynamics in this system accords with the idea that speed-limited sensorimotor transformations may be a general property of neural systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zheng and Meister, 2024</xref>).</p>

<title>Response amplitudes and durations reflect intrinsic mechanisms of termination and attenuation</title>
<p>In M1, the initial peak response amplitudes were substantially attenuated relative to S1, where amplitudes were high, far above the low baseline firing rates. In both areas, responses were self-terminating, with brief durations. Response profiles resemble the “packet”-like activity patterns previously described in diverse circuits, which have been proposed as fundamental units of information processing in neural systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Luczak et al., 2015</xref>). They also closely resemble those of optogenetically evoked activity patterns observed in higher-order corticocortical pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Responses were not only self-terminating but also self-extending, in the sense that their durations (tens of milliseconds) were much longer than the peripheral stimulus that evoked them (5 ms). At the cortical level, this temporal dispersion of the responses did not accumulate going from S1 to M1, reflecting tight control and termination of excitation along the corticocortical pathway.</p>
<p>Response termination likely involves multiple mechanisms, given the importance of preventing runaway excitation. For example, cellular-level mechanisms such as spike frequency adaptation rapidly attenuate firing of mouse S1 and M1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hattox and Nelson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Suter et al., 2013</xref>).

<title>Triphasic S1 responses reflect mass activation of PV neurons</title>
<p>The expression of ChR2 in cortical PV neurons enabled identification of these neurons by opto-tagging during the hand-stimulation experiments, and thus quantification of their roles in the evoked responses in S1. Prior studies in S1 have shown that somatosensory stimulation potently activates cortical inhibitory interneurons, particularly PV-type neurons, with stronger and faster (shorter latency) recruitment compared to excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Simons, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhu and Connors, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bruno and Simons, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Swadlow, 2003</xref>). Similarly, here we found that PV neurons in S1 are massively recruited by hand stimulation, both in terms of the number (approximately equal to that of non-PV units) and the firing rate (approximately double that of non-PV units). Indeed, most (∼76%) of the evoked spikes in S1 cortex during the initial peak response were from PV neurons. PV units were moreover recruited slightly earlier (i.e., with shorter response latencies) than non-PV units. We did not study PV units in M1 in response to hand stimulation, but prior studies indicate similarly strong, short-latency recruitment of fast-spiking neurons in hand/forelimb M1 as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Murray and Keller, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>PV units remained involved in the ensuing suppression and rebound phases as well. During suppression, PV spiking fell, rather than increased; thus, the overall suppression could not be ascribed to ongoing firing of these inhibitory interneurons, but likely reflects other mechanisms, such as slow kinematics of GABAergic responses. During rebound, the contribution of PV spiking to the overall activity was again high compared to non-PV units, which in this case reflected an increase in the number of PV units rather than their firing rates. These findings are consistent with prior characterizations of peak-suppression-rebound responses in S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chapin et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhu and Connors, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Selective activation of PV units alone in either S1 or M1 evoked a sequence of suppression and rebound activity similar to that evoked by hand stimulation alone, indicating a prominent role of PV activity in shaping the triphasic cortical responses. Focal activation of PV neurons, used here for the purpose of mechanistically probing cortical somatosensory responses, is also commonly used for the purpose of transient focal silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the rebound activity studied here as part of the triphasic somatosensory response is closely related to the rebound excitation that can occur as an unwanted confounding side effect of focal activation of interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wiegert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings emphasize that this is an inherent property of the cortex, elicitable not only by peripheral sensory input but also intracortically by PV activation or electrical stimulation, and likely involving intrinsic electrophysiological mechanisms as well as local cortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Grenier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Claar et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kumaravelu and Grill, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Russo et al., 2024</xref>). Forelimb-related S1 and M1 in the mouse both form strongly recurrent CTC circuits with thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guo et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Pairing selective activation of PV units in S1 with simultaneous hand stimulation caused the evoked somatosensory responses in both S1 and M1 to be attenuated. These findings suggest a role for PV neurons in S1 in regulating the extent to which S1 activity influences M1 activity. More generally, the findings obtained by opto-tagging PV neurons in S1 indicate a prominent role for these neurons in shaping both the local S1 and downstream M1 responses to somatosensory stimulation of the hand.</p>

<title>Perspectives</title>
<p>The S1-to-M1 transcortical loop – the longest of several sensorimotor loops embedded along the neuraxis to enable somatosensory feedback control over a range of time scales – may be particularly important for mediating rapid adjustments to ongoing somatosensory information in the context of current and planned cortical motor commands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Reschechtko and Pruszynski, 2020</xref>). Our findings in the mouse provide a basis for comparisons to homologous systems, particularly the rodent vibrissal and primate hand/forelimb circuits; as alluded to above, these can exhibit notable similarities as well as differences in latencies and other dynamic properties. Our characterizations of basic response parameters in mouse hand/forelimb circuits also provide a framework for relating dynamic spiking activity to the underlying cells and their synaptic connections in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>); as a first step, we explored the use of optogenetic manipulations of PV neurons. Additionally, building on the rapidly growing knowledge about cellular connectivity and behavior-related dynamics in “top-down” corticocortical circuits; e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Petreanu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zagha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kinnischtzke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Manita et al., 2015</xref>), the stimulation and recording paradigms developed here could be adapted to investigate how inputs from higher-order motor areas such as secondary motor cortex (M2, or rostral forelimb area) interact with ascending somatosensory activity to modulate M1 output during goal-directed behaviors.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Experimental studies on mice followed protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Northwestern University and fully complied with the animal welfare guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and the Society for Neuroscience. Two mouse lines were used in this study: the PV-Cre driver line of mice (B6.129P2-<italic>Pvalb<sup>tm1(cre)Arbr</sup></italic>/J; RRID:IMSR_JAX:017320) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hippenmeyer et al., 2005</xref>), which express Cre in peripheral mechanoreceptor afferents, particularly in proprioceptors, and also express Cre in cortical interneurons, particularly in parvalbumin-type cells; and, the Ai32 reporter line of mice (B6.Cg-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm32(CAG-COP4*H134R/EYFP)Hze</sup></italic>/J; RRID:IMSR_JAX:024109) (Madisen et al., 2012), which expresses a ChR2-EYFP fusion protein in Cre-expressing cells. Homozygous mice of each line were crossed to generate PV-Cre x Ai32 offspring. Mice were bred in-house and housed in groups on a 12-hour reverse light/dark cycle, with free access to food and water. Experiments were conducted during the dark phase of the light cycle. Adult mice of both sexes were used (12 male, 7 female). Mice were not selected based on sex and were used as they became available.</p>

<title>Surgical procedures</title>
<p>Head-bar implantation was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barrett et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, mice under deep isoflurane anesthesia were placed in a stereotaxic frame. The scalp and periosteum were removed to expose the cranium, a titanium bar was cemented over lambda, and the exposed cranium was covered with dental cement. For analgesia, mice were given 0.3 mg/kg buprenorphine preoperatively, and 1.5 mg/kg meloxicam both immediately and one day postoperatively.</p>
<p>In a subset of experiments, corticospinal neurons were labeled by injecting a retrograde AAV (pAAVretro-CAG-GFP, 37825-AAVrg; Addgene, Watertown, MA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>) into the spinal cord at the same time as head-bar mounting, following previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barrett et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>For one experiment, EMG electrodes were fabricated and implanted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barrett et al., 2024</xref>). Briefly, in the same surgery as the head-bar implantation, an incision was made over the upper forelimb and a knotted pair of Teflon-coated stainless steel wire (Catalog Number 793200, A-M Systems, Sequim, WA) crimped into a bent 27G needle was led under the skin, then inserted into the biceps brachii. The distal end of the wire pair was then knotted, the needle and excess wire cut away, and the incision sutured. The wires proximal to the knot were connected to a rectangular pin connector (CLP-112-02-F-D-A, Samtec, New Albany, IN), which was affixed to the head-bar with dental cement. After this surgery, the mouse received 10 mg/kg of enrofloxacin in addition to postoperative analgesia.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Electrophysiological recordings</title>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic> electrophysiological recordings from awake mice were performed similarly to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barrett et al., 2022</xref>). Mice were habituated first to handling by the experimenter and then to head fixation for 3 days prior to recording. Then, under deep isoflurane anesthesia, a dental drill was used to open one or more craniotomies over the cortical areas to be recorded. Recordings were made using 64-channel silicon probes (model A1×64-Poly2-6mm-23s-160-A64, Z-coated; NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI) and opto-probes (model A1×64-Poly2-6mm-23s-160-OA64LP, Z-coated, core diameter of the coupled fiber 105 μm, NA 0.22, termination 200 μm above top channel; NeuroNexus), with ∼1 MΩ impedance, and 23-μm spacing in staggered configuration (total recording length 1449 μm).</p>
<p>Probes were mounted on a linear translator (MTS25-Z8, ThorLabs, Inc.) on a 3-axis manipulator (1U RACK, Scientifica, Uckfield, UK). Probes were slowly (5 μm/s) inserted under software control (Kinesis, Thorlabs, Inc.) into the cortical target areas to a nominal depth of 1500 μm. Target coordinates for forelimb M1 were 0.25 mm anterior-posterior (AP), 1.35 mm medial-lateral (ML); those for forelimb S1 were 0.0 mm AP, 2.4 mm ML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>). A subgroup of mice with both corticospinal and probe-track labeling was used to further confirm accurate targeting of these coordinates, based on prior characterizations of corticospinal neuron distributions extending from the hand/forelimb-related subregions of M1 medially to S1 laterally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ueno et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>). For each mouse, recordings were made over one or two days from S1 and M1 of one or both hemispheres. After each recording session the probes were removed and the craniotomy was re-sealed with Kwik-Sil (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Mice were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline after finishing all experiments and the brains were processed to localize the probe tracks as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barrett et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Data acquisition hardware included RHD2132 headstages (Intan Technologies, Los Angeles, CA) and an Open Ephys data acquisition board (OEPS-6501, Open Ephys, Lisbon, Portugal). Signals were sampled at 30 KHz. Software control was with the Open Ephys GUI. To record EMG signals, the loose wires of an Intan 36-pin wire adapter were soldered to FTSH-112-03-F-DV-ND pin connectors that mate with the socket connectors of the EMG implant. This allowed EMG signals to be recorded through an RHD2216 bipolar headstage (Intan Technologies, Los Angeles, CA) connected to an Intan RHD2000 USB evaluation board</p>

<title>Spike sorting</title>
<p>Open Ephys binary files were converted to raw format using Matlab (The MathWorks, Natick, MA). As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barrett et al., 2022</xref>), spikes were detected and sorted using Kilosort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>) and verified using PHY (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy">https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy</ext-link>), using standard methods to reject artifactual units (waveforms spanning more than 3 adjacent channels, or atypical waveform shapes) and identify single units (refractory period; &lt;1% of spikes within 1 ms) and multi-units (all others). Multi-units on the same channel with similar waveform shapes were merged. Single units were merged only if they were on the same channel, displayed similar shapes, and had no spikes within ±1 ms in their cross-correlogram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hall et al., 2021</xref>). Single units and multi-units were pooled as “active units”. Only probe recordings with at least 15 active units were analyzed.</p>

<title>Optogenetic photostimulation of the hand</title>
<p>The experimental apparatus was assembled on a vibration isolation table, and included a raised platform on which a 3D-printed hut was placed for the mouse to sit in, head-bar holders with screw clamps, and hand rest. For photostimulation of hand mechanoreceptors, the bar for the hand rest was fashioned out of a thick-walled plastic tube (diameter: 3.2 mm outside, 1.5 mm inside) by drilling a through-hole and inserting the exposed end of an optical fiber (910 μm core diameter, 0.22 NA, 1.5 m length, FG910UEC Patch cable, Thorlabs, Inc.). The fiber was coupled to a blue LED (455 nm wavelength, M455F3 source, LEDD1B driver; Thorlabs, Inc.). The bar was positioned so that the fiber tip faced the palm when mice placed their hand on the resting bar. With this configuration, light stimuli broadly illuminated the volar aspect of the hand. We visually monitored the hand placement during each block of trials, and blocks in which the mouse moved the hand were discarded.</p>
<p>Photostimulation parameters were controlled by Wavesurfer software (v0.945, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wavesurfer.janelia.org/">https://wavesurfer.janelia.org/</ext-link>). Light intensity at the fiber tip was calibrated with a power meter (PM100D, Thorlabs, Inc.). Stimulus duration was 5 ms and intensity was 5 mW at the fiber tip, except where noted otherwise. Photostimuli were applied to the hand contralateral to the cortical recordings. For each experiment, light pulses were delivered in blocks of 25 or 27 trials with an inter-trial period of 1 s. In addition, we also recorded responses when the mouse’s hand was resting off the bar, either as a control or in combination with cortical photostimulation (described next).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f">
<title>Optogenetic photostimulation of cortical PV neurons</title>
<p>In most cases, optogenetic activation of PV neurons in S1 or M1 was performed while mice had their hands off the light-delivery bar, using a sequence of 25 pulses of blue light delivered at the tip of the opto-probe. The probe was inserted as described above and coupled via patch cord (M63L01, Thorlabs, Inc.) to the blue laser source (473 nm wavelength, MBL-III-473-100 mW, Opto Engine LLC), with an illumination intensity of 1 mW at the fiber tip. For a subset of silencing experiments, the optogenetic activation of PV neurons was interleaved with trials of hand stimulation or both hand and focal S1 stimulation while the mouse kept their hand resting on the light delivery bar. The illumination intensity was reduced to 0.25 mW at the fiber tip. There was a total of 27 trials per condition in this case. In all cases, the stimulus duration for PV activation was 20 ms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g">
<title>Analysis of stimulus-aligned data</title>
<p>For each active unit, spiking activity was binned in 5 ms bins, aligned to stimulus onset. Peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) spanning 0.5 s before to 0.5 s after stimulation were constructed by averaging the stimulus-aligned binned firing rates over trials (generally 25). The PSTHs were z-scored, and stimulus-responsive units were identified as those for which the maximum z-scored firing rate exceeded 2.5 s.d. above the baseline mean value (250 ms preceding the stimulus onset).</p>
<p>Analyses focused on stimulus-responsive units, except where otherwise indicated. Dynamic properties of each responsive unit’s PSTH were extracted as follows. To analyze properties associated with the early main response, for each trial, we first baseline-subtracted the raw PSTHs using their baseline mean value. Peak amplitude was calculated as the maximum firing rate in the average baseline-subtracted PSTH, over a time window of 100 ms post-stimulus. The time bin of the maximum post-stimulus firing rate was taken as the peak latency. The time bin when the firing rate first exceeded 2.5 s.d. was considered as the onset latency. Response duration was computed as the time window from when the firing rate first exceeded 2.5 s.d. above baseline to when it first fell below 1 s.d above baseline.</p>
<p>To analyze properties associated with the post-peak suppression phase of the responses, we identified units with significant suppression: for each unit, we calculated the mean firing rate during this interval, between 110 to 170 ms (based on visual inspection of average PSTHs), and statistically compared this to the mean of the pre-stimulus baseline (Wilcoxon’s signed rank test). As the response tended to rebound after this period, we identified units with significant rebound: for each unit, we calculated the rebound amplitude by finding the maximum of the PSTH during the rebound window, between 190 to 400 ms, and averaging from 20 ms before to 20 ms after this value, and statistically compared this with the mean of the pre-stimulus baseline.</p>
<p>For each experiment, once the parameters and PSTHs were computed for all responsive units, values were pooled and averaged. These averages were then pooled to obtain grand averages across experiments.</p>

<sec id="s4h">
<title>Probe track localization</title>
<p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barrett et al., 2022</xref>), recording sites were confirmed by coating the probes with a fluorescent dye (DiI, Vybrant Multicolor Cell Labeling Kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) prior to recordings, harvesting and histologically processing the brains after experiments, and localizing the probe tracks in 100 μm brain sections under epifluorescence microscopy. In two cases, because probe tracks could not be recovered histologically, areal assignment was based on the targeted coordinates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i">
<title>Pathway morphometry</title>
<p>S1-to-M1 distance was calculated as the Euclidean distance between the S1 and M1 recording sites, localized based on probe tracks as described above. To estimate the hand-to-S1 distance we separately estimated the hand-to-cord and cord-to-cortex distances and summed these. The distance from the palm of the hand to the sixth cervical (C-6) spinal cord segment was estimated from morphometric measurements of cadaveric specimens (N = 5 mice). The distance from C-6 cord to S1 cortex was estimated from published MRI images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Harrison et al., 2013</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s4j">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Group data are presented as mean ± s.d. unless otherwise indicated. For group comparisons, we primarily used nonparametric tests. Except where indicated otherwise, for paired samples Wilcoxon’s signed rank was calculated with a minimum sample size of n = 6. Where the number of experiments was smaller than this, paired t-Student tests were calculated instead (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref><bold>, S3</bold>), or within-animal Wilcoxon’s signed rank tests were performed (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure applied to the resulting p-values to control for the false discovery rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). The Friedman test was used for one-way repeated measures analysis of variance, with a minimum sample size of n = 4, and Dunn-Sidak as a post hoc multiple comparison test. For correlations, Spearman’s coefficients were calculated and t-tested afterwards. In all cases significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.</p>

<p>The authors show that: 1) following brief peripheral optogenetic stimulation of forepaw proprioceptors in mice, sensory-evoked responses in primary motor cortex (M1) are delayed relative to primary somatosensory cortex (S1); 2) the responses in both cortical areas follow a triphasic pattern of activation-suppression-activation; 3) directly activating cortical parvalbumin-positive (PV) inhibitory interneurons mimicked both the suppression and rebound components of the sensory-evoked response; and 4) partially suppressing activity in S1 reduces the sensory-evoked response in M1. The conclusions are <bold>convincing</bold> and build on prior work on cortical circuits related to the mouse forelimb from this group (Yamawaki et al., 2021, eLife, doi:10.7554/eLife.66836). More rigorously determining whether the peripheral stimulation approach used evokes movements would strengthen the conclusions. It is also possible that these effects would differ for peripheral mechanoreceptor stimulation. Overall, this in vivo work assessing sensory responses in forepaw-related cortical circuits represents a <bold>valuable</bold> comparison to previously published work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Building on previous in vitro synaptic circuit work (Yamawaki et al., eLife 10, 2021), Piña Novo et al. utilize an in vivo optogenetic-electrophysiological approach to characterize sensory-evoked spiking activity in the mouse's forelimb primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) areas. Using a combination of a novel &quot;phototactile&quot; somatosensory stimuli to the mouse's hand and simultaneous high-density linear array recordings in both S1 and M1, the authors report in awake mice that evoked cortical responses follow a triphasic peak-suppression-rebound pattern response. They also find that M1 responses are delayed and attenuated relative to S1. Further analysis revealed a 20-fold difference in subcortical versus corticocortical propagation speeds. They also report that PV interneurons in S1 are strongly recruited by hand stimulation. Furthermore, they report that selective activation of PV cells can produce a suppression and rebound response similar to &quot;phototactile&quot; stimuli. Lastly, the authors demonstrate that silencing S1 through local PV cell activation reduces M1 response to hand stimulation, suggesting S1 may directly drive M1 responses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study was technically well done, with convincing results. The data presented are appropriately analyzed. The author's findings build on a growing body of both in vitro and in vivo work examining the synaptic circuits underlying the interactions between S1 and M1. The paper is well-written and illustrated. Overall, the study will be useful to those interested in forelimb S1-M1 interactions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the results are clear and convincing, one weakness is that many results are consistent with previous studies in other sensorimotor systems, and thus not all that surprising. For example, the findings that sensory stimulation results in delayed and attenuated responses in M1 relative to S1 and that PV inhibitory cells in S1 are strongly recruited by sensory stimulation are not novel (e.g., Bruno et al., J Neurosci 22, 10966-10975, 2002; Swadlow, Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci 357, 1717-1727, 2002; Gabernet et al., Neuron 48, 315-327, 2005; Cruikshank et al., Nat Neurosci 10, 462-468, 2007; Ferezou et al., Neuron 56, 907-923, 2007; Sreenivasan et al., Neuron 92, 1368-1382, 2016; Yu et al., Neuron 104, 412-427 e414, 2019). Furthermore, the observation that sensory processing in M1 depends upon activity in S1 is also not novel (e.g., Ferezou et al., Neuron 56, 907-923, 2007; Sreenivasan et al., Neuron 92, 1368-1382, 2016). The authors do a good job highlighting how their results are consistent with these previous studies.</p>
<p>Perhaps a more significant weakness, in my opinion, was the missing analyses given the rich dataset collected. For example, why lump all responsive units and not break them down based on their depth? Given superficial and deep layers respond at different latencies and have different response magnitudes and durations to sensory stimuli (e.g., L2/3 is much more sparse) (e.g., Constantinople et al., Science 340, 1591-1594, 2013; Manita et al., Neuron 86, 1304-1316, 2015; Petersen, Nat Rev Neurosci 20, 533-546, 2019; Yu et al., Neuron 104, 412-427 e414, 2019), their conclusions could be biased toward more active layers (e.g., L4 and L5). These additional analyses could reveal interesting similarities or important differences, increasing the manuscript's impact. Given the authors use high-density linear arrays, they should have this data.</p>
<p>Similarly, why not isolate and compare PV versus non-PV units in M1? They did the photostimulation experiments and presumably have the data. Recent in vitro work suggests PV neurons in the upper layers (L2/3) of M1 are strongly recruited by S1 (e.g., Okoro et al., J Neurosci 42, 8095-8112, 2022; Martinetti et al., Cerebral cortex 32, 1932-1949, 2022). Does the author's data support these in vitro observations?</p>
<p>It would have also been interesting to suppress M1 while stimulating the hand to determine if any part of the S1 triphasic response depends on M1 feedback. I appreciate the control experiment showing that optical hand stimulation did not evoke forelimb movement. However, this appears to be an N=1. How consistent was this result across animals, and how was this monitored in those animals? Can the authors say anything about digit movement? A light intensity of 5 mW was used to stimulate the hand, but it is unclear how or why the authors chose this intensity. Did S1 and M1 responses (e.g., amplitude and latency) change with lower or higher intensities? Was the triphasic response dependent on the intensity of the &quot;phototactile&quot; stimuli?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Communication between sensory and motor cortices is likely to be important for many aspects of behavior, and in this study, the authors carefully analyse neuronal spiking activity in S1 and M1 evoked by peripheral paw stimulation finding clear evidence for sensory responses in both cortical regions</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments and data analyses appear to have been carefully carried out and clearly represented.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Some studies have found evidence for excitatory projection neurons expressing PV and in particular some excitatory pyramidal cells can be labelled in PV-Cre mice. The authors might want to check if this is the case in their study, and if so, whether that might impact any conclusions.</p>
<p>(2) I think the analysis shown in Figure S1 apparently reporting the absence of movements evoked by the forepaw stimulation could be strengthened. It is unclear what is shown in the various panels. I would imagine that an average of many stimulus repetitions would be needed to indicate whether there is an evoked movement or not. This could also be state-dependent and perhaps more likely to happen early in a recording session. Videography could also be helpful.</p>
<p>(3) Some similar aspects of the evoked responses, including triphasic dynamics, have been reported in whisker S1 and M1, and the authors might want to cite Sreenivasan et al., 2016.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a solid study of stimulus-evoked neural activity dynamics in the feedforward pathway from mouse hand/forelimb mechanoreceptor afferents to S1 and M1 cortex. The conclusions are generally well supported, and match expectations from previous studies of hand/forelimb circuits by this same group (Yamawaki et al., 2021), from the well-studied whisker tactile pathway to whisker S1 and M1, and from the corresponding pathway in primates. The study uses the novel approach of optogenetic stimulation of PV afferents in the periphery, which provides an impulse-like volley of peripheral spikes, which is useful for studying feedforward circuit dynamics. These are primarily proprioceptors, so results could differ for specific mechanoreceptor populations, but this is a reasonable tool to probe basic circuit activation. Mice are awake but not engaged in a somatosensory task, which is sufficient for the study goals.</p>
<p>The main results are:</p>
<p>
(1) brief peripheral activation drives brief sensory-evoked responses at ~ 15 ms latency in S1 and ~25 ms latency in M1, which is consistent with classical fast propagation on the subcortical pathway to S1, followed by slow propagation on the polysynaptic, non-myelinated pathway from S1 to M1;</p>
<p>
(2) each peripheral impulse evokes a triphasic activation-suppression-rebound response in both S1 and M1;</p>
<p>
(3) PV interneurons carry the major component of spike modulation for each of these phases;</p>
<p>
(4) activation of PV neurons in each area (M1 or S1) drives suppression and rebound both in the local area and in the other downstream area;</p>
<p>
(5) peripheral-evoked neural activity in M1 is at least partially dependent on transmission through S1.</p>
<p>All conclusions are well-supported and reasonably interpreted. There are no major new findings that were not expected from standard models of somatosensory pathways or from prior work in the whisker system.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a well-conducted and analyzed study in which the findings are clearly presented. This will provide important baseline knowledge from which studies of more complex sensorimotor processing can build.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A few minor issues should be addressed to improve clarity of presentation and interpretation:</p>
<p>(1) It is critical for interpretation that the stimulus does not evoke a motor response, which could induce reafference-based activity that could drive, or mask, some of the triphasic response. Figure S1 shows that no motor response is evoked for one example session, but this would be stronger if results were analyzed over several mice.</p>
<p>(2) The recordings combine single and multi-units, which is fine for measures of response modulation, but not for absolute evoked firing rate, which is only interpretable for single units. For example, evoked firing rate in S1 could be higher than M1, if spike sorting were more difficult in S1, resulting in a higher fraction of multi-units relative to M1. Because of this, if reporting of absolute firing rates is an essential component of the paper, Figs 3D and 4E should be recalculated just for single units.</p>
<p>(3) In Figure 5B, the average light-evoked firing rate of PV neurons seems to come up before time 0, unlike the single-trial rasters above it. Presumably, this reflects binning for firing rate calculation. This should be corrected to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>(4) In Figure 6A bottom, please clarify what legends &quot;W. suppression&quot; and &quot;W. rebound&quot; mean.</p>
