<title>Abstract</title><p>Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) envelop vertebrate brain arteries, playing a crucial role in regulating cerebral blood flow and neurovascular coupling. The dedifferentiation of VSMCs is implicated in cerebrovascular diseases and neurodegeneration. Despite its importance, the process of VSMC differentiation on brain arteries during development remains inadequately characterized. Understanding this process could aid in reprogramming and regenerating differentiated VSMCs in cerebrovascular diseases. In this study, we investigated VSMC differentiation on the zebrafish circle of Willis (CoW), comprising major arteries that supply blood to the vertebrate brain. We observed that the arterial expression of CoW endothelial cells (ECs) occurs after their migration from the cranial venous plexus to form CoW arteries. Subsequently, acta2+ VSMCs differentiate from pdgfrb+ mural cell progenitors upon recruitment to CoW arteries. The progression of VSMC differentiation exhibits a spatiotemporal pattern, advancing from anterior to posterior CoW arteries. Analysis of blood flow suggests that earlier VSMC differentiation in anterior CoW arteries correlates with higher red blood cell velocity wall shear stress. Furthermore, pulsatile blood flow is required for differentiation of human brain pdgfrb+ mural cells into VSMCs as well as VSMC differentiation on zebrafish CoW arteries. Consistently, the flow-responsive transcription factor klf2a is activated in ECs of CoW arteries prior to VSMC differentiation, and <italic>klf2a</italic> knockdown delays VSMC differentiation on anterior CoW arteries. In summary, our findings highlight the role of blood flow activation of endothelial klf2a as a mechanism regulating the initial VSMC differentiation on vertebrate brain arteries.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are contractile mural cells wrapping around endothelial cells (ECs) of large vessels, especially arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ando et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Donadon &amp; Santoro, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Stratman et al., 2020</xref>). The expression of contractile proteins, such as alpha-smooth muscle actin (encoded by <italic>acta2</italic>), distinguishes VSMCs from pericytes, the other type of mural cells primarily associated with small vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bahrami &amp; Childs, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Donadon &amp; Santoro, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Stratman et al., 2020</xref>). VSMCs are important for arterial homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Basatemur, Jorgensen, Clarke, Bennett, &amp; Mallat, 2019</xref>). In the brain, VSMC constriction and relaxation is essential for functional hyperemia in neurovascular coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kaplan, Chow, &amp; Gu, 2020</xref>). Phenotype switching or dedifferentiation of VSMCs, marked by lower expression of contractile proteins, is prominent in pathological progression of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Basatemur et al., 2019</xref>). VSMC phenotype switching or dedifferentiation also contributes to cerebrovascular diseases and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aguilar-Pineda et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Frosen &amp; Joutel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Milewicz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Oka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Poittevin et al., 2014</xref>). As development and regeneration share many common molecular and cellular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nowotarski &amp; SÃ¡nchez Alvarado, 2016</xref>), insights on VSMC differentiation on brain arteries during development may inform strategies to reprogram and regenerate dedifferentiated VSMCs and alleviate cerebrovascular diseases.</p>
<p>VSMCs differentiate from heterogenous perivascular progenitors of mesoderm and neural crest origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ando et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Donadon &amp; Santoro, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Whitesell et al., 2019</xref>). Previous research described various mechanisms that regulate VSMC differentiation. Autonomous Notch activation is required for specification of <italic>pdgfrb</italic>+ mural cell progenitors from peri-arterial mesenchyme, and these progenitors later differentiate into <italic>acta2+</italic> VSMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ando et al., 2019</xref>). Arterial Notch signaling activated by blood flow is necessary for <italic>acta2</italic>+ VSMC emergence on zebrafish trunk dorsal aorta (X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen, Gays, Milia, &amp; Santoro, 2017</xref>). Chemokine signaling promotes VSMC association with zebrafish dorsal aorta, whereas blood flow responsive transcription factor krÃ¼ppel-like factor 2 (encoded by <italic>klf2a</italic> in zebrafish) prevents their association with the adjacent cardinal vein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Stratman et al., 2020</xref>). Endothelial BMP signaling and autonomous <italic>foxc1</italic> expression regulate VSMC differentiation in zebrafish ventral head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Watterston, Zeng, Onabadejo, &amp; Childs, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Whitesell et al., 2019</xref>). Autonomous expression of an ATP-sensitive potassium channel modulates VSMC differentiation from <italic>pdgfrb</italic>+ progenitors in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ando et al., 2022</xref>). These studies suggest that VSMC differentiation is highly organotypic.</p>
<p>The circle of Willis (CoW) consists of major arteries that supply blood to the vertebrate brain, including internal carotid arteries (ICAs) and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Campbell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">SchrÃ¶der, Moser, &amp; Huggenberger, 2020</xref>). In early development, ICAs are the first large arteries to form and supply all circulation in the developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kathuria, Gregg, Chen, &amp; Gandhi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Menshawi, Mohr, &amp; Gutierrez, 2015</xref>). In adults, posterior circulation becomes independent, and ICAs remain major feeding arteries in anterior, while connected to posterior circulation with PCAs, completing a circle of arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kathuria et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">SchrÃ¶der et al., 2020</xref>). In adults, intracranial aneurysms are frequently found close to CoW arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Frosen &amp; Joutel, 2018</xref>). CoW arteries are wrapped by VSMCs, and VSMC dedifferentiation and hyperplasia are described in carotid atherosclerosis and Moyamoya disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fox, Dorschel, Lawton, &amp; Wanebo, 2021</xref>). Spatiotemporal dynamics of VSMC differentiation on vertebrate CoW arteries during development have not been thoroughly investigated. VSMC differentiation is difficult to observe <italic>in vivo</italic> with mammalian models, as mammalian embryos develop in utero and depend on maternal circulation. Zebrafish is an important vertebrate model for vascular development, as zebrafish embryos are externally fertilized, optically clear, and thus accessible to confocal live imaging of developing blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Stratman &amp; Weinstein, 2021</xref>). Establishment of zebrafish fluorescent transgenic reporter lines with <italic>pdgfrb</italic> and <italic>acta2</italic> promoters enables <italic>in vivo</italic> visualization and assessment of mural cells and VSMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ando et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Whitesell et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, zebrafish CoW shows comparable geometry to human CoW: the caudal division of the internal carotid artery (CaDI) in zebrafish is comparable to human ICA, and the posterior communicating segment (PCS) in zebrafish is comparable to human PCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Isogai, Horiguchi, &amp; Weinstein, 2001</xref>). Taking advantage of the zebrafish model, we describe the spatiotemporal pattern of VSMC differentiation on CoW arteries, and associate this pattern with blood flow activation of <italic>klf2a</italic> in arterial ECs.</p>

<title>Artery muscularization is spatiotemporally regulated in CoW arteries</title>
<p>In zebrafish brain, arteries are formed by ECs from cranial venous plexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Fujita et al., 2011</xref>). Recent single-cell transcriptome profiling of vascular cells in prenatal human brain also supports an endothelial differentiation trajectory from proliferative venous ECs to quiescent arterial ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Crouch et al., 2022</xref>). To establish the temporal sequence of CoW arterial specification and VSMC differentiation, we started with confocal live imaging of fluorescent transgenic reporter lines Tg(<italic>flt4:yfp</italic>)<sup>hu4881</sup>, which labels primitive venous ECs, and Tg(<italic>kdrl:hras-mcherry</italic>)<sup>s896</sup>, which is expressed in all ECs but enriched in arterial ECs, at four stages starting at 32 hours post fertilization (hpf), when CoW arteries are assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hogan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Isogai et al., 2001</xref>). As arterial ECs express higher <italic>kdrl</italic>, we used the intensity of <italic>mcherry</italic> as an indicator of artery specification (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chi et al., 2008</xref>). We found that when ECs from cranial venous plexus migrated to form CoW arteries at 32 hpf, they still retained primitive venous identity, as indicated by <italic>flt4</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). When connections between cranial venous plexus and CoW arteries disappeared at 54 hpf, CoW arteries no longer expressed primitive venous <italic>flt4</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Expression of arterial enriched <italic>kdrl</italic> in CaDI and PCS at 3 days post fertilization (dpf) was significantly higher than 32 hpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). At 4 dpf, <italic>kdrl</italic> expression in CoW arteries remained comparable to 3 dpf, suggesting that arterial specification of CoW was completed by 3 dpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). Together, these data suggest CoW morphogenesis precedes arterial endothelial gene expression.</p>

<p>Previous research suggested that <italic>acta2</italic>+ VSMCs on CoW arteries differentiate from <italic>pdgfrb</italic>+ mural cell progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ando et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ando et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, to characterize spatiotemporal dynamics of VSMC differentiation on CoW arteries, we performed confocal live imaging of Tg(<italic>acta2:mcherry</italic>)<sup>ca8</sup>, TgBAC(<italic>pdgfrb:egfp</italic>)<sup>ncv22</sup>, and Tg(<italic>kdrl:cerulean</italic>)<sup>sd24</sup>, to visualize respectively VSMCs (red), <italic>pdgfrb</italic>+ progenitors (green), and developing arteries (white) at four stages starting from 32 hpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ando et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Page et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Whitesell et al., 2014</xref>). We found that <italic>pdgfrb</italic>+ progenitors emerged on CoW arteries around 54 hpf after CoW morphogenesis, and most <italic>pdgfrb</italic>+ progenitors did not express <italic>acta2</italic> at 54 hpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B, 2E-2F</xref>, and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1A-S1B</xref>). The number of <italic>pdgfrb</italic>+ progenitors on CoW arteries increased temporally from 54 hpf to 3 dpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). Notably, while many <italic>pdgfrb</italic>+ cells on CaDI differentiated into <italic>acta2</italic>+ VSMCs by 3 dpf, <italic>acta2+</italic> VSMCs were hardly observed on adjacent BCA or PCS, suggesting that VSMC differentiation started between 54 hpf and 3 dpf on CaDI but not BCA or PCS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>, and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1A-S1B</xref>). At 4 dpf, the number of <italic>pdgfrb</italic>+ cells on CoW arteries remained comparable to 3 dpf, while the number of <italic>acta2</italic>+ VSMCs on CaDI increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1A-S1B</xref>). Importantly, most <italic>pdgfrb</italic>+ cells on BCA and PCS only started to express <italic>acta2</italic> around 4 dpf, much later than CaDI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1A-S1B</xref>). These findings support that differentiation of acta2+ VSMCs from pdgfrb+ progenitors progresses spatially and temporally along the anterior to posterior direction in CoW arteries.</p>

<title>CoW arteries have spatiotemporal difference in hemodynamics</title>
<p>Our data suggest that VSMCs on CaDI of anterior CoW differentiate much earlier than BCA and PCS of posterior CoW, although all <italic>acta2</italic>+ VSMCs on CoW differentiated from <italic>pdgfrb</italic>+ progenitors after they were recruited to CoW (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref>). In addition, anterior and posterior CoW vascular morphogenesis and arterial specification occurred around the same time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We speculate that hemodynamic distribution may contribute to the spatiotemporal difference in VSMC differentiation on CoW arteries. CaDI receive proximal arterial feed through lateral dorsal aorta from cardiac outflow tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Isogai et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, CaDI differs from the BCA or PCS in terms of overall vascular geometry, which is among determinants of local vascular hemodynamic forces such as wall shear stress (WSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Katritsis et al., 2007</xref>). To explore this possibility, we performed microangiography with a high molecular weight fluorescent dextran to determine each CoW artery diameter. We found that there was no significant different among CaDI, BCA and PCS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Then, we measure red blood cell (RBC) velocity by axial line scanning microscopy to analyze Tg(<italic>kdrl:gfp;gata1:DsRed</italic>)<sup>zn1/sd2</sup> zebrafish at 54 hpf, 3 and 4 dpf. The RBC velocity across CoW arteries was differentially distributed, with CaDI having the highest RBC velocity from 54 hpf to 4 dpf (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>). This is consistent with CaDI being the inlet vessel for arterial blood flow within the entire CoW circulation. Next, we used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the effect of flow on CoW, based on the Dextran-filled CoW geometric network and RBC velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">ANSYS, 2014</xref>; Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fernandes et al., 2022</xref>).

Further, the simulated flow pattern and WSS on the CoW showed that WSS in CaDI was significantly higher than BCA and PCS at 54 hpf, 3 dpf, and 4 dpf (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3K</xref>).

In summary, the analysis of blood flow suggests that CoW arteries undergo varied hemodynamic WSS, which correlates with the spatial and temporal pattern of VSMC differentiation along CoW arteries.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we employed confocal live imaging of fluorescence transgenic zebrafish embryos to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation on the cerebral vasculature (CoW), which comprises major arteries supplying blood to the vertebrate brain. Our observations revealed that CoW morphogenesis precedes the expression of arterial endothelial genes. Specifically, mural cell progenitors marked by pdgfrb+ initiate the expression of the VSMC marker acta2 subsequent to their recruitment to CoW arteries. Notably, VSMC differentiation occurs earlier in the anterior CoW arteries compared to their posterior counterparts, owing to the elevated wall shear stress (WSS) resulting from a higher velocity of red blood cells in the incoming blood flow. To investigate the regulatory role of blood flow on the spatiotemporal dynamics of VSMC differentiation, we employed an in vitro co-culture assay along with genetic manipulation and drug treatments. Our findings indicate that blood flow indeed governs the timing and location of VSMC differentiation on CoW arteries. Moreover, we observed that the flow-responsive transcription factor klf2a is activated in a gradient manner from anterior to posterior CoW arteries, preceding the onset of VSMC differentiation. Knockdown experiments targeting klf2a revealed a delay in VSMC differentiation specifically in the anterior CoW arteries. Taken together, these findings highlight the role of endothelial klf2a activation by blood flow as a mechanism that promotes VSMC differentiation on CoW arteries within the brain (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> for a visual summary).</p>

<p>Previous research shows that in zebrafish trunk, as soon as recruited to the dorsal aorta, VSMCs express <italic>acta2</italic> and <italic>transgelin (tagln)</italic>, suggesting simultaneous recruitment and differentiation from sclerotome progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ando et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Stratman et al., 2017</xref>). On CoW arteries in zebrafish brain, however, VSMC differentiation occurs after <italic>pdgfrb</italic>+ progenitor recruitment and proceeds from anterior to posterior (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). The observed spatiotemporal dynamics of CoW VSMC differentiation again highlights organotypic development of blood vessels.</p>
<p>Our data suggests <italic>klf2a</italic> mediate blood flow regulation of VSMC differentiation on brain arteries, and thus raises the question of how <italic>klf2a</italic> transduces endothelial signals to mural cell progenitors and VSMCs. Notch signaling appears a plausible downstream effector of <italic>klf2a</italic> activation, as previous research suggests Notch responds to flow in heart valve development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fontana et al., 2020</xref>), possibly downstream of <italic>klf2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Duchemin, Vignes, &amp; Vermot, 2019</xref>). Wnt signaling is another possible downstream effector of <italic>klf2a</italic>, as previous research suggests endocardial <italic>klf2</italic> upregulates Wnt signaling in neighboring mesenchymal cells in heart valve development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Goddard et al., 2017</xref>). The roles of Notch and Wnt signaling in organotypic VSMC differentiation on brain arteries remain to be determined.</p>
<p>The expression of <italic>klf2a</italic> in CoW arterial ECs remained stable from 3 dpf to 4 dpf (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), which raises and interesting question on whether sustained <italic>klf2a</italic> expression supports further maturation of VSMCs, as <italic>acta2</italic>+ VSMCs on CaDI showed distinct morphology at 4 dpf compared with 3 dpf, when they started differentiation from <italic>pdgfrb</italic>+ mural cell progenitors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref>). Previous research found that <italic>acta2</italic>+ VSMCs on the BCA and PCS express pericyte enriched <italic>abcc9</italic> (ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 9) at 4 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ando et al., 2022</xref>), when they started differentiation from <italic>pdgfrb</italic>+ mural cell progenitors and expressing <italic>acta2</italic>; <italic>abcc9</italic> expression is gradually lost from 5 dpf to 6 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ando et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, <italic>acta2</italic>+ VSMCs on CaDI, BCA, and PCS still retain expression of <italic>pdgfrb</italic> at 6 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ando et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, it is possible that stable expression of <italic>klf2a</italic> in CoW arterial ECs supports further VSMC maturation, as indicated by expression of <italic>tagln</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Colijn, Nambara, &amp; Stratman, 2023</xref>). Another aspect of VSMC maturation is its function to confer vascular tone. A previous study found that VSMC covered vessels in zebrafish brain dilate as early as 4 dpf and constrict at 6 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bahrami &amp; Childs, 2020</xref>). Future study may focus on the association between expression of different VSMC markers and VSMC functional maturation.</p>
<p>Another question is how flow activates <italic>klf2a</italic> in brain arteries. In a hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension model, <italic>klf2</italic> is activated by G-protein coupled receptor mediated Apelin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chandra et al., 2011</xref>). In heart valve development, endocardial <italic>klf2a</italic> is upregulated by membrane bound mechanosensitive channels <italic>trpp2</italic> and <italic>trpv4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Heckel et al., 2015</xref>). The pathway through which flow activates <italic>klf2a</italic> in brain arterial ECs remains unknown. The CoW VSMC phenotype of <italic>klf2a</italic> morphants is similar to, but do not fully recapitulate the phenotypes of <italic>tnnt2a</italic> morphants or nifedipine treated embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4L</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). A proximal explanation is compensation by paralogous <italic>klf2b</italic> in zebrafish. Further characterization of CoW VSMC development in <italic>klf2a</italic> and <italic>klf2b</italic> genetic mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rasouli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Steed et al., 2016</xref>) may help determine whether <italic>klf2b</italic> compensates <italic>klf2a</italic> in CoW VSMC differentiation.</p>
<p>In addition to WSS, transmural pressure and associated mechanical stretch is another mechanical input of vascular wall that may contribute to VSMC differentiation. VSMCs autonomously sense and adapt to mechanical stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Haga, Li, &amp; Chien, 2007</xref>). Cyclic stretching activates arterial VSMC production of certain components of extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Leung, Glagov, &amp; Mathews, 1976</xref>). In turn, specific interactions between ECM and integrins enable VSMCs to sense mechanical stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Goldschmidt, McLeod, &amp; Taylor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wilson, Sudhir, &amp; Ives, 1995</xref>). Connection to ECM is essential for VSMC force generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Milewicz et al., 2017</xref>). VSMCs express stretch activated <italic>trpp2</italic>, which enables myogenic response to autoregulate resting arterial diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sharif-Naeini et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, ex vivo stretching promotes expression of contractile proteins, such as <italic>acta2</italic> and <italic>tagln</italic> in VSMCs on murine portal veins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Albinsson, Nordstrom, &amp; Hellstrand, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Turczynska, Hellstrand, Sward, &amp; Albinsson, 2013</xref>). In addition, excessive mechanical stretch promotes VSMC dedifferentiation and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Further investigation is needed to determine the potential role of increasing transmural pressure and associated mechanical stretch during development in VSMC differentiation.</p>
<p>There are a few limitations to our current study. Genetic manipulation and drug treatment that reduce heart rate would also reduce nutrients carried by blood flow, and the effects of nutrient and flow reduction could not be uncoupled in live zebrafish embryos. In addition, these methods are only capable of qualitative reduction of flow but not specific dampening of pulsations. <italic>In vitro</italic> three-dimensional (3D) vascular culture models, which combine ECs and mural cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mirabella et al., 2017</xref>; Vila <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Cuenca et al., 2021</xref>), could be further optimized to simulate complex geometry of brain arteries. Combining these models with microfluidics, which allows precise calibration of nutrient composition in culture media, flow velocity and pulse, would enable more thorough analysis of endothelial mechanotransduction and its contribution to VSMC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abello, Raghavan, Yien, &amp; Stratman, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gray &amp; Stroka, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Griffith et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>We used nifedipine to temporally reduce heart rate and blood flow. Nifedipine is a blocker of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Quevedo et al., 1998</xref>). A previous study shows that ML218, a T-type VDCC-selective inhibitor, tends to increase VSMC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ando et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to the difference in drug targets, we also noted that in the previous study, the increase in VSMC differentiation only occur on anterior metencephalic central arteries (AMCtAs) that are more than 40 Î¼m away from the BCA; these AMCtAs are much smaller than CoW arteries and have different geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ando et al., 2022</xref>). Although the most obvious effect of nifedipine in zebrafish embryos is heart rate and blood flow reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gierten et al., 2020</xref>), it is possible that nifedipine affect VSMC through VDCCs. Further investigation is needed to uncouple the roles of different VDCCs in VSMC differentiation and their association with hemodynamics.</p>
<p>We used Tg(<italic>flt4:yfp</italic>, <italic>kdrl:ras-mcherry</italic>)<sup>hu4881/s896</sup> to show CoW arterial specification from primitive venous ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hogan et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>kdrl</italic> is not the best arterial marker as its expression is only enriched but not restricted to arteries. While the use of the two fluorescence transgenic lines helped us establish the temporal sequence of CoW morphogenesis, arterial specification and VSMC differentiation, analysis of additional arterial and venous markers is needed to fully characterize arterial specification during vertebrate brain vascular development.</p>
<p>In summary, our work identifies flow induced endothelial <italic>klf2a</italic> activation as a mechanism that regulates spatiotemporal dynamics of VSMC differentiation on CoW arteries in the vertebrate brain. Our data may help advance approaches to regenerate differentiated VSMCs in cerebrovascular diseases. It would be important to further investigate mechanisms upstream and downstream of <italic>klf2a</italic> activation in brain arterial ECs and additional mechanotransduction pathways that may contribute to VSMC differentiation on brain arteries.</p>

<title>Red blood cell velocity</title>
<p>Red blood cell (RBC) velocity was measured by used axial line scanning to analyze zebrafish in the Tg<italic>(kdrl:gfp;gata1:DsRed)</italic><sup>zn1/sd2</sup> background, in which blood vessels and RBCs are labeled with green and red fluorescent protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cross et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Traver et al., 2003</xref>). As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Barak et al., 2021</xref>), this axial line scan was conducted in a Zeiss LSM980 confocal microscope. A line was drawn inside the lumen of CoW vessels and parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vessel. The average length of the line was 21.21 Î¼m. The scan speed was chosen as maximum per second for 20,000 cycles (total scan duration was 5.86 s; line scan time is 292.80 Î¼s). A kymograph was exported in TIFF format after every measurement by ZEN 3.5 and analyzed RBC recognition and segmentation by using Fiji (ImageJ). Firstly, the RBC kymography image was processed using ânoise despeckleâ and âenhance contrastâ steps. The brightness and contrast were appropriately adjusted if needed. Next, the RBCs were segmented, thresholding was adjusted, and the slope of the RBCs was calculated automatically using the âAnalyze particleâ option. Finally, the velocity of each RBC was calculated using the following equation: velocity = (1/tan(a)) * (length of the y axis of the kymograph/duration of the total scan).

First, three-dimensional (3D) geometry models of CoW arteries were reconstructed from confocal z-stack microangiography images of Dextran injected Tg(<italic>kdrl:gfp</italic>) embryos with the Filament module in Imaris (9.9.0, Bitplane, Oxford instruments). These CoW 3D geometry models were pre-processed in ANSYS SpaceClaim 2022 R1 software. For example, the computational mesh on the CoW vascular wall was created and the boundary conditions were set up for the simulation. Meshing orthogonal quality was calculated, and objects less than 0.01 were excluded. Inlets and outlets were determined in the 3D model for the flow simulation. Next, the pre-processed models were imported in ANSYS Fluent 2022 R1 software. The non-Newtonian behavior of blood flow was modeled using the Carreau model which was provided by ANSYS. Blood density was considered as 1,060 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. The computational simulation used average RBC velocity among the CoW arteries at 54 hpf (532.72 Î¼m/s), 3 dpf (602.34 Î¼m/s) and 4 dpf (552.83 Î¼m/s), respectively.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Cheng et al. explore the development of the arteries that form the circle of Willis and investigate how blood flow pulsatility influences vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation. Using live confocal imaging of the developing zebrafish, the authors show that endothelial cells in circle of Willis arteries transition from venous to arterial identity between 54 hours post-fertilization (hpf) and 3 days post-fertilization (dpf), and that this coincides with pdgfrb+ mural cell progenitor differentiation into acta2+ arterial VSMCs. They find that the anterior portions of the circle of Willis, including the internal carotid arteries (CaDI), establish acta2 expression earlier than posterior aspects, likely due to faster flow rate and increased pulsatility through the CaDI. Then, using computational fluid dynamics, an in vitro co-culture assay, and genetic and drug manipulations of blood flow, the authors provide evidence that pdgfrb+ differentiation is dependent upon pulsatile blood flow and klf2a activation. The results add to our understanding of vascular development and suggest that deficits in pulsatile flow could be potential drivers of arteriopathies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Longitudinal confocal imaging of live developing zebrafish makes the timeline of arterial development in the circle of Willis easy to understand. This is a strong approach to studying how vascular networks are altered with genetic and pharmacological manipulations.</p>
<p>
(2) Rigorous use of multiple techniques to test the hypothesis that pulsatile blood flow is required for smooth muscle cell differentiation. The microangiography experiment, in vitro co-culture assay, and genetic and drug manipulations of heart rate at various developmental timepoints yield outcomes that are consistent with the hypothesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors should provide more information on how blood flow velocity and wall shear stress are calculated from circle of Willis vascular structure. It is presumed that these values are dependent upon the 3-D morphology of the vessel network, as labeled by intravenous dextran dye, but this is not clear. Small local differences in vessel diameter and shape will influence blood flow velocity, but these morphological changes are not clearly articulated. Further, it is unclear how flow input levels to the CaDI and basilar arteries are decided across time-points. In general, descriptions of the blood flow modeling are very sparse.</p>
<p>
(2) Is it possible to measure the blood flow speed empirically with line-scanning or high-speed tracking of labeled blood cells? This would provide some validation of the modeling results.</p>
<p>
(3) Does the cardiac injection of dextran itself affect the diameter or flow of the arteries, given the invasiveness of the procedure? This could be examined in fish with a transgenic endothelial label and with vs. without dextran.</p>
<p>
(4) The data from the microangiography experiment in Figure 3 does not fully support the stated results. The authors report that the CaDI had the highest blood flow speed starting from 54 hfp, but it does not appear to be higher than the other arteries at this time point. Additionally, there is not sufficient evidence that wall shear stress coincides with smooth muscle cell differentiation in the CaDI. Wall shear stress appears to be similar between 54 hpf and 3 dpf in the CaDI, only increasing between 3 dpf and 4 dpf, while differentiation is shown to begin at 3 dpf.</p>
<p>
(5) The genetic and drug manipulations of heart rate are important experiments, but more detail is required to understand the effects of the manipulations. At least, a discussion on the limitations of these manipulations is needed. For example, how does one separate the pulsatile versus nutritive effects of blood flow/heart rate reduction? It is possible that off-target or indirect effects of Nifedipine decrease smooth muscle cell proliferation, or that altered cardiac contractility fundamentally alters many aspects of vascular development other than blood flow. Nifedipine is also likely to act upon VSMC calcium handling in the circle of Willis, which may in turn affect cell maturation.</p>
<p>
(6) It is unclear if acta2 expression is conferring vascular tone, as would be expected if the cells are behaving as mature VSMCs. Does arterial diameter decrease with an increase in acta2 expression? Are acta2 positive mural cells associated with more dynamic changes in arteriole diameter under basal or stimulated conditions?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Cheng et al. studied if and how blood flow regulates differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in the Circle of Willis (CW) in zebrafish embryos. They show that CW vessels gradually acquire arterial identity. VSMCs also undergo gradual differentiation, which correlates with blood flow velocity. Using cell culture they show that pulsatile blood flow promotes pericyte differentiation into smooth muscle cells. They further identify transcription factor klf2a as differentially regulated by blood flow, and show that klf2a inhibition results in VSMC differentiation. The authors conclude that pulsatile flow promotes VSMC differentiation through klf2a activation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall this is an important study, because VSMC differentiation in CW has not been previously studied, although analogous observations regarding the role of blood flow and klf2 involvement have been previously made in other systems and other vascular beds, for example, mouse klf2 mutants, which have deficient VSMC coverage of the dorsal aorta (Wu et al., 2008, JBC 283: 3942-50). The results convincingly show that VSMC differentiation in CW depends on the blood flow, and that klf2a flow dependent function regulates VSMC differentiation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The provided data do not support correlation between wall shear stress (WSS) and acta2+ cell number. The number of acta2+ cells in CaDI increases dramatically between 54 hpf and 3 dpf (Fig. 2F). However, the graph provided in the response to reviewers shows that WSS in CaDI is actually lower at 3 dpf compared to 54 hpf. Authors argue that Pearson correlation analysis shows that both variables increase together, but this is calculated over the stage between 54 hpf and 4 dpf. acta2+ cells appear by 3 dpf, and at this stage WSS in CaDI is not increased (or even lower), which argues agains WSS being the cause of acta2+ cell differentiation. Furthermore, data in Fig. 3I-K show that WSS actually decreases in BCA and PCS between 54 hpf and 4 dpf, while the number of acta2+ increases in BCA and PCS by 4 dpf. This also argues against the argument that WSS affects differentiation of acta2+ cells.</p>
<p>
(2) In multiple instances, results are based on a single independent experiment (Fig. 3, Fig. 4H, I, Fig. S2 and Fig. S3) with only a few embryos analyzed in many cases. This falls short of expected standards in the field, and it is unclear if these results are reproducible.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses to be addressed:</p>
<p>(1) More detail is required to understand the effects of genetic and drug manipulations on heart rate as these are important experiments. At the very least, a discussion on the limitations of these manipulations is needed.</p>
<p>- For example, how does one separate the pulsatile versus nutritive effects of blood flow/heartrate reduction?</p>
<p>- The conclusion that arterial SMC differentiation is driven by pulsatile blood flow needs to be toned down. Indeed, this conclusion is mainly supported by in vitro cell co-cultures exposed to laminar versus pulsatile flow. In vivo, reducing Tnnt2a expression affects cardiac contractility and blood flow does not selectively affect pulsatility. To make this conclusion, the authors would need an experimental means to selectively dampen the pulsatility of blood flow.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand this concern and we toned down the statements related to the pulsatile flow of our conclusion by using 'flow' instead of 'pulsatile flow' in all text except for the in vitro co-cultures part. We also added a paragraph to discuss the limited capability of qualitatively reduce blood flow in vivo, and acknowledge that the effects of nutrients and flow reduction could not be uncoupled in live zebrafish embryos. We proposed that in the future, in vitro 3D vascular culture models may be combined with microfluidics to precisely calibrate nutrient composition in culture media, flow velocity and pulse; these methods would help address these questions more thoroughly. See page 11-12 line 312-322.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Since mural cells are sensitive to transmural pressure, could the authors elaborate on the potential role of raised intravascular pressure in SMC differentiation? This would better parallel rodents and humans.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank you for this suggestion. We added a paragraph to discuss the potential role of raised intravascular pressure in VSMC differentiation in the discussion section (see page 11 line 296-311).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors use nifedipine to reduce blood flow. Nifedipine is a specific and potent inhibitor of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC) which are expressed in SMCs. Prior studies (PMID: 35588738) showed that VDCC blockers increased rather than inhibited SMC differentiation. Nifedipine is also likely to act upon VSMC calcium handling in the circle of Willis, which may in turn affect cell maturation. Could the authors comment on this seeming discrepancy?</p>
<p>It is possible that off-target or indirect effects of Nifedipine decrease smooth muscle cell proliferation, or that altered cardiac contractility fundamentally alters aspects of vascular development other than blood flow.</p>
<p>- Additionally, it would be helpful to report the quantitative heart rate reduction achieved with Nifedipine. This would clear up concerns that the heart rate reduction is too large for normal vascular development to occur, and thus decrease proliferation rate independent of changes in blood flow pulsatility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We concur with these comments, which is why our experimentation with Nifedipine is reinforced by employing an alternative, non-pharmacological strategy to inhibit blood flow: the use of morpholino against tnnt2a gene. The results with either Nifedipine or tnnt2a support the lack of VSMCs maturation. In addition, we provided the quantitative heart rate reduction achieved with Nifedipine shown in new Figure S2A-S2C, suggesting that the drug is not completely halting the heart rate but decreasing it. Nevertheless, we report that Zebrafish embryos can survive and develop a normal blood vascular system without any heartbeat. Hence, we exclude that the effect on VSMCs maturation is linked non-specifical effects caused by the loss of heartbeat. Nevertheless, we now acknowledged in our discussion the limitation of nifedipine, as it may affect VSMC through VDCCs (page 12, line 323-334).</p>
<p>We also added a paragraph in the discussion section to compare nifedipine, an L-type VDCC blocker, and ML218, a T-type VDCC selective inhibitor from the previous study (Ando et al., 2022). We noted that in this previous study, the increase in VSMC differentiation only occur on anterior metencephalic central arteries (AMCtAs) that are more than 40 mm away from the BCA; these AMCtAs are much smaller than CoW arteries and have different geometry hence possible different kinetics of VSMC maturation (Ando et al., 2022) as our manuscript discovery would suggest.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors should provide more information on how blood flow velocity and wall shear stress are calculated from the Circle of Willis vascular structure. It is presumed that these values are dependent upon the 3-D morphology of the vessel network, as labeled by intravenous dextran dye, but this is not clear. (a second reviewer similarly comments: I was unclear how flow velocity values were obtained in Fig. 3E. Are they based on computational simulation, or are they experimentally calculated following the dextran injection?) Small local differences in vessel diameter and shape will influence blood flow velocity, but these morphological changes are not clearly articulated. Further, it is unclear how flow input levels to the CaDI and basilar arteries are decided across time points. For instance, is it possible to measure the blood flow speed empirically with line-scanning or high-speed tracking of labeled blood cells or particles? This would provide validation of the modeling results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The computational fluid dynamic simulation was performed according to previous study from our lab (Barak et al., 2021). Blood flow velocity and wall shear stress are dependent upon the 3D morphology of the vessel network labeled by intravascular dextran. Details on how the computational fluid dynamic simulation was performed are added in method section page 17 line 433-449.</p>
<p>Moreover, to address this reviewer concern we have now provided new experimental measurement of blood flow using the red blood cell (RBC) velocity via axial line scanning microscopy in Tg(kdrl:gfp;gata1:DsRed)zn1/sd2 zebrafish embryos at 54 hpf, 3 dpf, and 4 dpf. By using the experimental RBC velocity, we re-simulated the computational fluid dynamic. The new findings align with our conclusion and are further elaborated upon in response to this reviewer comment listed as point 6. Details on how RBC velocity calculated is added in method section page 16 line 414-431.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Does the cardiac injection of dextran itself affect the diameter of the arteries, given the invasiveness of the procedure? This could be examined in fish with a transgenic endothelial label with and without dextran.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here, we performed an experiment on wildtype zebrafish at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) with and without Dextran injection, examining the effects of Dextran injection on vessel diameters. As shown in the representative image below, the XZ panel clearly illustrates a Dextran-filled PCS vessel with no alteration in vessel size. Dextran microangiography, a technique employed to obtain vessel geometry with fluorescent microsphere, has been well established in zebrafish (Kamei et al., 2010). Our findings, demonstrating that Dextran does not affect vessel size, are consistent with previous studies utilizing Dextran microangiography.</p>

<p>(6) The data from the microangiography experiment in Figure 3 does not fully support the stated results.

The authors need to address this and/or soften conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>First, In response to this specific reviewer concern, we measured red blood cell (RBC) velocity by used axial line scanning microscopy to analyze Tg(kdrl:gfp;gata1:DsRed)zn1/sd2 zebrafish embryos (the detailed method was added in Method section in the manuscript). We replaced the computational simulated blood flow velocity by RBC velocity in new Figure 3E-3G, and re-run the computational simulated wall shear stress (WSS) using the RBC velocity in new Figure 3I-3K. We compared RBC velocity and WSS among different vessels at each time point. We confirmed that CaDI has the highest RBC velocity starting from 54 hpf to 4 dpf (new Figure 3A-3C, and 3E-3G) and found an overall increase in average WSS from 54 hpf to 4 dpf (new Figure 3A-3C, and 3H). Further, WSS in CaDI was significantly higher than BCA and PCS at 54 hpf, 3 dpf, and 4 dpf (new Figure 3A-3C, 3I-3K). Altogether, the CFD simulation suggests that CoW arteries experience different hemodynamic WSS that is associated with spatiotemporal pattern of VSMC differentiation on CoW arteries.â.  (Page 6, line 153-162)</p>
<p>Second, to identify the correlation of WSS and VSMC differentiation in CaDI, we performed Pearson correlation analysis. In the image provided here, we plotted a linear regression with normalized # of acta2+ cells in CaDI and WSS with developmental stages (54 hpf, 3 and 4 dpf), and performed Pearson correlation coefficient analysis by using GraphPad Prism 10.0.3. The correlation coefficient r = 0.595, suggesting that the two variables (acta2+ cells and WSS) tend to increase together with developmental stages (54 hpf, 3 and 4 dpf).</p>

<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-94094-sa3-fig2.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Third, we softened our conclusion as the RBC velocity across CoW arteries was differentially distributed while VSMC differentiation occurred in these vessels.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) It is unclear if acta2 expression is conferring vascular tone, as would be expected if the cells are behaving as mature VSMCs. Does arterial diameter decrease with an increase in acta2 expression? Are acta2-positive mural cells associated with more dynamic changes in arteriole diameter under basal or stimulated conditions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for this interesting question. VSMC maturation and its vasoactivity could be further investigated in the future. Our study focused on early stage of VSMC differentiation, in which pdgfrb+ progenitors started to express VSMC marker acta2. We discussed the onset of transgelin expression and loss of abcc9 expression as markers of VSMC maturation. In addition, a previous study found that VSMC covered vessels in zebrafish brain dilate as early as 4 dpf and constrict at 6 dpf (Bahrami &amp; Childs, 2020). Future study may focus on the association between expression of different VSMC markers and VSMC functional maturation. (page 10, line 272-279)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The authors argue that CoW vessels transition from venous to arterial identity (Fig. 1). However, kdrl is not an ideal arterial marker for this experiment as it is expressed in both arteries and veins. While it is true that many arterial beds have stronger kdrl expression than the veins, its expression in both arteries and veins changes with developmental stage, and its expression level may vary depending on the type of vessel. Therefore, showing that kdrl increases from 32 hpf - 4 dpf in CoW vessels is not convincing because its expression may increase in both venous or arterial vasculature as the vessels mature. In addition, flt4 expression is not exclusively venous; for example, it has noticeable expression in the dorsal aorta at 24-32 hpf stages. It would be helpful to confirm this transition by analyzing additional arterial and venous markers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge this and we added a paragraph to discuss the limitation. We combined loss of flt4 and increase in kdrl to establish the temporal sequence of circle of Willis morphogenesis, arterial specification, and VSMC differentiation. We acknowledge that additional arterial and venous markers need to be analyzed for a more thorough characterization of arterial specification in vertebrate brain vascular development. See page 12 line 335-341.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) The authors show that acta2+ VSMCs are absent in tnnt2a MO embryos, concluding that blood flow is required for their differentiation from pericytes. However, there is no data showing that pericytes are still present in tnnt2a MO embryos. Although this has been previously shown by Ando et al 2016, it would be beneficial to confirm in the current study as this is a critical piece of evidence needed for this conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To determine if blood flow is dispensable for pdgfrb+ progenitor recruitment, we performed tnnt2a MO (0.35 ng/embryo) injection in Tg(pdgrb:egfp, kdrl:ras-mcherry) ncv22/s896. Loss of blood flow did not affect pdgfrb+ progenitor emergence around the CoW (new Figure S2G-S2H) at 3 days post fertilization (dpf). This is consistent with previous observation in Ando et al 2016 Figure S2C (Ando et al., 2016).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) The authors show that klf2a MO injected embryos have a reduced number of VSMCs at 3 dpf but a normal number at 4 dpf (Fig. 6), concluding that klf2a is only important to initiate CaDI muscularization. If this is true, it would raise important questions about how VSMCs differentiate at a later stage in the absence of klf2a. For instance, is blood flow not required to differentiate at a later stage, or is there another factor that compensates in the absence of klf2a? The alternative explanation/ caveat is that klf2a MO loses efficacy with development, leading to the recovery of VSMCs at this stage. Therefore, it would be important to confirm this result using a genetic klf2a mutant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out.  We note that based on the klf2a reporter line, klf2a activity in CoW arterial endothelial cells is highly correlated with the number of acta2+ VSMCs in CaDI, BCA and PCS at 3 dpf (r = 0.974, new Figure S5J). Interestingly however, klf2a activity remained stable from 3 dpf to 4 dpf, well beyond initiation of VSMC differentiation. Thus, we speculate sustained klf2a expression may support further maturation of VSMCs, as acta2+ VSMCs showed distinct morphology at 4 dpf compared with 3 dpf. (Page 10, line 268-272). As for the observation that klf2a morphants have normal number of VSMCs at 4 dpf, we think that in addition to the temporary effect of morpholino, a proximal explanation is compensation by paralogous klf2b in zebrafish. We acknowledge that further characterization of CoW VSMC development in klf2a and klf2b double genetic mutants (Rasouli et al., 2018; Steed et al., 2016) may help determine whether klf2b compensates klf2a in CoW VSMC differentiation beyond 4 dpf. See page 10-11 line 292-295.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) A large part of the discussion focuses on Notch and Wnt signaling, as downstream Klf2 effectors. While these are reasonable hypotheses to propose, there is no data on the involvement of these pathways in the current study. It seems excessive to speculate on detailed mechanisms of how Klf2 activates Notch and Wnt signaling in the absence of data showing that these pathways are affected in CoW vessels. Therefore, the discussion could be shortened here unless additional data can be obtained to demonstrate the involvement of these pathways in VSMCs in CoW.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We concur and have condensed the discussion on Notch and Wnt signaling as downstream klf2 effectors.</p>

<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>(1) Line 138 &quot;CaDI is the only vessels in the CoW receiving pulsatile arterial blood low ... &quot;. Adding a reference to support this statement would be useful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and revised this sentence into âCaDI receive proximal arterial feed through lateral dorsal aorta from cardiac outflow tract (Isogai et al., 2001)â. It was also based on our general observation of zebrafish vascular anatomy and blood flow under a confocal microscope.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The image insets in Figs. 1A, 2A, 4E-L, 5A, 6A are quite small. Please make them larger to help the reader interpret the findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. We maximized the image size to help the reader interpret the finding, and to visualize confocal images and schematics side-by-side.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The schematics in Figs. 1-2, and 4-6 are helpful, but the different cell types are difficult to see because they are small and their colors/shapes are not very distinct.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. We increased the size and color contrast to provide better visualization of the schematics in new schematic Figures. 1-2 and 4-6.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It is stated that there are no diameter differences between different arteries, but statistics are not reported.</p>

<p>The statistics in Figure 3D were performed by ordinary two-way ANOVA followed by Tukeyâs multiple comparisons test, with a single pooled variance. Here we added pairwise comparisons among vessels in the CoW. Hence when non indicated the difference are non-significant.</p>

<p>(5) Figure 3F would be better visualized on a log scale, as it is difficult to see the differences between each post-fertilization timepoint.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. In the new Figure 3H, the average wall shear stress (WSS) in CoW arteries is presented on log scale in y axis to see the differences between each post-fertilization timepoint.</p>

We added a describe in the method section to provide background and validation on this pericyte line (see page 13 line 368-372).</p>

<p>(7) Flow velocity and WSS changes are shown in each vessel in Figs. 3E,G. However, the comparison should be made between different types of vessels to see if there is a statistical difference and PCS, for example, which would explain differences in VSMC coverage.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agreed. We compared the difference among arteries in the CoW at each developmental timepoint and performed ordinary one-way ANOVA with Tukeyâs multiple comparisons test. Figure. 3E is replaced by new Figure. 3E-G and Figure. 3G is replaced by new Figure. 3I-K.</p>

<p>(8) Similarly, between CaDI, the number of klf2a cells in Fig. 5B should be compared between different vessels, not between different stages of the same vessel.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. In new Figure 5B-E, the number of klf2a+ cells per 100 Î¼m vessel length are compared among different vessels at each developmental stage and analyzed by ordinary one-way ANOVA with Tukeyâs multiple comparisons test.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) When quantifying klf2+ cells in Fig. 5, it would be helpful to quantify klf2 expression level between cells in different vessels. This could be done by quantifying GFP expression in existing images. The difference in expression level may explain the variation between CaDI and PCS more accurately than just the difference in cell number.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The GFP expression reflect the stability of GFP protein expression and labels discrete nuclei with active klf2a expression. Hence the quantification of GFP level might not give an accurate readout of klf2a expression per se but rather of its activity. For this reason we donât think that this experiment will add accurate measurement of klf2a expression.</p>

<p>(10) Do data points in Figure 4D correspond to different cells in the same chamber experiment? If so, they cannot be treated as independent replicates. Each data point should correspond to an independent replicate experiment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. Now in the figure legend, we report the number of cells analyzed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) Graph placement is confusing in Figs. 4I, M. An adjacent Fig. 4G shows Nifedipine treated embryos, while the graph next to (Fig. 4I) shows acta+ cell number from tnnt2a 4 dpf experiment. Similarly, the bottom Fig. 4K tnn2a 4 dpf MO experiment has an adjacent graph Fig. 4M, which shows nifedipine treatment quantification, which makes it very confusing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agreed. We rearranged Figure 4E (representative images of control embryos at 3 dpf and 4 dpf), Figure 4F (tnnt2a MO embryos at 3 dpf and 4 dpf), Figure 4G (nifedipine treated embryos at 3 dpf and 4 dpf).</p>
