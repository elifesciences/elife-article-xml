<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Global amphibian declines are largely driven by deadly disease outbreaks caused by the chytrid fungus, <italic>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</italic> (<italic>Bd</italic>). In the time since these disease outbreaks were first discovered, much has been learned about the roles of amphibian skin-produced antimicrobial components and skin microbiomes in controlling <italic>Bd</italic>. Yet almost nothing is known about the roles of skin-resident immune cells in anti-<italic>Bd</italic> defenses. Notably, mammalian mast cells reside within and serve as key immune sentinels in barrier tissues like the skin. Thus, they are critical to immune recognition of pathogens and to orchestrating the ensuing immune responses. Accordingly, we investigated the roles of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> frog mast cells during <italic>Bd</italic> infections. Our findings indicate that enrichment of <italic>X. laevis</italic> skin mast cells confers significant anti-<italic>Bd</italic> protection and ameliorates the inflammation-associated skin damage caused by <italic>Bd</italic> infection. Moreover, enriching <italic>X. laevis</italic> mast cells promotes greater mucin content within cutaneous mucus glands and protects frogs from <italic>Bd</italic>-mediated changes to their skin microbiomes. Together, this work underlines the importance of amphibian skin-resident immune cells in anti-<italic>Bd</italic> defenses and introduces a novel approach for investigating amphibian host-chytrid pathogen interactions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Catastrophic declines of hundreds of amphibian species across six continents have been causally linked to the chytrid fungi, <italic>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</italic> (<italic>Bd</italic>) and <italic>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</italic> (<italic>Bsal</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Motile <italic>Bd</italic> zoospores readily colonize keratinized skin of adult amphibians and keratinized mouthparts of tadpoles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. <italic>Bd</italic> skin infections culminate in chytridiomycosis, ultimately disrupting the function of this respiratory and barrier tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Effectively combatting chytrid infections requires a holistic understanding of amphibian cutaneous immune defenses. Research efforts up to this point have focused on antifungal capacities of amphibian skin-produced antimicrobial peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>; commensal antifungal products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>; antifungal properties of mucus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, alkaloids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, and lysozymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> as well as the roles of antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Many of these studies suggest that <italic>Bd</italic> exposure can elicit some immune protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, the contribution of skin-resident immune cells to amphibian anti-<italic>Bd</italic> defenses remains almost entirely unexplored.</p>
<p>Mammalian mast cells serve as sentinels of mucosal and connective tissues, concentrated in barrier tissues like skin, where they maintain homeostasis and regulate immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Other granulocyte-lineage cells such as neutrophils are generally not found in healthy tissues and only extravasate into sites of inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Consequently, mast cells are among the first immune cells to recognize and respond to skin-infiltrating pathogens. When activated, mast cells release pre-formed and <italic>de novo</italic>-generated immunomodulatory compounds that may serve to elicit, exacerbate, or ameliorate inflammatory responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Cells bearing hallmark mast cell cytology have been reported across a range of non-mammalian species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, including amphibians<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Notably, the principal mast cell growth factor, stem cell factor (SCF, KIT ligand) required for mast cell differentiation and survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> is expressed by all vertebrates examined to-date.</p>
<p>Here, we combine comprehensive <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches to define the roles of amphibian (<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>) mast cells during <italic>Bd</italic> infections. Our results provide compelling evidence that skin-resident immune cells contribute to anti-<italic>Bd</italic> defenses.</p>

<title>Frog mast cells possess archetypal mast cell cytology and transcriptional profiles</title>
<p>We produced <italic>X. laevis</italic> recombinant (r)SCF, and used this reagent to generate mast cell cultures from bone marrow-derived myeloid precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Mast cells were compared to bone marrow-derived neutrophilic granulocytes (hereafter referred to as âneutrophilsâ), differentiated using a recombinant <italic>X. laevis</italic> colony-stimulating factor-3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> (rCSF3, <italic>i.e</italic>., granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; GCSF). While the neutrophil cultures were comprised of cells with hyper-segmented nuclei and neutral-staining cytoplasms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), the mast cell cultures consisted predominantly of mononuclear cells with basophilic cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We confirmed the granulocyte-lineage of <italic>X. laevis</italic> mast cells using specific esterase (SE) staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). As expected, <italic>X. laevis</italic> neutrophils were also SE-positive (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Mast cell and neutrophil morphology was further explored with electron microscopy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-H</xref>). SEM imaging demonstrated that <italic>X. laevis</italic> mast cells possess extensive folding of their plasma membranes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). This mast cell-characteristic membrane ruffling appeared as projections resembling pseudopods via TEM, which further revealed electron-dense heterogenous granules, few mitochondria, and round to elongated nuclei (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>) typical of mammalian mast cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. <italic>X. laevis</italic> neutrophils also exhibited pronounced membrane ruffling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) but strikingly distinct intracellular appearance including multilobed nuclei (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p>

<p>Frog mast cells and neutrophils also exhibited distinct transcriptional profiles of immune- related genes including those encoding lineage-specific transcription factors, immune receptors, downstream signaling components and adhesion molecules, as well as non-immune genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). Frog mast cells and neutrophils each expressed greater levels of lineage-specific transcription factors associated with mammalian mast cell (gata1, gata2, and mitf)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and neutrophil (cebp family members)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> counterparts, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Notably, mast cells expressed greater levels of enzyme and cytokine genes associated with tissue remodeling (carboxypeptidase; cpa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>), immune suppression (indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase-1; ido1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>) and amelioration of cutaneous inflammation (leukemia inhibitory factor, lif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).

<title>Enriching mast cells in frog skin offers protection against <italic>Bd</italic></title>
<p>Although all granulocyte-lineage cells possess SE activity, mast cells are the predominant mononuclear granulocytes to reside in vertebrate tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, we selectively enriched mast cells in <italic>X. laevis</italic> skin via subcutaneous rSCF administration (note SE-stained cells indicated by arrows in r-ctrl-injected skins, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, versus r-SCF-injected skins, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). We confirmed SE- positive cells in rSCF-treated skins also possessed round-oval nuclei (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Maximum mast cell enrichment was observed 12 hours post injection (hpi) of rSCF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). When we challenged <italic>X. laevis</italic> with <italic>Bd</italic>, we did not detect differences in skin fungal loads between control (r-ctrl- injected) and mast cell-enriched groups at 7 days post infection (dpi; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). However, fungal loads were almost two-fold lower in mast cell- compared to control-enriched animals at 21 dpi, allowing for approximately four cycles of zoospore to mature zoosporangia development (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>

<title>Mast cells protect frogs from <italic>Bd</italic>-elicited inflammation-associated pathology</title>
<p>To explore potential mechanisms of mast cell-mediated protection against <italic>Bd,</italic> we compared the gene expression profiles of r-ctrl- and rSCF-administered <italic>Bd</italic>-infected frog skins at 21 dpi. Among the top differentially expressed genes, we noted mast cell-enriched, <italic>Bd</italic>-infected skins possessed greater transcripts for genes associated with cutaneous strength and integrity (lamc2), epidermal cell maturation, lymphocyte recruitment (b3gnt3.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, as well as ion and nutrient flow (gjb3l). (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Moreover, mast cell-enriched <italic>Bd</italic>-challenged skin exhibited greater expression of genes associated with protection of the mucosa and epithelial healing (ttf3.6s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, pathogen nutrient deprivation in mucus (slc1a5s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, and mucus production (duoxa1.s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

<title>Cutaneous neutrophil enrichment results in increased <italic>Bd</italic> fungal loads</title>
<p>Neutrophils are one of the first leukocytes to infiltrate infected tissues, typically amplifying inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. All vertebrate neutrophils depend on CSF3 for their differentiation and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, and our previous work has demonstrated the gene encoding the CSF3 receptor (csf3r) is a marker of <italic>X. laevis</italic> neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Because csf3r expression was markedly elevated in control over mast cell-enriched skins of infected frogs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), we next assessed the outcomes of enriching skin for neutrophils via subcutaneous rCSF3 administration. We confirmed neutrophil enrichment peaked 12 hp rCSF3 injection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>) and resulted in a thickened epidermis in comparison with r-ctrl injected skins of otherwise healthy animals (<italic>i.e.</italic>, no <italic>Bd</italic>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D, E</xref>). When challenged with <italic>Bd</italic>, frogs with neutrophil-enriched skin possessed significantly greater <italic>Bd</italic> loads than control frogs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). This suggests inflammation may be exacerbating <italic>Bd</italic> infections.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> analyses of frog mast cells responses to <italic>Bd</italic></title>
<p>Amphibians rely heavily on skin-produced antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) for antifungal protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, and mast cells produce antimicrobial AMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Thus, we examined whether mast cells could be sources of such AMPs during <italic>Bd</italic> infections. As anticipated, mast cells, but not neutrophils challenged with <italic>Bd</italic>, upregulated their expression of the AMP-encoding genes, <italic>pgla</italic> and <italic>magainin</italic> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>).</p>
<p>Mammalian mast cells are recognized as potent producers of the pleotropic anti- inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-4 (IL4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Notably, <italic>X. laevis</italic> mast cells challenged <italic>in vitro</italic> with <italic>Bd</italic> significantly upregulated their il4 gene expression (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>), whereas almost no il4 expression was detected from either unstimulated or <italic>Bd</italic>-challenged neutrophils. To examine whether the frog IL4 might offer anti-<italic>Bd</italic> protection, we generated the <italic>X. laevis</italic> IL4 in recombinant form (rIL4) and confirmed subcutaneous injection of this moiety augmented expression of genes typically activated by the mammalian IL4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> (cd36, metalloproteinase inhibitor 3-timp3, and monoamine oxidase A- maoa; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). However, subcutaneous administration of rIL4 in <italic>Bd</italic>-infected frogs did not alter their fungal loads (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>), suggesting IL4 is probably not a major mechanism responsible for the observed mast cell-mediated anti-<italic>Bd</italic> protection.</p>

<title>Enrichment of frog skin mast cells alters mucus gland composition</title>
<p>Because mast cell-enriched frog skin had greater expression of genes associated with mucosal tissue integrity and mucus production (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), we next investigated whether the anti-<italic>Bd</italic> protection identified in mast cell-enriched skins could be due, at least in part, to differences in mucus production. Interestingly, while mucus glands in mock- and <italic>Bd</italic>-infected control skin sections contained normal levels of mucus, those from both mock- and <italic>Bd</italic>-infected frogs that had been enriched for cutaneous mast cells were significantly more filled with higher levels of mucin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-C</xref>).</p>

<title>Enrichment of frog skin mast cells alters skin microbial composition</title>
<p>Amphibian skin-produced mucus may offer antimicrobial protection and serve as a selective substratum for commensal microbes, many of which are antifungal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. We found no significant differences in direct <italic>Bd</italic>-killing capacities of mucus isolated from mock- or <italic>Bd</italic>-challenged control or mast cell-enriched frogs (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). By contrast, we observed substantial differences in skin microbiomes, including changes in bacterial composition and richness as well as relative abundances of <italic>Bd</italic>-inhibitory bacteria (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-G</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). A total of 1645 bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were identified from 20 bacterial phyla, seven of which were predominant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Of these, <italic>Verrucomicrobiota</italic> were only present on uninfected animals, whereas <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic> was only seen after 21 dpi on both control and mast cell-enriched, infected animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>At 10 dpi, mast cell-enrichment resulted in a nominal shift in community composition compared to control frogs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Notably, while control, <italic>Bd</italic>-infected animals exhibited a drastic shift in community composition, mast cell-enriched animals possessed substantially less deviated community composition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>), suggesting that these cells are somehow counteracting the adverse effects of <italic>Bd</italic> on microbiome structure. These mast cell-mediated effects persisted to 21 dpi (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>).</p>
<p>At 10 dpi, mast cell-enriched and mock-infected frogs possessed significantly greater abundance of <italic>Bd</italic>-inhibitory bacteria such as <italic>Chyrseobacterium sp</italic>., compared to control, mock infected animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. This suggests that mast cells may promote skin flora composition that is more antifungal. Control (non-enriched) <italic>Bd</italic>-infected frogs possessed significantly greater abundance of <italic>Bd</italic>-inhibitory bacteria than all other treatment groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). While mast cell- enriched, <italic>Bd</italic>-infected frogs had lower abundance of <italic>Bd</italic>-inhibitory bacteria than control infected frogs, they possessed higher abundance of inhibitory taxa than uninfected control animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). The <italic>Bd</italic>-inhibitory bacteria seen in greater abundance on mast cell-enriched, <italic>Bd</italic>-infected animals, included <italic>Roseateles sp</italic>., <italic>Flavobacterium sp.</italic>, and <italic>Kaistia sp</italic>. We did not see significant differences in <italic>Bd</italic>-inhibitory bacteria across the treatment groups at 21 dpi (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Mast cell-enriched uninfected frogs exhibited increased frog skin bacterial richness at 10 dpi (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). While control <italic>Bd</italic>-infected animals exhibited significantly reduced skin microbial richness, mast cell-enriched <italic>Bd</italic>-infected frogs did not exhibit such a reduction in bacterial richness (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>), supporting the idea that mast cells may be counteracting the adverse effects of <italic>Bd</italic> on skin microbiome composition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Amphibian extinction rates far outpace those of any other vertebrate class<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. It is now well- established that chytrid fungi are major contributors to these declines, and strikingly, are considered the greatest infectious disease threat to biodivsersity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. The development of effective mitigation strategies though, is hindered by incomplete understanding of amphibian immune defenses and skin integrity. In this respect, while mast cells are recognized as key immune sentinels of tissues such as skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, relatively little is known about this cell lineage outside of mammals. Our findings provide the first in-depth functional analyses of these cells in amphibians and explore their protective mechanisms during chytrid infections. This work presents a unique perspective on the evolution of mast cell functionality and will serve as a new avenue to explore ways to counteract the amphibian declines.</p>
<p>Mammalian mast cells directly interact with neurons innervating the skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, and mucus production in mammals is tightly controlled by neuronal signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. In turn, mucus serves as a critical substratum for microbiota at mucosal barriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Here, we demonstrate that frog skin mast cells appear to confer significant protection against <italic>Bd</italic> by counteracting <italic>Bd</italic>-elicited inflammation, maintaining skin integrity, promoting mucus production, and preventing the disassembly of established skin microbiomes. Amphibian skin is much thinner and more permeable than that of mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and as such, arguably represents a more penetrable barrier to pathogens. Because mammalian skin is relatively impermeable, mast cells are absent from mammalian epidermis and are instead found exclusively in their dermal layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. In contrast, we have shown here and have observed across several classes of amphibians<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> that mast cells are found in both epidermal and dermal layers. This localization has presumably evolved to support the more intimate contact between amphibian skin and their environments. Considering the importance of amphibian cutaneous integrity to their physiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, it is likely that skin-resident mast cells co-evolved to support skin immunity, physiology, and symbiotic microbiota. Ongoing research continues to reveal functional differences between mammalian connective tissue and mucosa-resident mast cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, and we suspect that there is similarly much to learn about the distinct physiological and immune roles of amphibian epidermal and dermal mast cells.</p>
<p><italic>Bd</italic> infections caused major reductions in bacterial taxa richness, changes in composition and substantial increases in the relative abundance of <italic>Bd</italic>-inhibitory bacteria early in the infection. Similar changes to microbiome structure occur during experimental <italic>Bd</italic> infections of red-backed salamanders and mountain yellow-legged frogs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. In turn, progressing <italic>Bd</italic> infections corresponded with a return to baseline levels of <italic>Bd</italic>-inhibitory bacteria abundance and rebounding microbial richness, albeit with dissimilar communities to those seen in control animals. These temporal changes indicate that amphibian microbiomes are dynamic, as are the effects of <italic>Bd</italic> infections on them. Indeed, <italic>Bd</italic> infections may have long-lasting impacts on amphibian microbiomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. While <italic>Bd</italic> infections manifested in these considerable changes to frog skin microbiome structure, mast cell enrichment appeared to counteract these deleterious effects to their microbial composition. Presumably, the greater skin mucosal integrity and mucus production observed after mast cell enrichment served to stabilize the cutaneous environment during <italic>Bd</italic> infections, thereby ameliorating the <italic>Bd</italic>-mediated microbiome changes. While this work explored the changes in established antifungal flora, we anticipate the mast cell-mediated inhibition of <italic>Bd</italic> may be due to additional, yet unidentified bacterial or fungal taxa. Intriguingly, while mammalian skin mast cell functionality depends on microbiome elicited SCF production by keratinocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, our results indicate that frog skin mast cells in turn impact skin microbiome structure and likely their function. It will be interesting to further explore the interdependent nature of amphibian skin microbiomes and resident mast cells.</p>
<p>In contract to the mast cell effects, enrichment of neutrophils seemed to result in greater <italic>Bd</italic> skin burdens. This suggests that neutrophils and the cytokines they release may result in a greater level of inflammation, which is not protective. This is consistent with other studies that suggest that a strong immune response in the skin compartment of some species may be detrimental<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has become apparent that amphibian host-<italic>Bd</italic> interactions are highly complex and multifaceted while different amphibian species exhibit marked differences in their susceptibilities to this devastating pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The findings described here emphasize the importance of skin- resident mast cells for successful anti-<italic>Bd</italic> defenses and demonstrate that these immune sentinels are intimately linked to many aspects of frog skin physiology. Our results indicate that when mast cells are enriched, the ensuing changes in the skin allow for greater resistance to infection by developing zoospores. Presumably, distinct amphibian species have evolved disparate interconnections between their skin mast cells and their cutaneous defenses, as dictated by their respective physiological and environmental pressures. In turn, these species-specific differences likely dictate whether and to what extent the skin-resident mast cells of a given amphibian species recognize and appropriately respond to <italic>Bd</italic> infections. We postulate that such differences may contribute to the differences in susceptibilities of amphibian species to pathogens like chytrid fungi.</p>

Genomic DNA was extracted from swabs using a PowerSoil Pro kit on a Qiacube HT (QIAGEN, MD). One-step PCR library prep and dual-index paired-end Illumina sequencing was used to sequence the skin microbiome of individual frogs. A â¼380 base pair region in the V3-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene using the universal primers 515F-Y (GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 939R (CTTGTGCGGGCCCCCGTCAATTC) was used for amplification. Negative and positive controls (ZymoBIOMICS D6300 &amp; D6305, Zymo, CA) were included in each round of extraction and PCR. Reactions were done in duplicate for each sample, pooled, cleaned with in-house Speed-beads (in a PEG/NaCl buffer), quantified with a Qubit4 (Invitrogen, MA) and pooled into a final library in equimolar proportion. The pooled library was sequenced on two Illumina MiSeq runs (v3 chemistry: 2x300 bp kit) at the Center for Conservation Genomics, Smithsonian National Zoo &amp; Conservation Biology Institute.</p>

<p>The <italic>X. laevis</italic> SCF and CSF3 sequences representing the signal peptide-cleaved transcripts were ligated into the pMIB/V5 His A insect expression vectors (Invitrogen). SCF-ligated, CSF3-ligated, or empty vectors were transfected into Sf9 insect cells (cellfectin II, Invitrogen). Recombinant proteins contain a V5 epitope, and western blot with an anti-V5-HRP antibody (Sigma) confirmed their presence. Positive transfectants were selected using 10 Î¼g/mL blasticidin (Gibco). Expression cultures were scaled up to 500 mL liquid cultures, grown for 5 days, pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatants collected. Supernatants were dialyzed overnight at 4Â°C against 150 mM sodium phosphate, concentrated against polyethylene glycol flakes (8 kDa) at 4Â°C, dialyzed overnight at 4Â°C against 150 mM sodium phosphate, and passed through Ni-NTA agarose columns (Qiagen). Columns were washed with 2 Ã 10 volumes of high stringency wash buffer (0.5% Tween 20, 50 mM Sodium Phosphate, 500 mM Sodium Chloride, 100 mM Imidazole) and 5 x 10 volumes of low stringency wash buffer (as above but with 40 mM Imidazole). Recombinant proteins were eluted with 250 mM imidazole. After recombinant protein purification, a halt protease inhibitor cocktail (containing AEBSF, aprotinin, bestatin, E-64, leupeptin and pepstatin A; Thermo Scientific) was added. Intact recombinant protein presence was confirmed again by western blot and the protein concentrations quantified by Bradford protein assays (BioRad). Protein aliquots were stored at -20Â°C until use.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The global decline of amphibians is primarily attributed to deadly disease outbreaks caused by the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). It is unclear whether and how skin-resident immune cells defend against Bd. Although it is well known that mammalian mast cells are crucial immune sentinels in the skin and play a pivotal role in the immune recognition of pathogens and orchestrating subsequent immune responses, the roles of amphibian mast cells during Bd infections are largely unknown. The current study developed a novel way to enrich X. laevis skin mast cells by injecting the skin with recombinant stem cell factor (SCF), a KIT ligand required for mast cell differentiation and survival. The investigators found an enrichment of skin mast cells provides X. laevis substantial protection against Bd and mitigates the inflammation-related skin damage resulting from Bd infection. Additionally, the augmentation of mast cells leads to increased mucin content within cutaneous mucus glands and shields frogs from the alterations to their skin microbiomes caused by Bd.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This study underscores the significance of amphibian skin-resident immune cells in defenses against Bd and introduces a novel approach to examining interactions between amphibian hosts and fungal pathogens.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The main weakness of the study is the lack of functional analysis of X. laevis mast cells. Upon activation, mast cells have the characteristic feature of degranulation to release histamine, serotonin, proteases, cytokines, and chemokines, etc. The study should determine whether X. laevis mast cells can be degranulated by two commonly used mast cell activators IgE and compound 48/80 for IgE-dependent and independent pathways. This can be easily done in vitro. It is also important to assess whether in vivo these mast cells are degranulated upon Bd infection using avidin staining to visualize vesicle releases from mast cells. Figure 3 only showed rSCF injection caused an increase in mast cells in naÃ¯ve skin. They need to present whether Bd infection can induce mast cell increase and rSCF injection under Bd infection causes a mast cell increase in the skin. In addition, it is unclear how the enrichment of mast cells provides protection against Bd infection and alternations to skin microbiomes after infection. It is important to determine whether skin mast cells release any contents mentioned above.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study, Hauser et al investigate the role of amphibian (Xenopus laevis) mast cells in cutaneous immune responses to the ecologically important pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) using novel methods of in vitro differentiation of bone marrow-derived mast cells and in vivo expansion of skin mast cell populations. They find that bone marrow-derived myeloid precursors cultured in the presence of recombinant X. laevis Stem Cell Factor (rSCF) differentiate into cells that display hallmark characteristics of mast cells. They inject their novel (r)SCF reagent into the skin of X. laevis and find that this stimulates the expansion of cutaneous mast cell populations in vivo. They then apply this model of cutaneous mast cell expansion in the setting of Bd infection and find that mast cell expansion attenuates the skin burden of Bd zoospores and pathologic features including epithelial thickness and improves protective mucus production and transcriptional markers of barrier function. Utilizing their prior expertise with expanding neutrophil populations in X. laevis, the authors compare mast cell expansion using (r)SCF to neutrophil expansion using recombinant colony-stimulating factor 3 (rCSF3) and find that neutrophil expansion in Bd infection leads to greater burden of zoospores and worse skin pathology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors report a novel method of expanding amphibian mast cells utilizing their custom-made rSCF reagent. They rigorously characterize expanded mast cells in vitro and in vivo using histologic, morphologic, transcriptional, and functional assays. This establishes solid footing with which to then study the role of rSCF-stimulated mast cell expansion in the Bd infection model. This appears to be the first demonstration of the exogenous use of rSCF in amphibians to expand mast cell populations and may set a foundation for future mechanistic studies of mast cells in the X. laevis model organism.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The conclusions regarding the role of mast cell expansion in controlling Bd infection would be stronger with a more rigorous evaluation of the model, as there are some key gaps and remaining questions regarding the data. For example:</p>
<p>1. Granulocyte expansion is carefully quantified in the initial time courses of rSCF and rCSF3 injections, but similar quantification is not provided in the disease models (Figures 3E, 4G, 5D-G). A key implication of the opposing effects of mast cell vs neutrophil expansion is that mast cells may suppress neutrophil recruitment or function. Alternatively, mast cells also express notable levels of csfr3 (Figure 2) and previous work from this group (Hauser et al, Facets 2020) showed rG-CSF-stimulated peritoneal granulocytes express mast cell markers including kit and tpsab1, raising the question of what effect rCSF3 might have on mast cell populations in the skin. Considering these points, it would be helpful if both mast cells and neutrophils were quantified histologically (based on Figure 1, they can be readily distinguished by SE or Giemsa stain) in the Bd infection models.</p>
<p>2. Epithelial thickness and inflammation in Bd infection are reported to be reduced by rSCF treatment (Figure 3E, 5A-B) or increased by rCSF3 treatment (Figure 4G) but quantification of these critical readouts is not shown.</p>
<p>3. Critical time points in the Bd model are incompletely characterized. Mast cell expansion decreases zoospore burden at 21 dpi, while there is no difference at 7 dpi (Figure 3E). Conversely, neutrophil expansion increases zoospore burden at 7 dpi, but no corresponding 21 dpi data is shown for comparison (Figure 4G). Microbiota analysis is performed at a third time point,10 dpi (Figure 5D-G), making it difficult to compare with the data from the 7 dpi and 21 dpi time points. Reporting consistent readouts at these three time points is important to draw solid conclusions about the relationship of mast cell expansion to Bd infection and shifts in microbiota.</p>
<p>4. Although the effect of rSCF treatment on Bd zoospores is significant at 21 dpi (Figure 3E), bacterial microbiota changes at 21 dpi are not (Figure S3B-C). This discrepancy, how it relates to the bacterial microbiota changes at 10 dpi, and why 7, 10, and 21 dpi time points were chosen for these different readouts (Figure 5F-G), is not discussed.</p>
<p>5. The time course of rSCF or rCSF3 treatments relative to Bd infection in the experiments is not clear. Were the treatments given 12 hours prior to the final analysis point to maximize the effect? For example, in Figure 3E, were rSCF injections given at 6.5 dpi and 20.5 dpi? Or were treatments administered on day 0 of the infection model? If the latter, how do the authors explain the effects at 7 dpi or 21 dpi given mast cell and neutrophil numbers return to baseline within 24 hours after rSCF or rCSF3 treatment, respectively?</p>
<p>The title of the manuscript may be mildly overstated. Although Bd infection can indeed be deadly, mortality was not a readout in this study, and it is not clear from the data reported that expanding skin mast cells would ultimately prevent progression to death in Bd infections.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Hauser et al. provide an exceptional study describing the role of resident mast cells in amphibian epidermis that produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that prevent Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) infection from causing harmful inflammation, and also protect frogs from changes in skin microbiomes and loss of mucin in glands and loss of mucus integrity that otherwise cause changes to their skin microbiomes. Neutrophils, in contrast, were not protective against Bd infection. Beyond the beautiful cytology and transcriptional profiling, the authors utilized elegant cell enrichment experiments to enrich mast cells by recombinant stem cell factor, or to enrich neutrophils by recombinant colony-stimulating factor-3, and examined respective infection outcomes in Xenopus.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Through the use of recombinant IL4, the authors were able to test and eliminate the hypothesis that mast cell production of IL4 was the mechanism of host protection from Bd infection. Instead, impacts on the mucus glands and interaction with the skin microbiome are implicated as the protective mechanism. These results will press disease ecologists to examine the relative importance of this immune defense among species, the influence of mast cells on the skin microbiome and mucosal function, and open the potential for modulating mucosal defense.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
A reduction of bacterial diversity upon infection, as described at the end of the results section, may not always be an &quot;adverse effect,&quot; particularly given that anti-Bd function of the microbiome increased. Some authors (see Letourneau et al. 2022 ISME, or Woodhams et al. 2023 DCI) consider these short-term alterations as encoding ecological memory, such that continued exposure to a pathogen would encounter an enriched microbial defense.

<p>While the description of the mast cell location in the epidermal skin layer in amphibians is novel, it is not known how representative these results are across species ranging in chytridiomycosis susceptibility.

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The global decline of amphibians is primarily attributed to deadly disease outbreaks caused by the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). It is unclear whether and how skin-resident immune cells defend against Bd. Although it is well known that mammalian mast cells are crucial immune sentinels in the skin and play a pivotal role in the immune recognition of pathogens and orchestrating subsequent immune responses, the roles of amphibian mast cells during Bd infections are largely unknown. The current study developed a novel way to enrich X. laevis skin mast cells by injecting the skin with recombinant stem cell factor (SCF), a KIT ligand required for mast cell differentiation and survival. The investigators found an enrichment of skin mast cells provides X. laevis substantial protection against Bd and mitigates the inflammation-related skin damage resulting from Bd infection. Additionally, the augmentation of mast cells leads to increased mucin content within cutaneous mucus glands and shields frogs from the alterations to their skin microbiomes caused by Bd.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This study underscores the significance of amphibian skin-resident immune cells in defenses against Bd and introduces a novel approach to examining interactions between amphibian hosts and fungal pathogens.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The main weakness of the study is the lack of functional analysis of X. laevis mast cells. Upon activation, mast cells have the characteristic feature of degranulation to release histamine, serotonin, proteases, cytokines, and chemokines, etc. The study should determine whether X. laevis mast cells can be degranulated by two commonly used mast cell activators IgE and compound 48/80 for IgE-dependent and independent pathways. This can be easily done in vitro. It is also important to assess whether in vivo these mast cells are degranulated upon Bd infection using avidin staining to visualize vesicle releases from mast cells. Figure 3 only showed rSCF injection caused an increase in mast cells in naÃ¯ve skin. They need to present whether Bd infection can induce mast cell increase and rSCF injection under Bd infection causes a mast cell increase in the skin. In addition, it is unclear how the enrichment of mast cells provides protection against Bd infection and alternations to skin microbiomes after infection. It is important to determine whether skin mast cells release any contents mentioned above.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for taking the time to review our work and for providing us with valuable feedback.</p>
<p>Please note that amphibians do not possess the IgE antibody isotype1.</p>
<p>To our knowledge there have been no published studies using approaches for studying mammalian mast cell degranulation to examine amphibian mast cells. Notably, several studies suggest that amphibian mast cells lack histamine2, 3, 4, 5 and serotonin2, 6. While there are commercially available kits and reagents for examining mammalian mast cell granule content, most of these reagents may not cross-react with their amphibian counterparts. This is especially true of cytokines and chemokines, which diverged quickly with evolution and thus do not share substantial protein sequence identity across species as divergent as frogs and mammals. Respectfully, while following up on these findings is possible, it would involve considerable additional work to find reagents that would detect amphibian mast cell contents.</p>
<p>We would also like to respectfully point out that while mast cell degranulation is a feature most associated with mammalian mast cells, this is not the only means by which mammalian mast cells confer their immunological effects. While we agree that defining the biology of amphibian mast cell degranulation is important, we anticipate that since the anti-<italic>Bd</italic> protection conferred by enriching frog mast cells is seen after 21 days of enrichment, it is quite possible that degranulation may not be the central mechanism by which the mast cells are mediating this protection.</p>
<p>As noted in our manuscript, frog mast cells upregulate their expression of interleukin-4 (IL4), which is a hallmark cytokine associated with mammalian mast cells7. We are presently exploring the role of the frog IL4 in the observed mast cell anti-<italic>Bd</italic> protection. Should we generate meaningful findings in this regard, we will add them to the revised version of this manuscript.</p>
<p>We are also exploring the heparin content of frog mast cells and capacities of these cells to degranulate <italic>in vitro</italic> in response to compound 48/80. In addition, we are exploring <italic>in vivo</italic> mast cell degranulation via histology and avidin-staining. Should these studies generate significant findings, we will include them in the revised version of this manuscript.</p>
<p>Per the reviewerâs suggestion, in our revised manuscript we also plan to include data showing whether <italic>Bd</italic> infections affect skin mast cell numbers and how rSCF injection impacts skin mast cell numbers in the context of <italic>Bd</italic> infections.</p>
<p>In regard to how mast cells impact <italic>Bd</italic> infections and skin microbiomes, our data indicate that mast cells are augmenting skin integrity during <italic>Bd</italic> infections and promoting mucus production, as indicated by the findings presented in Figure 4A-C and Figure 5A-C, respectively. There are several mammalian mast cell products that elicit mucus production. In mammals, this mucus production is mediated by goblet cells while the molecular control of amphibian skin mucus gland content remains incompletely understood. Interleukin-13 (IL13) is the major cytokine associated with mammalian mucus production8, while to our knowledge this cytokine is either not encoded by amphibians or else has yet to be identified and annotated in these animalsâ genomes. IL4 signaling also results in mucus production9 and we are presently exploring the possible contribution of the <italic>X. laevis</italic> IL4 to skin mucus gland filling. Any significant findings on this front will be included in the revised manuscript. Histamine release contributes to mast cell-mediated mucus production10, but as we outline above, several studies indicate that amphibian mast cells may lack histamine2, 3, 4, 5. Mammalian mast cell-produced lipid mediators also play a critical role in eliciting mucus secretion11 and our transcriptomic analysis indicates that frog mast cells express several enzymes associated with production of such mediators. We will highlight this observation in our revised manuscript.</p>
<p>We anticipate that <italic>X. laevis</italic> mast cells influence skin integrity, microbial composition and <italic>Bd</italic> susceptibility in a myriad of ways. Considering the substantial differences between amphibian and mammalian evolutionary histories and physiologies, we anticipate that many of the mechanisms by which <italic>X. laevis</italic> mast cells confer anti-<italic>Bd</italic> protection will prove to be specific to amphibians and some even unique to <italic>X. laevis</italic>. We are most interested in deciphering what these mechanisms are but foresee that they will not necessarily reflect what one would expect based on what we know about mammalian mast cells in the context of mammalian physiologies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study, Hauser et al investigate the role of amphibian (Xenopus laevis) mast cells in cutaneous immune responses to the ecologically important pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) using novel methods of in vitro differentiation of bone marrow-derived mast cells and in vivo expansion of skin mast cell populations. They find that bone marrow-derived myeloid precursors cultured in the presence of recombinant X. laevis Stem Cell Factor (rSCF) differentiate into cells that display hallmark characteristics of mast cells. They inject their novel (r)SCF reagent into the skin of X. laevis and find that this stimulates the expansion of cutaneous mast cell populations in vivo. They then apply this model of cutaneous mast cell expansion in the setting of Bd infection and find that mast cell expansion attenuates the skin burden of Bd zoospores and pathologic features including epithelial thickness and improves protective mucus production and transcriptional markers of barrier function. Utilizing their prior expertise with expanding neutrophil populations in X. laevis, the authors compare mast cell expansion using (r)SCF to neutrophil expansion using recombinant colony-stimulating factor 3 (rCSF3) and find that neutrophil expansion in Bd infection leads to greater burden of zoospores and worse skin pathology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors report a novel method of expanding amphibian mast cells utilizing their custom-made rSCF reagent. They rigorously characterize expanded mast cells in vitro and in vivo using histologic, morphologic, transcriptional, and functional assays. This establishes solid footing with which to then study the role of rSCF-stimulated mast cell expansion in the Bd infection model. This appears to be the first demonstration of the exogenous use of rSCF in amphibians to expand mast cell populations and may set a foundation for future mechanistic studies of mast cells in the X. laevis model organism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the breadth and extent of the undertaking that culminated in this manuscript. Indeed, this manuscript would not have been possible without considerable reagent development and adaptation of techniques that had previously not been used for amphibian immunity research. In line with the reviewerâs sentiment, to our knowledge this is the first report of using molecular approaches to augment amphibian mast cells, which we hope will pave the way for new areas of research within the fields of comparative immunology and amphibian disease biology.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The conclusions regarding the role of mast cell expansion in controlling Bd infection would be stronger with a more rigorous evaluation of the model, as there are some key gaps and remaining questions regarding the data. For example:</p>
<p>1. Granulocyte expansion is carefully quantified in the initial time courses of rSCF and rCSF3 injections, but similar quantification is not provided in the disease models (Figures 3E, 4G, 5D-G). A key implication of the opposing effects of mast cell vs neutrophil expansion is that mast cells may suppress neutrophil recruitment or function. Alternatively, mast cells also express notable levels of csfr3 (Figure 2) and previous work from this group (Hauser et al, Facets 2020) showed rG-CSF-stimulated peritoneal granulocytes express mast cell markers including kit and tpsab1, raising the question of what effect rCSF3 might have on mast cell populations in the skin. Considering these points, it would be helpful if both mast cells and neutrophils were quantified histologically (based on Figure 1, they can be readily distinguished by SE or Giemsa stain) in the Bd infection models.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful suggestion. We are performing a further examination of skin granulocyte content during <italic>Bd</italic> infections and plan on including any significant findings in our revised manuscript.</p>
<p>We predict that rSCF administration results in the accumulation of mast cells that are polarized such that they ablate the inflammatory response elicited by <italic>Bd</italic> infection. Mammalian mast cells, including peritonea-resident mast cells, express csf3r12, 13. Although the <italic>X. laevis</italic> animal model does not permit nearly the degree of immune cell resolution afforded by mammalian animal models, we do know that the adult <italic>X. laevis</italic> peritonea contain heterogenous leukocyte populations. We anticipate that the high kit expression reported by Hauser <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020 in the rCSF3-recruited peritoneal leukocytes reflects the presence of mast cells therein. As such and in acknowledgement of the reviewerâs suggestion, we also think that the cells recruited by rCSF3 into the skin may include not only neutrophils but also mast cells. Possibly, these mast cells have distinct polarization states from those enriched by rSCF. While the lack of antibodies against frog neutrophils or mast cells has limited our capacity to address this question, we will attempt to reexamine by histology the proportions of skin neutrophils and mast cells in the skins of frogs under the conditions described in our manuscript. Any new findings in this regard will be included in the revised version of this work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>2. Epithelial thickness and inflammation in Bd infection are reported to be reduced by rSCF treatment (Figure 3E, 5A-B) or increased by rCSF3 treatment (Figure 4G) but quantification of these critical readouts is not shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We will score epithelial thickness under the distinct conditions described in our manuscript and present the quantified data in the revised paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>3. Critical time points in the Bd model are incompletely characterized. Mast cell expansion decreases zoospore burden at 21 dpi, while there is no difference at 7 dpi (Figure 3E). Conversely, neutrophil expansion increases zoospore burden at 7 dpi, but no corresponding 21 dpi data is shown for comparison (Figure 4G). Microbiota analysis is performed at a third time point,10 dpi (Figure 5D-G), making it difficult to compare with the data from the 7 dpi and 21 dpi time points. Reporting consistent readouts at these three time points is important to draw solid conclusions about the relationship of mast cell expansion to Bd infection and shifts in microbiota.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Because there were no significant effects of mast cell enrichment at 7 days post <italic>Bd</italic> infection, we chose to look at the microbiome composition in a subsequent experiment at 10 days and 21 days post <italic>Bd</italic> infection, with 10 days being a bit more of a midway point between the initial exposure and day 21, when we see the effect on <italic>Bd</italic> loads. We will clarify this rationale in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>The enrichment of neutrophils in frog skins resulted in prompt (12 hours post enrichment) skin thickening (in absence of <italic>Bd</italic> infection) and increased frog <italic>Bd</italic> susceptibility by 7 days of infection. Conversely, mast cell enrichment stabilized skin mucosal and symbiotic microbial environment, presumably accounting at least in part for the lack of further <italic>Bd</italic> growth on mast cell-enriched animals by 21 days of infection. Our question regarding the roles of inflammatory granulocytes/neutrophils during <italic>Bd</italic> infections was that of âhowâ rather âwhenâ these cells affect <italic>Bd</italic> infections. Because the central focus of this work was mast cells and not other granulocyte subsets, when we saw that rCSF3-recruited granulocytes adversely affected <italic>Bd</italic> infections at 7 days post infection, we did not pursue the kinetics of these responses further. We plan to explore the roles of inflammatory mediators and disparate frog immune cell subsets during the course of <italic>Bd</italic> infections, but we feel that these future studies are more peripheral to the central thesis of the present manuscript regarding the roles of frog mast cells during <italic>Bd</italic> infections.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>4. Although the effect of rSCF treatment on Bd zoospores is significant at 21 dpi (Figure 3E), bacterial microbiota changes at 21 dpi are not (Figure S3B-C). This discrepancy, how it relates to the bacterial microbiota changes at 10 dpi, and why 7, 10, and 21 dpi time points were chosen for these different readouts (Figure 5F-G), is not discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our results indicate that after 10 days of <italic>Bd</italic> infection, control <italic>Bd</italic>-challenged animals exhibited reduced microbial richness, while skin mast cell-enriched <italic>Bd</italic>-infected frogs were protected from this disruption of their microbiome. The amphibian microbiome serves as a major barrier to these fungal infections14, and we anticipate that <italic>Bd</italic>-mediated disruption of microbial richness and composition facilitates host skin colonization by this pathogen. Control and mast cell-enriched animals had similar skin <italic>Bd</italic> loads at 10 days post infection. However, by 21 days of <italic>Bd</italic> infection the mast cells-enriched animals maintained their <italic>Bd</italic> loads to levels observed at 10 days post infection, whereas the control animals had significantly greater <italic>Bd</italic> loads. Thus, we anticipate that frog mast cells are conferring the observed anti-<italic>Bd</italic> protection in part by preventing microbial disassembly and thus interfering with optimal <italic>Bd</italic> colonization and growth on frog skins. In other words, maintained microbial composition at 10 days of infection may be preventing additional <italic>Bd</italic> colonization/growth, as seen when comparing skins of control and mast cell-enriched frogs at 21 days post infection. By 21 days of infection, control animals rebounded from the <italic>Bd</italic>-mediated reduction in bacterial richness seen at 10 days. Considering that after 21 days of infection control animals also had significantly greater <italic>Bd</italic> loads than mast-cell enriched animals suggests that there may be a critical earlier window during which microbial composition is able to counteract _Bd_growth.</p>
<p>While the current draft of our manuscript has a paragraph to this effect (see below), we appreciate the reviewer conveying to us that our perspective on the relationship between skin mast cells and the kinetics of microbial composition and _Bd_loads could be better emphasized. We plan to revise our manuscript to include the above discussion points.</p>
<p><italic>Bd</italic> infections caused major reductions in bacterial taxa richness, changes in composition and substantial increases in the relative abundance of <italic>Bd</italic>-inhibitory bacteria early in the infection. Similar changes to microbiome structure occur during experimental <italic>Bd</italic> infections of red-backed salamanders and mountain yellow-legged frogs15, 16. In turn, progressing _Bd_infections corresponded with a return to baseline levels of <italic>Bd</italic>-inhibitory bacteria abundance and rebounding microbial richness, albeit with dissimilar communities to those seen in control animals. These temporal changes indicate that amphibian microbiomes are dynamic, as are the effects of <italic>Bd</italic> infections on them. Indeed, <italic>Bd</italic> infections may have long-lasting impacts on amphibian microbiomes15. While <italic>Bd</italic> infections manifested in these considerable changes to frog skin microbiome structure, mast cell enrichment appeared to counteract these deleterious effects to their microbial composition. Presumably, the greater skin mucosal integrity and mucus production observed after mast cell enrichment served to stabilize the cutaneous environment during <italic>Bd</italic> infections, thereby ameliorating the <italic>Bd</italic>-mediated microbiome changes. While this work explored the changes in established antifungal flora, we anticipate the mast cell-mediated inhibition of <italic>Bd</italic> may be due to additional, yet unidentified bacterial or fungal taxa. Intriguingly, while mammalian skin mast cell functionality depends on microbiome elicited SCF production by keratinocytes17, our results indicate that frog skin mast cells in turn impact skin microbiome structure and likely their function. It will be interesting to further explore the interdependent nature of amphibian skin microbiomes and resident mast cells.</p>
