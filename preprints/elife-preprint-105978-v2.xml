<title>Abstract</title><p>Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) has the potential to provide durable, non-integrating transgene expression for transient gene therapy. However, its auto-replicative nature mimics viral infection, triggering innate immune responses that shut down cap-dependent translation, degrade cellular mRNA, induce cell death, and release cytokines. In non-immunotherapy applications, this immune activation is undesirable as it limits transgene expression, induces unintended changes in host gene expression, depletes transfected cells, and promotes inflammation—ultimately undermining therapeutic outcomes. Moreover, the use of exogenous immune suppressants to mitigate these effects often increases treatment complexity and the risk of unintended systemic side effects. To address these challenges, we developed a strategy to encode broad-spectrum innate immune suppression directly within saRNA. This approach leverages cap-independent translation to bypass saRNA-triggered translation shutdown, enabling the expression of multiple inhibitors targeting diverse double-stranded RNA-sensing and inflammatory signalling pathways. In mouse primary fibroblast-like synoviocytes—key cells in joint pathologies—this strategy eliminates the need for external immune inhibitors, reduces cytotoxicity and antiviral cytokine secretion, and enables sustained transgene expression that can be controlled with a small-molecule antiviral. Together, these findings support the development of reversible ‘immune-evasive saRNA’ constructs for transient gene therapy applications that avoid persistent immune activation and eliminate the need for external immune suppressants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) is a promising platform for transient gene therapy due to its ability to encode large therapeutic payloads and achieve sustained, non-integrating protein expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Upon cellular internalization, saRNA utilizes host machinery to synthesize an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which drives replication of the saRNA genome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> This process involves the production of a negative-strand RNA intermediate that serves as a template for both genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Subgenomic RNA, encoding the gene of interest, is transcribed in excess of the genomic RNA, leading to robust and sustained protein expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the self-replication of saRNA also generates double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates, formed both during the synthesis of negative-strand RNA and during the transcription of positive-strand RNA from the negative-strand template.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> These dsRNA intermediates are potent activators of cytosolic pattern recognition receptors, triggering innate immune responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> This recognition results in shutdown of cap-dependent translation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> degradation of cellular mRNA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> induction of programmed cell death,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and release of cytokines and chemokines characteristic of viral infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> In non-immunotherapy applications such as transient gene therapy, these responses are particularly problematic, as they limit transgene expression, reshape the host transcriptional landscape in ways that may undermine therapeutic effects, deplete transfected cells, and induce inflammation.</p>
<p>Strategies to mitigate saRNA-mediated innate immune responses have included the incorporation of modified nucleotides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, removal of dsRNA contaminants,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and co-delivery of non-replicating mRNA encoding viral innate immune inhibiting proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> While these approaches can reduce initial innate immune responses to saRNA transfection, they fall short in addressing the continuous immune activation triggered by dsRNA intermediates that arise during saRNA replication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Sequence evolution of the RdRp shows some promise in reducing these responses, but even engineered RdRps still induce significant innate immune activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> Encoding viral immune inhibitors within the saRNA construct using 2A self-cleaving peptides can improve protein expression <italic>in vitro</italic> but has limited impact on cytokine responses, despite reductions in NF-κB and IRF3 activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> Although these strategies temper saRNA-induced innate immune responses to levels appropriate for immunotherapy applications—where some immune activation is beneficial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>—they fall short of the stringent requirements for non-immunotherapy contexts, where therapeutic outcomes can be compromised by immune activation. In such cases, exogenous immunosuppressants can mitigate saRNA-induced immune responses and enable effective transgene expression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> but this approach complicates treatment regimens and increases the risk of unintended side effects from systemic immune suppression.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, we developed a fully saRNA-based approach that mitigates innate immune responses triggered by saRNA replication, incorporating several key innovations. First, innate immune inhibitory proteins are expressed via cap-independent translation, bypassing the cap-dependent translation shutdown commonly triggered by saRNA. Cap-dependent translation requires the presence of a 5′ cap structure on mRNA, which recruits translation initiation factors and ribosomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> By contrast, cap-independent translation uses internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) to recruit ribosomes directly to the mRNA, enabling translation even when cap-dependent pathways are inhibited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> Second, by simultaneously targeting multiple dsRNA-sensing and inflammatory signalling pathways, our method provides a more comprehensive suppression of innate immune responses than single target approaches. Third, encoding innate immune inhibitors directly within the saRNA ensures continuous protection against persistent innate immune activation caused by dsRNA intermediates during saRNA replication, eliminating the need for exogenous immunosuppressants.</p>
<p>We evaluated this approach in mouse primary fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), a key cell type in the pathology of joint diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> To facilitate this evaluation, we developed a microplate assay for straightforward, longitudinal monitoring of saRNA translation control and cytotoxicity in live cells. Our results demonstrate that this strategy effectively reduces saRNA-induced cytotoxicity and cytokine production while enabling sustained cap-dependent transgene expression, which can be reversed with a small-molecule antiviral. These results pave the way for ‘immune-evasive’ saRNA constructs that enable durable and externally controllable transgene expression with minimal innate immune activation, all without the need for exogenous immunosuppressants.</p>

<title>Development of a microplate assay for longitudinal monitoring of translational control and cell number</title>
<p>Since saRNA can induce cap-dependent translation shutdown and cell death, we developed a microplate assay to simultaneously monitor cap-independent translation, cap-dependent translation, and cell number over time. In this assay, primary mouse FLS (Supplemental Figure S1) were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with saRNA constructs that used the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) RdRp to self-replicate. These constructs featured a dual-fluorescence design, with EGFP expressed through encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) IRES-mediated, cap-independent translation, and mScarlet3 expressed through subgenomic cap-dependent translation. This dual-reporter system enabled assessment of the effects of saRNA on translational control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). Spectral overlap between EGFP and mScarlet3 was corrected using linear unmixing (Supplemental Figure S2a–c).</p>

<p>To monitor cell number, FLS were stained with BioTracker NIR680, a lipophilic carbocyanine membrane dye that enables long-term fluorescent labeling of cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> Carbocyanine dyes like BioTracker are weakly fluorescent in aqueous solution but exhibit high fluorescence when integrated into lipid bilayers.</p>
<p>Consequently, mock transfection with Lipofectamine MessengerMAX—a lipid transfection agent— enhanced BioTracker fluorescence compared to non-transfected cells, likely due to an interaction with the lipid components of Lipofectamine (Supplemental Figure S3a and b). Despite this interaction, BioTracker remains effective for indicating cell number, as treatment of mock-transfected cells with the apoptosis inducer staurosporine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> reduced BioTracker fluorescence. The BioTracker results were consistent with those obtained using the viability dye calcein AM (Supplemental Figure S3c and d), with the added advantages of eliminating the need for additional staining and wash steps and avoiding spectral overlap with red and green fluorescent proteins. This assay allows for seamless longitudinal monitoring of cap-independent translation, cap-dependent translation, and cell number using microplate readers or imagers.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Design of saRNA constructs for inhibiting multiple dsRNA-sensing pathways</title>
<p>To attenuate saRNA-induced innate immune responses, we first started by designing constructs that inhibit dsRNA-sensing pathways. Cells detect cytosolic dsRNA through several pathways, including RIG-I,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> protein kinase R (PKR),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> and oligoadenylate synthase (OAS)/RNase L pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> To broadly inhibit these pathways, we designed an saRNA construct, referred to as ‘E3’, that expresses the vaccinia virus E3 protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). E3 protein is a pleiotropic inhibitor that binds and sequesters dsRNA, effectively blocking multiple dsRNA-sensing pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the key roles of PKR in cap-dependent translation shutdown and OAS/RNase L in cellular mRNA degradation in response to dsRNA, we sought to further inhibit these pathways in a second construct. This construct includes Toscana virus NSs, a ubiquitin ligase that promotes PKR degradation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and Theiler’s virus L*, which inhibits RNase L.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> To enable co-expression of these three proteins—E3, NSs, and L*—we incorporated 2A “self-cleaving” peptide sequences between the proteins, allowing the polyprotein to be cleaved into separate proteins during translation. As prior experiments showed that using multiple identical 2A peptides can reduce protein expression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> we selected non-identical 2A peptides for this construct. This construct, named ‘E3-NSs-L*’, is expected to provide a more comprehensive inhibition of dsRNA-sensing pathways than the E3 construct.</p>
<p>Because translation shutdown is one of the major cellular responses to saRNA replication, we expressed these dsRNA-sensing pathway inhibitors using ECMV IRES-mediated, cap-independent translation.</p>
<p>During translation shutdown, global cap-dependent mRNA translation initiation is limited, freeing ribosomes that would otherwise be used for translating capped mRNAs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> thereby enhancing cap-independent translation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> By leveraging this mechanism, IRES-mediated expression of dsRNA-sensing pathway inhibitors ensures their levels increase as translation shutdown intensifies. In contrast, encoding these inhibitors via cap-dependent translation is expected to be less effective, as translation shutdown would lead to reduced inhibitor expression.</p>
<p>As a control, we designed a ‘native saRNA’ construct that expresses a blue fluorescent protein (moxBFP) as a visual marker of IRES functionality in place of inhibitors of dsRNA-sensing pathways. Importantly, moxBFP expression did not overlap spectrally with the EGFP or mScarlet3 channels (Supplemental Figure S2b).</p>

<title>Moderate dsRNA-sensing pathway inhibition enables high transgene expression at the cost of cell loss, while strong inhibition preserves cell number at lower expression levels</title>
<p>Following transfection of saRNA constructs, we monitored BioTracker, EGFP, and mScarlet3 fluorescence over 3 weeks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b and c</xref>). Inhibiting dsRNA-sensing pathways with viral proteins significantly enhanced saRNA transgene expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d and e</xref>).

<p>Achieving durable transgene expression depends equally on preserving cell viability and maximizing transgene expression, as constructs that induce cell death undermine the goal of sustained transgene expression. Transfection of FLS with native saRNA caused both immediate and long-term reductions in cell number, as indicated by BioTracker intensity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>). While the E3 construct initially maintained cell number, BioTracker signals gradually diminished over time. In contrast, the E3-NSs-L* construct provided sustained protection against the decline in cell number. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis quantified these cumulative effects, confirming that E3-NSs-L* significantly preserved cell numbers compared to E3 (<xref rid="figf1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). CellTag-based normalization assays on day 2 post-transfection further corroborated these findings, revealing a stepwise increase in protection against cell loss with greater dsRNA-sensing pathway inhibition across the three constructs (<xref rid="figf1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

<p>Upon detection of dsRNA, OAS enzymes synthesize 2′-5′-oligoadenylates, which activate RNase L, a ribonuclease that degrades single-stranded RNA.

<p>Consequently, RNase L activation by the E3 construct may preferentially deplete host mRNAs, thereby reducing competition for the ribosomal machinery and enhancing the relative translation of protected saRNA transcripts. In contrast, E3-NSs-L* expresses Theiler’s virus L*, an RNase L inhibitor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> preventing host mRNA degradation and forcing saRNA to compete with cellular mRNA for ribosome access.</p>
<p>To evaluate whether RNase L activation contributes to the greater transgene expression observed with the E3 construct compared to E3-NSs-L*, we assessed ribosomal RNA (rRNA) integrity as a surrogate measure of RNase L activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> Total RNA was extracted from FLS transfected with either E3 or E3-NSs-L*, and evaluated using the RNA integrity number (RIN) algorithm, an automated Bayesian learning method that quantifies rRNA integrity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> Cells transfected with E3 exhibited significantly lower RIN values compared to those transfected with E3-NSs-L* (<xref rid="figf3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

<p>We further evaluated global protein synthesis using surface sensing of translation (SUnSET),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> in which FLS were pulsed with puromycin, and newly synthesized peptides were detected via anti-puromycin immunoreactivity (<xref rid="figf3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Transfection with native saRNA led to a marked reduction in protein synthesis, consistent with translation shutdown. Co-expression of E3 partially restored translation; however, synthesis rates remained significantly lower than in mock transfected cells, likely due to continued RNase L–mediated depletion of host mRNAs despite relief from translation shutdown. In contrast, transfection with E3-NSs-L* resulted in protein synthesis rates comparable to those of mock-transfected cells, consistent with effective inhibition of RNase L and preservation of host mRNA.</p>
<p>Together, these findings support a model in which RNase L activation by the E3 construct enhances transgene expression through selective depletion of host mRNA, thereby reducing competition for the ribosomal pool.

<title>dsRNA-sensing pathway inhibition suppresses select antiviral cytokines while enhancing others</title>
<p>For therapeutic applications beyond immunotherapy, prolonged transgene expression is ideally achieved without triggering immune activation. While our data show that inhibition of dsRNA-sensing pathways can mitigate key saRNA-induced adverse effects, including cell death, translation shutdown, and host mRNA degradation, it remains unclear whether this strategy also attenuates cytokine secretion.

Transfection with native saRNA elicited a broad cytokine response. Inhibition of dsRNA-sensing pathways selectively suppressed production of certain cytokines: Both E3 and E3-NSs-L* significantly reduced interferon (IFN)-α and IFN-β, while E3-NSs-L* significantly reduced tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Notably, some production of cytokines was elevated: E3 transfection significantly increased macrophage chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and E3-NSs-L* significantly increased granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), relative to mock-transfected controls. These findings indicate that even strong inhibition of dsRNA-sensing pathways only partially attenuates the cytokine response to saRNA.

<p>We then assessed whether ML336 could be used to eliminate the replicon, providing a mechanism to terminate transgene expression after therapeutic goals have been met.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although saRNA is known to disrupt translational control, the precise mechanisms and downstream effects remain incompletely characterized. saRNA-induced translation shutdown is thought to be mediated by phosphorylation of eIF2α,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> mediated by activation of PKR in response to dsRNA replicative intermediates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> Our findings support this model and further show that saRNA reduces eIF4E phosphorylation—a phenomenon previously observed with alphavirus replicons, though its mechanism is not yet fully understood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> Reduced eIF4E phosphorylation suppresses cap-dependent translation initiation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> thereby favouring cap-independent translation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> Together, eIF2α phosphorylation and reduced eIF4E activity likely explain why IRES-driven transgenes achieve higher expression than their cap-dependent counterparts when using native saRNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to disrupting translation initiation, saRNA replication induces host translation shutoff through activation of RNase L. Many viruses exploit host shutoff—the global suppression of host gene expression, as a strategy to redirect cellular resources toward their replication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup> saRNA appears to co-opt this mechanism: RNase L activation depletes host mRNAs without impairing the translation machinery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> However, saRNA transcripts, are largely protected from degradation due to their localization within viral replication organelles known as spherules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>RNase L activity extends beyond transcript degradation. It also cleaves actively translated mRNAs, leading to ribosome stalling at 3’ ends, ribosome collisions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup> activation of the ribotoxic stress response,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup> and ultimately, apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup> PKR likewise contributes to saRNA-induced cytotoxicity and can induce apoptosis independently of eIF2α phosphorylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup> For example, microinjected dsRNA induces apoptosis in a PKR-dependent manner in HeLa cells, with RIG-I and MDA-5 being dispensable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup> Additional studies further support PKR as a central mediator of apoptosis in response to cytosolic dsRNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>These cytotoxic effects are exemplified by the E3 construct, which alleviates translation shutdown but does not inhibit RNase L activation. The resulting depletion in host transcripts reduces ribosomal competition, enhancing saRNA transgene translation—but at the cost of long-term cytotoxicity. This dual-edged effect may make the E3 construct well suited for immunotherapy applications, such as vaccines or cancer therapy, where robust transgene expression and immunogenic cell death are advantageous.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup> In contrast, applications requiring sustained cell viability demand strategies that mitigate both saRNA-induced translation shutdown and RNase L–mediated host shutoff. The E3-NSs-L* construct, which combines broad inhibition of dsRNA-sensing pathways with targeted suppression of PKR and RNase L, effectively protects against the intrinsic cytotoxicity associated with saRNA replication.</p>
<p>While we found that inhibiting dsRNA-sensing pathways was an effective means to reduce saRNA-induced cytotoxicity, it was not effective at preventing saRNA-induced cytokine responses. This agrees with prior reports showing that dsRNA activates NF-κB even in the absence of PKR and RNase L,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup> suggesting that alternative pathways contribute to NF-κB activation. One such mechanism may involve eIF4E, whose activity is governed by its phosphorylation status and serves as a rate-limiting step in cap-dependent protein synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> In this study, we found that saRNA transfection induces a reduction in eIF4E phosphorylation. Reduced eIF4E phosphorylation has been shown to decrease the levels of the short-lived IκBα protein,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup> an inhibitor of NF-κB that sequesters it in the cytoplasm and prevents nuclear translocation. Decreased IκBα levels thus allow NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus, initiating cytokine expression and inflammatory responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>Importantly, while NF-κB is best known for promoting inflammatory cytokine production, it also supports cell survival by inducing anti-apoptotic genes, though its effects vary by tissue type and biological context.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref></sup> In FLS, overexpression of srIκBα reduces cytokine production but increases sensitivity to TNF-induced apoptosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref></sup> consistent with our findings that saRNA encoding srIκBα lowered both cytokine responses and cell viability. This phenomenon is not unique to FLS; NF-κB inhibition with srIκBα also renders liver hepatocytes more susceptible to pro-apoptotic stimuli,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup> raising safety concerns given that RNA delivery systems such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) tend to accumulate in the liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup> Therefore, when designing saRNA constructs for sustained, non-immunostimulatory transgene expression in contexts where apoptosis is undesirable, the use of srIκBα to suppress cytokine responses may require co-expression of anti-apoptotic proteins to offset the loss of NF-κB-mediated survival signalling. In our case, co-expressing Smad7 and SOCS1 restored FLS viability in the presence of srIκBα. While we did not assess the individual contributions of each protein, both are known to have anti-apoptotic properties in certain contexts. Smad7 can inhibit TGF-β-induced apoptosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref></sup> while SOCS1 can suppress apoptosis triggered by IFN-α, IFN-β,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref></sup> IFN-γ,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup> and TNF-α.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref></sup> These anti-apoptotic effects likely enable Smad7 and SOCS1 to mitigate srIκBα-induced reductions in FLS cell viability.</p>
<p>We also found that co-expression of Smad7 and SOCS1 significantly enhanced cap-dependent transgene expression. Although we did not distinguish the contributions of each protein to this effect, it is likely mediated by SOCS1. Previous studies have shown that ruxolitinib, a small-molecule inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and JAK2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref></sup> increases saRNA transgene expression when added to saRNA polyplexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> SOCS1 is an endogenous inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref></sup> therefore, SOCS1 offers a genetically encoded alternative to the small-molecule approach of ruxolitinib for enhancing saRNA expression.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this study presents a straightforward method for controlling saRNA activity. ML336, a VEEV RdRp inhibitor, blocks the synthesis of positive-sense genomic, negative-sense template, and subgenomic RNAs of VEEV without affecting host cellular RNA transcription.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref></sup> It has an <italic>in vitro</italic> effective concentration 50 (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 0.02-0.04 μM, and a 50 mg/kg dose offers 100% protection in a lethal VEEV mouse infection model, with no observed toxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref></sup> Thus, ML336 and other RdRp inhibitors could provide a practical means to deactivate saRNA—either to terminate transgene expression once therapeutic objectives are met or as a safety measure to reduce the risks associated with prolonged innate immune suppression and other potential side effects, including adaptive immune responses to the VEEV replicon or viral innate immune inhibitory proteins.</p>
<p>Preclinical and clinical data show that saRNA vaccines often trigger an intense innate immune response that can hinder antigen expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> Additionally, saRNA vaccines can induce significant inflammation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref></sup> which is increasingly recognized as problematic, as common adverse events include pain, headache, tenderness, arthralgia, fever, and chills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">118</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">119</xref></sup> The approaches described in this study, which reduces the inherent immunostimulatory effects of saRNA replication, could potentially be applied to future saRNA vaccine designs to improve antigen expression and reduce reactogenicity.</p>
<p>The approach in this study also underscores the versatility of the saRNA platform, which can efficiently integrate multiple transgenes and genetic elements. Our largest construct included the VEEV RdRP, two IRES sequences, five 2A peptides, and eight transgenes within a 16.5-kilobase saRNA. Leveraging this capacity for multiple transgenes, we encoded diverse inhibitors of dsRNA-sensing and inflammatory signalling pathways directly within saRNA achieving durable and controllable transgene expression with minimal cytotoxicity and immunostimulation. This approach eliminates the need for exogenous immune suppressants—a common requirement in other studies utilizing saRNA for non-immunotherapy applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> By localizing immune suppression to transfected cells, this approach reduces treatment complexity and minimizes the risk of systemic immunosuppression.</p>
<p>Expressing multiple transgenes may also be a useful strategy for developing novel therapeutics. The NF-κB, TGF-β, and JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways are central to the progression of osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">122</xref></sup> The srIκBα-Smad7-SOCS1 saRNA construct provides a novel strategy to simultaneously target these pathways: srIκBα inhibits NF-κB, Smad7 blocks TGF-β, and SOCS1 suppresses the JAK/STAT pathway. Each of these proteins has been independently studied as a treatment for osteoarthritis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">123</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">125</xref></sup> and their combination within a single construct could represent a synergistic strategy to enhance therapeutic efficacy. While arthritogenic alphaviruses such as chikungunya virus and Ross river virus can drive inflammatory responses in FLS, including upregulation of secreted proteolytic molecules such as matrix metalloproteases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">126</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">127</xref></sup> the lack of FAP-α upregulation in transfected FLS provides some evidence that saRNA transfection does not trigger comparable responses. Moreover, the reduction in basal FAP-α levels observed with the srIκBα and srIκBα-Smad7-SOCS1 constructs raises the possibility that saRNA could serve as a tool for suppressing fibroblast activation in inflammatory settings. This approach could hold therapeutic potential in arthritis treatment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">128</xref></sup> warranting further investigation in disease models.</p>
<p>Our findings present a fully saRNA-based strategy that addresses a central limitation of the platform: innate immune activation driven by replicon activity. By encoding proteins that inhibit both dsRNA-sensing pathways and NF-κB signalling directly within the saRNA—expressed via cap-independent translation— we achieved broad suppression of innate immune responses. This approach enabled sustained transgene expression with minimal cytotoxicity and antiviral cytokine release, eliminating the need for exogenous immunosuppressants. Furthermore, the use of ML336 enables on-demand regulation or reversal of transgene expression, enhancing both the safety and versatility of this approach. Given the established success of saRNA in preclinical models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and approved human vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">119</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">129</xref></sup> we anticipate that this immune-evasive saRNA strategy will be readily translatable to future <italic>in vivo</italic> studies.</p>
<p>However, the inclusion of multiple viral proteins introduces additional challenges. <italic>In vivo</italic>, saRNA constructs must contend not only with intrinsic cytotoxic mechanisms but also with adaptive immune responses that drive extrinsic cytotoxicity. Co-expression of several viral proteins, along with the VEEV RdRp, increases the likelihood that viral peptides will be presented on major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. This, in turn, is expected to promote recognition and elimination of saRNA-transfected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, thereby limiting therapeutic durability. Overcoming both intrinsic and immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity will be essential for achieving long-term persistence of saRNA-transfected cells and realizing the platform’s full therapeutic potential.</p>
<p>In addition to characterizing the fate of saRNA-transfected cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, future studies should evaluate the biodistribution of immune-evasive saRNA. While mRNA-LNPs typically target the liver and induce strong hepatic expression, saRNA-LNPs, despite similar biodistribution, show little to no expression in the liver and instead exhibit significant expression in the spleen, lungs, and muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">130</xref></sup>. This is likely due to differences in innate immune responses to mRNA versus the cytosolic dsRNA intermediates generated by saRNA. Accordingly, the immune-evasive strategy described here, which disrupts innate immune sensing of dsRNA, is likely to influence the biodistribution and expression profile of saRNA constructs, potentially resulting in unanticipated secondary effects. Further investigation into the <italic>in vivo</italic> fate and biodistribution of these constructs will be essential for optimizing their safety and efficacy across diverse clinical applications. Ultimately, continued refinement of immune-evasive saRNA constructs and delivery strategies will be crucial for achieving safe, sustained, reversible, and clinically viable saRNA-based gene therapies.</p>

<title>Experimental Design</title>
<p>This study was designed to develop and evaluate saRNA constructs capable of suppressing multiple innate immune pathways—specifically dsRNA-sensing and inflammatory signalling—to mitigate saRNA-induced immunotoxicities such as translation shutdown, cytotoxicity, mRNA degradation, and cytokine release. The overarching goal was to enable sustained transgene expression suitable for non-immunotherapeutic applications of saRNA, without the need for exogenous immunosuppressants.</p>
<p>To this end, we engineered saRNA constructs that co-express multiple immune-modulatory proteins, including viral inhibitors of dsRNA-sensing pathways and cellular inhibitors of inflammatory signalling. In addition, constructs were designed to enable simultaneous monitoring of cap-dependent and cap-independent translation via distinct fluorescent protein reporters.</p>
<p>The experimental workflow involved molecular cloning of the saRNA constructs, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription, and transfection into primary mouse FLS. Transfected cells were assessed using fluorescence-based microplate assays to evaluate cell number, viability, phosphatidylserine exposure, and reporter protein expression. Further analyses comprised in-cell western assays for translational regulators and FLS activation markers, SUnSET assay for protein synthesis rates, capillary electrophoresis for rRNA integrity, and bead-based immunoassays for cytokine secretion. Finally, the potential for small-molecule regulation of transgene expression was tested using an antiviral compound that inhibits the VEEV RdRp.</p>

<title>Plasmid cloning and construct design</title>
<p>The commercially available TagGFP2 E3L Simplicon vector (SCR725, Merck) served as the saRNA backbone in this study. After removal of the TagGFP2-IRES-E3 sequence, various constructs were generated by combining different elements using restriction digests (FastDigest, Thermo Scientific), overlap extension PCR (Phusion, Thermo Scientific), and HiFi assembly (NEBuilder, New England Biolabs).</p>
<p>Genetic elements were sourced as follows: mScarlet3 from pDx_mScarlet3 (a gift from Dorus Gadella [Addgene plasmid #189754]),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">131</xref></sup> IRES-EGFP from pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech), and IRES-E3 and IRES-PuroR (puromycin resistance) from the original TagGFP2 E3L Simplicon vector.</p>
<p>Custom gene synthesis (GeneArt, Thermo Scientific) was used to produce IRES-moxBFP, IRES-E3-T2A-NSs-P2A-L*-E2A-mEGFP, and IRES-srIкBα-P2A-Smad7-T2A-SOCS1 sequences. The IRES sequence was derived from pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech). Other sequences were obtained from public databases: moxBFP (FPbase ID: SSTDU),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">132</xref></sup> mEGFP (FPbase ID: QKFJN), E3 (UniProt: P21605-1), NSs (UniProt: P21699), L* (UniProt: P0DJX4), Smad7 (UniProt: O35253-1), and SOCS1 (UniProt: O35716). srIкBα was engineered from IкBα (UniProt: Q9Z1E3) by substituting serines 32 and 36 with alanines.

<title>RNA synthesis</title>
<p>Plasmids were linearized with XbaI (FastDigest, Thermo Scientific) at 37 °C for 3 hours. The linear plasmids were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by sodium acetate-ethanol precipitation. Uncapped RNA was synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic> using the T7 RiboMAX Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega) at 37 °C for 2 hours. After purification by ammonium acetate precipitation, the RNA was denatured by heating to 65 °C for 5 minutes before rapidly cooling on ice. Cap-1 structures were then generated using the Vaccinia Capping System in conjunction with mRNA cap 2’-O-methyltransferase (both from New England Biolabs) for 45 minutes at 37 °C. Following another round of ammonium acetate precipitation, the RNA was treated with Antarctic phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 30 minutes at 37 °C. After a final ammonium acetate precipitation, RNA was resuspended in THE RNA Storage Solution (Invitrogen). RNA concentration was quantified using an N60 NanoPhotometer (Implen) and adjusted to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/μL. RNA was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C until further use.</p>
<p>The integrity of the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA was assessed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis (Supplemental Figure S6c). Constructs designed to inhibit dsRNA-sensing pathways (native saRNA, E3, and E3-NSs-L*) produced a single band at the expected size. In contrast, constructs targeting inflammatory signalling (moxBFP, srIκBα, and srIκBα-Smad7-SOCS1) displayed two bands: one corresponding to the full-length transcript, and a smaller, low-intensity band of consistent size across all three constructs (Supplemental Figure S6d).

<title>Mouse primary FLS culture</title>
<p>All mice used in this study were 5-to 12-week-old wildtype C57BL/6J mice (Envigo, Bicester, UK). Both male and female mice were included, though sex differences in response to saRNA transfection were not analyzed. Mice were housed in groups of up to five in a temperature-controlled room (21 °C), with bedding, a red shelter, and enrichment materials provided. They were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle, with food and water available ad libitum. Mice were euthanized by exposure to CO<sub>2</sub> gas in a rising concentration, and death confirmed by dislocation of the atlanto-occipital joint by applying pressure to the side of the neck using thumb and forefinger, procedures in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 Amendment Regulations 2012.</p>
<p>We cultured FLS from mouse knee joints following established protocols,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">135</xref></sup> with slight modifications. In brief, knee joints were exposed by cutting through the overlying skin with dissecting scissors. The patellar tendon was then grasped near the patella with Dumont tweezers, and spring scissors were used to sever the patellar tendon along with surrounding tissues. Finally, the patella was excised by cutting the quadriceps tendon, and excess muscle and tendons were carefully trimmed away.</p>
<p>Both patellae from each animal were collected into a microcentrifuge tube containing ice-cold sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS), then transferred to a 24-well tissue culture plate (Costar) with FLS culture media. The media consisted of DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 25% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1X GlutaMAX (Gibco), and 100 μg/ml Primocin (InvivoGen).</p>
<p>The patellae were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2, with media changes every 1-2 days. FLS outgrowth was observed, and after approximately 10 days, when cells reached 70% confluency, the patellae were transferred to new wells for further FLS collection. Cells attached to the original wells were passaged using 0.1% trypsin-EDTA (Sigma) into a single well of a 6-well plate (Costar). Cells were later expanded into T25 flasks (BioLite, Thermo Scientific or CELLSTAR, Greiner Bio-One) and passaged upon reaching confluency. After the second passage, Versene solution (Gibco) was used for cell dissociation.</p>
<p>FLS were used between passages 3 and 8. In most experiments, cells from the same animal were divided and plated onto 6-well or 24-well plates, allowing for parallel manipulations with matched conditions. Occasionally, when cell number was low, cells from different animals were pooled before plating. Once plated for experiments, media was changed every 2–3 days.</p>

In a separate tube, 3 μl of Lipofectamine MessengerMAX (Invitrogen) was diluted in 100 μl of Opti-MEM I. After gentle mixing, the solutions were combined and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes, then added dropwise to the cells.

<p>Black glass-bottom 6-well plates (P06-1.5H-N, Cellvis) or 24-well plates (662892, Greiner Bio-one) were used for microplate imaging. Prior to imaging, the FLS media was replaced with Live Cell Imaging Solution (Invitrogen).

<p>EGFP, mScarlet3, and BioTracker NIR680 were imaged using the 488, 520, and 700 channels, respectively. Spectral cross-excitation between EGFP and mScarlet3 in the 488 and 520 channels was corrected through linear unmixing analysis, as described below. Fluorescence intensity was quantified in ImageJ by measuring the integrated density within equal-area regions of interest for each well.</p>

<title>Linear unmixing analysis</title>
<p>saRNA constructs encoding individual fluorescent proteins (moxBFP, EGFP, or mScarlet3) were designed to assess cross-excitation among the fluorescent proteins used in this study. tSA201 cells (96121229, ECACC) were seeded in black glass-bottom 6-well plates coated with poly-D-lysine (Sigma) and transfected with the respective saRNA constructs.

<p>Expression of moxBFP was undetectable in both the 488 and 520 channels, and therefore it was excluded from further analysis. Bleed-through of EGFP into the 520 channel and mScarlet3 into the 488 channel was quantified using ImageJ, with cross-excitation determined to be 11.32% and 0.94%, respectively.

<p>FLS were stained with BioTracker NIR680 and plated on black glass-bottom 24-well plates (Sensoplate, Greiner Bio-One). Cells were transfected with saRNA or treated with 0.5 μM staurosporine (Cayman Chemical) as a positive control.</p>
<p>Annexin V-CF800 conjugate (Biotium) was diluted to 250 ng/ml in Live Cell Imaging Solution (Invitrogen).

<p>Image analysis was performed using ImageJ. To correct for unidirectional spectral bleed-through of BioTracker NIR680 into the 800-channel, subtractive compensation was applied by dividing the 700-channel image by a factor of 800 and then subtracting it from the 800-channel image. Due to the presence of a small number of high-intensity speckles in the 800-channel image, area rather than fluorescence intensity was quantified. The display range of the 800-channel image was set between 0.25 and 2.5, and the image was thresholded using the method of Li.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">136</xref></sup> The area of thresholded pixels within each well was then quantified and adjusted based on the BioTracker signal before transfection to account for variations in cell number.

<title>Calcein AM staining</title>
<p>Calcein AM (Invitrogen) staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Following three washes, cells were imaged in Live Cell Imaging Solution, and the 488-channel image was captured using an Odyssey M imager.</p>
<p>Although calcein AM and EGFP have overlapping spectra, calcein AM fluorescence was typically much higher than EGFP, making EGFP’s contribution to the measured Calcein AM signal negligible in most cases. However, when the E3 construct was used, EGFP expression was sufficient to interfere with the signal.

<caption><title>Blocking dsRNA-sensing pathways or saRNA replication inhibits saRNA-induced cell loss.</title> <p><bold>a,</bold> AUC analysis of BioTracker fluorescence data shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>, summarizing cumulative effects over the time course (n = 11 biological replicates). Increasing dsRNA-sensing pathway inhibition prevents saRNA-induced reductions in integrated BioTracker signal. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way RM ANOVA with Greenhouse–Geisser correction and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test to compare all groups. Mock transfection data is also presented in Supplemental Figure S5a. <bold>b,</bold> Quantification of mock transfection normalized CellTag signal (n = 29 biological replicates). Increasing dsRNA-sensing pathway inhibition mitigates saRNA-induced reductions in CellTag signal. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way RM ANOVA with Greenhouse–Geisser correction and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test to compare all groups. Assays were performed 2 days post-transfection. Data in this panel were pooled from in-cell western assays, incorporating data presented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="figf3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, and additional data not shown elsewhere. <bold>c,</bold> Quantification of calcein AM viability dye signal before and one day after transfection with native saRNA or mock transfection, with or without the RdRp inhibitor ML336 (n = 4 biological replicates). Transfection with native saRNA reduced cell viability, an effect that was prevented by co-treatment with ML336. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with Greenhouse– Geisser correction, followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test relative to the mock-transfected, vehicle-treated group. For all statistical reporting, *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001 and ****P &lt; 0.0001. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.</p></caption>

<caption><title>The E3-NSs-L* construct protects against saRNA-induced PKR upregulation, RNA degradation, and reduced global protein synthesis.</title> <p><bold>a,</bold> PKR levels examined day 2 post-transfection by in-cell western assay (n = 4 biological replicates). E3-NSs-L* significantly reduced PKR levels compared to both native saRNA and E3 transfection. Data are presented as fold-change relative to mock-transfected cells. Statistical significance was determined by one-way RM ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. <bold>b,</bold> rRNA integrity of FLS transfected with E3-NSs-L* is significantly higher than that of E3-transfected FLS (n = 5 biological replicates). rRNA integrity was assessed using the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) algorithm, which ranges from 1 to 10, with 10 indicating fully intact rRNA. Total RNA was extracted from FLS 1 day post-transfection. Data are shown as a Gardner-Altman comparison plot, with the right panel illustrating the mean effect size ± 95% CI. Statistical significance was assessed using a paired t-test (P = 0.0054). Dotted lines indicate group means. <bold>c,</bold> Translation rates were assessed two days post-transfection by measuring puromycin incorporation by in-cell western assay (n = 5 biological replicates). Transfection with native saRNA or the E3 construct significantly reduced the rate of protein synthesis, whereas the E3-NSs-L* construct had no effect. Statistical significance was determined by one-way repeated-measures ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. Statistical significance is indicated as follows: *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001, and ****P &lt; 0.0001.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Select cytokines show variable responses to dsRNA-sensing pathway inhibition following saRNA transfection.</title> <p><bold>a-m,</bold> FLS were transfected with the saRNA constructs described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> or mock transfected. Cell culture supernatants were collected two days post-transfection, and cytokine levels were quantified by bead-based immunoassay and normalized to cell number using the BioTracker signal measured on day 0 (n = 6 biological replicates). Native saRNA triggered robust secretion of multiple antiviral cytokines. Co-expression of viral innate immune inhibitors reduced some cytokine responses and enhanced others. Both E3 and E3-NSs-L* significantly reduced secretion of IFN-α and IFN-β, and E3-NSs-L* additionally suppressed TNF. In contrast, E3 increased MCP-1, and E3-NSs-L* increased GM-CSF levels relative to native saRNA. Statistical significance was assessed using one-way repeated-measures ANOVA for each cytokine. Multiple comparisons were controlled using the Benjamini–Krieger–Yekutieli false discovery rate (FDR) procedure (Q = 5%). All cytokines passed the discovery threshold.

<caption><title>Reduced antiviral gene expression and replicon activity observed with co-expression of inflammatory signalling inhibitors.</title> <p><bold>a,</bold> Antiviral and proinflammatory transcripts were quantified by qPCR 2 days post-transfection (n = 3 biological replicates).

Expression was normalized to <italic>18S</italic> rRNA, and data are shown as ΔCT values. FLS transfected with the srIκBα-Smad7-SOCS1 construct had higher ΔCT values (indicating lower EGFP transcript levels) compared to those transfected with native saRNA or the E3 construct. Statistical comparisons were performed on ΔCT values using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. <bold>c,</bold> In vitro transcribed saRNA constructs were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Native saRNA (11,181 nt), E3 (11,030 nt), and E3-NSs-L* (12,562 nt) migrated as single bands corresponding to their expected sizes. In contrast, the moxBFP (13,282 nt), srIκBα (13,614 nt), and srIκBα-Smad7-SOCS1 (15,664 nt) constructs each exhibited two bands: one at the expected size and a smaller lower intensity band of consistent size across all three constructs, suggestive of a common truncated transcript. <bold>d,</bold> Band intensity plots of moxBFP, srIκBα and srIκBα-Smad7-SOCS1 derived from the gel shown in panel (c).</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have developed self-amplifying RNAs (saRNAs) encoding additional genes to suppress dsRNA-related inflammatory responses and cytokine release. Their results demonstrate that saRNA constructs encoding anti-inflammatory genes effectively reduce cytotoxicity and cytokine production, enhancing the potential of saRNAs. This work is significant for advancing saRNA therapeutics by mitigating unintended immune activation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study successfully demonstrates the concept of enhancing saRNA applications by encoding immune-suppressive genes. A key challenge for saRNA-based therapeutics, particularly for non-vaccine applications, is the innate immune response triggered by dsRNA recognition. By leveraging viral protein properties to suppress immunity, the authors provide a novel strategy to overcome this limitation. The study presents a well-designed approach with potential implications for improving saRNA stability and minimizing inflammatory side effects.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Context - this is the 2nd review, of a manuscript that has already undergone some revisions.</p>
<p>
The manuscript explores ways to make self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) more silent through the inclusion of genes to inhibit the innate immune response. The readouts are predominantly expression and cell viability. They take a layered approach, adding multiple genes, as well as altering the capping of the anti-immune genes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>As described by the other reviewers, the authors take a stepwise approach to demonstrate that they can lead to sustained expression of the transgene.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The following weaknesses need some consideration</p>
<p>(1) The data show sustained expression, but do not directly show amplification. The amount of RFP is constantly decreasing over the time course. There is some evidence for the srIκBα-Smad7-SOCS1 construct. But measuring the RNA itself would be beneficial</p>
<p>
(2) The end construct is very large - it has 12 genes, this may have manufacturing considerations, affecting the translatability.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have developed self-amplifying RNAs (saRNAs) encoding additional genes to suppress dsRNA-related inflammatory responses and cytokine release. Their results demonstrate that saRNA constructs encoding anti-inflammatory genes effectively reduce cytotoxicity and cytokine production, enhancing the potential of saRNAs. This work is significant for advancing saRNA therapeutics by mitigating unintended immune activation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study successfully demonstrates the concept of enhancing saRNA applications by encoding immune-suppressive genes. A key challenge for saRNA-based therapeutics, particularly for non-vaccine applications, is the innate immune response triggered by dsRNA recognition. By leveraging viral protein properties to suppress immunity, the authors provide a novel strategy to overcome this limitation. The study presents a well-designed approach with potential implications for improving saRNA stability and minimizing inflammatory side effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer #1 for their thorough review and for recognizing both the significance of our work and the potential of our strategy to expand saRNA applications beyond vaccines.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Impact on Cellular Translation:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that modified saRNAs with additional components enhance transgene expression by inhibiting dsRNA-sensing pathways. However, it is unclear whether these modifications influence global cellular translation beyond the expression of GFP and mScarlet-3 (which are encoded by the saRNA itself). Conducting a polysome profiling analysis or a puromycin labeling assay would clarify whether the modified saRNAs alter overall translation efficiency. This additional data would strengthen the conclusions regarding the specificity of dsRNA-sensing inhibition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for this insightful suggestion. We performed a puromycin labeling assay to assess global translation rates (Figure 3—figure supplement 1c). This experiment revealed that the E3 construct significantly reduces global protein synthesis, despite driving high levels of saRNAencoded transgene expression (Figure 1d, e). In contrast, the E3-NSs-L* construct mitigated this reduction in global translation while maintaining moderate transgene expression. These findings support our hypothesis that E3 enhances transgene output in part by activating RNase L, which degrades host mRNAs and thereby reduces ribosomal competition. We appreciate the Reviewer’s recommendation of this experiment, which has strengthened the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Stability and Replication Efficiency of Long saRNA Constructs:</p>
<p>The saRNA constructs used in this study exceed 16 kb, making them more fragile and challenging to handle. Assessing their mRNA integrity and quality would be crucial to ensure their robustness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the replicative capacity of the designed saRNAs should be confirmed. Since Figure 4 shows lower inflammatory cytokine production when encoding srIkBα and srIkBαSmad7-SOCS1, it is important to determine whether this effect is due to reduced immune activation or impaired replication. Providing data on replication efficiency and expression levels of the encoded anti-inflammatory proteins would help rule out the possibility that reduced cytokine production is a consequence of lower replication.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for these valuable suggestions.</p>
<p>To assess the integrity of the saRNA constructs, we performed denaturing gel electrophoresis (Supplemental Figure 6c). The native saRNA, E3, and E3-NSs-L* constructs each migrated as a single band. The moxBFP, srIκBα, and srIκBα-Smad7-SOCS1 constructs showed both a full-length transcript and a lower-abundance truncated band (Supplemental Figure 6d), suggestive of a cryptic terminator sequence introduced in a region common to these three constructs.</p>
<p>To evaluate replicative capacity, we performed qPCR targeting EGFP, which is encoded by all constructs. This analysis revealed that the srIκBα-Smad7-SOCS1 construct exhibited lower replication efficiency than both native saRNA and E3. Several factors may contribute to this difference, including the longer transcript length, reduced molar input when equal mass was used for transfection, prevention of host mRNA degradation due to RNase L inhibition, or the presence of truncated transcripts.</p>
<p>Given these confounding variables, we revised our approach to analyzing cytokine production. Rather than comparing all six constructs together, we split the analysis into two parts: (1) the effects of dsRNA-sensing pathway inhibition (Figure 4a), and (2) the effects of inflammatory signalling inhibition (Figure 4c). For the latter, we compared srIκBα and srIκBα-Smad7-SOCS1 to moxBFP, as these three constructs are more comparable in size, share the same truncated transcript, and all encode L* to inhibit RNase L. This strategy minimizes the likelihood that differences in the cytokine responses are due to variation in replication efficiency.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Comparative Data with Native saRNA:</p>
<p>Including native saRNA controls in Figures 5-7 would allow for a clearer assessment of the impact of additional genes on cytokine production. This comparison would help distinguish the effect of the encoded suppressor proteins from other potential factors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for this helpful suggestion. We have added the native saRNA condition to Figure 5 as a visual reference. However, due to the presence of truncated transcripts in the constructs designed to inhibit inflammatory signalling pathways, the actual amount of full-length saRNA delivered in these conditions is likely lower than expected, despite using equal total RNA mass for transfection. This complicates direct comparisons with constructs targeting dsRNAsensing pathways, which do not show transcript truncation. For this reason, native saRNA was included only as a visual reference and was not used in statistical comparisons with the inflammatory signalling inhibitor constructs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In vivo Validation and Safety Considerations:</p>
<p>Have the authors considered evaluating the in vivo potential of these saRNA constructs? Conducting animal studies would provide stronger evidence for their therapeutic applicability. If in vivo experiments have not been performed, discussing potential challenges - such as saRNA persistence, biodistribution, and possible secondary effectswould be valuable.</p>
<p>(5) Immune Response to Viral Proteins:</p>
<p>Since the inhibitors of dsRNA-sensing proteins (E3, NSs, and L*) are viral proteins, they would be expected to induce an immune response. Analyzing these effects in vivo would add insight into the applicability of this approach.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s points regarding in vivo validation and safety considerations. While in vivo studies are beyond the scope of the present investigation, we agree that evaluating therapeutic potential, biodistribution, persistence, and secondary effects will be essential for future translation. We have now included a brief discussion of these considerations at the end of the revised discussion. In ongoing work, we are planning follow-up studies incorporating in vivo imaging and functional assessments of saRNA-driven cargo delivery in preclinical models of inflammatory joint pain.</p>
<p>Regarding the immune response to viral proteins, we agree that this is an important consideration and have now included a clearer discussion of this limitation in the revised manuscript. Specifically, we highlight that encoding multiple viral inhibitors (E3, NSs, and L*), in combination with the VEEV replicase, may increase the likelihood of adaptive immune recognition via MHC class I presentation. This could lead to cytotoxic T cell–mediated clearance of saRNA-transfected cells, thereby limiting therapeutic durability. We emphasize that addressing both intrinsic cytotoxicity and immune-mediated clearance will be essential for advancing the clinical potential of this platform.</p>

<p>(6) Streamlining the Discussion Section:</p>
<p>The discussion is quite lengthy. To improve readability, some content - such as the rationale for gene selection-could be moved to the Results section. Additionally, the descriptions of Figure 3 should be consolidated into a single section under a broader heading for improved coherence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for these helpful suggestions. We have streamlined the Discussion to improve readability and have moved the rationale for gene selection to the results section, as recommended. In addition, we have consolidated the Figure 3 descriptions to improve coherence and to simplify the presentation.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Lim et al. have developed a self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) design that incorporates immunomodulatory viral proteins, and show that the novel design results in enhanced protein expression in vitro in mouse primary fibroblast-like synoviocytes. They test constructs including saRNA with the vaccinia virus E3 protein and another with E3, Toscana virus NS protein and Theiler's virus L protein (E3 + NS + L), and another with srIκBα-Smad7SOCS1. They have also tested whether ML336, an antiviral, enables control of transgene expression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments are generally well-designed and offer mechanistic insight into the RNAsensing pathways that confer enhanced saRNA expression. The experiments are carried out over a long timescale, which shows the enhance effect of the saRNA E3 design compared to the control. Furthermore, the inhibitors are shown to maintain the cell number, and reduce basal activation factor-⍺ levels.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer #2 for their thoughtful and detailed assessment of our manuscript, and for recognizing the mechanistic insights provided by our study. We also appreciate their positive comments on the experimental design, the extended timescale, and the observed effects on transgene expression, cell viability, and basal fibroblast activation factor-α levels.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One limitation of this manuscript is that the RNA is not well characterized; some of the constructs are quite long and the RNA integrity has not been analyzed. Furthermore, for constructs with multiple proteins, it's imperative to confirm the expression of each protein to confirm that any therapeutic effect is from the effector protein (e.g. E3, NS, L). The ML336 was only tested at one concentration; it is standard in the field to do a dose-response curve. These experiments were all done in vitro in mouse cells, thus limiting the conclusion we can make about mechanisms in a human system.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your detailed feedback. We have added new experiments and clarified limitations in the revised manuscript to address these concerns:</p>
<p>RNA integrity: We performed denaturing gel electrophoresis on the in vitro transcribed saRNA constructs (Supplemental Figure 7c). Constructs targeting dsRNA-sensing pathways migrated as a single band, while those targeting inflammatory signalling pathways showed both a full-length product and a common, lower-abundance truncated transcript. This suggests that the actual amount of full-length RNA delivered for the constructs inhibiting inflammatory signalling was overestimated. To account for this, we avoided direct comparisons between the two types of constructs and instead focused on comparisons within each type to ensure more meaningful interpretation.</p>
<p>Confirmation of protein expression: While we acknowledge that direct measurement of each protein would provide additional insight, we believe the functional assays presented offer strong evidence that the encoded proteins are expressed and exert their intended biological effects. Additionally, IRES functionality was confirmed visually using fluorescent protein reporters, supporting the successful expression of downstream genes.</p>
<p>ML336 concentration–response: We have now performed a concentration–response analysis for ML336 (Figure 8a and b), which demonstrates its ability to modulate transgene expression in a concentration-dependent manner.</p>
<p>Use of human cells: We agree that testing these constructs in human cells is essential for future translational applications and are actively exploring opportunities to evaluate them in patientderived FLS. However, previous studies have shown that Theiler’s virus L* does not inhibit human RNase L (Sorgeloos et al., PLoS Pathog 2013). As a result, it is highly likely that the E3-NSs-L* construct will not function as intended in human systems. Addressing this limitation will be a priority in our future work, where we aim to develop constructs incorporating inhibitors specific to human RNase L to ensure efficacy in human cells.</p>

<p>(2) The impact of this paper would be greatly improved if these experiments were repeated, at least partially, in human cells. The rationale for mouse cells in vitro is unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The rationale for developing constructs targeting mouse cells is based on our intention to utilize these constructs in mouse models of inflammatory joint pain in future studies.</p>
<p>We recognize that incorporating data from human cells would significantly enhance the translational relevance of our work, and we are actively pursuing collaborations to test these constructs in patient-derived FLS. However, a key component of our saRNA constructs—Theiler’s virus L*—has been shown to inhibit mouse, but not human, RNase L (Sorgeloos et al., PLoS Pathog 2013). Consequently, the E3-NSs-L* polyprotein may not function as intended in human cells. To address this limitation, future work will focus on developing constructs that incorporate inhibitors specific to human RNase L, thereby facilitating more effective translation of our findings to human systems.</p>

<p>(3) The ML336 was only tested at one concentration and works mildly well, but would be more impactful if tested in a dose-response curve.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now performed a concentration–response analysis for ML336 (Figure 8a and b), which demonstrates its concentration-dependent effects on transgene expression and saRNA elimination. Thank you for the suggestion.</p>

<p>(4) Overall, there is not a cohesive narrative to the story, instead it comes off as we tried these three different approaches, and they worked in different contexts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the graphical abstract, results, and discussion to improve the cohesiveness of the manuscript’s narrative and to better integrate the mechanistic rationale linking the different approaches. We appreciate the feedback.</p>

<p>(5) The title is not supported by the data; the saRNA is still somewhat cytotoxic, immunostimulatory and the antiviral minimally controls transgene expression; suggest making this reflect the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the title to better reflect the scope of the data and the mechanistic focus of the study. The updated title emphasizes the pathways targeted and the outcomes demonstrated, while avoiding overstatement. Thank you for this helpful recommendation.</p>
