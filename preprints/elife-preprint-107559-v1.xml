<abstract><p>Life history traits are all essential traits linked to development, survival and reproduction, directly influencing individual fitness. Limited environmental or physiological resources force organisms to balance competing demands, leading to fundamental trade-offs, particularly between survival and reproduction. Male aggression often enhances reproductive success by improving resource acquisition and mate competition. However, the broader impact of high levels of aggression on individual overall fitness and life-history trade-offs remains poorly understood. To address this, we used the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster Bully</italic> line, derived from wild-type flies (<italic>Canton-S</italic> line) through artificial selection for high levels of male aggression, and assess whether increased aggressiveness influences male life-history traits. Our results reveal that increased male aggressiveness shifts the balance of a major life-history trade-off, favoring survival over reproductive success. <italic>Bully</italic> males exhibited lower mating success, shorter mating duration and less effective chemical mate-guarding. However, this was traded-off with increased lifespan, enabling more reproductive opportunities. We also uncover potential mechanistic underpinnings of the reproductive deficits. <italic>Bully</italic> males showed differences in their cuticular hydrocarbon (CHCs) profiles and transferred lower levels of cVA to females, a mate-guarding pheromone, thereby weakening their post-mating strategy. Overall, our findings demonstrate that selection for male aggression profoundly influence a key life-history trade-off highlighting aggression as an evolutionary force shaping adaptation of life-history traits and providing a foundation for future genetic and mechanistic studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Life history traits, such as development time, fertility, survival, and reproductive success, are key phenotypic components that directly influence individual fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Braendle and Paaby, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Roff, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Stearns, 1992</xref>). These traits often face trade-offs: investing in one can compromise another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fisher, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Stearns, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Williams, 1966</xref>). For instance, high reproductive effort may reduce survival due to the energetic costs of gamete production or increased mortality associated with mating behaviors or competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Flatt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">2020</xref>). Trade-offs also emerge between pre- and post-copulatory strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Simmons, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Warner et al., 1995</xref>). Males prioritizing pre-copulatory investment, such as aggressive competition for mates, may have limited resources for post-copulatory mechanisms, including sperm competition or mate guarding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andersson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brennan and Orbach, 2021</xref>). Understanding how such trade-offs are shaped by natural selection offers insight into how organisms optimize fitness in competitive social environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Roff, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Stearns, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster (D. mel.)</italic>, provides a powerful model for studying life-history trade-offs, with well-characterized developmental, behavioral, and reproductive traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Flatt, 2020</xref>). These traits are shaped by both genetic and environmental factors and can evolve under ecological pressures. Faster development, earlier reproduction and high mating rate, for instance, are advantageous in changing environments but come at the cost of reduced longevity and fecundity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Partridge and Farquhar, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Stearns, 2000</xref>). Experimental manipulations of environmental conditions such as temperature and food availability reveal how external factors shape trade-offs between survival and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chippindale et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Marshall and Sinclair, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond development and fecundity, <italic>D. mel.</italic> serves as a model to study a wide range of social behaviors, including aggregation, aggression, and courtship, that are largely mediated by chemical communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kohl et al., 2015</xref>). Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) and pheromones play diverse roles in social interaction: 7-Tricosene (7-T), a male-specific compound, increases female receptivity and modulates aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Grillet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wang et al., 2011</xref>); cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), a male-transferred pheromone, attracts females, repels other males, and promotes aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kurtovic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Laturney and Billeter, 2016</xref>); and the female-specific hydrocarbon 7,11-heptacosadiene (7,11-HD) strongly elicits male courtship and supports species-specific mate recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Toda et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Among these interactions, male-male competition plays a central role in shaping reproductive strategies. Pre-copulatory competition involves resource defense, courtship displays, and aggressive interactions to secure mating opportunities. Courtship in <italic>Drosophila</italic> includes stereotyped behaviors such as orientation, wing extensions (producing courtship song), tapping, licking, and attempted copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Yamamoto and Koganezawa, 2013</xref>). Successful courtship displays lead to female acceptance, outcompeting other males that fail to meet the female’s preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baxter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hindmarsh Sten et al., 2025</xref>). Aggression intensifies this competition: more aggressive or dominant males often monopolize access to females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dow and von Schilcher, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Filice and Dukas, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gao et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Nandy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Prunier and Trannoy, 2024</xref>). Aggressive behaviors range from wing threats and lunging to high-intensity physical confrontations like tussling and boxing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). These behaviors promote territorial dominance and enhance mating success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gao et al., 2024</xref>), although subordinate males may also achieve reproductive success through first access to females and prolonged copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Filice and Dukas, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Post-copulatory competition further shapes male reproductive success. After mating, males use multiple strategies to ensure paternity, including the transfer of seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) including Sex Peptide (SP) and Accessory gland proteins (Acps), which promote sperm storage, stimulate oviposition, and reduce female receptivity to further mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chapman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Fricke et al., 2009</xref>). These factors also contribute to the formation of a mating plug that retains sperm, acting as a passive mate-guarding strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Avila et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dunham and Rudolf, 2009</xref>). In parallel, chemical mate guarding via pheromone transfer (e.g. cVA and 7-T) reduce female attractiveness and their likelihood of re-mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Billeter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gillott, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Laturney and Billeter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Miyamoto and Amrein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Scott, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zawistowski and Richmond, 1986</xref>). Male reproductive behavior is plastic: in the presence of rivals, males extend their mating duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bretman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bretman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kim et al., 2013</xref>), increase the number of sperm in their ejaculate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Garbaczewska et al., 2013</xref>), adapt seminal fuids content in their ejaculate(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hopkins et al., 2019</xref>), and present higher levels of aggression toward opponents to guard their mates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baxter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bretman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dore et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Mazzi et al., 2009</xref>). Together, this demonstrate that male-male aggression influences access to mates and reproductive outcomes through both pre- and post-copulatory competition.</p>
<p>While aggression can enhance male mating success in natural settings, the relationship between aggression and reproductive fitness is not always straightforward. In a previous study, Penn et al.( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Penn et al., 2010</xref>) developed “<italic>Bully</italic>” males through 37 generations of selection for aggression originating from a <italic>Canton-S</italic> (<italic>Cs</italic>) background. These hyper-aggressive males frequently escalated to boxing, the most intense aggression phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chowdhury et al., 2017</xref>), but showed reduced reproductive success with virgin females compared to unselected control males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Penn et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that although aggression may enhance competitive ability, it can also incur fitness costs. This raises important questions about the role of aggression in shaping life-history trade-offs, such as: to what extent does aggression influence life history traits related to reproduction, and does it affect the balance reproduction vs survival?</p>
<p>To address these questions, we investigated whether <italic>D. mel.</italic> males from the <italic>Bully</italic> line exhibit changes in life-history trade-offs compared to the unselected starting wild-type flies (<italic>Cs</italic> lines). We found that hyper-aggressive <italic>Bully</italic> males show reduced reproductive success and shorter mating duration across their lifespan, indicating lower pre-copulatory success. They also display less effective mate-guarding behavior, indicating a weaker post-copulatory strategy. However, this poor pre- and post-copulatory success was traded-off with an increased survival, which is accompanied by late-life reproductive success. We then provided a mechanistic basis for the reduced copulatory success of <italic>Bully</italic> males. They showed distinct CHCs profiles compared to <italic>Cs</italic> males, which may contribute to their lower mating success. Moreover, they transferred lower levels of cVA, a mate-guarding pheromone, to females, potentially decreasing efficiency of their post-mating strategy. Our findings underscore the complex interplay between aggression, reproductive behavior, survival, and chemical signaling, providing insights into the evolutionary dynamics of life-history trade-offs in competitive social contexts.</p>

<title>Highly aggressive males exhibit reduced mating success and have shorter mating durations</title>
<p>To test the hypothesis that selection for male aggressive traits may confer mating advantages, we performed courtship competition assays in which <italic>Cs</italic> and <italic>Bully</italic> males competed for mating with virgin <italic>Cs</italic> females. No significant mating advantage was observed for <italic>Bully</italic> males (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We then assessed the reproductive capacity of <italic>Cs</italic> and <italic>Bully</italic> males in no-choice assays by pairing each male with a virgin <italic>Cs</italic> female for 30 minutes. Mating success was significantly lower in <italic>Bully</italic> males compared to what was observed with <italic>Cs</italic> males (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), despite no differences in the percentage of Unilateral Wing Extension (UWE), courtship latency or mating latency, when they succeed mating (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-E</xref>), suggesting intact courtship and mating motivation. These results were replicated using an independently selected <italic>Bully</italic> line (referred to as <italic>Bully B (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Penn et al., 2010</xref><italic>)</italic>), which also showed reduced mating success and increased aggression compared to <italic>Cs</italic> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A, C-E</xref>). This indicates that two independent selections for male aggressive traits had simultaneously reduced males mating success.</p>

<p>Differences between <italic>Cs</italic> and <italic>Bully</italic> extended to mating duration (MD) where <italic>Bully</italic> males mated 25% shorter than <italic>Cs</italic> males (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), a difference also observed in <italic>Bully B</italic> males (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>). This MD reduction persisted when using decapitated females (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>), ruling out female-driven termination and implicating male-intrinsic factors.</p>
<p>As males raised with other males have lengthened MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bretman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kim et al., 2013</xref>), we compared singly and group-housed males for their MD. We found that both <italic>Cs</italic> and <italic>Bully</italic> group-housed males exhibited significantly extended mating durations compared to single-housed males (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). However, the MD in <italic>Bully</italic> males remained shorter compared to <italic>Cs</italic> males in group-housed condition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). This indicates that <italic>Cs</italic> and <italic>Bully</italic> males respond equally to early social experience and hence do not display gene-by-environment interactions.</p>
<p>Together, these findings show that selection for male aggression reduces male mating success and mating duration, key traits of pre-copulatory reproductive performance. This supports our main hypothesis that selection for aggressive traits influences either or both pre- and post-copulatory strategies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Hyper-aggressive males display reduced mate-guarding efficiency, without compromising female fertility</title>
<p>Given that <italic>Bully</italic> males have shorter MD and reduced mating success, we hypothesized they would compensate this poor pre-copulatory success with more efficient post-mating strategies. After mating, males typically enter a refractory period during which they are no longer aroused and do not court the females they have just mated with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lynn et al., 2024</xref>). We first tested the hypothesis that <italic>Bully</italic> males would have a shorter refractory period than <italic>Cs</italic> males, allowing them to potentially mate with more females. To investigate this, we paired <italic>Cs</italic> and <italic>Bully</italic> males with virgin <italic>Cs</italic> females, allowed them to mate, and measured the percentage of UWE directed by these males at the female they just finished mating with over a 5-minutes post-mating period. While <italic>Cs</italic> males performed minimal UWE towards just-mated females (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>’), <italic>Bully</italic> males displayed a significantly higher percentage of UWE in this context compared to <italic>Cs</italic> males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>’), suggesting that <italic>Bully</italic> males have a shorter refractory period than <italic>Cs</italic> males to court mated females. This effect persisted when males were swapped after mating, with <italic>Bully</italic> males showing increased UWE towards <italic>Cs</italic>-mated females (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B–B</xref>’). This indicates that <italic>Bully</italic> males present a lower refractory period to court any mated females, allowing them to potentially have higher remating rate compared to <italic>Cs</italic> males. To test this, we conducted behavioral assays in which a single <italic>Cs</italic> or <italic>Bully</italic> male was consecutively paired with 6 novel virgin females over a 3h period and scored the number of mating. Contrary to our hypothesis, <italic>Bully</italic> males did not show higher remating rates, despite consistently shorter MD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C–D</xref>). This suggests that, despite shorter refractory period and reduced MD, <italic>Bully</italic> males did not achieve a higher remating success rate. As mating accompanies ejaculate transfer and incurs a reduction in sperm and seminal fluid reserve in <italic>D. mel.</italic> males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hihara, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sirot et al., 2009</xref>), we hypothesized that <italic>Bully</italic> males might retain more sperm, potentially enabling them to fertilize more females sequentially within a short period. We thus analyzed female fertility after each consecutive mating and found no significant difference between <italic>Bully</italic> and <italic>Cs</italic> males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Females that mated with <italic>Bully</italic> males remained as fertile as those mated with <italic>Cs</italic> males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Together, our results indicate that while <italic>Bully</italic> males present shorter refractory period after mating, but their remating rate and ability to fertilize females remain comparable to those of <italic>Cs</italic> males.</p>

<p>Due to a shorter MD in <italic>Bully</italic> males, we reasoned that a lower quantity of CHCs, acting as mate-guarding pheromones, may be transferred to the females’ body, making <italic>Cs</italic> females that mated with <italic>Bully</italic> males more attractive to other males compared to those mated with <italic>Cs</italic> males. To assess female attractiveness independently of any confounding effects of female receptivity, we performed preference assays for decapitated females, who lack receptivity. <italic>Cs</italic> females were first mated with either <italic>Cs</italic> or <italic>Bully</italic> males, then decapitated and simultaneously presented to naïve males in a binary choice assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Both <italic>Cs</italic> and <italic>Bully</italic> males preferentially courted decapitated females that had previously mated with <italic>Bully</italic> males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>’, green side), showing that females mated with <italic>Bully</italic> males remain more attractive than those mated with <italic>Cs</italic> males. In addition to mate guarding pheromones, males transfer seminal fluids that affect long term female receptivity, which may differ between <italic>Bully</italic> and <italic>Cs</italic> males. We therefore conducted mating assays in which virgin <italic>Cs</italic> females were initially mated with either <italic>Cs</italic> or <italic>Bully</italic> males. Several days later, these mated females were paired with naïve virgin <italic>Cs</italic> males, and the proportion of females that remated was analyzed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>’). Females previously mated with <italic>Cs</italic> males, remated significantly less than females that had mated with <italic>Bully</italic> males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>’, green), further supporting weaker mate-guarding by <italic>Bully</italic> males.</p>
<p>We conclude that <italic>Bully</italic> males fail to offset their poor pre-copulatory success with more efficient post-mating strategies. Their mates present a higher remating rate, likely due to reduced transfer of mate-guarding pheromones and seminal fluid. Thus, selection for aggressive traits compromises both pre- and post-copulatory male performance.</p>

<p>Our results suggest that the higher remating rate in females mated with <italic>Bully</italic> males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>’) may be due to increased attractiveness compared to females mated with <italic>Cs</italic> males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>’), a process influenced by pheromones transferred from males to females such as the blend of cVA/7-T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Laturney and Billeter, 2016</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we extracted CHCs from the cuticles of <italic>Cs</italic> virgin and <italic>Cs</italic> females mated to either a <italic>Cs</italic> or <italic>Bully</italic> males and compared their CHCs profiles. As a first step, PCA analysis showed that <italic>Cs</italic> virgin females exhibited distinct CHCs profiles from those of both <italic>Cs</italic> and <italic>Bully</italic>-mated females (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The first (PC1) and the second (PC2) dimensions explain 80.7% and 11.1% of the variance in CHCs profiles, respectively. High cos² values indicate a strong correlation between CHCs compounds and the principal components, suggesting that the PCA captures the major part of the variance in the data (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, some compounds such as 2MeC24, C23:1(6), cVA and C25:1(6) strongly influence PC1 and explain the difference between the clusters, <italic>i.e.</italic> female mated status (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B-D</xref>). Individual compound analysis revealed that this difference was primarily due to the transfer of male-specific CHCs during mating not found in virgin females (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">E</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Relatively to virgin females, C23:1(9) (9-Tricosene, 9-T), C23:1(7) (7-Tricosene, 7-T), C23:1(6), C25:1(6) and cVA were significantly elevated in mated females (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">E</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These results are consistent with previous studies showing that 7-T and 9-T are acquired by females during mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Everaerts et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Laturney and Billeter, 2016</xref>). When comparing the two groups of mated females, individual compound analysis showed that C23:1(5) (5-Tricosene, 5-T) and C25:1(5) (5-Pentacosene, 5-P) were significantly elevated in <italic>Bully</italic>-mated females compared to <italic>Cs</italic>-mated females (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, surrounded in red, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).

Given that <italic>Bully</italic> males also showed higher levels of both 5-P and 5-T compared to naïve <italic>Cs</italic> males (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), it is likely that the elevated levels of these compounds observed in females result from their transfer during mating.</p>

<p>cVA, a male-specific compound that acts as an anti-aphrodisiac and a mate-guarding molecule, is primarily transferred to the female’s genital tract during mating, with only trace amounts deposited on the cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Laturney and Billeter, 2016</xref>). Females with higher cVA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kurtovic et al., 2007</xref>), combined with 7-T, are less attractive to males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Laturney and Billeter, 2016</xref>). Given that remating rate of <italic>Bully</italic>-mated females was higher than that of <italic>Cs</italic>-mated females (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>’), we hypothesized that <italic>Bully</italic>-mated females would receive less cVA in their genital tract during mating, thus decreasing their attractiveness than when mating with <italic>Cs</italic> males. To test this, we conducted mating assays with <italic>Cs</italic> females paired with either <italic>Cs</italic> or <italic>Bully</italic> males, followed by dissection of the females’ genital tracts to quantify the amount of cVA transferred. We found that females mated with <italic>Bully</italic> males had about three times lower cVA quantities in their genital tracts compared to those mated with <italic>Cs</italic> males (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>’). Combined with higher quantities of 5-T and 5-P, reduced cVA level in genital tract likely contribute to the increased attractiveness and higher remating rates observed in females that previously mated with <italic>Bully</italic> males.</p>
<p>Overall, our findings suggest a mechanistic basis for the reduced pre- and post-copulatory behaviors observed in <italic>Bully</italic> males. Differences in CHCs profiles between naïve <italic>Cs</italic> and <italic>Bully</italic> may underlie a reduced attractiveness to females, thereby reducing their mating success. Additionally, increased levels of 5-T and 5-P, combined with reduced cVA transfer to the female genital tract, may contribute to the lower mate-guarding efficiency observed in these hyper-aggressive males.</p>

<title>The lower copulatory strategy of aggressive males is offset by a longer lifespan and maintenance of reproductive success later in life</title>
<p>Based on the main life-history trade-off between reproduction and survival, we hypothesized that the reduced pre- and post-copulatory success in <italic>Bully</italic> males would increase their survival. To test this, we conducted longitudinal courtship assays in which individual <italic>Cs</italic> and <italic>Bully</italic> males were paired weekly with a new virgin Cs female until their natural death. Throughout their lifespan, <italic>Bully</italic> males consistently displayed shorter MD than <italic>Cs</italic> males (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). While <italic>Cs</italic> males increased their MD with age or experience, a pattern reported in another <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dhole and Pfennig, 2014</xref>), this effect was absent in <italic>Bully</italic> males, whose MD remained stable across mating and throughout their lives (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Analysis of individual male slopes confirmed this divergence: most <italic>Cs</italic> males showed increasing MD across mating events, while <italic>Bully</italic> males did not (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mating success followed a similar pattern. Although <italic>Bully</italic> males mated less frequently than <italic>Cs</italic> males during the first 70 days, they maintained reproductive activity after all <italic>Cs</italic> males had ceased reproductive activity. All <italic>Cs</italic> males stopped mating by day 78 and died by day 97, whereas <italic>Bully</italic> males continued to mate until day 98 and survived up to 119 days (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Remarkably, these late-life matings produced viable offspring, demonstrating that <italic>Bully</italic> males retain fertility at older ages.</p>

<p><italic>Bully</italic> males survived significantly longer than <italic>Cs</italic> males, suggesting a shift in the reproduction-survival trade-off. To explore this further, <italic>Cs</italic> virgin females were mated with either <italic>Cs</italic> and <italic>Bully</italic> males, and progeny survival was monitored. Progeny from <italic>Bully</italic> mating showed a median survival (EC50) of 79 days, with the last male dying at day 106 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, green), while progeny from <italic>Cs</italic> males showed an EC50 of 57 days, with the last death occurring at day 90 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, yellow). This showed that the median survival was extended by ∼22 days (79 vs. 57 days) in <italic>Bully</italic> males. We then monitored male survival in mixed-sex groups composed of ten males and twelve females. <italic>Bully</italic> males still showed increased longevity, with an EC50 of 56 days and the last death on day 71, compared to <italic>Cs</italic> males, that had an EC50 of 43 days and all died by day 67 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).

<p>Our findings demonstrate that males selected for high levels of aggression show reduced investment in mating success but exhibit extended lifespan and sustained reproductive output later in life.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study reveals that selection for aggressive traits in <italic>D. mel.</italic> males influences one key life-history trade-off, in which survival is extended while reproductive success is reduced. Our results indicate that selection for aggressive traits directly or indirectly affects both pre-and post-copulatory strategies in <italic>Bully</italic> males, challenging the hypothesis that aggression necessarily enhances mating success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andersson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">West-Eberhard, 1983</xref>). Aggressive males had lower pre-copulatory success with decreased mating success and shorter mating duration than their less aggressive counterparts. Despite reduced refractory courtship period after mating, <italic>Bully</italic> males fail to achieve higher remating rate and exhibit a less effective mate-guarding strategy, as evidenced by the increased remating rate and potentially attractiveness of their previous mates. Differences between <italic>Bully</italic> and <italic>Cs</italic> males also extend to chemical profiles, which may account for reduced mating success in <italic>Bully</italic> males. In addition, females mated to highly aggressive males exhibited quantitative differences in CHCs profiles compared those mated with <italic>Cs</italic> males, along with a dramatic reduction in cVA quantities in their genital tracts after mating, providing a mechanism underlying a less efficient mate-guarding. Our findings suggest that artificial selection applied to male aggressive traits to produce the <italic>Bully</italic> line, is associated with changes in reproductive traits, enhanced survival, and increased CHCs levels, suggesting the existence of pleiotropic genes whose variation links aggression with these other traits.</p>
<p>The increased survival rate observed in highly aggressive males raises questions about the evolutionary consequences of aggression. While <italic>Bully</italic> males exhibit reduced pre- and post-copulatory success compared to <italic>Cs</italic> males, their extended lifespan allows them to sustain mating activity and produce viable offspring at later ages, challenging the classical view that early reproductive success is the primary driver of male fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Flatt, 2011</xref>). This shift suggests that alternative reproductive strategies, even those associated with lower mating success, can persist if they confer long-term survival advantages. Moreover, the extended lifespan of both <italic>Bully</italic> males and their progeny suggests the transmission of pleiotropic genetic traits that influence both aggression and survival, or the transmission of independent genetic loci affecting these traits separately. A previous study identified a limited number of genes that are differentially expressed in the <italic>Bully</italic> line compared to <italic>Cs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chowdhury et al., 2017</xref>). One of these genes, CG13646, a putative transmembrane transporter, is down-regulated in <italic>Bully</italic> males compared to <italic>Cs</italic>. Future research should investigate the genetic and neurobiological mechanisms underlying the trade-off reproduction/survival by examining the roles of candidate genes whose expression is up- or down-regulated in the <italic>Bully</italic> line.</p>
<p>Despite maintaining high courtship intensity, highly aggressive males exhibit reduced mating success and mating duration, suggesting that aggression is linked to physiological or behavioral traits that may be suboptimal for reproductive performance. For example, males might be less attractive for reasons unrelated to their courtship efforts. Rather than maximizing immediate reproductive output, aggressive males might allocate energy in a way that prioritizes long-term survival, potentially reflecting a life-history shift toward extended reproductive capacity at the cost of reduced mating success.</p>
<p>We showed that naïve highly aggressive individuals present distinct chemical profiles compared to unselected wild-type flies, indicating that selection for aggressive traits may have broader impacts, such as indirectly influencing mate choice through male attractiveness to females. Elevated levels of most CHCs in aggressive males suggest that they could be perceived as more attractive to females than wild-type males. However, despite these chemical traits potentially enhancing female attraction, aggressive males exhibit lower mating success, highlighting that a higher quantity of CHCs alone does not guarantee mating success. However, besides 7-T as CHCs fostering male attractiveness, other cuticular compounds, such as palmitoleic acid signaling through Or47b, modulate courtship behaviors in an age-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dweck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kohlmeier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). This mechanism enables older males to initiate courtship more rapidly and with greater intensity, potentially enhancing their mating success relative to younger males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). In our experiments, we did not measure palmitoleic acid levels in <italic>Bully</italic> and <italic>Cs</italic> males. However, it remains possible that <italic>Bully</italic> males have lower levels of palmitoleic acid compared to <italic>Cs</italic> males. This could explain their decreased mating success by potentially reducing their attractiveness. Aggressive males may signal their fitness through chemical cues, but their high level of aggression could hinder mate choice by females, who may prioritize other factors, such as male courtship behavior or compatibility in post-mating interactions, over chemical signaling alone. This raises the possibility that aggression-driven sexual selection operates through both direct behavioral competition and indirect chemical signaling mechanisms, influencing overall reproductive success.</p>
<p>The influence of aggression extends beyond accessing mates, affecting post-mating behaviors, mate-guarding and chemical communication, shaping male reproductive strategies and female remating dynamics. Hyper-aggressive males exhibit a shorten refractory period to court females showed by an elevated post-mating courtship yet reduced mate-guarding efficiency, likely contributing to increasing remating rate of both males and females respectively. This suggests that while aggression may provide advantages in direct competition, it can incur reproductive costs by diminishing mate-guarding efficiency. The chemical analysis further supports this assumption, showing that females mated with the hyper-aggressive <italic>Bully</italic> males exhibit elevated levels of specific CHCs (5-T and 5-P) and significantly lower cVA transfer into the female genital tract, which may fail to efficiently decrease their attractiveness, thus triggering higher remating rate. This is supported by other study showing that lower cVA levels can shorten the effectiveness of chemical mate-guarding, allowing quicker female re-attractiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ejima, 2015</xref>). As 7-T and cVA act in concert to modulate behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Laturney and Billeter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Verschut et al., 2023</xref>), it is possible that the elevated levels of 5-T and 5-P in <italic>Bully</italic>-mated females interact synergistically too, or with potential other CHCs, to fail to reduce female attractiveness. This would suggest that aggression may indirectly influence post-copulatory sexual selection by changing female chemical signatures.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings emphasize the need to consider aggression within a broader life-history and evolutionary framework. The influence of aggression on the trade-off survival/reproduction, potentially through chemical signaling, illustrates how selection for competitive traits does not occur in isolation but is shaped by interrelated behavioral and physiological factors. This supports the notion that aggression benefits to individuals in competitive environment but may induce reproductive constraints. By framing aggression as part of a broader life-history strategy rather than an isolated trait, our study highlights the intricate balance between competition, survival, and reproductive success. These insights offer novel perspectives on the evolutionary consequences of aggressive behavior and its role in shaping reproductive strategies in animal populations.</p>

<p>Experimental arenas were described in details in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Trannoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Trannoy et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, resin blocks containing three circular behavioral arenas (dimension: 2.3 cm diameter, 1.7 cm height) were used to conduct behavioral assays. Each arena was divided in two equal sizes by a plastic divider allowing flies to acclimate without physical interactions with the second fly. Then, dividers are removed from the arenas to start the behavioral assays. All behavioral assays were performed in empty arenas, expect for aggression assays and courtship assays with decapitated females, in which a food cup (1.5 cm diameter, 1 cm height) containing fresh standard fly food with a drop of fresh yeast paste on the surface was placed in the center of each arena.</p>

<title>Commonalities between all behavioral assays</title>
<p>Late-stage pupae were collected from stocks raised at 25°C. Male pupae were individually placed in 5ml vials (Dutscher, ref 390597) containing about 1ml of standard fly food while female pupae were placed in group of 15 in ≈47ml vials (Dutscher, ref 789001B) containing about 15ml of standard fly food. All vials were placed at 25°C for 7 days. Seven-day-old individuals were randomly inserted in arenas by negative geotaxis, and allow to acclimate for 5 min before experiments. All behavioral assays were performed at 25°C. All tests were recorded with Basler camera Ace1970 through the StreamPix8 multi video recording software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://norpix.com">norpix.com</ext-link>) and analyzed with BORIS software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Friard and Gamba, 2016</xref>). After 15 min or 30 min, if pairs of flies had not yet lunged or mated respectively, we considered that no aggression or mating occurred and arenas were not considered for analysis. No power analyses were performed prior to the experiments, as we chose to use sample sizes of approximately 20 replicates, which is considered standard practice in the field.</p>

<sec id="s5b">
<title>Aggression assays</title>
<p>Two days prior to the aggression assays, males were anesthetized with CO₂, and half were marked with a small white dot on the thorax before being returned to their original isolation vials. Aggression tests were conducted between ZT0 and ZT3 using size-matched male pairs. Males competed for access to a central food cup containing yeast. The following behaviors were recorded for 10 minutes following the first lunge: latency to lunge (i.e., the time between the initial encounter on the food cup and the first lunge), total number of lunges, and number of boxing events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5c">
<title>Mating assays</title>
<p>Seven-day-old individuals were tested in arenas without any food source. Latency to court and to mate, defined as the time between the first encounter and either the first Unilateral Wing Extension (UWE) or the initiation of mating, respectively, were measured. Total UWE duration was recorded over a 10-minute period starting from the first encounter. Mating proportion and mating duration were also scored. In all assays, males were reared in social isolation, except for <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, where they were housed in groups of 10 males for 7 days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5d">
<title>Mating assays with decapitated females</title>
<p>Females were anesthetized with CO₂ and placed under the binocular for head removal. Experiments with decapitated females were performed in arenas with food cup filled with fresh fly food but without yeast.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5e">
<title>Multiple consecutive mating events assays</title>
<p>Single naïve <italic>Cs</italic> and <italic>Bully</italic> males were sequentially paired with six virgin <italic>Cs</italic> females. For each male, mating duration and the number of successful mating were recorded. After each copulation, the mated female was transferred to a 5 ml vial containing fly food to assess progeny production.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5f">
<title>Mating assays throughout the lifespan</title>
<p>24 <italic>Cs</italic> and <italic>Bully</italic> males were reared in isolation and paired with seven-day-old virgin <italic>Cs</italic> females for mating assays, conducted every seven days until all males had died. At each time point, mating duration and mating success (proportion of mating) were recorded. After all <italic>Cs</italic> males had died, females that had mated with <italic>Bully</italic> males were transferred to 5 ml vials containing fly food to assess progeny production.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5g">
<title>Attractiveness assays</title>
<sec id="s5g1">
<title>Measure of post-mating UWE</title>
<p>Mating assays were performed by pairing <italic>Cs</italic> and <italic>Bully</italic> males with <italic>Cs</italic> females. Right after mating end, we scored the total time that males displayed UWE for 10 minutes towards the just-mated females.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5g2">
<title>Measure of post-mating UWE with switched females</title>
<p>Mating assays were performed with naive <italic>Cs</italic> or <italic>Bully</italic> males and virgin <italic>Cs</italic> females. Immediately after mating ends, females were switched: <italic>Cs</italic> males interacted with <italic>Bully</italic>-mated females and <italic>Bully</italic> males interacted with <italic>Cs</italic>-mated females. Then total time of UWE towards the females was scored during 10 min.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5g3">
<title>Measure of post-mating UWE with decapitated females</title>
<p>Mating assays were conducted using naïve <italic>Cs</italic> or <italic>Bully</italic> males paired with virgin <italic>Cs</italic> females. Following copulation, mated females were decapitated. One decapitated <italic>Cs</italic>-mated and one <italic>Bully</italic>-mated female were then placed on the surface of the food cup. A new naïve <italic>Cs</italic> or <italic>Bully</italic> male was introduced and allowed to interact with both decapitated females. The duration of Unilateral Wing Extensions (UWE) directed toward each female was recorded over a 2-minute period following the first encounter. Arenas in which males interacted with only one of the two females were excluded from the analysis, as no choice could be determined.</p>

<sec id="s5h">
<title>Re-mating assays</title>
<p>Mating assays were performed with naïve <italic>Cs</italic> or <italic>Bully</italic> males and virgin <italic>Cs</italic> females. Mated-females were then individually placed in 5ml vials containing about 1ml of standard fly food and kept at 25°C. 12 or 14 days after the initial mating, mated-females were paired with a new naïve <italic>Cs</italic> male in empty arena and the proportion of re-mating during 30 min was scored.</p>

<title>Survival assays</title>
<sec id="s5i1">
<title>Survival with isolated males</title>
<p>Late-stage pupae from the progeny of ♀Cs × ♂Cs and ♀Cs × ♂Bully crosses were individually isolated in 5 ml vials containing 1ml of standard fly food and kept at 25 °C until adult emergence. The number of dead individuals was recorded daily until all flies had died. To maintain food quality, flies were transferred weekly to fresh vials containing approximately 1 ml of new fly food.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5i2">
<title>Survival with group-raised males</title>
<p>Late-stage Cs and Bully male pupae and Cs female pupae were placed in group of 12♀Cs-10♂Cs or 12♀Cs-10♂Bully in ≈47ml vials containing 15mL standard fly food and kept at 25 °C until adult emergence. The number of dead males was recorded daily until they all had died. To maintain food quality, flies were transferred twice a week to fresh vials containing approximately 15 mL of new fly food.</p>

<title>CHCs analysis</title>
<p>Extraction and analysis of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) of naive <italic>Cs</italic> and <italic>Bully</italic> males, as well as virgin <italic>Cs</italic>, <italic>Cs</italic>- and <italic>Bully</italic>-mated females were performed in Jean-Christophe Billeter’s lab, Groningen, Netherlands, with a Gas Chromatography coupled with Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID) as already described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Laturney and Billeter, 2016</xref>). Briefly, single whole flies were put in a 2ml glass vial (Supelco certified vial kit, 2ml clear glass vial 12×32mm and Supelco inserts) containing 50µl of nC18+nC26 10 ng/µl standard solution (made in Billeter’s lab) diluted in n-Hexane 99%+ (Acrōs Organic®). Vials were then vortexed at the lowest speed for 2min, afterward flies’ body were gently removed from vials using a “J-shape” paper clip sliced at the end, taking care not to damage the body to prevent from hemolymph contamination. Finally, samples were placed in GC-FID for apolar compounds analysis only.</p>

<title>cVA quantification into genital tract</title>
<p>Mating assays were performed with naïve <italic>Cs</italic> or <italic>Bully</italic> males and virgin <italic>Cs</italic> female. Right after mating, females were transferred into a 5ml vial previously put in ice in -80°C fridge to make them fall asleep quickly and prevent from sperm ejection. Mated-females’ genital tract was dissected in PBS with precision forceps under a binocular loupe. Protocol was already employed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Verschut et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, abdomen was torn to make ovaries and genital tract out and visible, then ovaries, oviduct, spermathecae, parovaria and cuticula were removed to keep only the uterus, taking care not to injure it to prevent from sperm leak. Each uterus was inserted in a 2ml glass vial (Supelco certified vial kit, 2ml clear glass vial 12×32mm and Supelco inserts) containing 50µl of n-Hexane 99%+ (Acrōs Organic) for 1h at ambient temperature. Hexane solution was then evaporated under helium flow to prevent from cVA oxidation with dioxygen. Samples were sent to Jean-Christophe Billeter’s lab for GC-FID analysis of cVA, as describe above in CHCs analysis method part.</p>

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>No data have been removed from the statistical analysis. Some experiments were independently replicated by different authors to reduce potential bias.

<p>Comparisons of means (k =2) were performed with a T-test when possible (<italic>i.e.</italic> mating duration) otherwise a Fisher Pitman permutation test was used (<italic>i.e.</italic> UWE, latency to court and to mate). For comparisons with more than 2 conditions, a linear model (LM) was used and tested either with a type II ANOVA when possible (<italic>i.e.</italic> mating duration) or a permutation test instead (<italic>i.e.</italic> latency to lunge and CHC concentrations). For comparison of proportions and counting events, a type II analysis of deviance table with a Likelihood Ratio Test (<italic>i.e.</italic> mating success, proportion of female re-mating, number of lunge and boxing events) or a Wald Chi-square test (<italic>i.e.</italic> number of consecutive mating events) was performed. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to see different CHC profiles and tested with a PerMANOVA and a SIMPER analysis. Survival data were analysed with a Weibull regression model and a Likelihood Ratio Test.</p>
<p>When paired data, dependency was considered thanks to linear mixed model (LMM) with the source of dependency as random factor. Data following a distribution other than a normal distribution (<italic>e.g.</italic> binomial or Poisson distribution) were computed in a generalized linear model (GLM) (<italic>i.e.</italic> mating success, number of consecutive mating events, number of mating giving progeny, proportion of females re-mating, number of lunges and boxing events). When necessary, interactions were considered within models and tested. All post-hoc comparisons were performed with a sequential Bonferroni correction on the alpha level using either Holm method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Holm, 1979</xref>) when few numbers of comparisons or Benjamini and Hochberg method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>) when more comparisons.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors compare &quot;Bully&quot; lines, selected for male aggression, to Canton-S controls and find that Bully males have lower mating success, shorter mating durations, and remate sooner. Chemical analyses show Bully males have distinct cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) signatures and transfer markedly less cVA to females, offering a plausible mechanistic link to weaker mate-guarding.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, Bully males live longer and remain fertile at older ages when CS males no longer mate, indicating a shift in the reproduction-survival trade-off in aggression-selected populations.</p>
<p>Importantly, the work sheds light on proximate mechanisms, demonstrating that shifts in CHCs and pheromone transfer co-occur with changes in fitness traits, thus offering new entry points for understanding life-history evolution.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript's strengths lie in its comprehensive and integrative approach framed within an evolutionary context. By combining behavioral assays, chemical profiling, and lifespan measurements, the authors reveal a coherent pattern linking aggression selection to life-history trade-offs. The direct quantification of cVA in female reproductive tracts after mating provides a particularly compelling mechanistic correlate, strengthening the link between behavior and chemical signaling. Findings on altered 5-T and 5-P levels further highlight how chemical communication shapes mating and mate-guarding strategies. Analytical approaches are largely rigorous, and the results provide valuable insights into the pleiotropic effects of selection on socially relevant traits. The study will be of interest to Drosophila biologists working on sexual selection, behavioral evolution, and aging.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The weaknesses are primarily conceptual rather than procedural. The generality of the findings is uncertain, as selection appears to be represented by only one (and a second closely related) Bully line, limiting conclusions about selection responses versus line-specific drift or founder effects. The causal link between aggression selection and increased longevity is not established: the data show a correlated shift but do not identify mechanisms underlying lifespan extension. In several places, the manuscript uses causal language (e.g., that selection 'influences' longevity or mating strategy) where association would be more accurate; this should be toned down to avoid overstatement. Ecological relevance is also not addressed, since laboratory conditions may bias the balance between costs and benefits of aggression compared with variable natural environments. Addressing these points would strengthen both the impact and clarity of the study.</p>

<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>This valuable study addresses the effects of selection on aggression on fitness and life-history trade-offs in Drosophila melanogaster. However, the evidence presented is incomplete and does not support the claims proposed in the study of increased survival of highly aggressive males at the expense of reproductive success and shorter mating duration.

</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to clarify the points raised in the eLife assessment.</p>
<p>The report states that we relied on a single line of hyper-aggressive males tested with CantonS females, and implies that Bully and Cs have not co-evolved. This is a misunderstanding: Bully flies were derived from Cs population. Thus, Bully and Cs have co-evolved. In addition to the Bully A line presented in the main figures of the manuscript, we replicated several of our findings with a second independent selected line, Bully B. Results from courtship assays involving both Bully A and Bully B couples males and females were presented in Figure Supp1. We apologies for not having made this more explicit in the original manuscript, which we will correct. These experiments should alleviate the concerns from the reviewers; they demonstrate that our conclusions are supported by two independent hyper-aggressive lines, and these include assays with selected male and female flies.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The flies used for comparisons are inadequate. Behavioral assays compare Bully males mated to non-coevolved Cs females with Cs males mated to coevolved Cs females.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, which made us realize that we had not sufficiently highlighted some of our experiments. The Bully lines used in our work were derived from Canton-S flies and thus did co-evolve with Cs. As originally described by Penn et al. (2010), highly aggressive “Bully” lines were generated through selective breeding from Canton-S males that consistently won aggressive encounters. After 34–37 generations, stable Bully lines were established. Thus, Bully and Cs flies have co-evolved and 2) the selection applied was male-specific. Independent selection replicates produced distinct lines, including Bully A and Bully B. Previous studies only characterized Bully A (Penn et al., 2010; Chowdhury et al., 2017), but our work includes both Bully A and Bully B (Fig. S1).</p>
<p>The rationale for pairing Bully or Cs males with Cs females (with which both male types co-evolved) follows the approach used by Dierick et al. (2006), who investigated how the male-specific selection for aggression affected courtship and mating behaviors by testing them with standard Canton-S females. This design allows to isolate the effects of male genotype and behavior on courtship and mating outcomes, avoiding confounding effects from female behavioral changes.</p>
<p>We initially compared selected Bully pairs (Bully males × Bully females) (Fig. S1) with Cs pairs and observed similarly shortened mating durations in both Bully × Bully and Bully × Cs matings (Fig. S1, Fig. 1F and G). Thus, the reduction in mating duration arises specifically from Bully males. We therefore chose to use Cs females as a standard background to assess the consequences of male-specific selection for aggression on reproductive behaviors.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Lifespan analysis is done on male progeny of Cs females mated to either genetically more distant Bully or co-evolved Cs males; the longer lifespan and performance on the former is interpreted as a trade-off with aggressiveness, rather than a simple explanation of hybrid vigor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment, which again stems from a poor explanation from our part about the origin of the Bully line in the original manuscript. The Bully flies were derived from the same original population as the Cs line. Hybrid vigor typically arises when crossing individuals from distinct populations, which is not the case here as both Bully and CS come from the same population.</p>
<p>To further support our conclusions, we conducted additional experiments using progeny from within-line crosses (Bully males × Bully females) and results revealed the same phenotype: the progeny of these flies also exhibited significantly longer lifespans than Cs males x Cs females progeny. This finding argues against hybrid vigor as the main explanation for the observed phenotype, since both the Bully and Cs crosses result in inbreeding, yet give longer lifespan in Bully. We will include these additional longevity data (currently not included in the manuscript) to strengthen our results and reinforce our interpretation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Differences in CHCs between Bully and Cs males and Cs females mated to those males are not shown to cause differences in measured behavioral outcomes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point regarding causality. One way to establish a causal link between differences in CHCs observed in Bully and Cs flies and the corresponding behavioral outcomes would be to experimentally manipulate CHC profiles. For instance, one could perfume oenocyte-less males with the compounds found in higher abundance in Bully flies, then perform behavioral assays to assess causality. We agree that such experiments would be highly informative in determining the functional roles of specific CHCs elevated in Bully males. However, this approach is technically challenging, as the perfuming technique must be optimized to transfer precise amounts of each compound. For example, this method can be used to gradually perfume flies to assess dose–response behavioral effects, whereas matching exactly the natural concentrations found in individuals, especially given inter-individual variability, remains difficult.</p>
<p>We considered conducting such experiments during our study but did not pursue them for these technical reasons. Nevertheless, we can include a statement in the Discussion acknowledging this as an important future direction to test the causal relationship between CHC variation and behavior.</p>

<p>(1) Generality of findings and potential line effects</p>
<p>We agree that our results presented in the main figures of the manuscript relied mainly on one Bully line (Bully A). To address potential line-specific effects, we replicated key courtship experiments with another independent line, Bully B, selected in parallel from the same Canton-S stock but through distinct selection replicates. The results obtained from Bully B closely matched those from Bully A, suggesting that the observed phenotypes are consistent consequences of aggression selection rather than random drift or founder effects.</p>
<p>(2) Causality versus correlation</p>
<p>We concur that some sentences in the manuscript could overstate causal interpretations. We will revise the text to clearly distinguish correlation from causation and to avoid implying direct causal relationships where data only support association.</p>
<p>(3) Ecological relevance</p>
<p>We appreciate this point. Our experiments were performed under controlled laboratory conditions, which may not fully capture the ecological contexts shaping the costs and benefits of aggression. We will acknowledge this limitation and expand the Discussion to consider how environmental variability could modulate the fitness trade-offs associated with aggression in natural populations.</p>
<p>We thank both reviewers for their constructive feedback, which will help us strengthen the rigor and clarity of the manuscript. We believe that the additional results and revisions will satisfactorily address their concerns.</p>
