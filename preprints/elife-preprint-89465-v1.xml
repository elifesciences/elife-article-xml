<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Rapid transduction of force into a biological signal allows living cells to respond to mechanical changes in their environment. Force is thought to first act on the plasma membrane and alter membrane associated proteins. The enzyme phospholipase D2 (PLD2) is mechanosensitive and associates with the membrane through a covalently attached palmitate lipid (palmitoylation) and its affinity for a structured membrane-lipid site comprised of cholesterol and saturated ganglioside (GM1). Here we show stretch activation of TWIK-related K<sup>+</sup> channel (TREK-1) is mechanically activated by movement from ordered GM1 clusters to 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) clusters. First, force (shear or stretch) deforms the ordered GM1 lipids and lowers cholesterol in the membrane. Second the deformation disrupts the interaction of palmitate with the ordered GM1 lipids allowing a complex of TREK-1 and PLD2 to move to PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters where the enzyme produces the second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA) that helps gate the channel. Co-expression of catalytically dead PLD2, devoid of PA production, inhibits TREK-1 stretch currents in the cell membrane. Loading cultured cells with cholesterol clusters TREK-1 with GM1 lipids and inhibits the channel and depletion of cholesterol in astrocytes moves TREK-1 away from GM1. Reduction or elimination of PLD2 expression in flies results in hypersensitivity to mechanical force—decreased thresholds. We conclude the ordered lipids sense force and PLD2 combines with TREK-1 to elicit a mechanical response. The hypersensitivity of PLD2 deficient flies suggests an <italic>in vivo</italic> role for PA lipid signaling in setting mechanosensitivity and pain thresholds.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All cells respond to force (mechanosensation)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Mechanosensation requires both sensing and transducing the force. Ion channels are important meditators of force. Some ion channels are downstream of multi-step signaling cascades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. For example, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are activated by multi-step mechanical signaling cascades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> including those involving mechanosensitive G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>TWIK-related K<sup>+</sup> channel subtype 1 (TREK-1) is an analgesic mechanosensitive channel of the two-pore-domain potassium (K2P) family that inhibits neuronal firing and reduces pain by the release of potassium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the enzyme phospholipase D2 (PLD2) binds directly to the C-terminus of TREK-1 and activates the channel through local production of phosphatidic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. PLD2 is also mechanosensitive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Shear of 3 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> robustly increases PLD2 catalytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. PLD2 is palmitoylated at cysteines near its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which at rest causes PLD2 to bind to a specific site comprised of monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) lipids and cholesterol in the liquid ordered (L<sub>o</sub>) region of the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplemental Fig. S1a-b</xref>). The PH domain also binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) which opposes association with GM1 lipids by trafficking the enzyme to the liquid disordered (L<sub>d</sub>) region of the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> where it is activated by substrate presentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplemental Fig. S1c</xref>).</p>
<p>PLD2 mechanosensitivity and TREK-1 binding raises several important questions: first, does PLD2’s mechano-sensitivity contribute to mechanosensitivity of TREK-1 channels? The TREK-1 C-terminus that binds PLD2 is also required for TREK-1 mechanosensitivity in cellular membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and the same C-terminal segment is required for PLD2 dependent anesthetic sensitivity of the channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Lastly, how does PLD2 sense mechanical force on the membrane when it has only a lipid palmitate to associate with the membrane, i.e., no transmembrane domain? Here we show mechanical activation of TREK-1 in cultured cells includes mechanically induced movement of TREK-1 and the production of PA by PLD2.</p>

<title>PLD2 dependent TREK-1 activation</title>
<p>To test the contribution of PLD2 to the mechanical sensitivity of TREK-1, we measured pressure currents with and without a catalytically dead K758R PLD2 mutant (xPLD2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> in HEK293 cells. We used HEK293 since they have very little endogenous potassium currents and by over expressing the channel, we can attribute the measured current to TREK-1. Expression of TREK-1 was monitored by an eGFP tag on the c-terminus. All constructs expressed well and could be seen on the surface of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2a-b</xref>). We expected TREK-1 to be less sensitive to mechanical activation with xPLD2 (i.e., xPLD2 should reduce PLD2 dependent activation of TREK-1).</p>
<p>We found overexpression of xPLD2 inhibited a significant portion of the stretch-activated TREK-1 current (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-c</xref>) in cultured HEK293T cells. Currents, measured in the inside out configuration with negative pressure (from 0 to -60 mmHg) decreased &gt;80% from 0.181 ± 0.04 to 0.035 ± 0.013 pA/µm<sup>2</sup>.Truncating the C-terminus to remove the putative PLD binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3a</xref>) decreased the TREK-1 pressure current &gt; 85% to 0.025 ± 0.013 pA/µm<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3b</xref>).</p>

(<bold>c</bold>) The data, minus HEK293 background (0.04 ± 0.02 pA/µm<sup>2</sup> n=5 (inset)), are summarized for -60 mmHg. Compared to endogenous PLD2, the expression of xPLD2 eliminated the majority of detectible TREK-1 pressure current (p&lt;0.007, n=16-23), as did a truncated TREK-1 (TREK1 trunc) lacking the PLD2 binding site (p=0.002, n=15-23) The inset compares mock transfected HEK293T cells with TREK-1 trunc and full length (FL) TREK1 + xPLD2, indicative of direct TREK-1 activation.

<p>Previous work showed purified reconstituted TREK-1 is directly sensitive to force absent PLD2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. To characterize the PLD2 independent (i.e., direct) component of TREK-1 mechanosensitivity in a cellular membrane (mammalian lipids), we compared cells expressing the truncated TREK1 (TREK-1 trunc) with mock transfected HEK293T cells (no TREK-1). We found TREK-1 trunc had 0.046 ± 0.023 pA/µm<sup>2</sup> more current (p=0.08) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref> inset). Similarly in cells expressing xPLD2 with full length TREK-1, the channel showed a small, 0.060 ± 0.035 pA/µm<sup>2</sup> increase in currents (p=0.11). This PLD2 independent current is consisted with direct TREK-1 mechanosensitivity seen in liposomes.</p>
<p>As a control, to confirm surface expression and function of TREK-1 in the presence of xPLD2, we measured TREK-1 basal resting currents at 0 mV with and without xPLD2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). TREK-1 is a potassium leak channel with basal currents in cultured cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Consistent with previous studies, we found significant TREK-1 basal current with (24.0 ± 4.2 pA/pF) and without (16.9 ± 4.3 pA/pF) xPLD2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Currents from FL TREK-1 with xPLD2 was significantly higher than a control, C321 truncation of TREK-1, which we found to have no current. This result suggests that FL TREK-1 is expressed and functional in the presence of xPLD2. Furthermore, this result shows that the pressure current (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) is much more sensitive to xPLD2 than the leak current (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>; TREK FL, grey bar vs. +xPLD2, red bar)</p>
<p>Further establishing a role for PLD2 in TREK-1 mechanical activation, overexpression of TREK-1 with endogenous or over-expressed levels of wild type (WT) mouse PLD2 (mPLD2) led to a robust TREK-1 pressure-dependent current in HEK 293 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplemental Fig. S3b</xref> for raw traces). The relative xPLD2 inhibition was highly significant compared to TREK-1 with or without overexpression of mPLD2 (p&lt;0.002 and 0.007 respectively, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>
<p>The PLD dependent threshold from TREK-1 was relatively sensitive, responding to negative pressure (0 to -60 mmHg) with a half maximal pressure (P<sub>50</sub>) of ∼32 mmHg and yielding up to 200 pA of TREK-1 current (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplemental Fig. S3c</xref>) consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Mechanical activation of TREK-1 by movement between nanodomains</title>
<p>As mentioned, fluid shear causes PLD2 to move from cholesterol dependent GM1 clusters to PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters and this activated the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Since TREK-1 binds to PLD2 we reasoned the channel could be similarly mechanically activated by a movement from GM1 to PIP<sub>2</sub> lipids. To directly visualize TREK-1 in sheared lipids, we developed a procedure to chemically fix membranes during shear (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Cultured HEK293T cells expressing TREK-1 and mPLD (identical to our electrophysiology experiments) were sheared at 3 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> (a physiologically relevant force to cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>), fixed and labeled for two-color dSTORM. For TREK-1 protein labeling, we used the direct self-blinking properties of the eGFP tag. For labeling lipids, we used Alexa 647 (A647) anti-PIP<sub>2</sub> antibody or A647 labeled cholera toxin B (CTxB), which label PIP<sub>2</sub> and GM1 clusters respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. By labeling both lipid and protein we are able to monitor movement between nanoscopic lipid domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. To access the PIP<sub>2</sub> on the inner leaflet, the cells were permeabilized (see methods). Cellular staining was verified by confocal microscopy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2a</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Prior to shear, TREK-1_eGFP and GM1 lipids showed strong pair correlation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b,c</xref>) suggesting, TREK-1 is associated with or near GM1 lipids. After shear, the pair correlation was dramatically decreased (p&lt;0.01 at 50 nm). A similar experiment with a cy3b labeled anti-TREK-1 antibody showed an almost identical decrease in TREK-1/GM1 pair correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4a</xref>) validating both our eGFP-dSTORM method and the specificity of the TREK-1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2a</xref>).</p>
<p>After leaving GM1 lipids, we expect TREK-1 to move a nanoscopic distance to PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters. PIP<sub>2</sub> forms its own nanodomains separate from GM1cluster <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> which on average are ∼133 nm apart in HEK293T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Cells were sheared with 3 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> fluid shear, permeabilized, fixed, and labeled with A647 anti-PIP<sub>2</sub> antibody.</p>
<p>As expected, TREK-1_eGFP pair correlation was low prior to shear and then increased significantly after shear (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>), opposite the result with GM1(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Hence shear causes TREK-1 to leave GM1 cluster and move to PIP<sub>2</sub> cluster. Based on a student’s t test, the nanoscopic movement to PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters was significant both at a single radius and a multiple point comparison along the curve. The significance of multiple points was calculated using a nested student’s t test (see methods).</p>
<p>Next, we investigated shear induced movement of TREK-1 in the presence of xPLD2. Like mPLD2, we over expressed xPLD2 in HEK293T cells matching the conditions of our electrophysiology experiments in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>. And like mPLD2, HEK293T cells were sheared, permeabilized, and labeled for two-color dSTORM with eGFP_TREK-1 and either A647-cholesteratoxin or A647-anti-PIP<sub>2</sub> antibody.</p>
<p>In the presence of xPLD2, shear caused TREK-1 to leave GM1 domains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). However, unlike mPLD2, the association of TREK-1 with PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters remained relatively weak after shear (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>) despite an overall increase in TREK-1 and PIP<sub>2</sub> levels in the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2c-d</xref>). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref> shows a model of shear induced movement of TREK-1 from GM1 PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters.</p>

<title>Mechanism of PLD2 activation by shear</title>
<p>Presumably TREK-1 moves between nanodomains as a complex with PLD2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. TREK-1 is not palmitoylated, rather its binds to PLD2 through its disordered C-terminus. We previously showed PLD2 moves in response to changes in cellular cholesterol, but we have not directly imaged PLD2 movement in the membrane under shear.</p>
<p>To test shear induced movement of PLD2 we used calibrated shear chambers (ibidi µ-Slide I<sup>0.4</sup> parallel-plate) with cultured C2C12 muscle cells (mouse myocytes) and N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells endogenously expressing TREK-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2e</xref>). The endogenous expression avoids artifacts from saturating GM1 clusters by over expressing the protein. We initiated shear by pumping phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with a calibrated shear of 3 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>. Using a digitally controlled inline heater, the cells were kept at constant 37 ℃. Immediately after applying shear (&lt;10 sec), we infused fixative agents to the shear buffer which allowed the cells to be rapidly fixed in the mechanically stimulated state. Non-sheared control cells were grown and treated similarly on static coverslips without shear (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">S5a</xref>).</p>

<p>Using two-color dSTORM and pair correlation, we found shear mobilized PLD2 in the membrane independent of heat. Prior to shear, PLD2 was robustly localized with GM1 clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). After shear, PLD2 pair correlation decreased in GM1 clusters and robustly increased with PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Shear-induced release of PLD2 from GM1 domains was more robust than anesthetic disruption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The fact that temperature was kept constant, ± 0.1℃, suggests the mechanism is not due to melting of ordered lipids near a transition state.</p>
<p>Cluster analysis of the sheared GM1 particles showed a decrease in the apparent size of GM1 clusters from 167±3 to 131±3 nm (∼20%, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>) in C2C12 cells and similar effect on the size of GM1 clusters in N2a cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Like GM1 clusters, PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters remained largely intact and slightly smaller (154±1 vs 139±1) after shear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5b</xref>). The size and number were determined using DBSCAN cluster analysis software of GM1 clusters.</p>
<p>The decrease resembled previous experiments where we removed cholesterol with methybetacyclodextrin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. To test if mechanical shear lowers cholesterol, we applied orbital fluid shear (3 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>) for 10 min at 37 C and then fixed the cells. Control cells were either not sheard or sheared and then allowed to recover ∼45 sec prior to fixing.</p>
<p>We found orbital shear decreased free cholesterol by 25% in N2a cells (p&lt;0.001) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>) and this activated PLD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). The decrease in cholesterol was statistically significant p&lt;0.0001 and reversible. Allowing the cells to sit for ∼45 prior to fixing increased cholesterol to the levels in non-sheared cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>).

Unlike HEK293T cells, C2C12 cells had very little TREK-1/GM1 pair correlation before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5e</xref>, grey trace). PLD2 is regulated by cholesterol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> leading us to consider cholesterols role in attracting endogenous levels of TREK-1 to GM1 lipids.

<p>Cholesterol induced movement of TREK-1 to GM1 lipids should decrease TREK-1 currents since PLD2 will be inhibited by a lack of substrate.

<p>In earlier studies, we showed astrocytes regulates clustering of proteins in neurons by releasing apoE containing particles loaded primarily with cholesterol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.

<p>PLD<sup>null</sup> flies showed a significantly lower arousal threshold than their control strains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Taken together we have shown the translocation of TREK-1 and PLD2 nanoscopic distances away from GM1 lipids, and the production of PA near TREK-1, are necessary events associated with full mechanical activation of the channel in cultured cells. In cultured cells, 0.05 PA/cm<sup>2</sup> current density (&lt;10% of the total stretch current) was PLD2 independent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref> inset). Presumably, the PLD independent current is from direct mechanical activation of TREK-1, a mechanism that was first proposed in purified vesicle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Some of the PLD2 dependent stretch current may be an enhancement of direct TREK-1 mechanosensitivity; however, the enhancement mechanism is not required as the channel is directly activated by PA in purified lipids absent stretch and tension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The mechanism for TREK-1 nanoscopic movement is both cholesterol dependent (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) and mechanically dependent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), suggesting a shear thinning mechanism of GM1 clusters. Shear thinning is a process where viscous mixtures become more fluid in response to shear or stretch. The process is kinetic and works by mechanical disruption of noncovalent bonds allowing the molecules to move relative to each other (See <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">S5f</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure S2h</xref> shows a proposed model of PLD2 activation by shear thinning. Prior to shear, the ordered GM1 clusters present a surface that is amenable to palmitate binding. This attracts PLD2 to GM1 lipids through an ordered lipid-lipid interaction. When shear is applied, the ordered GM1 lipids deform (shown as bent lipid acyl chains), but they remain ordered. The deformation is shown altering the binding surface for palmitate, which decreases the lipid-lipid interaction and increases PLD2 fluidity in the membrane (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplemental Fig. S3d</xref>). The decrease in membrane cholesterol (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>) likely evolved to further decrease the palmate order in the palmitate binding site.</p>
<p>The translocation of TREK-1 to PIP<sub>2</sub> clusters appears to be conformation dependent, as the xPLD/TREK-1 combination associated less with PIP<sub>2</sub> after shear compared to the mPLD/TREK-1 combination (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d,f</xref>) despite an increase in PIP<sub>2</sub> and TREK-1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2c-d</xref>). This is consistent with the up down model of the gating helix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref> shows a theoretical mechanism for combined PA signaling and direct force from lipid in a biological membrane. Induced conformational changes are maintained in the helix-up (open) position, only when PLD2 is present and able to produce local PA. If PA is absent, PIP<sub>2</sub> is in higher concentration, which forces the channel closed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and the helix in the down position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3e-f</xref>).</p>
<p>The latency of PLD2 dependent activation is important since it indicates the potential physiological processes where PLD2 may function in mechanotransduction. Based on diffusion from GM1 to PIP<sub>2</sub>, we estimated a latency of 650 us<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In our electrophysiology experiments we cannot rule out an initial fast component from direct TREK-1 mechanosensation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, inset). Nonetheless, using the rise in TREK-1 activity with wild type PLD2, we calculated a putative upper limit on the time for PLD2 to be activated and generate PA near TREK-1.</p>
<p>After instrument delay we observed initial TREK-1 currents almost immediately and the current appeared significance within 2.1 ms at 60 mmHg (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). This is likely faster than the error in our instrument setup. We did not calibrate the exact error of our setup, but based on estimates from the manufacturer, 10 ms is a very conservative upper limit.</p>
<p>The requirement for both PLD2 activity and the C-terminus to activate TREK-1 by pressure further validates the previous conclusion that TREK-1 is lipid-gated by a local high concentration of PA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In theory, PLD2 activity could raise the global PA levels sufficient to activate TREK-1 without being localized through a protein-protein interaction, but we did not see this with truncated TREK-1 and 60 mmHg pressure in HEK293 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>
<p>Many important signaling molecules are palmitoylated including tyrosine kinases, GTPases, CD4/8, and almost all G-protein alpha subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> and palmitoylation alone is sufficient to target proteins to GM1 domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Translocation of these proteins, or a palmitoylated binding partner, from lipid domains by mechanical force could alter their available substrates and affect downstream signaling. Lipid cluster disruption and its effect on palmitoylated G-proteins likely explains at least some of the mechanosensitivity of many GPCRs<sup>4,7–</sup></p>
<p><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> and suggests TREK-1 may share a distant mechanism of activation with many TRP channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. A common pathway is further suggested by the fact that lipid clustering modulates TRP channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and functions downstream of anionic lipid signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Many ion channels are also palmitoylated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. For example, the voltage-gated sodium channel (Na<sub>v</sub>)1.9 clusters with GM1 lipids and its de-clustering (by chemically removing cholesterol) induces a corresponding pain response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>PA’s regulation of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> mechanosensation and pain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) adds <italic>in vivo</italic> support to a growing list of anionic lipids that set force-sensing thresholds. For example, PIP<sub>2</sub> sets the threshold for mechanical B-cell activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Likewise, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), an anionic lipid similar to PA, regulates pain in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. PLD’s activation by mechanical force and substrate presentation helps explain how anionic lipids could directly set pain thresholds and mechanosensitivity via canonical mechanosensitive ion channels.</p>
<p>Ork1 is the closest homolog to TREK-1 in flies. However, Ork1 is predicted to be most like K2P channels TALK-1 and TALK-2 in humans not TREK-1. In cultured mammalian cells, TALK-1 is insensitive to mechanical stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> and they are not among the channels that bind PLD2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. This suggests that PLD has evolved to regulate distinct mechano-effectors in flies and mammals. A single lipid regulating multiple channels simultaneously may have a greater affect compared to a single channel.</p>

<title>Expression and Purification of TREK-1</title>
<p>Expression and purification of TREK-1 was performed as previously explained<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Briefly, Pichia pastoris (SMD1163H) transformed with the TREK-1 gene in pPICZ-B vector was grown in 2.8L baffled flasks. Overnight cultures were grown overnight at 30C, 250rpm to an OD600 of ∼16. Cells are then harvested and resuspended in minimal methanol media and incubation temp is reduced to 25C. Induction was maintained by the addition of 0.5% methanol every 12 hours. Expression was continued for ∼48-60 hours. Cells were pelleted, frozen in N2l, and stored at -80C.</p>
<p>Cells were milled and powder was added to lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl, 60 mM dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM), 0.1 mg/mL DNAse 1, 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mg/ml soy trypsin inhibitor, 1 mM benzamidine, and 0.1 mg/ml AEBSF, with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride added immediately before use) at a ratio of 1g pellet/4mL lysis buffer. After stirring for 4 hours membranes were extracted at 35,000 xg for 45 min and supernatant was applied to cobalt resin (Clontech) column by gravity flow. Column was serially washed and eluted in IMAC buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl, 4 mM DDM, pH 8) with 30 mM and 300 mM imidazole respectively. Eluted protein was concentrated and applied to Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DDM).</p>

<title>Flux Assay</title>
<p>The flux assay was performed similarly as previously published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Briefly, 5 μL of sonicated proteoliposomes was added to 195 μL of flux assay buffer (150mM NaCl, 20mM HEPES pH 7.4, 2μM ACMA) in duplicates in a black 96-well plate (Costar 3915). A protocol was set up on a Tecan M200 Pro to initially read the fluorescence (excitation 410, emission 490) every twenty seconds for one minute as a baseline. The temperature inside the plate reader was set at 25°C. Then, using the protonophore CCCP (1μM final concentration), we collapsed the electrical potential allowing protons into the vesicles. Fluorescence was read every twenty seconds for seven minutes. Next, the potassium-selective ionophore valinomycin (20nM final concentration) was added to terminate the chemical gradient, and fluorescence was read every twenty seconds for five to ten minutes. An average of the duplicates was taken, and then the data was normalized similar to that published in Su et al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Briefly, at each time point (<italic>F</italic>-<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>start</italic></sub>)/(<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>start</italic></sub> – <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>end</italic></sub>) was calculated, where <italic>F</italic> is the fluorescent value at that time, <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>start</italic></sub> is the average of the first four initial readings before the addition of CCCP, and <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>end</italic></sub> is the final fluorescent value after 5 minutes of valinomycin. Next, control proteoliposome flux was normalized to 1 throughout CCCP, and the TREK flux was normalized to the control accordingly. In flux assay figures, addition of CCCP occurs at <italic>t</italic>=80 seconds and ends at <italic>t</italic>=520 seconds before valinomycin was added.</p>

<p>HEK293t cells (ATCC Cat# CRL-3216, RRID:CVCL_0063) were maintained in the solution consisting of the DMEM (Corning cellgro) culture media, 10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Cells were plated on poly-D-lysine-coated 12 mm microscope cover glass ∼12h, ∼36h, or ∼60 h before transfection in low confluence (5%, 2.5%, or 1.25%). Genes for target proteins were transiently co-transfected to HEK293t cells with X-tremeGENE 9 DNA transfection agent (Roche Diagnostics).

Mouse PLD2 constructs(mPLD2) without GFP tag in pCGN vector were gifts from Dr. Michael Frohman. Both functional (mPLD2) and inactive mutant (mPLD2-K758R, single mutation) form of mPLD2 were used together blindly to test mPLD2 effect on hTREK-1. hTREK-1 was co-transfected with mPLD2 or K758R with the 1(0.5g of hTREK-1):4(2g of PLD2) ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.

<p>The transfected HEK293t cells were used in 24∼36 hr. after transfection. Standard excised inside-out patch-clamp recording procedure for TREK-1 was performed following the lead of others (Brohawn et al., 2014; Honore et al, 2006; Coste et al., 2010). Currents were recorded at room temperature with Axopatch 200B amplifier and Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices). Borosilicate glass electrode pipettes (B150-86-10, Sutter Instrument) were pulled with the Flaming/Brown micropipette puller (Model P-1000, Sutter instrument) resulting in 3∼6 MΩ resistances with the pipette solution (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 3 MgCl2, 10 TEA-Cl, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 (adjusted with NaOH). Bath solution consists of (in mM): 140 KCl, 3 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 TEA-Cl, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2 (adjusted with KOH). Low concentration of TEA (10 mM), which has been known to be insensitive to TREK-1 current (Piechotta et al., 2011), was added into both pipette/bath solutions to block the endogenous potassium channels in HEK293 cells (Thomas and Smart, 2005). Patch electrodes were wrapped with parafilm to reduce capacitance. Currents measured using Clampex 10.3(Molecular Devices) were filtered at 1 kHz, sampled at 20 kHz, and stored on a hard disk for later analysis. Pressure clamping on the patch was performed using high speed pressure clamping system (ALA Scientific) through the Clampex control. Data was analyzed off-line by a homemade procedure using IgorPro 6.34A (WaveMetrics).</p>
<p>hTREK-1 current either co-expressed with mPLD2 or K758R was activated by negative pressure steps from 60 to 0 mmHg in 10 mmHg decrements at +30 mV membrane potential, and 5 traces for each case were recorded and averaged for the analysis. Inside-out patch has generally less patch size variability than cell-attached recording when pressure clamped (Suchyna et al., 2009), but in other to further minimize the patch size variability in inside-out patches, patch size was estimated using a method described by Sakman and Neher (Sakman and Neher,1995), and the current density (I_density; pA/µm<sup>2</sup>) was calculated for the further analysis. Then, a Boltzman equation, I_density = base +{max/[1+exp((P50-P)/slope)]} was used to fit the data with a constraint of base=1 due to poor saturation of the current at high pressure. P is the applied pressure, P50 is the pressure that activates 50% of maximum current, and slope shows the sensitivity of current activation by pressure. In some experiments with hTREK-1+K758R co-expression where the activated currents were too small to fit to the Boltzman equation, the current amplitude at P=-30 mmHg (I_m30) was compared with its 5x standard deviation(I_5xSD). If I_m30 &lt; I_5xSD, the experiment was excluded from the Boltzman equation fitting and corresponding P50-slope analysis. This empirical rule (we call it 5xSD rule) can discern 4 out of 5 wilt type cell-attached recording cases as null experiments suggesting that it could be a usable/useful empirical criterion for our experiment. Then, the current density at -60 mmHg and P50-slope data were used for statistical analysis. Mann Whitney test was done to assess statistical significance using Prism6 (GraphPad software), and outliers were eliminated using a built-in function in Prism with Q = 1 %. The values represented are Mean +/-SEM.</p>

Currents were elicited by a biphasic step voltage command (at -10 and -100 mV from V<sub>hold</sub> = -60 mV) and ramp voltage commands (short ramp = -120 mV to -10 mV in 440 ms, and long ramp = -100 mV to +50 mV in 1 sec) in absence and presence of quinidine (200 µM), which was used as a known TREK1 blocker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. The subtracted 200 µM quinidine sensitive currents from the long ramp were used to obtain the current density at 0 mV. Mann Whitney test was done to assess statistical significance using Prism6 (GraphPad software), and outliers were eliminated using a built-in function in Prism with Q = 1 %.</p>

<title>Fixed cell preparation</title>
<p>C2C12 cells were grown to 80% confluence and then allowed to differentiate overnight in serum free media. Cells were rinsed, treated as needed, and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 10 min to fix both protein and lipids. Glutaraldehyde was reduced with 0.1% NaBH4 for 7 min followed by three-10 min washes with PBS. Cells were permeabilized for 15 min with 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with 10% BSA/0.05% Triton/PBS at rt. for 90 min. Primary antibody (PLD2, Cell Signaling #13891; TREK-1, Santa Cruz #sc-50412; PIP<sub>2</sub>, Echelon Biosciences #z-P045) was added to a solution of 5% BSA/0.05% Triton/PBS for 60 min at rt at a concentration of 1:100 followed by 5 washes with 1%BSA/0.05% Triton/PBS for 15 min each. Secondary antibody (Life Technologies #A21244 and A21235; cy3B antibodies were produced as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>) was added in the same buffer as primary for 30 min at rt followed by 5 washes as above. A single 5 min wash with PBS was followed by a post-fix with fixing mixture, as above, for 10 min w/o shaking. This was followed by three-5 min. washes with PBS and two-3 min. washes with dH2O. Cells only receiving CTxB treatment were not permeabilized.</p>
<p>The dual-fixation protocol is used to minimize any effects from post-fixation aberrations. While always good practice for super-resolution in general, this dual fixation also ensures that the movement of any molecule of interest which may not have been immobilized by the initial fixation can be fully immobilized after labeling since the antibodies or toxins used for labeling will be efficiently cross-linked during this post-labeling fixation step. While some have proposed that this problem should be solved by adding the label before the initial fixation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> we believe that in the absence of easily-attainable monomeric labeling molecules it would have likely led to clustering artifacts due to the (often) multimer nature of the labeling proteins.</p>

<title>Super-resolution dSTORM imaging</title>
<p>Images were recorded with a Vutara 352 and VXL super-resolution microscopes (Bruker Nano Surfaces, Salt Lake City, UT) which is based on the 3D Biplane approach. Super-resolution images were captured using a Hamamatsu ORCA Flash4.0 sCMOS camera and a 60x water objective with numerical aperture 1.2. Data were analyzed by the Vutara SRX software (version 5.21.13). Single molecules were identified by their brightness frame by frame after removing the background. Identified particles were then localized in three dimensions by fitting the raw data in a customizable region of interest (typically 16 X16 pixels) centered on each particle in each plane with a 3D model function that was obtained from recorded bead data sets. Fit results were stored as data lists for further analysis.</p>

The GLOX/BME buffer was not required for eGFP blinking, but it did improve the fluorescence and the number of localization particles determined. The resolution of eGFP_TREK-1 and cy3b labeled anti TREK-1 were comparable (47±14 nm vs. 38±6 respectively).</p>
<p>Pair correlation and cluster analysis was performed using the Statistical Analysis package in the Vutara SRX software. Pair correlation analysis is a statistical method used to determine the strength of correlation between two objects by counting the number of points of probe 2 within a certain donut-radius of each point of probe 1. This allows for localization to be determined without overlapping pixels as done in traditional diffraction-limited microscopy. Localization at super resolution is beyond techniques appropriate for diffraction-limited microscopy such as Pearson’s correlation coefficient.</p>
<p>The resolution of dSTORM images was calculated with the resolution analysis feature of the VutaraSRX software. The resolution was calculated in the xy plane using 10 nm pixel size for each cell used for pair correlation and the mean determined.</p>

<p>For behavior experiments, 1 to 5-day old flies were collected in vials containing ∼50 flies at least 12 hours before the experiment. Flies were allowed to acclimate to behavior room conditions for &gt;30 min (dim red light, ∼75% humidity) before each assay. Shock avoidance was tested by placing flies in a T-maze where they could choose between an arm shocking at the indicated voltage every 2 seconds and an arm without shock. Flies were given 2 min to choose which arm, after which flies were collected and counted to determine the shock avoidance index for each voltage and genotype. Control and knockout flies were alternated to avoid any preference and the arm used for shock was also alternated to control for any non-shock preference in the T-maze itself. Shock avoidance index (AI) was calculated as AI=(# flies shock arm-# flies control arm)/# flies total.

<p>Cholera toxin labeling: The cholera toxin and antibody probes used to label the lipids in our study have been shown to cause artificial clustering in unfixed cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Clustering of proteins in unfixed cells is called “antibody patching”. Antibody patching has been used in the past to segregate proteins into distinct compartment for determining their localization in a biological membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Here we expect antibody patching to have the same effect on lipids which would provide a beneficial effect for clearly determining localization of proteins with lipids in the membrane.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, to mitigate other potential artifacts from clustering, cells were fixed twice, once during treatment to decrease lipid movement, and then again after labeling to ensure good dSTORM localization precision. We tested diffusion after fixing using our typical experimental setup and procedures. In our system, fixing with combined paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde effectively inhibited diffusion of GM1 lipids as measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5g-h</xref>)).</p>
<p>Potential artifacts resulting from differences in labeling density and overcounting are also possible artifacts. This could impact the size of the lipid clusters we analyzed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. We quantified the amount of fluorescent labeling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3h</xref>. A small decrease in labeling was observed after shear, but the change was not statistically significant. The translocation of PLD2 between domains was determined by cross-correlation analysis which is not subject to artifacts from changes in labeling density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Hence, our data showing a movement of proteins between domains is largely independent of artifacts arising from any artificial clustering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. This conclusion is also supported by the similar dSTORM results obtained from eGFP and cy3b-anti-TREK-1 antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">S4</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>The role of lipids and lipid order in mechano-transduction.</title>
<p>The plasma membrane is composed of lipids which can cluster into separate and distinct domains with unique properties such as thickness and charge (<bold>a</bold>). These domains contain proteins which localize to them through post-translational acylation (<bold>b</bold>). Domain localization exposes proteins to micro-environments which can regulate their activity. For example, our previous findings showed that PLD is localized to GM1-labeled domains due to its palmitoylation sites (<bold>c</bold>, top). This sequesters PLD from high concentrations of substrate (phosphatidylcholine) and activating lipid (PIP2). Upon chemical or mechanical disruption of the domain, the environment changes, instead favoring PLD translocation and activation (<bold>b</bold>, bottom) by substrate presentation. This process is a form of cellular transduction. (<bold>d</bold>) Transduction is known to occur directly between a mechanical to chemical signal using raft-localized enzymes, but it is unknown whether electrical transduction also occurs directly or can be facilitated through a secondary mechanism.</p></caption>

Release of stretch could in theory force the channel into a closed conformation by a large amount of direct pressure on the channel (large red arrows). In a thin membrane this would cause the helix to move up to 8 Å away from the membrane and potentially disrupt the PLD2/TREK-1 interaction allowing PLD2 to translocate back to GM1 lipids.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study poses a provocative mechanism of channel activation of the mechanically activated ion channel TREK-1. The data provide evidence that the application of shear to cells causes a redistribution of both TREK-1 and an associated enzyme, PhospholipaseD2 in the membrane that increases the enzyme activity. The work offers a new mechanism; however, evidence is <bold>incomplete</bold> and restricted to the over-expression system used.</p>

<p>Force sensing and gating mechanisms of the mechanically activated ion channels is an area of broad interest in the field of mechanotransduction. These channels perform important biological functions by converting mechanical force into electrical signals. To understand their underlying physiological processes, it is important to determine gating mechanisms, especially those mediated by lipids. The authors in this manuscript describe a mechanism for mechanically induced activation of TREK-1 (TWIK-related K+ channel. They propose that force induced disruption of ganglioside (GM1) and cholesterol causes relocation of TREK-1 associated with phospholipase D2 (PLD2) to 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) clusters, where PLD2 catalytic activity produces phosphatidic acid that can activate the channel. To test their hypothesis, they use dSTORM to measure TREK-1 and PLD2 colocalization with either GM1 or PIP2. They find that shear stress decreases TREK-1/PLD2 colocalization with GM1 and relocates to cluster with PIP2. These movements are affected by TREK-1 C-terminal or PLD2 mutations suggesting that the interaction is important for channel re-location. The authors then draw a correlation to cholesterol suggesting that TREK-1 movement is cholesterol dependent. It is important to note that this is not the only method of channel activation and that one not involving PLD2 also exists. Overall, the authors conclude that force is sensed by ordered lipids and PLD2 associates with TREK-1 to selectively gate the channel. Although the proposed mechanism is solid, some concerns remain.</p>
<p>1. Most conclusions in the paper heavily depend on the dSTORM data. But the images provided lack resolution. This makes it difficult for the readers to assess the representative images.</p>
<p>2. The experiments in Figure 6 are a bit puzzling. The entire premise of the paper is to establish gating mechanism of TREK-1 mediated by PLD2; however, the motivation behind using flies, which do not express TREK-1 is puzzling. Importantly, data in this figure is not convincing.</p>

<p>This manuscript by Petersen and colleagues investigates the mechanistic underpinnings of activation of the ion channel TREK-1 by mechanical inputs (fluid shear or membrane stretch) applied to cells. Using a combination of super-resolution microscopy, pair correlation analysis and electrophysiology, the authors show that the application of shear to a cell can lead to changes in the distribution of TREK-1 and the enzyme PhospholipaseD2 (PLD2), relative to lipid domains defined by either GM1 or PIP2. The activation of TREK-1 by mechanical stimuli was shown to be sensitized by the presence of PLD2, but not a catalytically dead xPLD2 mutant. In addition, the activity of PLD2 is increased when the molecule is more associated with PIP2, rather than GM1 defined lipid domains. The presented data do not exclude direct mechanical activation of TREK-1, rather suggest a modulation of TREK-1 activity, increasing sensitivity to mechanical inputs, through an inherent mechanosensitivity of PLD2 activity. The authors additionally claim that PLD2 can regulate transduction thresholds in vivo using Drosophila melanogaster behavioural assays. However, this section of the manuscript overstates the experimental findings, given that it is unclear how the disruption of PLD2 is leading to behavioural changes, given the lack of a TREK-1 homologue in this organism and the lack of supporting data on molecular function in the relevant cells. This work will be of interest to the growing community of scientists investigating the myriad mechanisms that can tune mechanical sensitivity of cells, providing valuable insight into the role of functional PLD2 in sensitizing TREK-1 activation in response to mechanical inputs, in some cellular systems.</p>
<p>The authors convincingly demonstrate that, post application of shear, an alteration in the distribution of TREK-1 and mPLD2 (in HEK293T cells) from being correlated with GM1 defined domains (no shear) to increased correlation with PIP2 defined membrane domains (post shear). These data were generated using super-resolution microscopy to visualise, at sub diffraction resolution, the localisation of labelled protein, compared to labelled lipids. The use of super-resolution imaging enabled the authors to visualise changes in cluster association that would not have been achievable with diffraction limited microscopy. However, the conclusion that this change in association reflects TREK-1 leaving one cluster and moving to another overinterprets these data, as the data were generated from static measurements of fixed cells, rather than dynamic measurements capturing molecular movements.</p>
<p>When assessing molecular distribution of endogenous TREK-1 and PLD2, these molecules are described as &quot;well correlated: in C2C12 cells&quot; however it is challenging to assess what &quot;well correlated&quot; means, precisely in this context. This limitation is compounded by the conclusion that TREK-1 displayed little pair correlation with GM1 and the authors describe a &quot;small amount of TREK-1 trafficked to PIP2&quot;. As such, these data may suggest that the findings outlined for HEK293T cells may be influenced by artefacts arising from overexpression.</p>
<p>The changes in TREK-1 sensitivity to mechanical activation could also reflect changes in the amount of TREK-1 in the plasma membrane. The authors suggest that the presence of a leak currently accounts for the presence of TREK-1 in the plasma membrane, however they do not account for whether there are significant changes in the membrane localisation of the channel in the presence of mPLD2 versus xPLD2. The supplementary data provide some images of fluorescently labelled TREK-1 in cells, and the authors state that truncating the c-terminus has no effect on expression at the plasma membrane, however these data provide inadequate support for this conclusion. In addition, the data reporting the P50 should be noted with caution, given the lack of saturation of the current in response to the stimulus range.</p>
<p>Finally, by manipulating PLD2 in D. melanogaster, the authors show changes in behaviour when larvae are exposed to either mechanical or electrical inputs. The depletion of PLD2 is concluded to lead to a reduction in activation thresholds and to suggest an in vivo role for PA lipid signaling in setting thresholds for both mechanosensitivity and pain. However, while the data provided demonstrate convincing changes in behaviour and these changes could be explained by changes in transduction thresholds, these data only provide weak support for this specific conclusion. As the authors note, there is no TREK-1 in D. melanogaster, as such the reported findings could be accounted for by other explanations, not least including potential alterations in the activation threshold of Nav channels required for action potential generation. To conclude that the outcomes were in fact mediated by changes in mechanotransduction, the authors would need to demonstrate changes in receptor potential generation, rather than deriving conclusions from changes in behaviour that could arise from alterations in resting membrane potential, receptor potential generation or the activity of the voltage gated channels required for action potential generation.</p>
<p>This work provides further evidence of the astounding flexibility of mechanical sensing in cells. By outlining how mechanical activation of TREK-1 can be sensitised by mechanical regulation of PLD2 activity, the authors highlight a mechanism by which TREK-1 sensitivity could be regulated under distinct physiological conditions.</p>

<p>The manuscript &quot;Mechanical activation of TWIK-related potassium channel by nanoscopic movement and second messenger signaling&quot; presents a new mechanism for the activation of TREK-1 channel. The mechanism suggests that TREK1 is activated by phosphatidic acids that are produced via a mechanosensitive motion of PLD2 to PIP2-enriched domains. Overall, I found the topic interesting, but several typos and unclarities reduced the readability of the manuscript. Additionally, I have several major concerns on the interpretation of the results. Therefore, the proposed mechanism is not fully supported by the presented data. Lastly, the mechanism is based on several previous studies from the Hansen lab, however, the novelty of the current manuscript is not clearly stated. For example, in the 2nd result section, the authors stated, &quot;fluid shear causes PLD2 to move from cholesterol dependent GM1 clusters to PIP2 clusters and this activated the enzyme&quot;. However, this is also presented as a new finding in section 3 &quot;Mechanism of PLD2 activation by shear.&quot;</p>
<p>For PLD2 dependent TREK-1 activation. Overall, I found the results compelling. However, two key results are missing.</p>
<p>
1. Does HEK cells have endogenous PLD2? If so, it's hard to claim that the authors can measure PLD2-independent TREK1 activation.</p>
<p>
2. Does the plasma membrane trafficking of TREK1 remain the same under different conditions (PLD2 overexpression, truncation)? From Figure S2, the truncated TREK1 seem to have very poor trafficking. The change of trafficking could significantly contribute to the interpretation of the data in Figure 1.</p>
<p>For shear-induced movement of TREK1 between nanodomains. The section is convincing, however I'm not an expert on super-resolution imaging. Also, it would be helpful to clarify whether the shear stress was maintained during fixation. If not, what is the time gap between reduced shear and the fixed state. lastly, it's unclear why shear flow changes the level of TREK1 and PIP2.</p>
<p>For the mechanism of PLD2 activation by shear. I found this section not convincing. Therefore, the question of how does PLD2 sense mechanical force on the membrane is not fully addressed. Particularly, it's hard to imagine an acute 25% decrease cholesterol level by shear - where did the cholesterol go? Details on the measurements of free cholesterol level is unclear and additional/alternative experiments are needed to prove the reduction in cholesterol by shear.</p>
<p>
Importantly, there is no direct evidence for &quot;shear thinning&quot; of the membrane and the authors should avoid claiming shear thinning in the abstract and summary of the manuscript.</p>
<p>The authors should also be aware that hypotonic shock is a very dirty assay for stretching the cell membrane. Often, there is only a transient increase in membrane tension, accompanied by many biochemical changes in the cells (including acidification, changes of concentration etc). Therefore, I would not consider this as definitive proof that PLD2 can be activated by stretching membrane.</p>

<p>The images were provided are at 300 dpi. Perhaps the reviewer is referring to contrast in Figure 2? We are happy to increase the contrast or resolution.</p>
<p>As a side note, we feel the main conclusion of the paper, mechanical activation of TREK-1 through PLD2, depended primarily on the electrophysiology in Figure 1b-c, not the dSTORM. But both complement each other.</p>

<p>The fly experiment shows that PLD mechanosensitivity is more evolutionarily conserved than TREK-1 mechanosensitivity. We should have made this clearer.</p>

<p>Figure 6B is a confocal image, it is not dSTORM. There is no dSTORM in Figure 6. This should have been made clear in the figure legend. For reference, only a few cells would fit in the field of view with dSTORM.</p>

<p>Yes, 1g is physiologically relevant. It is almost the force needed to wake a fly from sleep (1.2-3.2g).  See ref 33. Murphy Nature Pro. 2017.</p>

<p>Yes, osmotic swell activates TREK1. This was shown in ref 19 (Patel et al 1998). We agree the 70 mOsm is a high degree of stress. This needs to be stated better in the paper.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree, the downstream effectors of PLD2 mechanosensitivity are not known in the fly. Other anionic lipids have been shown to mediate pain see ref 46 and 47. We do not wish to make any claim beyond PLD2 being an in vivo contributor to a fly’s response to mechanical force.</p>
<p>That said we do believe we have established a molecular function at the cellular level. We showed PLD is robustly mechanically activated in a cultured fly cell line (BG2-c2) Figure 6a of the manuscript. And our previous publication established mechanosensation of PLD (Petersen et. al. Nature Com 2016) through mechanical disruption of the lipids. At a minimum, the experiments show PLDs mechanosensitivity is evolutionarily better conserved across species than TREK1.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for his/her concern about expression levels. We did test TREK-1 expression. mPLD decreases TREK-1 expression ~two-fold (see Author response image 1). We did not include the mPLD data since TREK-1 was mechanically activated with mPLD. For expression to account for the loss of TREK-1 stretch current (Figure 1b), xPLD would need to block surface expression of TREK-1. The opposite was true, xPLD2 increased TREK-1 expression increased (see Figure S2c). Furthermore, we tested the leak current of TREK-1 at 0 mV and 0 mmHg of stretch. Basal leak current was no different with xPLD2 compared to endogenous PLD (Figure 1d; red vs grey bars respectively) suggesting TREK-1 is in the membrane and active when xPLD2 is present. If anything, the magnitude of the effect with xPLD would be larger if the expression levels were equal.</p>

<p>Finally, by manipulating PLD2 in D. melanogaster, the authors show changes in behaviour when larvae are exposed to either mechanical or electrical inputs. The depletion of PLD2 is concluded to lead to a reduction in activation thresholds and to suggest an in vivo role for PA lipid signaling in setting thresholds for both mechanosensitivity and pain. However, while the data provided demonstrate convincing changes in behaviour and these changes could be explained by changes in transduction thresholds, these data only provide weak support for this specific conclusion. As the authors note, there is no TREK-1 in D. melanogaster, as such the reported findings could be accounted for by other explanations, not least including potential alterations in the activation threshold of Nav channels required for action potential generation. To conclude that the outcomes were in fact mediated by changes in mechanotransduction, the authors would need to demonstrate changes in receptor potential generation, rather than deriving conclusions from changes in behaviour that could arise from alterations in resting membrane potential, receptor potential generation or the activity of the voltage gated channels required for action potential generation.</p>

<p>We are willing to restrict the conclusion about the fly behavior as the reviewers see fit.  We have shown PLD is mechanosensitivity in a fly cell line, and when we knock out PLD from a fly, the animal exhibits a mechanosensation phenotype.</p>

<p>This work provides further evidence of the astounding flexibility of mechanical sensing in cells. By outlining how mechanical activation of TREK-1 can be sensitised by mechanical regulation of PLD2 activity, the authors highlight a mechanism by which TREK-1 sensitivity could be regulated under distinct physiological conditions.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript &quot;Mechanical activation of TWIK-related potassium channel by nanoscopic movement and second messenger signaling&quot; presents a new mechanism for the activation of TREK-1 channel. The mechanism suggests that TREK1 is activated by phosphatidic acids that are produced via a mechanosensitive motion of PLD2 to PIP2-enriched domains. Overall, I found the topic interesting, but several typos and unclarities reduced the readability of the manuscript. Additionally, I have several major concerns on the interpretation of the results. Therefore, the proposed mechanism is not fully supported by the presented data. Lastly, the mechanism is based on several previous studies from the Hansen lab, however, the novelty of the current manuscript is not clearly stated. For example, in the 2nd result section, the authors stated, &quot;fluid shear causes PLD2 to move from cholesterol dependent GM1 clusters to PIP2 clusters and this activated the enzyme&quot;. However, this is also presented as a new finding in section 3 &quot;Mechanism of PLD2 activation by shear.&quot;</p>
<p>For PLD2 dependent TREK-1 activation. Overall, I found the results compelling. However, two key results are missing.</p>
<p>1. Does HEK cells have endogenous PLD2? If so, it's hard to claim that the authors can measure PLD2-independent TREK1 activation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, there is endogenous PLD (enPLD). We calculated the relative expression of xPLD2 vs enPLD. xPLD2 is &gt;10x more abundant (Fig. S3d of Pavel et al PNAS 2020, ref 14 of the current manuscript). Hence, as with anesthetic sensitivity, we expect the xPLD to out compete the endogenous PLD, which is what we see. This should have been described more carefully in this paper and the studies pointed out that establish this conclusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Does the plasma membrane trafficking of TREK1 remain the same under different conditions (PLD2 overexpression, truncation)? From Figure S2, the truncated TREK1 seem to have very poor trafficking. The change of trafficking could significantly contribute to the interpretation of the data in Figure 1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>If the PLD2 binding site is removed (TREK-1trunc), yes, the trafficking to the plasma membrane is unaffected by the expression of xPLD and mPLD (Figure R1 above). For full length TREK1 (FL-TREK-1), co-expression of mPLD decreases TREK expression (Figure R1) and co-expression with xPLD increases TREK expression (Figure S2). This is exactly opposite of what one would expect if surface expression accounted for the change in pressure currents. Hence, we conclude surface expression does not account for loss of TREK-1 mechanosensitivity with xPLD2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For shear-induced movement of TREK1 between nanodomains. The section is convincing, however I'm not an expert on super-resolution imaging. Also, it would be helpful to clarify whether the shear stress was maintained during fixation. If not, what is the time gap between reduced shear and the fixed state. lastly, it's unclear why shear flow changes the level of TREK1 and PIP2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Shear was maintained during the fixing. We do not know why shear changes PIP2 and TREK-1 levels. Presumably endocytosis and or release of other lipid modifying enzymes affect the system. The change in TREK-1 levels appears to be directly through an interaction with PLD as TREKtrunc is not affected by over expression of xPLD or mPLD.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For the mechanism of PLD2 activation by shear. I found this section not convincing. Therefore, the question of how does PLD2 sense mechanical force on the membrane is not fully addressed. Particularly, it's hard to imagine an acute 25% decrease cholesterol level by shear - where did the cholesterol go? Details on the measurements of free cholesterol level is unclear and additional/alternative experiments are needed to prove the reduction in cholesterol by shear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The question “how does PLD2 sense mechanical force on the membrane” we addressed and published in Nature Comm. In 2016. The title of that paper is “Kinetic disruption of lipid rafts is a mechanosensor for phospholipase D” see ref 13 Petersen et. al.  PLD is a soluble protein associated to the membrane through palmitoylation. There is no transmembrane domain, which narrows the possible mechanism of its mechanosensation to disruption.</p>
<p>The Nature Comm. reviewer identified as “an expert in PLD signaling” wrote the following of our data and the proposed mechanism:</p>
<p>&quot;This is a provocative report that identifies several unique properties of phospholipase D2 (PLD2). It explains in a novel way some long established observations including that the enzyme is largely regulated by substrate presentation which fits nicely with the authors model of segregation of the two lipid raft domains (cholesterol ordered vs PIP2 containing). Although PLD has previously been reported to be involved in mechanosensory transduction processes (as cited by the authors) this is the first such report associating the enzyme with this type of signaling... It presents a novel model that is internally consistent with previous literature as well as the data shown in this manuscript. It suggests a new role for PLD2 as a force transduction tied to the physical structure of lipid rafts and uses parallel methods of disruption to test the predictions of their model.&quot;</p>
<p>Regarding cholesterol. We use a fluorescent cholesterol oxidase assay which we described in the methods. This is an appropriate assay for determining cholesterol levels in a cell which we use routinely. We have published in multiple journals using this method, see references 28, 30, 31. Working out the metabolic fate of cholesterol after sheer is indeed interesting but well beyond the scope of this paper. Furthermore, we indirectly confirmed our finding using dSTORM cluster analysis (Figure 3d-e). The cluster analysis shows a decrease in GM1 cluster size consistent with our previous experiments where we chemically depleted cholesterol and saw a similar decrease in cluster size (see ref 13). All the data are internally consistent, and the cholesterol assay is properly done. We see no reason to reject the data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Importantly, there is no direct evidence for &quot;shear thinning&quot; of the membrane and the authors should avoid claiming shear thinning in the abstract and summary of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We previously established a kinetic model for PLD2 activation see ref 13 (Petersen et al Nature Comm 2016). In that publication we discussed both entropy and heat as mechanisms of disruption. Here we controlled for heat which narrowed that model to entropy (i.e., shear thinning) (see Figure 3c).  We provide an overall justification below. But this is a small refinement of our previous paper, and we prefer not to complicate the current paper. We believe the proper rheological term is shear thinning. The following justification, which is largely adapted from ref 13, could be added to the supplement if the reviewer wishes.</p>
<p>Justification: To establish shear thinning in a biological membrane, we initially used a soluble enzyme that has no transmembrane domain, phospholipase D2 (PLD2). PLD2 is a soluble enzyme and associated with the membrane by palmitate, a saturated 16 carbon lipid attached to the enzyme. In the absence of a transmembrane domain, mechanisms of mechanosensation involving hydrophobic mismatch, tension, midplane bending, and curvature can largely be excluded. Rather the mechanism appears to be a change in fluidity (i.e., kinetic in nature). GM1 domains are ordered, and the palmate forms van der Waals bonds with the GM1 lipids. The bonds must be broken for PLD to no longer associate with GM1 lipids.  We established this in our 2016 paper, ref 13. In that paper we called it a kinetic effect, however we did not experimentally distinguish enthalpy (heat) vs. entropy (order). Heat is Newtonian and entropy (i.e., shear thinning) is non-Newtonian. In the current study we paid closer attention to the heat and ruled it out (see Figure 3c and methods). We could propose a mechanism based on kinetic disruption, but we know the disruption is not due to melting of the lipids (enthalpy), which leaves shear thinning (entropy) as the plausible mechanism.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors should also be aware that hypotonic shock is a very dirty assay for stretching the cell membrane. Often, there is only a transient increase in membrane tension, accompanied by many biochemical changes in the cells (including acidification, changes of concentration etc). Therefore, I would not consider this as definitive proof that PLD2 can be activated by stretching membrane.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comment noted. We trust the reviewer is correct. In 1998 osmotic shock was used to activate the channel. We only intended to show that the system is consistent with previous electrophysiologic experiments.</p>
