<title>Abstract</title><p>Genomic loss of the transcriptional kinase <italic>CDK12</italic> occurs in ∼6% of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers (mCRPC) and correlates with poor patient outcomes. Prior studies demonstrate that acute CDK12 loss confers a homologous recombination (HR) deficiency (HRd) phenotype via premature intronic polyadenylation (IPA) of key HR pathway genes, including <italic>ATM.</italic> However, mCRPC patients have not demonstrated benefit from therapies that exploit HRd such as inhibitors of polyADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Based on this discordance, we sought to test the hypothesis that an HRd phenotype is primarily a consequence of acute <italic>CDK12</italic> loss and the effect is greatly diminished in prostate cancers adapted to <italic>CDK12</italic> loss. Analyses of whole genome sequences (WGS) and RNA sequences (RNAseq) of human mCRPCs determined that tumors with biallelic <italic>CDK12</italic> alterations (<italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic>) lack genomic scar signatures indicative of HRd, despite carrying bi-allelic loss and the appearance of the hallmark tandem-duplicator phenotype (TDP). Experiments confirmed that acute CDK12 inhibition resulted in aberrant polyadenylation and downregulation of long genes (including <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic>) but such effects were modest or absent in tumors adapted to chronic <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic>. One key exception was <italic>ATM</italic>, which did retain transcript shortening and reduced protein expression in the adapted <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> models. However, <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic>cells demonstrated intact HR as measured by RAD51 foci formation following irradiation. <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> cells showed a vulnerability to targeting of CDK13 by sgRNA or CDK12/13 inhibitors and <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment of prostate cancer xenograft lines showed that tumors with <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic>responded to the CDK12/13 inhibitor SR4835, while CDK12-intact lines did not. Collectively, these studies show that aberrant polyadenylation and long HR gene downregulation is primarily a consequence of acute CDK12 deficiency, which is largely compensated for in cells that have adapted to CDK12 loss. These results provide an explanation for why PARPi monotherapy has thus far failed to consistently benefit patients with CDK12 alterations, though alternate therapies that target CDK13 or transcription are candidates for future research and testing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Large scale genomic analyses of localized and metastatic prostate cancers (PC) have identified a large spectrum of recurrent somatic alterations that involve the activation of oncogenic signaling pathways or the inactivation of tumor suppressor processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). For example, the androgen receptor (AR) serves as a key therapeutic target for most metastatic PCs, and recurrent somatic events that drive persistent AR activity promote treatment resistance and the emergence of metastatic castration resistant PC (mCRPC). A subset of other recurrent genomic alterations observed in mCRPC confer differential sensitivity to specific treatments: notably, mutations in genes involved in homology directed DNA repair (HR), such as <italic>BRCA2</italic>, confer responses to poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, and mutations in genes involved in DNA mismatch repair such as <italic>MSH2</italic> and <italic>MSH6</italic> associate with exceptional responses to immune checkpoint blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In addition to other frequent genomic aberrations that include gene fusions involving <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> and <italic>ERG</italic>, mutations in <italic>TP53</italic>, and loss of <italic>PTEN</italic>, there is a ‘long tail’ of genes altered in 3-10% of mCRPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Though by definition, genes comprising the ‘long tail’ involve smaller subsets of patients, the high prevalence of PC in the population means that events occurring at low frequency will still affect thousands of individuals. The classification of tumors with both common and rarer genomic alterations may aid prognosis and prioritize the allocation of treatments.</p>
<p>The gene encoding c<italic>yclin dependent kinase 12</italic> (<italic>CDK12)</italic> is functionally compromised by bi-allelic mutation or copy loss in about 5% of mCRPC cases (and in 1-2% of primary prostate cancers)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). <italic>CDK12</italic> is also lost in 3-4% of ovarian cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). CDK12 is a transcription-associated kinase that pairs with Cyclin K (<italic>CCNK</italic>) to form an active complex that phosphorylates the RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II) C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). A germline <italic>Cdk12</italic> knockout is embryonic lethal in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). CDK12 has been reported to regulate mRNA splicing, suppress upstream intronic polyadenylation sites (IPAs), and maintain transcriptional elongation, especially for very large genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Several genes involved in DNA repair, especially members of the HR pathway, are large (i.e. &gt;50kb) and have been reported to be selectively downregulated in <italic>CDK12</italic> loss models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). This has led to a proposed outcome whereby <italic>CDK12</italic> loss in patient tumors may phenocopy HR deficiency (HRd). This is of notable clinical relevance as HRd tumors respond well to genotoxic platinum chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors (PARPi), which have proven to be effective across a range of cancers with underlying HR gene mutations, including mCRPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior studies have evaluated the consequences of <italic>CDK12</italic> deficiency in a variety of experimental models, though nearly always under acute loss conditions including: protein degraders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), <italic>CDK12</italic> knockdown or genetic knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), or treatment with small molecule CDK12/13 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Acute CDK12 loss in cell models results in the down-regulation of HR associated genes, suppression of HR-mediated DNA repair, and synthetic lethality with PARP1/2 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). However, an HRd phenotype resulting from <italic>CDK12</italic> loss has not been confirmed in assessments of patient tumors or clinically with therapeutics that exploit HRd, and there are conflicting reports on the presence of HRd-associated genomic ‘scars’ in <italic>CDK12</italic> mutant cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Crucially, mCRPC patients with <italic>CDK12</italic>-alterations have shown poor responses to PARPi, despite the fact that <italic>CDK12</italic> mutation is a labeled indication for two approved PARP inhibitors: olaparib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) and talazoparib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). A notable deficiency in the field has been the lack of models with a stable <italic>CDK12<sup>-/-</sup></italic>genotype, as <italic>CDK12</italic> loss is poorly tolerated and attempts to generate long-term stable cell lines models have failed with the exception of an engineered <italic>CDK12<sup>-/-</sup></italic>ovarian cancer line, which notably does not exhibit cisplatin or PARPi sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). The objectives of this study were to address the molecular and phenotypic discordance between the preclinical studies associating <italic>CDK12</italic> loss with HRd, and <italic>in vivo</italic> human pathobiology, and identify vulnerabilities in PCs with <italic>CDK12</italic> loss that have potential applications for clinical management.</p>

<title>Identification of genomic characteristics that associate with <italic>CDK12</italic> loss in prostate cancer</title>
<p>To ascertain genomic and phenotypic alterations that associate with biallelic <italic>CDK12</italic> loss (<italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic>) in PC, we analyzed several large datasets where deep molecular assessments of tumors included analyses of genomic alterations by whole exome sequencing (WES) or whole genome sequencing (WGS), and metrics of gene expression by RNAseq. Four datasets with these criteria were evaluated: the SU2C/PCF International study of mCRPC comprising 442 tumors (SU2C-I), the SU2C/PCF US West Coast study of mCRPC comprising 101 tumors (SU2C-WC), the Hartwig Foundation study of metastatic PC comprising 168 tumors (HMF), and the University of Washington Autopsy study of mCRPC comprising 269 tumors from 127 patients (UW)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Collectively, 39 tumors from 832 patients (4.7%) with at least 20% tumor cellularity were classified as <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic>. These grouped by: 1 with biallelic copy loss (2.5%), 15 with single copy loss with a pathogenic second allele mutation (38.5%), and 23 (31%) with biallelic pathogenic mutation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S1</xref>). Of the pathogenic mutations, 31 (31%) were localized to the kinase domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>). In addition, monoallelic <italic>CDK12</italic> pathogenic genomic alterations were identified in 92 tumors (11%) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Patterns of CDK12 genomic alterations and tandem duplication phenotype</title><p><bold>(a)</bold> The number of samples harboring a <italic>CDK12</italic> genomic alteration are shown for four CRPC cohorts. <italic>CDK12</italic> alterations that lead to bi-allelic loss (<italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic>): homozygous deletion, 2 or more (2+) small mutations (SNV/INDEL), or 1 mutation plus a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) event. CDK12 alterations that lead to monoallelic loss (CDK12<sup>MAL</sup>): 1 small mutation or hemizygous deletion leading to LOH. Deletion was determined based on copy loss relative to the tumor ploidy.

<p>Having identified cohorts of PCs with and without <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic>, we next sought to determine if <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> tumors exhibited evidence of HRd. Various mutational processes, including the loss of mechanisms that repair DNA damage through HR, produce characteristic signatures of residual structural alterations or mutations that can be classified according to the type of mutagen or compromised repair mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Cancers with HRd are notable for genome instability resulting in large regions of copy loss and gain that can be scored based on metrics of loss of heterozygosity (LOH). LOH scores in PCs with <italic>BRCA2<sup>BAL</sup></italic> were significantly greater than PCs without biallelic loss of <italic>BRCA2</italic>, <italic>CDK12</italic> or <italic>TP53</italic> (‘All Intact’ group)(Mann-Whitney U p=2.8e<sup>-3</sup>), whereas LOH scores in tumors with <italic>CDK12</italic><sup>BAL</sup> were not different than ‘All Intact’ tumors (p=1.0)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S1</xref>, Methods).</p>
<p>COSMIC single base substitution (SBS) mutation signature 3 (CSig3) is associated with HRd and can be determined through WES or WGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). We determined that 10 of 39 tumors (26%) classified as <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> had evidence of CSig3 activity, a CSig3 proportion distribution which did not significantly differ compared to ‘All Intact’ tumors (Mann-Whitney U p=1.00)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S1</xref>, Methods). In contrast, 46 of 69 (65%) PCs with <italic>BRCA2</italic> biallelic loss exhibited CSig3 signatures, having a trend of higher CSig3 activity than in <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> tumors (p&lt;0.06)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref>).</p>
<p>CDK12 inactivation is documented to be associated with a tandem duplicator phenotype (TDP) classified by numerous copy gains of duplications across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Of the 38 tumors with biallelic <italic>CDK12</italic> loss that were evaluable for a TDP, 34 exhibited a TD genome (89%) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>). Of the four <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> tumors that were TDP(−), three had mutations after the key functional kinase domain (amino acids 727-1020)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S1</xref>), which may be less likely to completely abolish protein function.</p>
<p>Overall, we classified 46 tumors with a TDP across all cohorts, including nine with monoallelic <italic>CDK12</italic> alteration and 3 with no alterations in <italic>CDK12</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1e</xref>, Methods). Notably, six different TDP groups have been described, based on the size of the duplicated segment and whether the size distributions are unimodal or bimodal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Prior reports determined that tumors with <italic>CDK12</italic> loss generally categorize as Group 6 with TDs exhibiting a bimodal size of ∼230kb and ∼1.7Mb whereas tumors with <italic>BRCA1</italic> loss classify as Group 1 TDP with a unimodal size of ∼10kb. Of the 46 mCRPCs with a TDP, 30 (65%) classified as Group 6, 11 (37%) in Group 3 (median 2.6 Mb), and 3 (7%) as Group 2 (median</p>
<p>∼380kb) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1a,b</xref>, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Table S2</xref>). One of 30 tumors that exhibited a Class 6 TDP did not have <italic>CDK12</italic> genomic alterations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1b</xref>). No tumors with biallelic <italic>BRCA2</italic> loss exhibited a TDP, though 8 of 31 tumors with monoallelic <italic>BRCA2</italic> alterations classified as a Group 6 TDP and none classified as the Group 1 TDP associated with <italic>BRCA1</italic> loss. Of tumors with <italic>TP53</italic> alterations, 23 (3.7%) classified as TDP+, though of these, 17 also had a <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Table S2</xref>). Collectively, these findings confirm prior reports detailing the unique TDP genomic structure associated with <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> which is distinct from the types of genomic scars associated with HRd.</p>
<p>We next sought to determine the gene composition within tandem duplications (TDs) to assess whether consistent oncogenic drivers or tumor suppressor mechanisms accompanied CDK12 inactivation. The median number of TDs per tumor with a TDP was 103 (range 61-161) and 426 (range 159-781) for WES and WGS data, respectively. We compared the frequency of copy gain by TDs from TDP+ tumors (n=46) against the frequency in tumors without a TDP (TDP-; n=777) and identified 130Mb (2,601 50kb windows) of total regions enriched in TDP+ tumors (Fisher’s exact test; Bonferroni adjusted p-value &lt; 0.001)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Table S2</xref>, Methods). Of 433 genes annotated as Cancer Gene Census oncogenes, 29 were significantly enriched as altered in TDP+ tumors, and 5 of 394 Cancer Gene Census tumor suppressor genes were transected by a TD boundary (p &lt; 0.01) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1f-h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Table S2</xref>).</p>
<p>Though several notable genes with oncogenic functions were enriched in TDs, including <italic>CCND1</italic>, <italic>AKT1</italic> and <italic>MDM4</italic>, there were no genomic regions comprising a TD that recurred with a frequency greater than 40% across the 46 TDP+ tumors. Genes involved in HRd were not significantly altered in TDP tumors. The androgen receptor (AR) and upstream AR enhancer locus were contained within a TD in 18 and 19 of the 46 TDP+ tumors, respectively, with a significantly higher median AR copy number of 3 compared to 2 in non-TDP tumors (p=0.004, two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1i</xref>). <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> was mutually exclusive with <italic>BRCA2<sup>BAL</sup></italic> (p=0.03, one-tailed Fisher’s exact test). Of <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> tumors, 51% also harbored monoallelic (n=9) or biallelic (n=11) <italic>TP53</italic> alterations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1j</xref>) while <italic>PTEN<sup>BAL</sup></italic> only occurred in 1 tumor with <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic>.</p>
<p>While the majority of the mCRPC cohorts were comprised of single tumors from an individual patient, the UW autopsy study included three patients with <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> where multiple tumors were sampled, allowing for assessments of tumor heterogeneity with respect to <italic>CDK12</italic> events. In each patient, all metastatic tumors shared the same <italic>CDK12</italic> alteration, and all tumors exhibited a TDP with the majority of TDs shared across tumors within an individual (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>). These data suggest that <italic>CDK12</italic> alterations are early events in tumorigenesis and support the monoclonal model of metastatic PC dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). However, there was evidence for continued accumulation of TDs as individual metastasis also exhibited a number of unique TDs, a subset of which encompassed oncogenic drivers such as <italic>MYC</italic>, <italic>ETS1</italic>, and <italic>KRAS</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref>). For two tumors, we were able to profile gene expression by whole transcriptome RNAseq. Both tumors expressed high levels of the AR and AR program activity with highly concordant proliferation rates as determined by cell cycle progression (CCP) scores (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>).</p>

<title>Transcriptional alterations in mCRPCs with <italic>CDK12</italic> Loss</title>
<p>While the genomic consequences of <italic>CDK12</italic> loss in PC and other malignancies have been established with respect to features such as tandem duplications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), the assessments of phenotypic alterations in mCRPCs that accompany <italic>CDK12</italic> inactivation have not been evaluated extensively. As a first proxy for phenotype, we analyzed matched whole transcriptome RNAseq data from 332, 96, 135, and 269 tumors having at least 20% tumor cellularity in the SU2C-I, SU2C-WC, HMF and UW mCRPC datasets, respectively, and compared <italic>CDK12</italic> intact tumors against those with <italic>CDK12</italic><sup>BAL</sup> for differential genes, pathways, and hallmarks that reflect relevant biological characteristics of mCPRC. We removed neuroendocrine (NEPC) and AR-negative/NE-negative (DNPC) samples due to their lack of representation in the <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic>group and compared the remainder to a group <italic>CDK12</italic> intact tumors lacking any <italic>CDK12</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> alterations (n=296 tumors). Global comparisons of transcript abundance levels identified 344 genes differentially increased and 333 genes differentially decreased in <italic>CDK12</italic> loss vs intact tumors (log<sub>2</sub> FC and p&lt;0.05 across 2 or more cohorts)(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Table S3</xref>). There was substantial overlap in these differentially expressed genes across the four mCRPC cohorts (Bonferroni adjusted p-values&lt;0.0001, pairwise hypergeometric tests)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2b-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Table S3</xref>). We observed concordance in these datasets with previously reported gene expression alterations resulting from <italic>CDK12</italic> loss including the upregulation of <italic>ARID3C</italic>, <italic>TBX4</italic>, and downregulation of <italic>TSACC</italic> and <italic>CDNF</italic> in mCRPCs with <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic>, along with enrichment of a CDK12-loss transcriptional signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2a</xref>).</p>
<p>mCRPCs are now recognized to exhibit subtypes classified by differentiation states reflecting androgen receptor (AR), neuroendocrine (NE), and other lineage programs. Compared to <italic>CDK12</italic> intact tumors, mCRPCs with <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> exhibited significantly higher AR expression and AR activity (p=0.002, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2d-g</xref>). Notably, of 29 tumors classified as NEPC in the cohorts, none harbored <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> and overall NE activity scores were not different in <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> tumors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2f</xref>). The cell cycle progression score (CCP), a metric of cell proliferation, did not distinguish <italic>CDK12</italic> status (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2g</xref>). The expression of the alternatively spliced ARv7 transcript was higher in tumors with <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> (p=0.004, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), further supporting an AR-driven phenotype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2h</xref>). Several pathways were reproducibly altered in <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> mCRPCs including alterations in cell cycle, androgen response, spliceosome and DNA replication (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2l,m</xref>).</p>
<p>We considered several mechanisms that could explain the differential gene expression in <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> mCRPCs. We confirmed a prior study reporting high rates of gene rearrangements and fusion transcripts that associate with <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> (p=5e<sup>-6</sup>, Wilcoxon rank-sum test)(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2i</xref>). However, only 22 of 623 fusion transcripts were recurrent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2j</xref>), and overall did not explain the differential expression of specific genes recurrently altered across studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2h</xref>). In contrast, several COSMIC-defined oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes located within regions of TDs were increased at the transcript level and were recurrent across mCRPCs with <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2k</xref>). Genes involved in HR were not involved in gene fusion events and were not commonly transected by gene rearrangements or TDPs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1h</xref>).</p>
<p>A key function of CDK12 involves the regulation of gene transcription by complexing with Cyclin K to phosphorylate the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II which promotes transcriptional elongation and the synthesis of full-length mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Notably, acute loss of CDK12 in cell line models results in decreased expression of a small subset of genes that are long and comprise large numbers of exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Genes with these characteristics shown to be influenced by acute CDK12 depletion include several involved in HR DNA repair such as <italic>ATM</italic>, <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>ATR</italic>, <italic>FANCI</italic>, and <italic>FANCD2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). To determine if the expression of long genes or those with large numbers of exons were differentially altered in PCs with <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic>we analyzed the whole transcriptome RNAseq data from the four mCRPC datasets collectively and individually. We found no overall associations between differentially downregulated genes in <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic>vs <italic>CDK12</italic>-intact tumors based on gene length when integrating tumors from all cohorts (p=0.26) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>). However, other gene parameters were associated with lower transcript levels in the context of <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> including longer coding sequence length, longer transcript length, and shorter 3’UTR length (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig S3a-c</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition to gene length-dependent effects on transcriptional elongation, acute inhibition of CDK12 activity results in premature cleavage and polyadenylation (PCPA), with the use of alternative polyadenylation sites (APA), particularly in genes with features such as large gene length, greater exon numbers, large first intron, and more intronic poly(A) sites (IPAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Several genes involved in DNA damage repair fit these criteria. CDK12 has been shown to globally repress the use of intronic polyadenylation sites and the consequent expression of full-length transcripts whereas cells with CDK12 depletion exhibit elevated numbers of truncated transcript isoforms resulting from IPA usage. Analysis of previously published RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) using the APAlyzer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>) tool confirmed the reported selective increase in intronic APA usage in the TCGA-PRAD primary tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig S3d</xref>). In mCRPC, preferential upregulation of APA sites was observed tumors with <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> in each of the mCRPC cohorts, though to variable degrees (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig S3e,f</xref>).</p>
<p>Several genes involved in sensing and repairing DNA damage via HR are large, and prior studies have reported downregulation of several including <italic>ATM</italic>, <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> in the context of acute CDK12 loss which contributes to a ‘BRCAness’ phenotype with compromised HR. We confirmed prior studies demonstrating increased use of internal polyadenylation sites in ATM and a modest reduction in transcript reads derived from the distal 3’ exon (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3e,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2i-l</xref>).

First, we chose to replicate acute loss conditions using approaches described in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). We evaluated whether acute CDK12 inhibition caused long gene downregulation via transcript shortening, as would be expected from a role of CDK12 in suppressing APA usage. As there are no pharmacological agents that exclusively impede CDK12 activity, we used the dual CDK12/13 inhibitor SR4835 to acutely inhibit CDK12 function. Because some large DNA repair genes, including <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic>, show cell cycle linked expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), palbociclib (Palbo) was used as a control to demonstrate the extent of mRNA decrease solely due to G1 arrest. Actinomycin D (ActD) served as a control for non-specific RNA-Pol II inhibition. Genes downregulated by SR4835 skewed longer (Students t-test p=3.2e<sup>-4</sup> for LNCaP; p=3.3e<sup>-88</sup> for LuCaP35_CL) than upregulated or unchanged genes, while such effects were non-significant or reversed (i.e. shorter genes downregulated) upon Palbo or ActD treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>). This result is based on gene length (introns+exons) and not the spliced transcript length, in which case all treatments caused preferential downregulation of longer transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig S4a</xref>). Though all three treatments led to some increases and decreases in APA site usage, SR4835 led to more selective enrichment for upregulated APA site usage (7,929 up, 11.0 up/down ratio) compared to ActD (3,257 up, 2.1 up/down ratio) and Palbo (1,700 up, 1.2 up/down ratio) in LNCaP with similar results in LuCaP35_CL (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4b</xref>). After six hours of treatment, SR4835 resulted in substantial alterations in gene expression (1,128 down / 201 up in LNCaP; 2,933 down / 2,009 up in LuCaP35_CL) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>), including down regulation of multiple genes involved in the DNA repair pathways, in particular HR (13/31 in LNCaP and 22/31 in Lu-CaP_35CL) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4d</xref>). Pathway analysis showed that although SR4835 caused a significant decrease in the HR pathway activity by negative enrichment score (NES) (−1.1, FDR=0.9 for LNCaP, and –1.2, FDR=0.34 for LuCaP35_CL), palbociclib caused a much greater decrease (−1.9, FDR=0.001 in LNCaP, and –1.9, FDR=0.006 in LuCaP35_CL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig S4c</xref>). In fact, approximately half (16/30 in LNCaP and 24/58 in LuCaP35_CL) of the downregulated KEGG pathways upon SR4835 treatment are also downregulated by palbociclib, leading to some difficulty in assigning which effects are due broadly to cell cycle arrest vs CDK12/13 specific effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4d</xref>). However, some genes did show SR4835-selective downregulation (e.g. <italic>ATM</italic>; –0.88 log2(fold), p&lt;0.0001) and others (e.g. <italic>RAD51D</italic>) were downregulated more dramatically with SR4835 (−0.77, p&lt;0.0001) than Palbo (−0.33, p=0.002) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4e</xref>). Thus, while the transcriptional effects from CDK12/13i treatment may be partially confounded by cell arrest effects, several key DNA repair genes do show selective downregulation.</p>

<p>To determine if levels of proteins involved in DNA repair pathways were concordantly diminished, LNCaP and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells were treated for 6, 24 or 48h with SR4835 and proteins were analyzed by immunoblot (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig S4e,f</xref>). In agreement with previous studies, BRCA2, ATM, and ATR protein decreased at 24h and 48h post treatment with 200nM SR4835. Acute CRISPR/Cas9 mediated CDK12 KO in LNCaP and C4-2B cells also led to decreased BRCA2 and ATM protein expression by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4g</xref>). Double strand DNA (dsDNA) breaks, as indicated by γH2A.X, increased by 48h (LNCaP) and 24h (22Rv1) of SR4835 treatment but was largely ablated with the addition of Z-VAD, a pan-caspase inhibitor. Similar results were observed with an ovarian cancer line, Skov3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig S4f</xref>). Thus, while SR4835 does cause moderate decreases in key DNA repair proteins, most of the corresponding γH2A.X appears due to caspase-dependent apoptosis and not impaired DNA repair directly.</p>
<p>To test if transcript shortening was responsible for the DNA repair gene downregulation with SR4835, qRT-PCR was performed with specific primers for 5’ and 3’ regions of each target. SR4835, but not ActD or Palbo, led to specific 3’ transcript loss in the long genes tested including <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic>, <italic>ATM</italic>, <italic>ATR</italic>, <italic>HDAC1</italic>, and <italic>VCL</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4g</xref>). Together, these results confirm mRNA shortening, the APA activation phenotype, and downregulation of transcripts and proteins involved in HR in prostate cancer models under acute CDK12 loss conditions.</p>
<p><italic>CDK12</italic> is classified as a ‘common essential’ gene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org/portal/">https://depmap.org/portal/</ext-link>) and CDK12/13 inhibitors cause apoptosis after 24-48h (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4e,f</xref>). Despite this essentiality, a subset of human prostate cancers do tolerate the loss of <italic>CDK12</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). We next investigated the possibility that cells adapted to CDK12 loss might show a different phenotype than cells undergoing acute CDK12 depletion. To carry out these studies, we developed a new <italic>in vitro</italic> model of <italic>de novo CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> prostate cancer by generating a cell line (LuCaP189.4_CL) from the LuCaP189.4 patient derived xenograft (PDX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>) that carries bi-allelic <italic>CDK12</italic> frameshift mutations (p.S345Gfs*10, p.S521Qfs*89) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig S4h</xref>). Lu-CaP 189.4 does not express detectable CDK12 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig S4i</xref>) and exhibits a classic tandem duplicator phenotype (TDP) that is a hallmark of <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig S4j</xref>). We quantified the abundance of 5’ vs 3’ transcript levels by qRT-PCR in three <italic>CDK12</italic> intact PC models and LuCaP189.4_CL and found that only the <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> LuCaP189.4_CL displays a selective 3’ decrease (log2(fold) mean difference) in <italic>ATM</italic> (0.72, p&lt;0.0001) and <italic>ATR</italic> (0.72, p=0.004<italic>)</italic>, but non-significant or 3’ increases in <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>BRCA2, HDAC4,</italic> and <italic>VCL</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a</xref>), indicating that these long genes are less affected by APA and splicing effects in cells naturally adapted to tolerate the absence of <italic>CDK12</italic>.</p>

<p>To further study the transcriptional features of cells adapted to <italic>CDK12</italic> loss, CRISPR-mediated knockout (KO) clones were generated in 22Rv1 (two clones: KO2 and KO5) and Skov3 cells (one clone: KO1), and LuCaP189.4_CL cells were engineered to re-express CDK12 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, very few clones tolerated <italic>CDK12</italic> deletion, and those that did grow slower than the parental lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4k</xref>). The 22Rv1 KO clones were generated with dual sgRNAs generating mutations in exons 1 and 4 that were validated by targeted PCR showing large insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5a</xref>) and frameshift indels as seen from RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5b</xref>). The Skov3-CDK12-KO1 clone was generated with a single CDK12 sgRNA and contains two frameshift indels (+1 and −1) detected in exon 1 RNA-seq reads (not shown). At the protein level, cells with <italic>CDK12</italic> deletion showed slight increases in CDK13 and decreases in CCNK/CyclinK but no obvious decrease in p-Ser2 RNA Polymerase II/RBP1/POLR2A levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b</xref>). The <italic>CDK12</italic>-KO clones did not show decreases in ATR, BRCA1, or BRCA2 protein but did show decreased ATM compared to the parental lines (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> LuCaP189.4_CL showed comparable levels of these DNA repair genes, and although the re-expression of CDK12 was not very robust, ATM protein was slightly increased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b</xref>). Consistent with the results in the <italic>de novo CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> LuCaP189.4_CL, the 22Rv1 <italic>CDK12</italic>-KO clones also exhibited persistent 3’ vs 5’ transcript decreases (mean log2(fold)) in <italic>ATM</italic> (1.16, p &lt;0.001 for KO2 and 1.71, p&lt;0.0001 for KO5) and <italic>ATR</italic> (0.84, p&lt;0.0001 for KO2 and 0.88 p&lt;0.0001 for KO5), but minimal 5’/3’ difference in <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>BRCA2,</italic> or <italic>VCL</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5c</xref>). The 22Rv1 <italic>CDK12</italic>-KO clones did show lower overall <italic>BRCA1</italic> (–1.46 KO2, –1.01 KO5) and <italic>BRCA2</italic> (–1.79 KO2, –0.97 KO5) mRNA levels (log2(fold) vs DMSO, 3’ primer set) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5c</xref>). However, reduced transcripts of these genes may be due to cell-cycle linked expression and the slower proliferation of these clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig S4k</xref>) and not a direct result of <italic>CDK12</italic> loss. The 22Rv1-CDK12 KO clones did not display an obvious TDP pattern from low coverage WGS copy number analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5c</xref>), especially compared to LuCaP189.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4j</xref>).</p>
<p>RNAseq based assessments of the isogenic <italic>CDK12</italic> intact versus knockout lines identified no enrichment for longer genes among those with lower expression in the stable 22Rv1-<italic>CDK12</italic>-KO clones (p=0.99 for KO2 and p=0.094 for KO5), though there was enrichment in the Skov3-<italic>CDK12</italic>-KO1 line (p=1.5e<sup>-20</sup>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5d</xref>). APA analysis found modest increases in IPA site usage (UP/DOWN ratio) in the <italic>CDK12</italic>-KO5 (1.2) and Skov3-<italic>CDK12</italic>-KO1 (2.7), but not 22Rv1-<italic>CDK12</italic>-KO2 (0.8) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S6a</xref>), far less dramatic than under acute CDK12 inhibition which had UP/DOWN ratios of 11.0 in LNCaP and 6.1 in LuCaP35_CL (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4b</xref>). These results show that, with the notable exception of <italic>ATM</italic>, most long genes (including <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic>) do not show downregulation in tumor cells that have adapted to <italic>CDK12</italic> loss. Though some genes show IPA alterations, the phenotype is far less apparent than under acute loss conditions. Furthermore, though CDK12 inactivation in the Skov3 ovarian cancer cells showed some preferential downregulation of long genes overall (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5d</xref>), BRCA1 and BRCA2 protein were not affected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b</xref>).</p>

<title>Cells adapted to <italic>CDK12</italic> loss are HR competent and lack exceptional sensitivity to PARPi or platinum chemotherapy</title>
<p>A key early step in HR involves BRCA2-mediated loading of RAD51 onto resected ssDNA. Loss of key HR pathway members, including BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2, all lead to loss of RAD51 loading and initiation of HR repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Though CDK12-KO cells retain BRCA1 and BRCA2 protein expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b</xref>), it remains possible that HR function could still be altered by other means. To test this possibility, in addition to the CDK12-KO clones, LNCaP, 22Rv1, and Skov3 cells were engineered with Tet-inducible shBRCA2 or shCDK12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig S6b</xref>). Cells were exposed to 6Gy ionizing radiation (IR) and immunostained for γH2A.X and RAD51 at 3h post irradiation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S6c-e</xref>). 22Rv1-Tet-shBRCA2 cells functioned as an HRd control: shBRCA2 without dox went from 1.0 to 1.8 RAD51 foci per cell after IR, while dox treated cells went from 0.5 to 0.6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5f</xref>). Following IR, the RAD51 foci per cell in 22Rv1-CDK12-KO lines increased from 1.2 to 2.9 in KO2 (p=0.04) and 0.9 to 2.4 in KO5 (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). Likewise, the <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> LuCaP189.4_CL was competent at inducing RAD51 foci (1.4 to 5.4 foci per cell, p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig S6c</xref>). Since only G2/M cells can use HR repair, we also used an alternate quantification metric of % cells with 5 or more foci (i.e. % of population undergoing HR) which showed that <italic>BRCA2</italic> knockdown greatly reduced the RAD51 population after IR (13.9% indox, 1.5% in +dox) while the 22Rv1-<italic>CDK12</italic>-KO clones and LuCaP189.4_CL showed a high proportion (25-28%) of HR-functioning cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5g</xref>). Additional experiments with TetshBRCA2 and Tet-shCDK12 in LNCaP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig S6d</xref>) and Skov3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig S6e</xref>) produced similar results, with CDK12 knockdown unable to prevent RAD51 foci induction (i.e. non-significant differences after IR between shCDK12 line −/+dox). These results with CDK12 knockdown and knockout, across multiple models, show that CDK12 deficient cells maintain the ability to load RAD51 and initiate HR repair.</p>
<p>Though cells adapted to survive CDK12 loss do not exhibit compromised HR, the possibility remains that CDK12 loss could sensitize to platinum chemotherapies or PARPi via other mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Dose response curves were performed with carboplatin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>) and the PARPi olaparib (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i</xref>) using various prostate cancer lines, plus <italic>BRCA1</italic>-deficient UWB1.289 ovarian cancer cells as a <italic>bona fide</italic> HRd control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Though UWB1.289 showed the expected sensitivity to both carboplatin (EC50 0.36uM) and olaparib (0.71 uM) at 8 days, LuCaP189.4_CL was not sensitive (carboplatin EC50 = 19.15; olaparib EC50 &gt;100uM). Inducible knockdown of <italic>BRCA2</italic> in 22Rv1 cells altered the EC50 of carboplatin from 5.92 μM to 2.16 μM with dox, whereas the two 22Rv1 <italic>CDK12</italic>-KO clones showed either a greater or equivalent EC50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig S7a</xref>). Skov3-<italic>CDK12</italic>-KO1 showed no difference in response to carboplatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7b</xref>) or olaparib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7c</xref>) at 8 days treatment compared to control Skov3 cells. The 22Rv1-<italic>CDK12</italic>-KO clones and <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> LuCaP189.4_CL showed mixed responses to PARPi: in a 12-day treatment, LuCaP189.4_CL (EC50 0.20μM) and the 22Rv1-<italic>CDK12</italic>-KO clones (0.88μM for KO2, 0.92μM for KO5) displayed some sensitivity to olaparib compared to 22Rv1 (17.37μM), but not to the same extent as UWB1.289 (0.08μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig S7d</xref>). LuCaP189.4_CL did not show enhanced sensitivity in an 8 day exposure to rucaparib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig S7e</xref>). In 14 day treatments with organoids harvested from PDX tumors, <italic>CDK12</italic>-intact LuCaP lines (23.1, 170.2, 86.2CR) had EC50 ranges of 2.23-6.33μM for olaparib while LuCaP189.4 was at 13.30μM, showing no apparent sensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig S7f</xref>) as was also the case with rucaparib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig S7g</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that stable CDK12 loss does not sensitize to carboplatin, though the effect on PARPi sensitivity is less consistent with clonal variation, but significantly less than the <italic>bona fide</italic> HRd line UWB1.289.</p>

The LuCaP189.4_CL, which does not express CDK12, was the only natural line tested without negative growth effects upon sgCDK12 transduction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>), while LNCaP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c-d</xref>), C4-2B (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>), Skov3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref>), and 22Rv1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7h,i</xref>) all showed significantly reduced growth (p&lt;0.006) by confluence in sgCDK12 vs sgAAVS1, most dramatically in C4-2B (47.3% with sgAAVS1, 2.6% with sgCDK12). While LNCaP, C4-2B, and Skov3 tolerated CDK13 CRISPR lentivirus with no significant difference vs AAVS1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6c-f</xref>), cells with stable <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> loss: LuCaP189.4_CL and Skov3-CDK12-KO1, showed a marked growth inhibition with sgCDK13 vs control (LuCaP189.4_CL: 59.5% vs 88.3%, p&lt;0.0001, Skov3-KO1: 5.6% vs 12.9%, p=0.004) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6b,g</xref>). Of interest, the growth of 22Rv1 was repressed by either CDK12 or CDK13 sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig S7i</xref>). However, 22Rv1-<italic>CDK12</italic>-KO5 appeared to have almost complete growth suppression with sgCDK13 from Day 5 to 14 (0.8% to 0.8%) compared to sgAAVS1 (0.6% to 5.5%) while parental 22Rv1 with sgCDK13 still had measurable growth (1.6% to 6.3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig S7h-j</xref>).</p>

<p>Due to high protein conservation, all currently available pharmacological inhibitors of CDK12 also inhibit CDK13. We performed dose response curves with two different selective CDK12/13 inhibitors: SR4835, an ATP competitive inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7k</xref>), and THZ531, a covalent binding inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7l-m</xref>). SR4835 was reported to have a dissociation constant of 4.9nM for CDK13, 98nM for CDK12, and &gt;800nM for all other kinases tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) while THZ531 was measured to have an IC50 value of 69nM for CDK13, 158nM for CDK12, and &gt;8µM for CDK7 and CDK9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). LuCaP189.4_CL and the <italic>CDK12</italic>-KO 22Rv1 clones all showed higher sensitivity to THZ531 with EC50 of 88.6nM for 22Rv1 vs 17.3nM (KO2) and 33.3nM (KO5) and 37.8nM (LuCaP189.4-vec) vs 52.6nM for cells with re-expressed CDK12 (LuCaP189.4-CDK12) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6i</xref>). Under 3D growth conditions, LuCaP189.4 spheroids were also more sensitive to THZ531 (EC50: 77nM) than LuCaP35 (145nM) or RWPE1 (223nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7m-n</xref>). Surprisingly, the <italic>CDK12</italic>-KO clones did not show the same curve shift with SR4835 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6h</xref>), though LuCaP189.4_CL was quite sensitive with an EC50 of 38nM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6h</xref>) and 29nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig S7k,n</xref>) measured in different experiments. This difference could be due to the fact that SR4835 is a non-covalent inhibitor, while THZ531 is a covalent modifier. Unfortunately, THZ531 has not been deemed usable for <italic>in vivo</italic> use while SR4835 has been used previously in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm whether the CDK13 vulnerability could exploited for <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment, we performed xenograft drug treatments using three LuCaP PDX lines (LuCaP35, LuCaP136, and LuCaP189.4) treated for 28 days with vehicle or SR4835. The dose schedule was the same as previously established in a report from the developers of the compound in a breast cancer PDX experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). LuCaP 35 and 136 are both <italic>CDK12</italic>-intact. At the final 28 day timepoint, vehicle treated LuCaP 189.4 tumor volumes (mm<sup>3</sup>[95%CI]) measured 521[411-630] while SR4835 tumors were smaller at 310[196-425] with a significant (p=0.046) cumulative difference between growth curves (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, twotailed) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6j</xref>). Tumors were harvested and weighed, with SR4835 treated tumor average weight being significantly smaller (0.59 vs 1.08 g, p=0.0015, Mann-Whitney test) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6j</xref>). There were no significant tumor volume or weight reductions in the <italic>CDK12</italic>-intact lines. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that cells lacking CDK12 become dependent on CDK13 for their CCNK/CyclinK activity, thus presenting a potential targeted vulnerability with potential <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy, even with dual CDK12/13 targeting compounds.</p>
<p>We performed RNA-seq on three of the harvested tumors per group after 28 days SR4835, plus a set of LuCaP189.4 PDX tumors treated acutely for 3 days with SR4835 or vehicle. Results were analyzed by APAlyzer and found large upregulation of APA sites in LuCaP189.4 after 3 day treatment (2,958 Up) but not LuCaP 35 after 28 days treatment (342 Up) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6k</xref>). Furthermore, the UP/DOWN ratio of APA usage was only &gt;1.0 for LuCaP189.4 at the 3 day treatment point (3.9 ratio) and at or below 1.0 for all 3 lines in the 28 day treated tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7o</xref>). A selection of example long DNA repair gene transcripts were significantly decreased with the 3d treatment including: <italic>ATM</italic> (log<sub>2</sub> FC –1.1), <italic>ATR</italic> (−1.2), <italic>BRCA1</italic> (−2.6), <italic>BRCA2</italic> (−2.0), and <italic>RAD51D</italic> (−0.8)(all p&lt;0.01 in SR4835 vs vehicle) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6l</xref>). None of these genes were significantly decreased in the 28 day treated tumors, suggesting that cells able to survive and grow in the presence of the CDK12/13 inhibitor no longer show the long gene APA phenotype and downregulation.</p>

<title>CDK12 loss increases sensitivity to selected therapeutics targeting transcription</title>
<p>The most studied function of CDK12 is to maintain RNA polymerase II processivity and proper splicing and polyadenylation. Tumors adapted to CDK12 loss show modest if any alteration in the transcript lengths or APA usage of large genes involved in HR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5b-d</xref>) and no substantial change in RNA-Pol II Ser2 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>), but these adapted cells may still have impaired transcriptional processes which could be exploited. We next tested if cells with CDK12 loss may exhibit enhanced sensitivity to therapeutics targeting transcription mechanisms. Dose response curves revealed a modest selective sensitivity in <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> lines to α-amanitin, an RNA-Pol II poison with EC50 of 779nM for 22Rv1 compared to 506nM (KO2) and 339nM (KO5) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6m</xref>). Re-expression of CDK12 in the LuCaP189.4_CL promoted amanitin resistance to a small but not statistically significant degree (631nM to 735nM, p=0.4) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6m</xref>). These results suggest that cells adapted to CDK12 loss may continue to exhibit compromised transcriptional mechanisms, and that this may lead to a vulnerability to amanitin-class agents or other drugs that target mRNA synthesis or processing.</p>

<title>CDK12 loss does not consistently increase sensitivity to WEE1, ATR, or CHEK1 inhibitors</title>
<p>Among other potential targetable DNA repair pathway vulnerabilities considered, we tested two WEE1 inhibitors: (adavosertib/MK-775) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig S8a</xref>) and PD0166285 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig S8b</xref>). The EC50 values for LuCaP189.4_CL (with or without CDK12 re-expressed) and 22Rv1-<italic>CDK12</italic>-KO2 were all greater than parental 22Rv1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig S8c</xref>). However, 22Rv1-<italic>CDK12</italic>-KO5 did show some increase in sensitivity (EC50) compared to the parental line to adavosertib (0.04μM vs 0.11μM) and PD0166285 (0.10μM vs 0.37μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig S8c</xref>). Considering that adapted <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> cells do retain some ATM transcript shortening and protein decreases (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a,b</xref>), we evaluated ATR as a potential vulnerability. We tested two ATR inhibitors, berzosertib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig S8d</xref>) and elimusertib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig S8e</xref>), but found that LuCaP189.4_CL had the highest EC50 values to both inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig S8f</xref>). 22Rv1-<italic>CDK12</italic>-KO5 (but not KO2) showed a slight increase in sensitivity to berzosertib, and although both KO clones showed some increased sensitivity to elimusertib vs parental, the EC50 curves were similar to LNCaP and C4-2B reducing the likelihood of a CDK12-specific effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig S8f</xref>). Lastly, we tested two CHEK1 inhibitors, rabusertib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig S8g</xref>) and MK-8776 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig S8h</xref>), as potential ATR-related dependencies. However, the results show that LuCaP189.4_CL was the least sensitive line tested to both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig S8i</xref>), and only 22Rv1-<italic>CDK12</italic>-KO5 showed a clear increase in sensitivity vs parental to both rabusertib (0.53μM vs 1.81μM) and MK08776 (0.48μM vs 1.54μM). In summary, one of the tested <italic>CDK12</italic> loss models (22Rv1-<italic>CDK12</italic>-KO5) showed modest CDK12-associated growth repression by WEE1, ATR, and CHEK1 inhibitors. However, since differential treatment effects were not shared with 22Rv1-<italic>CDK12</italic>-KO2 or Lu-CaP189.4_CL it appears that these sensitivities are not consistent, but may relate to alternative mechanisms by which cells survive CDK12 loss.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present work we sought to identify a molecular basis for the discrepancy between the poor clinical responses to PARPi in patients with <italic>CDK12</italic> alterations and preclinical studies demonstrating that <italic>CDK12</italic> loss or pharmacological inhibition compromises HR, phenocopies ‘BRCAness’ and results in synthetic lethality to drugs impeding PARP function. A central feature of most prior studies evaluating CDK12 and HR is the conduct of very short term <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, with timepoints usually less than 72 hours after pharmacological inhibition of CDK12 activity or repressing CDK12 by genetic methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). A key reason for evaluating such acute timepoints is largely due to the fact that CDK12 inhibition leads to proliferation arrest and/or cell death, as CDK12 is a common essential gene in most cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). Acute loss of CDK12 activity clearly results in increased APA site usage and the diminished expression of a cohort of large genes, including several involved in HR. This consequence can contribute to HRd in the immediate setting, and act in synergy with PARPi and DNA damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). However, it should be noted that cell cycle arrest also results in the downregulation of many HR-associated genes, and it is not straightforward to attribute causality specifically to CDK12-mediated transcriptional compromise versus cell cycle-regulated expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). We note that the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib caused more significant downregulation of DNA repair pathways than the CDK12/13 inhibitor SR4835.</p>
<p>In contrast to the acute effects of functional CDK12 loss, cells naturally adapted to survive and proliferate in the context of <italic>CDK12</italic> absence, such as the LuCaP189.4 model and human tumors, show less differential down-regulation of long genes compared to acute CDK12 repression. In analyses of human tumors with <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic>, the expression of genes regulating HR are not reduced, and these tumors do not exhibit genomic scars (such as high LOH) or mutation signatures (such as COSMIC mutation signature 3) that reflect compromised HR found in tumors with <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> loss. Further, using functional assays, such as RAD51 foci formation after radiation, both <italic>de novo CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> cells, and those adapted to tolerate CDK12 deletion by CRISPR/Cas9, demonstrate HR competency.</p>
<p>Through literature searches and cell line database queries, we were not able to identify any cancer models with <italic>de novo CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic>, and only one prior study where a stable <italic>CDK12</italic> deletion in a cancer cell line was generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). This supports the conclusion that <italic>CDK12</italic> is a common essential gene in most cells, with a severe impact on viability that is challenging to overcome. In agreement with the results presented here, the above mentioned A2780 ovarian cancer cell line model with stable <italic>CDK12</italic> deletion showed markedly slower proliferation, increased rates of apoptosis, and no significant reductions in HR-related proteins including ATM, BRCA1, ATR or FANCD2. The A2780 <italic>CDK12</italic> knockout line was also not sensitive to platinum chemotherapy or olaparib, and was 5-fold more resistant to the ATR inhibitor VE822 and the WEE1 inhibitor MK1775 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). We observed variable sensitivities to WEE1, ATR, and CHEK1 inhibitors in the context of CDK12 loss, suggesting actionable vulnerabilities in specific <italic>CDK12</italic> loss-adapted contexts which have yet to be characterized.</p>
<p>Though we did see modest sensitivity to PARPi in <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic>cells in a few experiments, the lack of consistent HR gene downregulation, no effect on RAD51 foci formation, and low scoring of HRd genomic signatures, indicate that PARPi as a monotherapy is unlikely to benefit patients with CDK12<sup>BAL</sup> tumors by exploiting HRd. However, other aspects of compromised CDK12 function could provide a therapeutic window for PARP inhibition as well as other targets. Recent studies revealed that PARPi can act beyond HR and affect other critical cell functions where CDK12 activity may be important including transcription, RNA splicing, R-loop repair, and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>).</p>
<p>The identification of pharmacological vulnerabilities conferred by CDK12 loss is an important research priority. While we did not observe consistent effects using ATR or WEE1 antagonists, CDK13 appears to be an ideal synthetic lethal target for <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> cells, as complete loss of cyclin K activity in tumors would be severe, and other tissues could likely tolerate CDK13 inhibition in the setting of functional CDK12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). However, available pharmacologic inhibitors have been unable to separate CDK12 and CDK13 antagonism due to high protein similarity. This can lead to some toxicity concerns, especially with covalent inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). However, CDK12/13 dual inhibitors may still be useful due to the enhanced sensitivity of <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> tumors to CDK13 inhibition. Furthermore, though less effective than THZ531 in culture assays, SR4835 was effective and generally tolerated well in mice and has been used in at least two published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). We observed modest differential sensitivity in several <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> models to the transcriptional inhibitor α-amanitin. Amanitin-based compounds are extremely toxic, but there is interest in using these drugs in antibody drug conjugates (ADCs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>), which would offer a way to deliver toxic payloads directly and selectively to the tumor.</p>
<p>In addition to transcription-related consequences of CDK12 loss, it is very possible that CDK12 could play additional roles beyond RNAP II that have yet to be explored. Known direct substrates of CDK12 are fairly limited, with RNAP II being the most well studied. However, there is a report that 4EBP1 is a direct CDK12 substrate and confers a role in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>), and LEO1, part of the transcription elongation complex, was also reported as a direct CDK12 substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). CDK12 has also been pulled down in complex with various other factors, including splicing regulators, though it is unclear if they are direct substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>).</p>
<p>Of importance, the direct oncogenic role(s) of <italic>CDK12</italic> loss remains to be determined. Of interest is the limited organ site distribution of tumors with <italic>CDK12</italic> alterations. While the genomic structures of TDs produce a substantial increase in gene rearrangements, we found that very few of these are recurrent, and thus unlikely to serve as drivers of neoplasia. In contrast, a large number of oncogenes are contained within regions of tandem duplication of which several were recurrently gained in copy number, and could individually or collectively represent pathways driving cancer development. Notable among these recurrent events is the AR, which is either gained or amplified within a TD in 46% percent of <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic> tumors. Of interest is the finding that no mCRPCs with a neuroendocrine phenotype had <italic>CDK12<sup>BAL</sup></italic>, suggesting that <italic>CDK12</italic> loss is incompatible with neuroendocrine differentiation, or the <italic>AR</italic> locus copy gains serve to maintain AR signaling and prevent transdifferentiation to other lineages.</p>

All SNV and Indel calls were annotated using ANNOVAR (release 20200607). SNVs were included if they were detected by two or more callers, were not labeled by ClinVar significance as ‘benign’ or ‘likely_benign’, and were annotated as either ‘exonic’ or ‘splicing.’ Indel calls were included if they were not labeled by CLNSIG as ‘benign’ or ‘likely_benign’, were annotated as either ‘exonic’ or ‘splicing,’ and passed the following filters: Alt_reads_in_Tumor &gt;= 5, Ref_reads_in_Tumor &gt;= 10, and a variant allele frequency (VAF) of &gt; 0.1. For patients with discrepant SNV or Indel calls between samples, manual curation was performed using IGV (version 2.16.2). For SU2C-WC WGS data, we obtained mutation calls from the original published results by Quigley et al. 2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). For the Hartwig Medical Foundation (HMF) WGS data, the mutation callset was obtained via controlled access as part of Data Access Request DR-250.

The reference and non-reference allele read counts at each heterozygous SNP were extracted from the tumor sample. SNPs were not analyzed in chromosome X. Copy number analysis was performed using TitanCNA R package v1.15.0. Automatically generated optimal solutions were used.</p>
<p>The following methods were used for analyses of whole genome sequencing data. For SU2C-WC WGS data, copy number alterations, tumor purity, and tumor ploidy was predicted using TITAN (v1.15.0) as originally reported in Zhou et al. 2022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>) using the workflow provided in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/GavinHaLab/TitanCNA_SV_WGS">https://github.com/GavinHaLab/TitanCNA_SV_WGS</ext-link>.

<title>Mutational signature analysis</title>
<p>Mutational signature proportions were determined using the Analyze.cosmic_fit function from SigProfilerAssignment (v0.0.33) and Cosmic Version 3.4. Only SNV calls which passed our filtration were used for signature analysis. One input VCF was made per sample, with each input being reformatted to have five columns in the following order: chromosome, genomic coordinate, sample ID, reference base call, and alternative base call. When running Analyze.cosmic_file, the ‘build’ option was set to ‘GRCh38’, ‘input_type’ was set to ‘vcf’, and the ‘exome’ option was set to true for WES samples. All other options were left as default. To best capture HRD-related mutational signatures, we combined Cosmic Signatures SBS3 and SBS8 into an HRD-signature. Cosmic Signature 3 proportion was obtained by dividing the number of SBS3 SNVs by the total number of input SNVs per sample. The reported proportions were obtained by summing the counts of SBS3 and SBS8 per sample, then dividing by the total number of calls for each sample. We only considered SBS3 or SBS8 calls for samples with more than 50 passing SNVs and a combined SBS3 and SBS8 proportion of &gt;0.05.</p>

<title>Tandem duplicator phenotype classification</title>
<p>Simple tandem duplications (TDs) were predicted from the copy number results genome-wide for each sample. For whole exome sequencing, duplication events must meet these criteria: <bold><italic>(i)</italic></bold> segment is shorter than 10 Mb; <bold><italic>(ii)</italic></bold> have flanking segments with lower copy number; (iii) the difference in copy number between the left and right flanking segment is ≤ 1. Out of the 632 WES samples, 581 were successfully analyzed by TITAN and having tumor purity &gt;0.2 and <italic>MAD</italic> &lt;0.25 were used to identify duplications. For WGS data, the tandem duplications were taken from the intersection of TITAN copy number segments and tandem duplication breakpoints from the final SV call set. As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>), we used the Nearest-Neighbor Index (NNI) metric to distinguish the pattern of tandem duplications being dispersed (value near 1) as opposed to clustered. We applied a threshold for the NNI score as a guideline for manual curation of individual samples. For WES samples, TDP+ was defined as having NNI &gt;1 and median segment length &gt;100kb.</p>
<p>For WGS samples, TDP+ was defined as having NNI &gt;1.25 and median segment length &gt;100kb. Further manual inspection of the copy number profiles confirmed TDP+ and TDP-status.</p>

<title>Tandem duplication size group analysis</title>
<p>To categorize TDP+ cases into TD size (i.e. length) groups, we applied Gaussian mixture model fitting using the densityMclust (mclust v6.1 R package). Input TD segments consists of events meeting the criteria in the TDP classification analysis. For each sample, solutions of one to four possible Gaussian components were used to fit the log10-transformed TD lengths in kilobases. The optimal solution is selected via Bayesian information criteria (default in MClust), and components in the optimal solution with mixed weights ≤ 0.1 or variance. The estimated means for the remaining components determine the size groups: 1-100kb (Group 1), 100kb-1Mb (Group 2), 1-10Mb (Group 3). For solutions with &gt; 1 group (i.e. &gt; 1 component), additional groups were defined: Group 4 (Group 1 + Group 2), Group 5 (Group 1 + Group 3), and Group 6 (Group 2 + Group 3). TD Group size analysis is shown separately for WES and WGS due to differences in copy number segment size resolution – WGS is expected to have higher resolution and therefore smaller TD segments are better represented. Finally, the distribution of the estimated component means is shown for all WES (n=26) and WGS (n=20) samples.</p>

Genes that had a ‘Role in Cancer’ value containing the string “oncogene” or “fusion” were considered in this list of 433 oncogenes. A gene was considered to be altered by a TD if the gene coordinates were fully contained within a TD event (i.e. the TD event spans the entire gene). For each gene, a two-sided Fisher’s exact test was used to determine enrichment of TD alteration frequency between TDP+ and TDP-groups. Bonferroni correction was applied<italic>; 3) COSMIC Cancer Gene Census tumor suppressor genes.</italic> The same Cancer Gene Census file was used as above.

<title>Multi-tumor tandem duplication and phylogenetic analysis of rapid autopsy samples</title>
<p>For UW patient 05-217, input TD segments consisted of events meeting the criteria in the TDP classification analysis. The complete set of TDs within the patient was defined as the union of TD events were taken across all samples within the patient. A matrix consisting of samples by TD event was constructed using 1 for presence of the TD in the sample or 0 if it was absent. A TD event was considered present if the proportion of the overlap by width was ≥ 0.9. This matrix was used to determine the number of overlapping events in pairwise, triplets, and all samples within the patient. This matrix was also used as input into neighbor-joining tree estimation (ape R package) using Manhattan distance to construct a phylogenetic tree with a rooted-tree configuration.

<title>Annotating gene alteration by copy-number</title>
<p>Copy-number segments were excluded if their cellular fraction was lower than 0.8, except for those which were determined as copy neutral or copy-number greater than 4. The gene annotation was based on known protein coding genes from GenCode release 30 (GRCh38.p12). For each gene, its copy-number was assigned to the copy-number value and LOH status of the segment that has the largest overlap with it. The gene-level copy-number was normalized based on ploidy of the corresponding sample, with autosomal genes normalized by the inferred ploidy rounded to nearest integer, and X-linked genes normalized by half such value. Then the copy-number status of each gene was categorized based on the following criteria: (i) Amplification. Normalized gene-level copy-number is greater than or equal to 2.5; (ii) Gain. Normalized gene-level copy-number is between 1.5 and 2.5; (iii) Homozygous deletion. Normalized gene-level copy-number is 0; (iv) Deletion with LOH. Normalized gene-level copy-number is between 0 and 1, and LOH status was found; (v) Copy neutral LOH. Normalized gene-level copy-number is 1 and LOH status was found.</p>

<title>Annotating gene alteration by structural variant</title>
<p>Gene coordinates were based on ENSEMBL v33 of hg38. Gene body region of one gene was defined as the widest region of all known isoforms collapsed. Gene flanking region was defined as the corresponding two 1 Mb regions next to the gene body region on 5’-end and 3’-end, respectively. Gene alteration status by genome rearrangements was defined based on the breakpoints and directions of involving structural variant events. A gene in one WGS sample (gene-sample pair) was considered having gene transecting events if any breakpoints of SV events were located within the gene body region. If the gene transecting status did not apply, then this gene-sample pair was examined for gene flanking status if the breakpoints of any intra-chromosomal SV events, including tandem duplications, deletions, and inversions, were located within the gene flanking regions. Additionally, translocation events including intra-chromosomal balanced and unbalanced events which spanned over 10 Mb, and inter-chromosomal translocation events were considered altering the gene flanking regions if any of their breakpoints was in the gene flanking region, and the direction of the SV was going towards the gene body region. The alteration status of rearrangements for each gene-sample pair was exclusive between gene transecting and gene flanking, with the former being prioritized in report.</p>

An event was only included in gene status calling if it passed all filters applied to the corresponding data type. For a given gene, BAL was defined as two or more events or a homozygous deletion within gene boundaries. MAL was defined as one detected loss-of-function event occurring within gene boundaries, while samples annotated as Intact had no recorded variants. Manual curation was performed to confirm gene statuses, with an emphasis being placed on confirming or amending discordant calls between samples from the same patient.</p>

<caption><title>CDK12 genomic alterations and tandem duplication phenotypes</title><p><bold>(a)</bold> Tandem duplication (TD) size analysis confirms multiple modes of TD lengths (top) in whole exome (WES; orange) and whole genome sequencing (WGS; blue) data for 46 tumors with a TDP. Fitting mixtures of Gaussian distributions to each of 26 WES and 20 WGS samples provided estimates of Gaussian means. The distribution of these mean values across 26 WES cases and 20 WGS cases are shown in red dotted lines; samples may have multiple mean values, one for each estimated mixture. The mixture means are categorized into six possible TD Groups based on the length ranges (bottom). The proportion of each TD Group are shown for the four CRPC cohorts.</p><p><bold>(b)</bold> The proportions of <italic>CDK12</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic>, and <italic>TP53</italic> genomic alteration status, including mono-allelic and bi-allelic losses and intact, for the 46 TDP cases compared across TD Groups.</p></caption>

<p>The paper is a <bold>fundamental</bold> study examining the role of CDK12 loss in prostate cancer. While previous studies have suggested that CDK12 loss confers HRD phenotypes, clinical trials using PARPi in CDK12 altered patients have not demonstrated significant benefit. This work investigates these mechanisms in depth and provides <bold>compelling</bold> evidence. A comprehensive genomic analysis serves an excellent resource to the field, showing that biallelic CDK12 alterations do not have genomic features of HRd. Moreover, the study explored both acute and chronic deletion of CDK12, with data suggestive of CDK12-altered cells being uniquely sensitive to CDK13 inhibition. While some minor weaknesses have been previously noted by the reviewers, the authors have adequately addressed these concerns with appropriate rigor.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors were attempting to identify the molecular and cellular basis for why modulators of the HR pathway, specifically PARPi, are not effective in CDK12 deleted or mutant prostate cancers and they seek to identify new therapeutic agents to treat this subset of metastatic prostate cancer patients. Overall, this is an outstanding manuscript with a number of strengths and in my opinion represents a significant advance in the field of prostate cancer biology and experimental therapeutics.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The patient data cohort size and clinical annotation from Figure 1 are compelling and comprehensive in scope. The associations between tandem duplications and amplifications of oncogenes that have been well-credentialed to be drivers of cancer development and progression are fascinating and the authors identify that in those that have AR amplification for example, there is evidence for AR pathway activation. The association between CDK12 inactivation and various specific gene/pathway perturbations is fascinating and is consistent with previously published studies - it would be interesting to correlate these changes with cell line-based studies in which CDK12 is specifically deleted or inhibited with small molecules to see how many pathways/gene perturbations are shared between the clinical samples and cell and mouse models with CDK12 perturbation. The short-term inhibitor studies related to changes in HRD genes and protein expression with CDK12/13 inhibition are fascinating and suggest differential pathway effects between short inhibition of CDK12/13 and long-term loss of CDK12. The in vivo studies with the inhibitor of CDK12/13 are intriguing but not definitive</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Given that there are different mutations identified at different CDK12 sites as illustrated in Figure 1B it would be nice to know which ones have been functionally classified as pathogenic and for which ones that the pathogenicity has not been determined. This would be especially interesting to perform in light of the differences in the LOH scores and WES data presented - specifically, are the pathogenic mutations vs the mutations for which true pathogenicity is unknown more likely to display LOH or TD? For the cell inhibition studies with the CDK12/13 inhibitor, more details characterizing the specificity of this molecule to these targets would be useful. Additionally, could the authors perform short-term depletion studies with a PROTAC to the target or short shRNA or non-selected pool CRISPR deletion studies of CDK12 in these same cell lines to complement their pharmacological studies with genetic depletion studies? Also perhaps performing these same inhibitor studies in CDK12/13 deleted cells to test the specificity of the molecule would be useful. Additionally, expanding these studies to additional prostate cancer cell lines or organdies models would strengthen the conclusions being made. More information should be provided about the dose and schedule chosen and the rationale for choosing those doses and schedules for the in vivo studies proposed should be presented and discussed. Was there evidence for maximal evidence of inhibition of the target CDK12/13 at the dose tested given the very modest tumor growth inhibition noted in these studies?</p>

While CDK12 loss has been shown to confer homologous recombination (HR) deficiency through premature intronic polyadenylation of HR genes, the response of PARPi monotherapy has failed. This study therefore performed an in-depth analysis of genomic sequencing data from mCRPC patient tumors, and showed that tumors with CDK12 loss lack pertinent HR signatures and scars. Furthermore, functional exploration in human prostate cancer cell lines showed that while the acute inhibition of CDK12 resulted in aberrant polyadenylation of HR genes like BRCA1/2, HR-specific effects were overall modest or absent in cell lines or xenografts adapted to chronic CDK12 loss. Instead, vulnerability to genetically targeting CDK13 resulted in a synthetic lethality in tumors with CDK12 loss, as shown in vivo with SR4825, a CDK12/13 inhibitor - thus serving as a potential therapeutic avenue.</p>
<p>The evidence supporting this study is based on in-depth genomic analyses of human patients, acute knockdown studies of CDK12 using a CDK12/13 inhibitors SR4835, adaptive knockout of CDK12 using LuCaP 189.4_CL and inducible re-expression of CDK12, CDK12 single clones in 22Rv1 (KO2 and KO5) and Skov3 (KO1), Tet-inducible knockdown of BRCA2 or CDK12 followed by ionizing radiation and measurement of RAD51 foci, lack of sensitivity generally to PARPi and platinum chemotherapy in cells adapted to CDK12 loss, loss of viability of CDK13 knockout in CDK12 knockout cells, and in vivo testing of SE4825 in LuCaP xenografts with intact and CDK12 loss.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this study is robust and of interest to the broader homologous recombination and CDK field. First, the topic is clinically relevant given the lack of PARPi response in CDK12 loss tumors. Second, the strength of the genomic analysis in CDK12 lost PCa tumors is robust with clear delineation that BRCA1/2 genes and maintenance of most genes regulating HR are intact. Specifically, the authors find that there is no mutational signature or genomic features suggestive of HR, such as those found in BRCA1/2 tumors. Lastly, novel lines are generated in this study, including de novo LuCaP 189.4_CL with CDK12 loss that can be profound for potential synthetic lethalities.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>One caveat that continues to be unclear as presented, is the uncoupling of cell cycle/essentiality of CDK12/13 from HR-directed mechanisms. Is this purely a cell cycle arrest phenotype acutely with associated down-regulation of many genes?</p>
<p>While the RAD51 loading ssRNA experiments are informative, the Tet-inducible knockdown of BRCA2 and CDK12 is confusing as presented in Figure 5, shBRCA2 + and -dox are clearly shown. However, were the CDK12_K02 and K05 also knocked down using inducible shRNA or a stable knockout? The importance of this statement is the difference between acute and chronic deletion of CDK12. Previously, the authors showed that acute knockdown of CDK12 led to an HR phenotype, but here it is unclear whether CDK12-K02/05 are acute knockdowns of CDK12 or have been chronically adapted after single cell cloning from CRISPR-knockout.</p>
<p>Given the multitude of lines, including some single-cell clones with growth inhibitory phenotypes and ex-vivo derived xenografts, the variability of effects with SR4835, ATM, ATR, and WEE1 inhibitors in different models can be confusing to follow. Overall, the authors suggest that the cell lines differ in therapeutic susceptibility as they may have alternate and diverse susceptibilities. It may be possible that the team could present this more succinctly and move extraneous data to the supplement.</p>
<p>The in-vitro data suggests that SR4835 causes growth inhibition acutely in parental lines such as 22RV1. However, in vivo, tumor attenuation appears to be observed in both CDK12 intact and deficient xenografts, LuCAP136 and LuCaP 189.4 (albeit the latter is only nominally significant). Is there an effect of PARPi inhibition specifically in either model? What about the the 22RV1-K02/05? Do these engraft? Given the role of CDK12/13 in RNAP II, these data might suggest that the window of susceptibility in CDK12 tumors may not be that different from CDK12 intact tumors (or intact tissue) when using dual CDK12/13 inhibitors but rather represent more general canonical essential functions of CDK12 and CDK13 in transcription. From a therapeutic development strategy, the authors may want to comment in the discussion on the ability to target CDK13 specifically.</p>

<p>Significance:</p>
<p>About 5% of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers (mCRPC) display genomic alterations in the transcriptional kinase CDK12. The mechanisms by which CDK12 alterations drive tumorigenesis in this molecularly-defined subset of mCRPC have remained elusive. In particular, some studies have suggested that CDK12 loss confers a homologous recombination deficiency (HRd) phenotype, However, clinical studies have not borne out the benefit to PARP inhibitors in patients with CDK12 alterations, despite the fact that these agents are typically active against tumors with HRd.</p>
<p>In this study, Frank et al. reconcile these findings by showing that: (1) tumors with biallelic CDK12 alterations do not have genomic features of HRd; (2) in vitro, HR gene downregulation occurs with acute depletion of CDK12 but is far less pronounced with chronic CDK12 loss; (3) CDK12-altered cells are uniquely sensitive to genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of CDK13.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this is an important study that reconciles disparate experimental and clinical observations. The genomic analyses are comprehensive and conducted with a high degree of rigor and represent an important resource to the community regarding the features of this molecular subtype of mCRPC.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) It is generally assumed that CDK12 alterations are inactivating, but it is noteworthy that homozygous deletions are comparatively uncommon (Figure 1a). Instead many tumors show missense mutations on either one or both alleles, and many of these mutations are outside of the kinase domain (Figure 1b). It remains possible that the CDK12 alterations that occur in some tumors may retain residual CDK12 function, or may confer some other neomorphic function, and therefore may not be accurately modeled by CDK12 knockout or knockdown in vitro. This would also reconcile the observation that knockout of CDK12 is cell-essential while the human genetic data suggest that CDK12 functions as a tumor suppressor gene.</p>
<p>(2) It is not entirely clear whether CDK12 altered tumors may require a co-occurring mutation to prevent loss of fitness, either in vitro or in vivo (e.g. perhaps one or more of the alterations that occur as a result of the TDP may mitigate against the essentiality of CDK12 loss).</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Given that there are different mutations identified at different CDK12 sites as illustrated in Figure 1B it would be nice to know which ones have been functionally classified as pathogenic and for which ones that the pathogenicity has not been determined. This would be especially interesting to perform in light of the differences in the LOH scores and WES data presented - specifically, are the pathogenic mutations vs the mutations for which true pathogenicity is unknown more likely to display LOH or TD?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Alterations were classified as pathogenic when resulting in frameshift, nonsense, or cause an aminoacid change likely to alter function (according to ANNOVAR).  Four patients were called CDK12<sup>BAL</sup> but were negative for TDP signatures. Three of these had CDK12 mutations downstream of the kinase domain, which may be less likely to ablate protein activity. Most functionally validated pathogenic mutations include disruption of the kinase domain (PMID: 25712099). We added a sentence to the Results section (under “Identification of genomic characteristics that associate with CDK12 loss in prostate cancer”) to highlight this caveat on pathogenic mutation calls.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For the cell inhibition studies with the CDK12/13 inhibitor, more details characterizing the specificity of this molecule to these targets would be useful. Additionally, could the authors perform short-term depletion studies with a PROTAC to the target or short shRNA or non-selected pool CRISPR deletion studies of CDK12 in these same cell lines to complement their pharmacological studies with genetic depletion studies? Also perhaps performing these same inhibitor studies in CDK12/13 deleted cells to test the specificity of the molecule would be useful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are not aware of a CDK12-specific PROTAC, and generate such as reagent is beyond the scope of the present study. Regarding the specificity of the CDK12/13 inhibitor molecules, additional information on the specificity and in vivo dose selection were added to the Results section (under “CDK13 is synthetic lethal in cells with biallelic CDK12 loss”). Cells with CDK12-KO did not tolerate CDK13-KO, so we were unable to generate double knockouts to test for CDK12/13 inhibitor non-specific effects.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, expanding these studies to additional prostate cancer cell lines or organdies models would strengthen the conclusions being made. More information should be provided about the dose and schedule chosen and the rationale for choosing those doses and schedules for the in vivo studies proposed should be presented and discussed. Was there evidence for maximal evidence of inhibition of the target CDK12/13 at the dose tested given the very modest tumor growth inhibition noted in these studies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>With respect to additional acute CDK12 loss models, our Tet-inducible shCDK12 models show only minor growth slowdown and do not appear to phenocopy the strong arrest or apoptosis seen with CDK12 KO or inhibition, respectively. Future work is ongoing to generate CDK12-degron regulated cell lines. We added a new immunoblot panel showing that acute CRISPR/sgRNA targeting of CDK12 does indeed lead to BRCA2 and ATM protein decrease (Fig. S4g), providing some orthogonal genomic targeting evidence of the acute HR gene effect.  We are continuing efforts to collect and generate additional CDK12<sup>BAL</sup> cell models, in both 2D and 3D culture systems, but none are presently available. We added a 3D culture drug dose curve with LuCaP189.4 exposed to THZ531 (Fig. S7m), which confirms heightened sensitivity vs two CDK12-intact lines.</p>
<p>Regarding assessments of CDK12 targets; as we are not aware of any unique CDK12 substrates, it is fair to ask but difficult to measure precise CDK12 inhibition by the compounds in tumors. We dosed mice using the same protocol as detailed in the original report testing SR4835 in mice (PMID: 31668947). We performed immunoblots on lysates from 3 and 28 day treated PDX tumors and did not see any consistent decreases in pRBP1(Ser2) or ATM or increases in γH2A.X (data not shown). However, we did see increases in APA usage and downregulation of DNA repair transcripts with three day treatment (Fig. 6k-l), as would be expected from on target acute effects.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review)</bold></p>
<p>One caveat that continues to be unclear as presented, is the uncoupling of cell cycle/essentiality of CDK12/13 from HR-directed mechanisms. Is this purely a cell cycle arrest phenotype acutely with associated down-regulation of many genes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In regard to untangling the effects of cell arrest on HR gene expression, this is a difficult question given that many HR genes, including BRCA2, are S/G2 linked. We attempted to account for those effects in the acute CDK12 inhibition experiment by including a palbociclib (CDK4/6i) control, which caused cell arrest and decreased BRCA1/2 RNA expression with no apparent 5/3’ transcript imbalance determined by qPCR (Fig. 4e,g). Though overall BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA levels are lower in the stable 22Rv1-CDK12-KO2 and KO5 lines, they do not show selective 3’ loss (Fig. 5c), suggesting the downregulation in these lines is mostly due to their slower growth (Fig. S4k) and not intronic polyA usage.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While the RAD51 loading ssRNA experiments are informative, the Tet-inducible knockdown of BRCA2 and CDK12 is confusing as presented in Figure 5, shBRCA2 + and -dox are clearly shown. However, were the CDK12_K02 and K05 also knocked down using inducible shRNA or a stable knockout? The importance of this statement is the difference between acute and chronic deletion of CDK12. Previously, the authors showed that acute knockdown of CDK12 led to an HR phenotype, but here it is unclear whether CDK12K02/05 are acute knockdowns of CDK12 or have been chronically adapted after single cell cloning from CRISPR-knockout.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As a clarification, the 22Rv1-CDK12-KO2 and 22Rv1-CDK12-KO5 are stable CRISPR knockout clonal lines that were expanded from single cells. We added a new figure to include more validation of these lines (Fig. S5). We tried multiple times to reproduce the HRd phenotype and PARPi sensitivity with siRNA and inducible shRNA lines but were unable to see clear sensitivity differences, despite seeing the expected shifts with shBRCA2 controls (data not shown). It is possible the degree of knockdown (~80%), timing (8 days), or specific cell lines used in our experiments were not sufficient to expose the acute phenotype by this method.</p>
<p>However, we were able to see acute HR gene decreases by inhibitor treatment (Fig. 4) or acute CRISPR (Fig. S4g).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Given the multitude of lines, including some single-cell clones with growth inhibitory phenotypes and ex-vivo derived xenografts, the variability of effects with SR4835, ATM, ATR, and WEE1 inhibitors in different models can be confusing to follow. Overall, the authors suggest that the cell lines differ in therapeutic susceptibility as they may have alternate and diverse susceptibilities. It may be possible that the team could present this more succinctly and move extraneous data to the supplement.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the complexity of the data and attempted to use multiple models to report consistency and variability. We are not able to ascertain what data would be extraneous, and elected to present data we view as relevant in the main figures while moving supporting data in the supplement.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The in-vitro data suggests that SR4835 causes growth inhibition acutely in parental lines such as 22RV1. However, in vivo, tumor attenuation appears to be observed in both CDK12 intact and deficient xenografts, LuCAP136 and LuCaP 189.4 (albeit the latter is only nominally significant). Is there an effect of PARPi inhibition specifically in either model? What about the 22RV1-K02/05? Do these engraft? Given the role of CDK12/13 in RNAP II, these data might suggest that the window of susceptibility in CDK12 (mutant) tumors may not be that different from CDK12 intact tumors (or intact tissue) when using dual CDK12/13 inhibitors but rather represent more general canonical essential functions of CDK12 and CDK13 in transcription. From a therapeutic development strategy, the authors may want to comment in the discussion on the ability to target CDK13 specifically.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Though the response of the CDK12<sup>BAL</sup> models to some compounds is variable, we believe those mixed results are important and future studies may be able to better explain why some show shifts in sensitivity while others do not. We hope future studies with additional models will help determine which sensitivities are more consistently true, and perhaps provide explanations for differences between models.</p>
<p>Regarding SR4835, we find, and others have reported, a toxic (i.e. apoptotic) effect for in vitro treatment with dual CDK12/13 inhibitors (Fig. 4f, S4e,f); in fact, that may be why previous studies have used short timepoints in cell culture assays with these dual inhibitors. In mice, SR4835 was tolerated well but only LuCaP 189.4 showed statistically significant decreases in tumor volume and weight (Fig. 6j). We did not test PARPi responses in the PDX models, nor did we attempt engrafting the 22Rv1-CDK12-KO cell lines, but both would be worthwhile experiments in the future. Beyond CDK12<sup>BAL</sup> tumors, we agree that CDK12/13 inhibitors could be effective in cancer therapies more generally (e.g. triggering acute HRd, loss of RNAP2 phosphorylation). We added a line to the discussion section about ongoing efforts to combine PARPi and CDK12/13i, which we expect to be synergistic in CDK12-intact tumors due to the acute loss phenotype. We certainly agree that development of a specific CDK13 inhibitor would be the ideal therapeutic option for CDK12<sup>BAL</sup> tumors. However, CDK12 and CDK13 are 43% conserved at the protein level (PMID: 26748711), with 92% conservation in the active site (PMID: 30319007), and there are no available pharmacologic inhibitors that discriminate between CDK12 and CDK13.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>It is generally assumed that CDK12 alterations are inactivating, but it is noteworthy that homozygous deletions are comparatively uncommon (Figure 1a). Instead many tumors show missense mutations on either one or both alleles, and many of these mutations are outside of the kinase domain (Figure 1b). It remains possible that the CDK12 alterations that occur in some tumors may retain residual CDK12 function, or may confer some other neomorphic function, and therefore may not be accurately modeled by CDK12 knockout or knockdown in vitro. This would also reconcile the observation that knockout of CDK12 is cell-essential while the human genetic data suggest that CDK12 functions as a tumor suppressor gene.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the feedback. It is a keen observation that homozygous deletions of CDK12 are not typical, though many mutations are upstream frameshifts that are expected to lead to loss of functional protein and mRNA via nonsense mediated decay. LuCaP189.4, our only natural mutant model, has two upstream frameshifts leading to complete protein loss (Fig 5b, S4h-i). We also added a caveat previously mentioned (in response to Reviewer 1) that mutations downstream of the kinase domain may be less likely to be fully pathogenic. For upstream missense mutations, the possibility of neuromorphic function remains an intriguing possibility that cannot be ruled out and would not be captured in our current models. Hopefully additional models can be developed, both natural and engineered, to help dissect that question in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is not entirely clear whether CDK12 altered tumors may require a co-occurring mutation to prevent loss of fitness, either in vitro or in vivo (e.g. perhaps one or more of the alterations that occur as a result of the TDP may mitigate against the essentiality of CDK12 loss).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We concur. Another caveat with the CRISPR models, beyond reliance on upstream frameshift mutations, is the simultaneous loss of alleles. In human tumors, there may be a period of single copy loss before the second hit that may provide a window for adaptation. It is possible that sequential loss is far easier for a cell to tolerate than acute bi-allelic inactivation. We agree that the question of what (if any) cooperating genetic alterations are required to tolerate CDK12 loss is an important one that we plant to further explore in future work.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for Authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for Authors):</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The authors have thoroughly addressed all issues of data availability, reagents, in vivo protocols, and animal approvals associated with the studies presented in this manuscript. Specific comments and experimental suggestions that in my opinion would strengthen the conclusions of this interesting and compelling manuscript are included above</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors were thorough in their studies. As a general note, switching between the cell lines is often overwhelming in interpreting the data given cell-to-cell variability in response. If possible, consolidating the text/conclusions in results would improve the readability of the manuscript.</p>
<p>The variety of cell lines and models is perhaps expansive at times, but we hope the inclusion of these different models helps support the conclusions.</p>
<p>Is it possible to knockout CDK12 acutely using a degron-based approach, instead of utilizing an inhibitor that targets both CDK12/13?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There is a HeLa cell line made with analog-sensitive CDK12 (Bartkowiak, Yan, and Greenleaf 2016) but we were unaware of any such prostate lines at the time of this work. We are attempting to develop engineered prostate lines with specific CDK12 degradation but do not yet have them available.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>How do the authors address a lower BRCA1/2 level in for example 22RV1-K05, does this cell line have increased sensitivity to PARPi over its parental 22RV1 line? Could this be added to Figure 5h/i?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The lower BRCA2 levels in 22Rv1CDK12-KO5 is likely due to the slower growth rate (Fig. S4k), as BRCA2 expression is S/G2 linked. While the mRNA level of BRCA2 overall is lower in the KO5 line, we do not observe the 5’/3’ transcript imbalance (Fig. 5c). The 22Rv1-CDK12-KO lines did not show increased sensitivity to carboplatin, while inducible shBRCA2 did (Fig. S7a), so we do not believe this lower BRCA2 confers functional HRd. We did test the KO lines with olaparib (Fig. S7d) and saw a modest increased sensitivity compared to parental 22Rv1, but not to the extent measured in the BRCA1 mutant line UWB1.289.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>What is the clonality of the LuCAP 189.4 lines upon derivation? Is biallelic CDK12 loss seen in all cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not know the exact clonality of the LuCAP 189.4 PDX or CL model, but we do see highly uniform CDK12 protein loss in these cells (quantified by IHC staining, data not shown).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors state that 22RV1-K02/05 has an increased growth arrest to CDK13 inhibition. However, in Figure 6h, it appears the viability is not significantly different compared to the parental 22RV1 line. Similar aspects noted in 189.4-vec/CDK12?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We found that 22Rv1 KO2/KO5 have growth arrest with sgCDK13 and cell death with CDK12/13 inhibitor. We did notice that SR4835 did not show the differential effects we anticipated (Fig. 6h), as was seen with THZ531 (Fig. 6i). SR4835 is a non-covalent inhibitor, while THZ531 is a covalent binder, so there are some functional differences between these compounds that might explain the lack of differential effects in the isogenic lines in a 4 day in vitro assay. We included the SR4835 in vitro data because it was used for the in vivo experiment. THZ531 is not suited for animal use.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Could the authors comment on SR4835 response in vivo as a function of tumor growth rate?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The in vivo SR4835 treated LuCaP189.4 did show signs of reduced proliferation with decreased Cell Cycle and DNA Replication in the RNA-seq signatures, but a more detailed investigation into cell cycle arrest vs apoptotic response has yet to be fully explored. We plan to conduct additional PDX experiments if we can obtain a selective CDK13 inhibitor.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Do the authors explore TDPs in their isogenic cell lines?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We performed low coverage WGS on the 22Rv1 KO clones and added that to the paper (Fig. S5c). We did not see any obvious signs of TDP. We suspect the phenotype takes longer to accumulate and is not apparent within the ~20 passages our clones underwent in culture. This would be consistent with the tumor analysis (Fig. 2b) showing increase in TDs from primary to metastatic tumors, suggesting TDs accumulate over time.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A future study may allow for screening synthetic lethals in the context of CDK12 loss in the presence or absence of SR4835 inhibition.</p>

<p>We are actively pursuing experiments to identify new synthetic lethal targets by CRISPR and drug screens in CDK12 loss models and hope to report those in a future study.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>As discussed above, the authors may wish to adjust their terminology to &quot;CDK12-altered&quot; rather than &quot;CDK12 lost&quot; or &quot;CDK12-inactivated&quot; to leave open the possibility that some tumors may retain residual CDK12 function or adopt neomorphic functions.</p>

<p>Thank you for the additional comments and feedback. The possibility of neomorphic CDK12 allele function is important. As our models were all complete protein loss mutations, we decided to retain “biallelic loss” as our preferred nomenclature, but the note is well taken.</p>

<p>The plots in Figures 1f-h are interesting and suggest that certain cancer genes (especially oncogenes) are recurrently gained in CDK12-altered tumors. It may be interesting to look at this on the individual level rather than the cohort level to see whether any groups of oncogenes tend to be gained together in an individual patient - this could inform whether certain combinations of cancer drivers cooperate with CDK12 alteration to drive oncogenesis.</p>

<p>Thank you for the idea of looking at the patient-level for TDP-enriched oncogenes. A preliminary assessment did not identify recurrent co-gained oncogenes. We will continue these analyses as additional patient tumors with CDK12 alterations are identified.</p>

<p>The finding that AR gene or enhancer are recurrently gained with TDP is interesting and I am curious whether the authors have thoughts on whether these alterations can also be seen in the 1-2% of CDK12altered primary prostate cancers that are treatment naïve, and where AR pathway alterations are not as frequently seen.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not focus on CDK12 altered primary prostate cancers, but we did check if there is AR amplification enrichment in the 6 CDK12<sup>BAL</sup> cases of the TCGA-PRAD dataset and did not identify enrichment. However, with such small numbers we would hesitate to draw any hard conclusions.</p>

<p>It could be interesting to more comprehensively characterize some of the CDK12 KO-adapted lines in Figure 5 (e.g. by WES or WGS) to determine whether they exhibit the TDP and/or whether they have acquired any secondary mutations that allow them to adapt to CDK12 loss.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are planning to do further genomics characterization of the CDK12-KO lines and will hopefully include that in a future study. Genomic analyses of the 22Rv1 clones (see copy number plots in Fig. S5c) did not identify a TDP. We plan to repeat the genomic assessments over additional cell passages and we have planned additional experiments designed to understand why some cells tolerate CDK12 loss and others do not.</p>
