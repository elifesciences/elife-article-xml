<title>Abstract</title><p>Alcohol relapse is linked to corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) signaling and is caused by dysfunction within reward pathway circuitry, yet the underlying mechanisms guiding this process remain unclear. Here, we investigated how CRF modulates cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the dorsal striatum, a region critical for mediating cognitive flexibility and action selection. Using monosynaptic and retrograde circuit tracing, we identified direct inputs from CRF-expressing (CRF⁺) neurons in the central amygdala (CeA) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) to dorsal striatal CINs. We showed that CINs express CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) and established their functional connectivity with CeA/BNST CRF⁺ projections. Functional recordings revealed that CRF enhanced CIN excitability and promoted acetylcholine release in the dorsal striatum. However, acute alcohol exposure and withdrawal attenuated the excitatory effect of CRF on CIN firing, suggesting a mechanism by which alcohol disrupts CRF-dependent neuromodulation. These findings uncover a novel CRF-mediated circuit linking the extended amygdala to the dorsal striatum and provide insight into how CRF and alcohol interact to impair striatal function. This work highlights CRF signaling as a potential target for uncovering the mechanism of stress-induced changes to the reward pathway.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>The dorsal striatum regulates goal-directed behavior and is implicated in alcohol use disorder (AUD). Within this region, cholinergic interneurons (CINs) support cognitive flexibility and receive input from limbic areas, including the central amygdala (CeA) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). In this study, we identified direct projections from CRF-producing neurons in the CeA and BNST to dorsal striatal CINs, a subset of which express CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1). Electrophysiological recordings confirmed these projections provide functional input that is disrupted by acute alcohol exposure. These findings lay the groundwork for future studies on how CRF and alcohol interact to impair striatal function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic, recurring brain condition characterized by compulsive alcohol consumption, impaired control over drinking, and negative emotional states during withdrawal. Stress is a key contributor to both the development and recurrence of AUD, with stressful experiences and elevated stress hormone levels frequently precipitating relapse episodes in abstinent individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. An expanding body of clinical and preclinical evidence highlights the importance of stress-responsive neurocircuits in driving addiction-related behaviors, implicating neuropeptides like corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in relapse vulnerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. CRF is a central regulator of the stress response, coordinating hormonal and behavioral adaptations to stress through widespread action in both hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic brain regions. In addition to initiating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, CRF modulates affective and motivational processes via its action in the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and other limbic structures.</p>
<p>Substantial evidence indicates that CRF signaling enhances drug-seeking behavior during stress and withdrawal across multiple substances of abuse, supporting its role as a critical mediator of relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Despite extensive research on CRF in limbic areas, its role in the dorsal striatum—an area crucial for goal-directed learning, habit formation, and behavioral flexibility—remains less well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Within this region, cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are key regulators of striatal output and acetylcholine (ACh)-mediated dopamine modulation, integrating diverse inputs and contributing to reward-based learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. CINs are sensitive to neuromodulatory influences, yet it is unclear whether they are directly targeted by CRF and how this interaction might be altered by alcohol exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated a novel CRF–CIN circuit linking the CeA and BNST to the dorsal striatum. Using monosynaptic and retrograde circuit tracing, we identified direct projections from CRF-expressing neurons to dorsal striatal CINs. CRF enhanced CIN excitability and promoted ACh release via CRFR1 receptors, but this excitatory effect was disrupted by acute alcohol exposure, indicating that alcohol interferes with CRF-dependent cholinergic modulation. These findings identify a CRF-CIN circuit that is vulnerable to alcohol-induced dysregulation, providing mechanistic insight into how stress peptides and alcohol interact to impair striatal function.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Male and female 3-4-month-old mice or rats were used in all studies. ChAT-eGFP (stock 007902), ChAT-Cre (stock 031661), Drd1a-tdTomato (D1-tdT, stock 016204), Ai32 (stock 012569), CRH-ires-CRE (stock 012704) and C57BL/6J (stock 000664) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. All mice were backcrossed onto a C57BL/6 background. ChAT-Cre mice were crossed with D1-tdTomato mice to obtain ChAT-Cre;D1-tdTomato mice. CRF-Cre mice were crossed with ChAT-eGFP mice to generate CRF-Cre;ChAT-eGFP mice. CRF-Cre;Ai32 mice were generated in-house and crossed with ChAT-eGFP to generate triple transgenic CRF-Cre;Ai32;ChAT-eGFP mice. We used CRFR1-Cre-2A-tdTomato rats that have been validated for expression of Cre and tdTomato in CRFR1-expressing neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. We also used CRF-Cre rats that have been shown to express Cre recombinase in CRF-producing neurons in the CeA and BNST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. We crossed CRF-Cre rats with a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter line to visualize CRF<sup>+</sup> neurons. Genotypes were confirmed through PCR analysis of tail DNA to detect Cre or fluorescent protein genes in mice and rats (Cre for CRF-Cre, and ChAT-Cre; tdTomato for D1-tdTomato; and GFP for Ai32) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Animals were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled vivarium with a 12-h light/dark cycle. Food and water were available <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The Texas A&amp;M University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal care and experimental procedures.</p>

<title>Stereotaxic virus infusion</title>
<p>The stereotaxic virus infusion procedure was conducted as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. When required for the experimental design, AAV-DIO-TVA-mCherry and AAV-DIO-RG were bilaterally infused into the dorsal striatum (AP: 0.38, mm, ML: ±1.55 mm, DV: -2.90 mm from the Bregma) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>] of ChAT-Cre;D1-tdTomato mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Rabies-GFP was infused at the same injection site three weeks later at a 10° angle to avoid contamination of the infusion tract. Rabies-GFP virus was allowed to incubate for one week. AAVrg-pCAG-FLEX-eGFP-WPRE was infused into the dorsal striatum (AP: 0.00, mm, ML: ±2.80 mm, DV: -4.85 mm from the Bregma) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>] of CRF-Cre;tdTomato rats (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). Additionally, AAV-DIO-Chrimson-tdTomato was infused into the CeA (AP: - 2.60 mm; ML: ±4.20 mm; DV: -8.10 mm) and BNST (AP: -0.10 mm; ML: ±1.40 mm; DV: - 6.70 mm) as described in published literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>). The animals were placed on a stereotaxic surgical frame after being sedated with 3-4% isoflurane at a rate of 1.0 L/min, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. These coordinates were obtained from previous publications and verified using the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] or mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>] brain atlases. A volume of 0.5 µL/site (mice) or 1 µL/site (rats) of virus was infused at a rate of 0.08 µL/min. At the end of the infusion, the injectors remained at the injection site for 10 to 15 min before removal to allow for virus diffusion. The scalp incision was then sutured and animals were returned to their home cage for recovery.</p>

<title>Histology and cell counting</title>
<p>Animals were anesthetized and perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The brains were then extracted and submerged in 4% PFA/PBS solution for one day at 4°C, then transferred to a 30% sucrose solution in PBS. Once the brains completely sank in the sucrose solution, they were cut into 50-µm thick coronal sections using a cryostat. The slices were stored in a PBS bath at 4°C before mounting on slides for imaging using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Fluoview, Olympus). All images were processed using Imaris 8.3.1 (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Immunostaining for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) was performed using an anti-ChAT primary antibody (AB144P), followed by a fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (A21447) emitting at 647 nm, labeling CINs with far-red fluorescence. Cell counting was performed in 8 CRF-Cre;tdTomato rats. For each brain region, 5-10 brain sections were imaged from each animal. Imaris was used to quantify green and red neurons as well as evaluate colocalization. Brain regions were identified using the Mouse Brain Atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>].</p>

<p>Slices were prepared and electrophysiological recordings were conducted as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Briefly, coronal sections (250 μm) containing the striatum were cut in an ice-cold cutting solution containing (in mM): 40 NaCl, 148.5 sucrose, 4 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, 1 sodium ascorbate, 3 sodium pyruvate, and 3 myo-inositol. The solution was saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Slices were then incubated in a 1:1 mixture of the cutting and external solutions at 32°C for 45 min. The external solution was composed of the following (in mM): 125 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 15 glucose, and 15 sucrose. The external solution was saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Slices were then maintained in the external solution at room temperature until use.</p>

<sec id="s2e2">
<title>Cell-attached recordings</title>
<p>Individual slices were transferred to a recording chamber and continuously perfused with the external solution at 2-3 mL/min at 32°C. Fluorescent axonal fibers and neurons were visualized using an epifluorescent microscope (Olympus). The presence of tdTomato and GFP allowed cell type verification and expression of Ai32 allowed visualization of CRF-producing fibers. CINs in slices were identified by their labeled color, large size, and spontaneous firing. Spontaneous cell-attached CIN firing activity was recorded for 5 min to calculate the average firing frequency. 470-nm or 590-nm light was emitted from the objective lens for 2 ms at a frequency and duration specified in the respective figure legend to stimulate axonal fibers containing channelrhodopsin in the dorsal striatum. We used a potassium-based intracellular solution containing (in mM): 123 potassium gluconate, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 8 NaCl, 2 MgATP, and 0.3 NaGTP, with an osmolarity of ∼280 mOsm/L and the pH adjusted to 7.3 using KOH. For protocols involving alcohol application, we pretreated dorsal striatal slices with alcohol (50 mM) for 1 h outside of the recording chamber. After pretreatment, slices were transferred to the recording chamber, where alcohol was washed out for at least 15 min before recording. The recordings included a 10-min baseline period (without alcohol), followed by 10 min of CRF bath application, and then 10 min of alcohol exposure. Control slices did not receive alcohol pretreatment but were exposed to acute alcohol following CRF application. In both conditions, the final 10-min alcohol application allowed us to assess whether alcohol pretreatment altered the CIN firing response to subsequent CRF and alcohol exposure. In protocols that required inhibition of glutamatergic and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, DNQX and bicuculline were used, respectively. Electrophysiology data were acquired using Clampex-10 (Molecular Devices) and analyzed using Clampfit-10 (Molecular Devices) and Mini Analysis (Mini60, Synaptosoft Inc.).</p>

<title>Dorsal Striatal CINs Receive Monosynaptic Inputs From CeA and BNST Neurons</title>
<p>To investigate the connection between dorsal striatal CINs and stress-related brain regions, we examined whether CINs receive monosynaptic inputs from the CeA and the BNST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. We used ChAT-Cre;D1-tdTomato mice to perform rabies-mediated monosynaptic retrograde tracing. In this mouse model, CINs express Cre recombinase and dopamine D1-receptor (D1R)-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) are labeled with tdTomato. Including the D1-tdTomato marker allowed us to delineate the CeA and BNST, which do not express D1Rs unlike surrounding striatal areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. We performed rabies-mediated retrograde monosynaptic circuit tracing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), allowing specific targeting of CINs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In addition to labeling neurons in brain regions known to project to dorsal striatal CINs, we were surprised to see labeled neurons in both the CeA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) and BNST (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), which are well-characterized as key stress-responsive nuclei. Interestingly, we observed significantly more GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons in the BNST than in the CeA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>; Mann-Whitney U = 29.500, ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). These results demonstrate that dorsal striatal CINs receive direct, monosynaptic inputs from neurons in the CeA and BNST. Together, these findings highlight the anatomical connection of dorsal striatal CINs with key stress-responsive brain regions.</p>

<title>The Dorsal Striatum Lacks CRF<sup>+</sup> Neurons Unlike the CeA and BNST</title>
<p>We first investigated whether the dorsal striatum contains CRF producing cells or if CRF signaling in the dorsal striatum instead depends on CeA and BNST inputs. While previous studies have identified CRF-producing neurons in the CeA and BNST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], their presence in the dorsal striatum remains uncertain. Coronal brain sections from CRF-Cre;tdTomato rats revealed dense populations of CRF-tdTomato<sup>+</sup> neurons in the CeA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) and BNST (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Although CRF<sup>+</sup> axonal fibers were observed in the dorsal striatum, CRF<sup>+</sup> cell bodies were largely absent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Quantitative analysis confirmed significant regional differences, indicating that the CeA and BNST contained substantially more CRF<sup>+</sup> neurons than the dorsal striatum (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>; CeA versus DS, Q = 7.30, *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; BNST versus DS, Q = 3.72, *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).

The apparent lack of CRF<sup>+</sup> cell bodies in the dorsal striatum suggests that CRF signaling in the dorsal striatum arises from CRF<sup>+</sup> neurons in the CeA and BNST.</p>

<title>Dorsal Striatum CINs Receive Monosynaptic CRF<sup>+</sup> Inputs from the CeA and BNST</title>
<p>To test whether CRF<sup>+</sup> neurons in the CeA and BNST project to the dorsal striatum, we infused a retrograde adeno-associated virus into the dorsal striatum of CRF-Cre;tdTomato rats. This strategy allows CRF<sup>+</sup> neurons (tdTomato<sup>+</sup>) that project to the dorsal striatum to also be labeled with GFP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).

This indicates that CRF<sup>+</sup> neurons from the CeA and BNST project to the dorsal striatum.

<p>To test whether CRF neurons in the CeA and BNST make monosynaptic projections to dorsal striatal CINs, we performed ChR2-assisted circuit tracing. Given that both the CeA and BNST are primarily GABAergic nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>], we examined whether optogenetic stimulation of CRF-containing projections to the dorsal striatum induce inhibitory monosynaptic currents in CINs. To test this, we infused AAV-FLEX-Chrimson-tdTomato into the CeA and BNST of CRF-Cre;ChAT-eGFP mice so that we could selectively stimulate CRF-containing fibers in the dorsal striatum while recording from GFP labeled CINs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). We found that optogenetic stimulation of CRF<sup>+</sup> fibers with yellow light evoked fast synaptic currents in dorsal striatal CINs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). This response was abolished by TTX (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>; BL versus TTX: q = 4.16, *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) but restored using TTX+4-AP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>; TTX vs TTX+4-AP: q = 4.73, *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), suggesting the existence of monosynaptic transmission.

<title>Striatal CINs Express CRFR1</title>
<p>Having established that CINs receive monosynaptic inputs from CRF neurons in the CeA and BNST, we next replicated the finding that CINs express the CRF receptor, CRFR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. To address this, we used CRFR1-Cre-tdTomato rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], in which CRFR1-containing neurons express Cre recombinase and are visible due to the tdTomato label. Confocal imaging of striatal sections from these rats confirmed that CRFR1-expressing neurons are distributed throughout the striatum (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). To verify that CRFR1-positive (CRFR1⁺) neurons are also cholinergic, we stained sections with an anti-ChAT antibody and imaged them using confocal microscopy (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

<p>Because CINs are the primary source of ACh in the dorsal striatum, we next examined whether CRF-induced CIN activation enhances ACh release. To do so, we infused an adeno-associated virus (AAV) introducing a genetically encoded ACh sensor (AAV-GRAB<sub>ACh4m</sub>) into the dorsal striatum of wildtype mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Live-tissue confocal imaging was performed on brain slices containing the dorsal striatum 14 days post-infusion to monitor ACh levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).

<p>To determine how acute alcohol exposure affects CRF-induced enhancement of CIN firing, we pretreated dorsal striatal slices with alcohol (50 mM) for 1 h outside of the recording chamber (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). In control slices, CRF significantly increased the spontaneous firing of dorsal striatal CINs, consistent with our previous findings (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>; BL versus CRF, q = 11.51, **<italic>*p</italic> &lt; 0.001; see also <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).

This residual increase is likely due to the persistent effect of exogenous CRF, which is sustained for several minutes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>In slices pretreated with alcohol, CRF still increased CIN firing frequency, but subsequent alcohol application failed to suppress it back to baseline (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>; BL versus CRF, q = 5.20, *<italic>*p</italic> &lt; 0.01; CRF versus EtOH, q = 6.21, <italic>p</italic> = 0.05). This suggests that prior acute alcohol exposure reduces the ability of subsequent alcohol exposure to suppress CIN activity in the presence of CRF. Notably, when comparing the change in CIN firing from baseline to CRF application, alcohol pretreatment significantly blunted CRF-induced enhancement of CIN firing (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>; t<sub>18</sub> = 2.70, <italic>*p</italic> &lt; 0.05).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study identifies a circuit in which CRF-positive neurons in the CeA and BNST provide direct input to dorsal striatal CINs that express CRFR1. CRF enhances CIN excitability and ACh release, linking CRF to cholinergic modulation. In addition, alcohol exposure and withdrawal blunt this effect, suggesting a possible role for CRF signaling to dorsal striatal CINs in the etiology of alcohol use disorder. Using monosynaptic and retrograde circuit tracing, we identified direct projections from CRF-expressing neurons in the CeA and BNST to dorsal striatal CINs. Functional electrophysiology shows that CRF enhances CIN excitability and promotes ACh release via CRFR1 receptors. However, acute alcohol exposure and withdrawal disrupted this excitatory effect, indicating that alcohol interferes with CRF-dependent cholinergic modulation. These findings identify a CRF–CIN circuit that is vulnerable to alcohol-induced dysregulation, providing mechanistic insight into how CRF and alcohol interact to impair striatal function. Our results highlight CRF signaling in the dorsal striatum as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating the cognitive flexibility deficits and reward system dysfunction seen in AUD.

While previous studies have identified CeA and BNST projections to the striatum, they did not show that they arise from CRF neurons or that they target CINs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Our results establish a direct CRF-to-CIN pathway, linking CRF release to cholinergic modulation. Given CINs’ roles in striatal output, behavioral flexibility, and reward learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>], this circuit likely contributes to stress-driven behavioral adaptations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>].</p>
<p>We found that there are no CRF neurons in the dorsal striatum, indicating that CRF signaling in the dorsal striatum arises from inputs outside of the striatum, including from the CeA and BNST. Electrophysiological experiments show that CRF fiber stimulation enhances CIN excitability in the presence of synaptic blockers, supporting a role for CRF signaling in the modulation of striatal cholinergic tone. The transient effects of endogenous CRF release, compared to prolonged effects of CRF bath application, suggest that CRF signaling in the striatum may generate dynamic patterns of cholinergic activation to influence behavioral expression.</p>

<title>Alcohol Disrupts CRF-Mediated CIN Excitation</title>
<p>A key finding of this study is that alcohol exposure disrupts CRF-mediated CIN excitation. Both acute alcohol exposure and withdrawal attenuate the CRF-induced increase in CIN activity, indicating that alcohol alters the responsiveness of these neurons to stress signals. Because stress is a well-established trigger for alcohol relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>], the observed alcohol-induced disruption in CRF signaling may impair the brain’s ability to adaptively respond to stress, thereby increasing susceptibility to relapse.</p>
<p>One possibility is that alcohol exposure downregulates CRFR1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>] or alters CIN function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], reducing their responsiveness to stress-related input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]. Alternatively, alcohol may interfere with intracellular signaling cascades downstream of CRFR1 activation, leading to diminished excitability and ACh release. The mechanisms underlying alcohol’s effect on CRF signaling in CINs remain to be fully elucidated.</p>

<title>Implications for Alcohol Use Disorder</title>
<p>By delineating a CRF-to-CIN pathway linking the extended amygdala to the dorsal striatum, our findings provide critical insights into how stress and alcohol interact at the circuit level to shape behavior. Given the role of CINs in action selection and behavioral flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>], disruption of this stress-sensitive cholinergic circuit may underlie the decision-making deficits and compulsive alcohol-seeking behavior observed in AUD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, we identify a direct CRF-positive projection from the CeA and BNST to dorsal striatal CINs, revealing a new mechanism by which stress can modulate cholinergic signaling in the striatum. We demonstrate that CRF enhances CIN excitability and ACh release, and that alcohol exposure disrupts this modulation. These findings highlight the CRF–CIN circuit as a potential therapeutic target in AUD and suggest that restoring CRF signaling may help counteract stress- and alcohol-induced striatal dysfunction. Future work should assess whether pharmacological or circuit-based interventions targeting CRFR1 or CINs can mitigate behavioral impairments in individuals with AUD.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study identifies a novel CRF-positive projection from the central amygdala and BNST to dorsal striatal cholinergic interneurons, revealing a previously unrecognized pathway by which stress signals modulate striatal function. The authors present strong and <bold>convincing</bold> evidence for the anatomical and functional connectivity of this circuit and demonstrate that alcohol disrupts CRF-mediated cholinergic activity, supporting its relevance to alcohol use disorder.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors show that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the central amygdala (CeA) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) monosynaptically target cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the dorsal striatum of rodents. Functionally, activation of CRFR1 receptors increases CIN firing rate, and this modulation was reduced by pre-exposure to ethanol. This is an interesting finding, with potential significance for alcohol use disorders, but some conclusions could use additional support.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Well-conceived circuit mapping experiments identify a novel pathway by which the CeA and BNST can modulate dorsal striatal function by controlling cholinergic tone. Important insight into how CRF, a neuropeptide that is important in mediating aspects of stress, affective/motivational processes, and drug-seeking, modulates dorsal striatal function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Tracing and expression experiments were performed both in mice and rats (in a mostly non-overlapping way). While these species are similar in many ways, some conclusions are based on assumptions of similarities that the presented data do not directly show. In most cases, this should be addressed in the text (but see point number 2).</p>
<p>(2) Experiments in rats show that CRFR1 expression is largely confined to a subpopulation of striatal CINs. Is this true in mice, too? Since most electrophysiological experiments are done in various synaptic antagonists and/or TTX, it does not affect the interpretation of those data, but non-CIN expression of CRFR1 could potentially have a large impact on bath CRF-induced acetylcholine release.</p>
<p>(3) Experiments in rats show that about 30% of CINs express CRFR1 in rats. Did only a similar percentage of CINs in mice respond to bath application of CRF? The effect sizes and error bars in Figure 5 imply that the majority of recorded CINs likely responded. Were exclusion criteria used in these experiments?</p>
<p>(4) The conclusion that prior acute alcohol exposure reduces the ability of subsequent alcohol exposure to suppress CIN activity in the presence of CRF may be a bit overstated. In Figure 6D (no ethanol pre-exposure), ethanol does not fully suppress CIN firing rate to baseline after CRF exposure. The attenuated effect of CRF on CIN firing rate after ethanol pre-treatment (6E) may just reduce the maximum potential effect that ethanol can have on firing rate after CRF, due to a lowered starting point. It is possible that the lack of significant effect of ethanol after CRF in pre-treated mice is an issue of experimental sensitivity. Related to this point, does pre-treatment with ethanol reduce the later CIN response to acute ethanol application (in the absence of CRF)?</p>
<p>(5) More details about the area of the dorsal striatum being examined would be helpful (i.e., a-p axis).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Essoh and colleagues present a thorough and elegant study identifying the central amygdala and BNST as key sources of CRF input to the dorsal striatum. Using monosynaptic rabies tracing and electrophysiology, they show direct connections to cholinergic interneurons. The study builds on previous findings that CRF increases CIN firing, extending them by measuring acetylcholine levels in slices and applying optogenetic stimulation of CRF+ fibers. It also uncovers a novel interaction between alcohol and CRF signaling in the striatum, likely to spark significant interest and future research.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A key strength is the integration of anatomical and functional approaches to demonstrate these projections and assess their impact on target cells, striatal cholinergic interneurons.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The nature of the interaction between alcohol and CRF actions on cholinergic neurons remains unclear. Also, further clarification of the ACh sensor used and others is required</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that CRF neurons in the extended amygdala form GABAergic synapses onto cholinergic interneurons and that CRF can excite these neurons. The evidence is strong, however, the authors fail to make a compelling connection showing CRF released from these extended amygdala neurons is mediating any of these effects. Further, they show that acute alcohol appears to modulate this action, although the effect size is not particularly robust.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an exciting connection from the extended amygdala to the striatum that provides a new direction for how these regions can modulate behavior. The work is rigorous and well done.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the authors show that opto stim of these neurons can increase firing, this is not shown to be CRFR1 dependent. In addition, the effects of acute ethanol are not particularly robust or rigorously evaluated. Further, the opto stim experiments are conducted in an Ai32 mouse, so it is impossible to determine if that is from CEA and BNST, vs. another population of CRF-containing neurons. This is an important caveat.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript presents a compelling and methodologically rigorous investigation into how corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) modulates cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the dorsal striatum - a brain region central to cognitive flexibility and action selection-and how this circuit is disrupted by alcohol exposure. Through an integrated series of anatomical, optogenetic, electrophysiological, and imaging experiments, the authors uncover a previously uncharacterized CRF⁺ projection from the central amygdala (CeA) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) to dorsal striatal CINs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Key strengths of the study include the use of state-of-the-art monosynaptic rabies tracing, CRF-Cre transgenic models, CRFR1 reporter lines, and functional validation of synaptic connectivity and neurotransmitter release. The finding that CRF enhances CIN excitability and acetylcholine (ACh) release via CRFR1, and that this effect is attenuated by acute alcohol exposure and withdrawal, provides important mechanistic insight into how stress and alcohol interact to impair striatal function. These results position CRF signaling in CINs as a novel contributor to alcohol use disorder (AUD) pathophysiology, with implications for relapse vulnerability and cognitive inflexibility associated with chronic alcohol intake.</p>
<p>The study is well-structured, with a clear rationale, thorough methodology, and logical progression of results. The discussion effectively contextualizes the findings within broader addiction neuroscience literature and suggests meaningful future directions, including therapeutic targeting of CRFR1 signaling in the dorsal striatum.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Minor areas for improvement include occasional redundancy in phrasing, slightly overlong descriptions in the abstract and significance sections, and a need for more concise language in some places. Nevertheless, these do not detract from the manuscript's overall quality or impact.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a highly valuable contribution to the fields of addiction neuroscience and striatal circuit function, offering novel insights into stress-alcohol interactions at the cellular and circuit level, which requires minor editorial revisions.</p>

<p>We have outlined a clear plan to revise and strengthen the manuscript by addressing key experimental concerns raised in the public reviews.</p>
<p>Summary of Planned Revisions:</p>
<p>We intend to address the following points through new experiments or additional analyses:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1, Concern 2:</bold>  </p>
<p>
“CRFR1 expression is largely confined to a subpopulation of striatal CINs in rats—Is this also true in mice?”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this, we will obtaine CRFR1-GFP mice and perform immunohistochemistry for ChAT to assess the overlap between CRFR1-GFP+ neurons and CINs in the dorsal striatum. This will allow us to directly determine whether CRFR1 expression is similarly restricted in mice as it is in rats.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1, Concern 3:</bold>  </p>
<p>
“In rats, ~30% of CINs express CRFR1. Did a similar proportion of CINs in mice respond to CRF application?”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will revisit and re-analyze our electrophysiological dataset to calculate the percentage of recorded CINs in mice that respond to bath-applied CRF. Our preliminary analysis suggests a higher response rate (&gt;90%), and we will reconcile this with expression data, discuss possible mechanisms (e.g., indirect effects or species-specific differences), and provide a clear explanation in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2, Recommendation 5:</bold>  </p>
<p>
“Can the authors quantify the onset delay of optogenetic responses from CRF+ axons onto CINs?”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We initially performed this experiment in a single animal. To strengthen our conclusion of monosynaptic connectivity, we will increase the sample size (additional injections in CRF-Cre mice) and quantify the onset latency of optogenetically evoked responses in CINs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2, Recommendation 7:</bold>  </p>
<p>
“Are CRFR1+ CINs equally distributed in DMS vs. DLS?”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will re-analyze existing immunohistochemical images from Figure 4 to compare the density (cells/µm²) of CRFR1+ CINs in the dorsomedial vs. dorsolateral striatum. This analysis will help clarify whether there is a regional bias in CRFR1 expression across striatal subdomains.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3, Recommendation 1:</bold>  </p>
<p>
“Test whether CRFR1 mediates the effect of optogenetic stimulation on CIN firing.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will directly test CRFR1-dependence of optogenetically evoked CIN excitation by applying a CRFR1 antagonist during optical stimulation of CRF+ terminals and evaluating the effect on CIN firing. This will clarify whether the CRF effect is receptor-mediated and strengthen the interpretation of our functional findings.</p>
<p>We may conduct more experiment to address other concerns. These targeted experiments will significantly enhance the rigor and mechanistic insight of our study.</p>
