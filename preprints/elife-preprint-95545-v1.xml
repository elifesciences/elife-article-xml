<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Testicular microcalcifications consist of hydroxyapatite and have been associated with an increased risk of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) but may also be the result of benign causes such as loss-of-function variants in the phosphate-transporter gene <italic>SLC34A2</italic>. Here, we show that fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a regulator of phosphate homeostasis, is expressed in testicular germ cell neoplasia <italic>in situ</italic> (GCNIS), embryonal carcinoma (EC), and human embryonic stem cells. FGF23 is not glycosylated in TGCTs and therefore cleaved into a C-terminal fragment which competitively antagonizes full-length FGF23. Here, <italic>Fgf23</italic> knockout mice presented with marked calcifications in the epididymis, spermatogenic arrest, and focally germ cells expressing the osteoblast marker bone gamma-carboxyglutamate protein (BGLAP). Moreover, the frequent testicular microcalcifications in mice with no functional androgen receptor and lack of circulating gonadotropins is associated with lower <italic>Slc34a2</italic> and higher <italic>Slc34a1/Bglap</italic> expression compared with wild-type mice. In accordance, human testicular specimens with microcalcifications also have lower <italic>SLC34A2</italic> and a subpopulation of germ cells express SLC34A1, BGLAP, and RUNX2 highlighting aberrant local phosphate handling and expression of bone-specific proteins. Mineral disturbance <italic>in vitro</italic> using calcium or phosphate treatment induced deposition of calcium-phosphate in a spermatogonial cell line and this effect was fully rescued by the mineralization-inhibitor pyrophosphate. In conclusion, testicular microcalcifications may arise secondary to local alterations in mineral homeostasis, which in combination with impaired Sertoli cell function and reduced levels of mineralization-inhibitors due to high alkaline phosphatase activity in GCNIS and TGCTs, facilitate osteogenic-like differentiation of testicular cells and deposition of hydroxyapatite.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Testicular microlithiasis in infertile men is associated with an increased risk of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. However, both ultrasonic and histological microcalcifications are also frequent findings in the testis of asymptomatic men and the etiology remains largely unknown in both malignant and benign cases. The histological microcalcifications have been shown by Raman spectroscopy to consist of hydroxyapatite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, which is normally found exclusively in the skeleton and requires the presence of cells with osteoblast-like characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Extra-skeletal mineralization is often caused by an imbalance in promoters and inhibitors of biomineralization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Tissue mineralization is tightly controlled by small integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoproteins (SIBLINGs) such as osteopontin (OPN) and dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 (DMP1) that regulate mineralization in concert with osteoblast-specific factors such as bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein (BGLAP) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2). Pyrophosphate (PPi) generated by ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) is an essential suppressor of hydroxyapatite deposition and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) inactivates PPi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. ALP abundance is thus a central factor for local phosphate homeostasis, and during osteogenic differentiation increased ALP activity is a hallmark of the bone-like characteristics of the cells in other extra-skeletal tissue such as blood vessels. In this paper, ALP is used as an acronym for all four isozymes of ALP as all can be found in TGCTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and its receptor Klotho, the phosphate transport proteins solute carrier family SLC34A-1, -2, and -3, and vitamin D metabolizing enzymes are essential for maintaining stable mineral homeostasis and that imbalance in their activity may lead to extra-skeletal calcifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Interestingly, loss-of-function variants in the <italic>GALNT3</italic> gene and hence a lack of degradation-protective glycosylation of FGF23 leads to systemic hyperphosphatemia and severe testicular microcalcifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Intratesticular phosphate levels seem to be essential in the formation of testicular microlithiasis as loss-of-function variants in the main testicular phosphate transporter <italic>SLC34A2</italic> also lead to severe testicular microcalcifications without affecting systemic phosphate levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Testicular microlithiasis is also found in patients with loss-of-function variants in the gene encoding ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 6 (<italic>ABCC6</italic>), which results in abnormal PPi metabolism and thus less inhibition of mineralization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. These studies indicate that particularly local and potentially systemic changes in phosphate homeostasis induce testicular microcalcifications. Therefore, we hypothesized that the etiology of testicular microcalcifications involves disturbances in intratesticular mineral homeostasis.</p>
<p>TGCTs originate from a common progenitor germ cell neoplasia <italic>in situ</italic> (GCNIS), which is characterized by the expression of pluripotency factors such as octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4), NANOG, and high alkaline phosphatase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. GCNIS cells undergo malignant transformation and form either a seminoma that retains germ cell characteristics or a non-seminoma that may contain embryonal carcinoma (EC) resembling human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), teratoma, yolk sac tumor, choriocarcinoma, or a combination of these<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. During the malignant transformation of GCNIS into invasive TGCTs duplication of chromosome 12p (often as isochromosome 12p) is the most consistent chromosomal aberration, and may be involved in the dedifferentiation from GCNIS to EC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In healthy individuals, FGF23 is produced exclusively in osteocytes, and the location of the gene on chromosome 12p may be important for its presence and role in TGCTs. Full-length FGF23 increases phosphate excretion by decreasing the luminal expression of SLC34A1 in the kidney and by lowering the concentration of active vitamin D via increased expression of the inactivating enzyme CYP24A1 and reduced expression of the activating enzyme CYP27B1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. We have previously shown that the local metabolism of vitamin D disappeared during the malignant transformation of GCNIS to EC and that FGF23 was expressed in an EC-derived cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. O-glycosylation by GALNT3 protects FGF23 from rapid degradation, and full-length FGF23 activates a receptor complex consisting of Klotho heterodimerization with FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1). However, the cleaved C-terminal fragment (cFGF23) can bind and serve as a competitive antagonist for intact FGF23 (iFGF23), and iFGF23 is also capable of inducing Klotho-independent effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Loss-of-function variants in the genes <italic>FGF23</italic>, <italic>GALNT3</italic>, or <italic>Klotho</italic> lead to tumoral calcinosis partly through osteogenic-like differentiation of mesenchymal-derived cells due to altered mineral homeostasis and vitamin D metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Here, we investigated whether ectopic FGF23 production and abundant ALP activity in TGCTs alter testicular mineral homeostasis, which alone or in combination with impaired Sertoli cell function may facilitate osteogenic-like differentiation and thus be responsible for the frequent deposition of hydroxyapatite in TGCTs and dysgenetic testes. To address this question, we investigated the expression of mineral regulators and bone factors in human tissues containing TGCT-associated calcifications, <italic>Fgf23</italic> knockout (<italic>Fgf23</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) mice, hypogonadal (no gonadotropins) mice, androgen-insensitive mice with microcalcifications, mice with microcalcifications due to Sertoli cell ablation, mice xenografted with a TGCT-derived cell line, mice treated with a high phosphate diet, mineral deposition in a mouse spermatogonial cell line (GC1), and an <italic>ex vivo</italic> mouse testis culture model.</p>

<title>Testicular microcalcifications are associated with the presence of renal phosphate transporters and bone markers in human testis</title>
<p>Ultrasonic testicular microlithiasis is often observed adjacent to TGCTs but can also be found in testes without TGCTs or GCNIS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Ultrasonic testicular microlithiasis is not always associated with histological microcalcifications but intratesticular mineral depositions can be confirmed by von Kossa or alizarin red staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), and Raman spectroscopy has previously demonstrated that testicular microcalcifications consist of hydroxyapatite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In GCNIS-containing tubules adjacent to microcalcifications we found that the renal phosphate transporter SLC34A1 and FGF23 were ectopically expressed. In contrast, Klotho was expressed in the cytoplasm of the germ cells in normal tubules, with or without adjacent microcalcifications, but not in GCNIS. FGFR1 expression was found in both GCNIS and normal tubules (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The expression of the bone marker BGLAP was present in tissue with GCNIS and adjacent to the microcalcifications but not the normal tubules with full spermatogenesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Suppl. Table 1</xref>). The microcalcifications vary in size from small calcifications focally in the center of seminiferous tubules to occupying most of the intraluminal area (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). In very rare severe cases there was intratesticular bone formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). We investigated the presence of several bone factors in the cells adjacent to the microcalcifications. The early osteoblast marker RUNX2 was not expressed in testes with normal spermatogenesis. However, occasionally, when microcalcifications or bone formation were detected, a small fraction of the germ cells in the seminiferous tubules (ST) had cytoplasmic staining of RUNX2 supporting a bone-like phenotype of some germ cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref>, and <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Suppl. Table 1</xref>). The shift in expression of the phosphate transporters from SLC34A2 to SLC34A1 and the presence of bone factors in testis with microcalcifications were also evident at the transcriptional level. <italic>SLC34A1</italic> was expressed at a very low level in normal testis but was highly expressed in 25% of the specimens containing GCNIS. In contrast, the phosphate transporter <italic>SLC34A2</italic> was abundantly expressed in the germ cells from normal testis but the expression was lower in specimens containing GCNIS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>FGF23 is produced by human testicular germ cell tumors and embryonic stem cells</title>
<p>FGF23, a potent regulator of phosphate homeostasis, is expressed in the EC-derived cell line NTera2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, and the <italic>FGF23</italic> gene is located on chromosome 12p which is duplicated in TGCTs and could be associated with the formation of testicular microcalcifications. Thus, expression of <italic>FGF23</italic> was investigated in human testicular specimens containing ‘normal testis’ (adjacent tissue to TGCT/GCNIS without presence of malignant cells), Sertoli-cell-only pattern, GCNIS, seminoma, and EC with or without teratoma components. The transcriptional level of <italic>FGF23</italic> was highest in EC components, significantly higher compared with normal testis, and was positively associated with the expression of the pluripotency factors <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> (R=0.66, P=0.049, and R=0.61, P=0.068, respectively). Two EC specimens with polyembryoma components (the most dedifferentiated structure resembling early embryonic formation) had several fold higher levels of <italic>FGF23</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>). A higher expression of <italic>FGF23</italic> in GCNIS compared with normal testis was also confirmed in microdissected GCNIS cells, while fetal gonocytes and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) also expressed <italic>FGF23</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The high expression of <italic>FGF23</italic> in hESC and EC was validated by a ∼30-fold higher expression in different strains of hESC cells and the EC-derived cell line NTera2 compared with normal testis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). In contrast, normal testicular tissue had a high expression of the receptor Klotho (<italic>KL</italic>), whereas the expression was low in GCNIS cells and hESC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). IHC confirmed the marked expression of FGF23 solely in OCT4-positive GCNIS cells that also expressed FGFR1, while Klotho was exclusively expressed in normal germ cells and not found in any of the OCT4-positive cancer cells including seminoma and EC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Suppl. Table 1</xref>). FGF23 was also expressed in the EC cells characterized by concomitant OCT4 expression but was virtually absent in seminoma cells despite their marked OCT4 expression suggesting that the chromosome 12p duplication (occurring in both seminoma and EC) alone is not sufficient to maintain FGF23 production. Western blot confirmed the presence of FGF23 with two bands corresponding to the sizes of cFGF23 and iFGF23 in GCNIS and EC. cFGF23 was also expressed in NTera2 cells, and neither cFGF23 nor iFGF23 were detected in normal testis or the seminoma-derived cell line TCam2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). cFGF23 and iFGF23 were expressed in an anaplastic seminoma sample, which is considered a rare intermediate between seminoma and EC due to the high proliferative index and morphological resemblance with EC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref> and <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Suppl. table 1</xref>). Production and release of FGF23 in GCNIS and EC cells were examined by measuring the total FGF23 (iFGF23 + cFGF23) and cFGF23 concentrations in seminal fluid from healthy men and testicular tumor patients. Healthy men had undetectable iFGF23 levels in the seminal fluid, and a few (8/19) men had detectable cFGF23. A few men with GCNIS (2/7) or EC (2/10) had detectable levels of iFGF23 in the seminal fluid while total FGF23 were detected in the majority (9/10) of men with EC and their total FGF23 concentration in seminal fluid was significantly higher compared with healthy men (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>).</p>

<title>Testicular phosphate homeostasis in NTera2 xenograft mice is altered by FGF23-independent actions</title>
<p>In NTera2 xenograft tumors, FGF23 was expressed in only 5-10% of tumor cells, which indicates that the phenotype of the NTera2 cells changes <italic>in vivo</italic>. This may be caused in part by somatic differentiation of the FGF23-negative fraction comprising 90-95% of the tumors, as also illustrated by the similar expression pattern of OCT4 within the tumor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Human iFGF23 in serum from nude mice with tumors was 4-fold higher compared with control nude mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) and thus much lower than the EC tumors samples. The presence of iFGF23 in serum and the undetectable levels of iFGF23 in NTera2 cells grown <italic>in vitro</italic> suggests that NTera2 cells xenografted into nude mice may undergo somatic differentiation in response to host stimuli and facilitate GALNT3-mediated glycosylation of iFGF23 to prevent its cleavage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>).

<title>Testicular microcalcifications in hypogonadal, androgen receptor knockout, and Sertoli cell-ablated mice</title>
<p>Testicular microcalcifications are not exclusively found in mice with knockout of phosphate transport regulators but also in ∼30% of hypogonadal (<italic>hpg</italic>) mice that lack circulating gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone). The proportion of mice with testicular microcalcifications increased to ∼94% in mice with concomitant global loss of the androgen receptor (<italic>AR</italic>) (<italic>hpg</italic>.ARKO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> (schematically illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Sertoli cell-specific ablation of <italic>AR</italic> in <italic>hpg</italic> mice (<italic>hpg</italic>.SCARKO) did not augment the effect on microcalcifications in the <italic>hpg</italic> mice, indicating a role of AR in peritubular cells (the only other cell type in the testis that express AR) or AR-expressing cells outside the testis for the formation of microcalcifications. Thus, suggesting that somatic cells may be important for the bone-like trans-differentiation in mice. Noteworthy, a shift in the expression of phosphate transporters was observed in the testis of <italic>hpg</italic>, <italic>hpg</italic>.SCARKO, and <italic>hpg</italic>.ARKO mice which had higher expression of <italic>Slc34a1</italic> and lower expression of <italic>Slc20a1</italic> and <italic>Slc34a2</italic> compared with WT mice. Thus, supporting the hypothesis that local phosphate homeostasis is involved in the formation of microcalcifications in accordance with the observations in human tissues with microcalcifications. There were no significant differences in <italic>Slc20a1, Slc34a2</italic>, and <italic>Slc34a1</italic> expression between <italic>hpg, hpg</italic>.SCARKO, or <italic>hpg</italic>.ARKO mice despite the higher proportion of mice with microcalcifications in the <italic>hpg</italic>.ARKO group.

Ablation of Sertoli cells at postnatal day 18 induced substantial microcalcifications in the adult mice (80 days old) as shown by alizarin red and von Kossa staining (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). The microcalcifications persisted when assessed in mice 1-year of age (data not shown). The timing of ablation seemed to be important because Sertoli cell ablation in adulthood (after puberty) did not cause microcalcifications when evaluated after 90 days but was detectable one year later (data not shown). This shows that immature prepubertal cells are more prone to form microcalcifications. The formation of microcalcifications depends on the presence of germ cells with stem cell potential as ablation of Sertoli cells during embryonic development, which causes loss of germ cells, did not result in testicular microcalcifications.</p>

<title>Alkaline phosphatases in TGCTs and effects of calcium, phosphate, and pyrophosphate on mineralization in a spermatogonial cell line</title>
<p>ALP degrades the potent inhibitor of mineralization PPi and is highly expressed in the cells of mineralized tissue. Clinically, ALP expression is used as a marker for GCNIS and seminoma. Alkaline phosphatase activity was markedly higher in GCNIS tubules compared with normal seminiferous tubules as determined by NBT/BCIP staining (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). All four types of ALPs were expressed in normal testis and the expression in GCNIS with microlithiasis and seminoma was not significantly higher, although some tumor specimens have marked expression of all four ALP isozymes. This shows that alkaline phosphatase activity is higher in GCNIS/TGCTs and typically mediated by a combination of different isozymes rather than a single type of ALP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). To determine if mineralization can be induced in germ cells, the mouse spermatogonial cell line GC1 was treated with increasing concentrations of calcium and phosphate, and mineral deposition was subsequently visualized by alizarin red. Mineralization was already observed after co-treatment with calcium and phosphate for two days, but also after seven days of treatment with calcium or phosphate alone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). With a low serum phosphate concentration (0.9 mM), 3 mM calcium was required to obtain rapid mineralization after two days, whereas even 4 mM phosphate did not induce mineralization in a normal calcium concentration (1.8 mM) after two or four days. However, an increment in calcium to 2.0 mM enabled five of the six phosphate doses to induce rapid mineralization of the GC1 cells. This indicates that low calcium levels are protective in the high intratesticular phosphate environment. Longer exposure (four and seven days) augmented the response in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of PPi, an inhibitor of mineralization, reduced mineralization, whereas co-treatment with PPi and pyrophosphatase (PPA1) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate (PPi) to inorganic phosphate (Pi) reintroduced mineralization (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). To assess the regulation of phosphatase activity in germ cells, a human cell line TCam2 was used as a positive control. TCam2 is derived from a seminoma and retains high expression of ectopic alkaline phosphatase, as assessed by NBT/BCIP staining, which was critically dependent on an alkaline environment with marked phosphatase activity at pH 9, but not at pH 7 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Staining with Fast Blue RR revealed that alkaline phosphatase activity was increased in the presence of osteogenic medium compared with control medium, indicating that germ cells may increase their alkaline phosphatase activity in the presence of factors that facilitate bone differentiation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). However, an <italic>ex vivo</italic> model using wild-type mouse testicles (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>) cultured for 14 days with osteogenic medium -/+ phosphate did not change the expression of the bone markers <italic>Bglap</italic>, <italic>Runx2</italic>, or <italic>Alpl</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). However, occasionally one or few tubules had expression of RUNX2, which was observed more often in specimens treated with osteogenic medium than in specimens treated with vehicle (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Few of the specimens only had Sertoli cells in the tubules due to loss of germ cells and were therefore excluded from the analysis. Runx2 protein expression was not observed in those tissue pieces.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This translational study demonstrates that testicular microcalcifications, both benign and malignant, occur secondary to changes in gonadal phosphate homeostasis and are often accompanied by a subsequent osteogenic-like differentiation of germ cells or testicular somatic cells. Microcalcifications are more prevalent in testicular biopsies with GCNIS than without<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, which highlights that GCNIS or TGCTs may release factors involved in the development of microlithiasis, but the accompanied impaired Sertoli cell function appears to be of greater importance than the presence of malignant germ cells. In this manuscript, we show that impaired Sertoli cell function in both mice and humans increases the risk of testicular microlithiasis and this association seems to be more persistent than the malignant linkage.</p>
<p>The systemic master regulator of phosphate, FGF23, is highly expressed in GCNIS, EC, and hESC but not in classical seminoma. This suggests that the expression of FGF23 is linked with the transformation of GCNIS to the invasive EC and is not a result of duplication of chromosome 12p which is also prevalent in classical seminoma. The marked expression in EC and hESCs highlights that FGF23 is an early embryonic signal, which is further supported by the strong correlation between <italic>FGF23</italic> and pluripotency factors <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NANOG</italic> in EC and the high <italic>FGF23</italic> expression in EC with polyembryoma formation. Moreover, it is in accordance with previous reports identifying <italic>FGF23</italic> transcripts in hESCs and during early embryonic life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Phosphate levels in the testis are 3-fold higher than in serum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In vascular and soft tissue calcification, FGF23-Klotho activity has been suggested to regulate ion metabolism and subsequently induce the presence of bone-like cells in the vessels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. The observed hydroxyapatite in the cauda epididymis of <italic>Fgf23<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice shows that loss of FGF23 signaling causes deposition of hydroxyapatite. As EC and GCNIS have no GALNT3 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, FGF23 will rapidly be cleaved into cFGF23 which is in accordance with the detection of mainly cFGF23 (and not iFGF23) in seminal fluid from GCNIS and EC patients. High intratesticular cFGF23 may bind the Klotho/FGFR1 receptor and antagonize the effect of iFGF23<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> thereby inducing a phenotype resembling <italic>Fgf23<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with increased expression of <italic>Bglap</italic>. However, in our human testis <italic>ex vivo</italic> model neither cFGF23 nor iFGF23 induced changes in phosphate transporters or <italic>BGLAP</italic> suggesting that short-term exposure (24 h) to high cFGF23 does not induce changes in phosphate transporters, bone factors, or microcalcifications. The epididymal phenotype of <italic>Fgf23<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice does not appear to be mediated via systemic hyperphosphatemia as a high phosphate dietary exposure for weeks did not result in testicular or epididymal microcalcifications or changes in testicular phosphate transporter expression. Instead, we have previously shown that germ cell-specific deletion of Klotho in mice leads to aberrant mineral homeostasis, particularly calcium transport through TRPV5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, which may be important as low calcium appears to be protective for inducing microcalcifications in a high phosphate environment. Local testicular mineral levels depend mainly on the presence and activity of specific transporters and sensors of calcium and phosphate in the reproductive organs, rather than on systemic concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. This may also explain why patients with loss-of-function variants in the predominant testicular phosphate transporter <italic>SLC34A2</italic> present with testicular microcalcifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, patients with loss-of-function variants in <italic>GALNT3</italic>, which lead to the early degradation of intact FGF23 to its C-terminal form, present with global calcifications, severe testicular microlithiasis, and microcalcifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><italic>Fgf23</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit hypogonadism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and spermatogenic arrest, which resembles the condition of some men with testicular dysgenesis syndrome that occasionally have testicular microcalcifications despite no malignancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Benign microcalcifications may be facilitated by low levels of androgens or gonadotropins as such hormonal imbalances can disrupt the Sertoli cell function. As a result, the germ cells may remain in their prepubertal stem cell state, rather than maturing properly leaving them susceptible to external stimuli that could trigger abnormal differentiation. Changes in the local testicular phosphate concentration (which is 3-fold higher than serum) could exert such a stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. This hypothesis was supported by the presence of microcalcifications in <italic>hpg</italic> mice with concomitant global <italic>AR</italic> ablation as these mice have immature Sertoli cells and are unable to complete spermatogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Moreover, these mice had altered testicular phosphate homeostasis characterized by a non-significant tendency towards lower <italic>Slc34a2,</italic> but significantly higher <italic>Slc34a1</italic> expression compared with WT mice. However, both <italic>hpg</italic> and <italic>hpg</italic> mice with Sertoli cell-specific <italic>AR</italic> deletion (<italic>hpg.SCARKO</italic>) had similar changes in phosphate transporters and only 30-36% frequency of microlithiasis, suggesting that additional mechanisms are contributing to the formation of microlithiasis. The bone marker <italic>Bglap</italic> was detected exclusively in all the <italic>hpg</italic> mice with concomitant global <italic>AR</italic> deletion (<italic>hpg.ARKO</italic>) but not in <italic>hpg</italic> mice with intact AR, which supports that some testicular cells undergo osteogenic trans-differentiation, and this may facilitate or accompany more abundant deposition of hydroxyapatite. We can not show the cell-of-origin, but we have previously shown that vitamin D induces an osteogenic-like differentiation of NTera2 cells which start to express bone-specific proteins such as BGLAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. However, the osteogenic-like differentiation in <italic>hpg</italic> mice occurs in non-malignant prepubertal/non-maturated testicular cells although we cannot clarify the cell-of-origin.</p>
<p>Peritubular cells may be a good candidate because they are mesenchymal-derived and such fibroblast-like cells can undergo osteogenic-like differentiation during vascular calcification at other sites of extra-skeletal mineralization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. However, human Sertoli cells can also form large-cell calcifying tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> indicating that multiple gonadal cell types have the potential to become bone-like. In mice, Sertoli cell-ablation before puberty caused extensive intratubular microcalcifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, whereas Sertoli cell-ablation in adulthood did not result in the formation of microcalcifications when assessed three months later despite a greater burden of immediate intratubular cell death. This finding is important because it demonstrates that microcalcifications are not caused by massive intratubular cell death in mice but are critically dependent on germ cells with stem cell potential. Thus, indicating that Sertoli cell maturation and function are essential for protection against osteogenic-like differentiation of the germ cells or peritubular cells and that benign microcalcifications are more likely to occur as a consequence of prepubertal Sertoli cell disturbance. The spermatogonial stem cells may also be the cell type that undergoes osteogenic-like differentiation as they can spontaneously develop into all three germ layers when isolated from adult mice, form teratomas in nude mice, and participate in the formation of multiple organs when injected into blastocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. RUNX2 is an essential transcription factor for osteoblast development, and although germ cells express a different isoform of RUNX2 (lacking exon 4-8), it is transcribed from the same promoter as in bone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. RUNX2 was undetectable in healthy seminiferous tubules using an antibody targeting exon 5, but was detected in GCNIS, hyalinized/calcified tissues, and the otherwise seemingly healthy seminiferous tubules adjacent to bone in the testis, which could indicate that the bone-specific RUNX2 isoform may also be expressed in the testis when microcalcifications occur. Also, the mature bone marker BGLAP was expressed in a fraction of cells that morphologically resemble germ cells. Unfortunately, there was no cell-tracing marker in the mouse models so the required tracing experiments to support that these bone-like cells originated from the germ cells could not be conducted. Instead, a spermatogonial mouse cell line was exposed to calcium and phosphate at concentrations similar to those found in the testis or the epididymis. After 2-7 days of exposure, the spermatogonia started to deposit minerals illustrating that they developed some osteoblast-like characteristics, but they did not undergo complete osteogenic differentiation. A similar experiment using an adult mouse testis culture model without exposure to gonadotropins or androgens showed that treatment with an osteogenic cocktail for 14 days did not induce <italic>Runx2</italic>, <italic>Bgalp</italic>, or <italic>Alpl</italic> but a focal expression of the RUNX2 (using the antibody targeting exon 5) was found in specimens treated with both vehicle and the osteogenic cocktail, indicating that RUNX2 expression was switched to the bone-specific isoform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> during <italic>ex vivo</italic> culturing. Interestingly, RUNX2 was more frequently found in specimens treated with the osteogenic cocktail and phosphate.</p>
<p>One of the most potent inhibitors of mineralization is PPi, which can be degraded by alkaline phosphatase or pyrophosphatase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. PPi prevented the mineralization induced by calcium and phosphate in the GC1 cell line, which was reintroduced in the presence of pyrophosphatase-degrading PPi. This highlights the role of PPi as an inhibitor of spermatogonial mineralization. Alkaline phosphatases convert PPi to Pi and are expressed by primordial and malignant germ cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Four genes encode alkaline phosphatases in humans (five in mice), and all are expressed in malignant germ cells, including the tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. TNAP is required for normal bone formation and regulates vascular matrix mineralization by inactivation of the mineralization inhibitors PPi and OPN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. We show here that TCam2 cells have high alkaline phosphatase activity in alkaline pH, suggesting that mineralization is promoted by malignant cells. This implies that men with GCNIS and TGCTs are prone to microcalcifications due to lower PPi levels caused by increased alkaline phosphatase activity. Several other inhibitors and promoters of mineralization could be involved, but the marked epididymal mineralization observed in <italic>Fgf23</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, despite the presence of SIBLING proteins that inhibit hydroxyapatite formation and the extensive testicular microcalcifications in men with loss-of-function variants in <italic>SLC34A2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, suggest that a change of just one component can be enough to promote the formation of microcalcifications. Bone formation in the testis is commonly observed in teratomas but can occur without malignancy. Mature bone tissue formation has also been reported in the testis after trauma or bleeding without signs of GCNIS or invasive TGCTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Here, we also show intratesticular bone in a specimen despite no detection of GCNIS or malignant cells. A comprehensive analysis of germ cells adjacent to the bone tissue revealed focally bone-specific RUNX2 positive germ cells but none of them expressed the other investigated bone markers or deposition of hydroxyapatite, which indicates that the mature bone may have been formed in the interstitial compartment through a different mechanism related to the trauma rather than alterations in mineral homeostasis leading to testicular microcalcifications.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we show that the formation of testicular microcalcifications occurs as a result of both malignant and benign etiology, which includes one or more of the following events: aberrant function of Sertoli cells, disturbed local phosphate homeostasis, change in mineralization inhibitors, and aberrant germ cell function. These changes alone or in combination can drive osteogenic-like differentiation of germ cells resulting in intratubular deposition of microcalcifications consisting of hydroxyapatite. Thus, this study suggests that microcalcifications alone should not be considered a marker for malignancy in the testis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Despite the study being a collation of important results likely to have an overall positive effect on the field, methodological weaknesses and suboptimal use of statistics make it difficult to give confidence to the study's message.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Relevant human and mouse models approached with in vivo and in vitro techniques.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The methodology, statistics, reagents, analyses, and manuscripts' language all lack rigour.</p>
<p>(1) The authors used statistics to generate P-values and Rsquare values to evaluate the strength of their findings.</p>
<p>However, it is unclear how stats were used and/or whether stats were used correctly. For instance, the authors write: &quot;Gaussian distribution of all numerical variables was evaluated by QQ plots&quot;. But why? For statistical tests that fall under the umbrella of General Linear Models (line ANOVA, t-tests, and correlations (Pearson's)), there are several assumptions that ought to be checked, including typically:</p>
<p>(a) Gaussian distribution of residuals.</p>
<p>(b) Homoskedasticity of the residuals.</p>
<p>(c) Independence of Y, but that's assumed to be valid due to experimental design.</p>
<p>So what is the point of evaluating the Gaussian distribution of the data themselves? It is not necessary. In this reviewer's opinion, it is irrelevant, not a good use of statistics, and we ought to be leading by example here.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is not clear whether the homoscedasticity of the residuals was checked. Many of the data appear to have particularly heteroskedastic residuals. In many respects, homoscedasticity matters more than the normal distribution of the residuals. In Graphpad analyses if ANOVA is used but equal variances are assumed (when variances among groups are unequal then standard deviations assigned in each group will be wrong and thus incorrect p values are being calculated.</p>
<p>Based on the incomplete and/or wrong statistical analyses it is difficult to evaluate the study in greater depth.</p>
<p>While on the subject of stats, it is worth mentioning this misuse of statistics in Figure 3D, where the authors added the Slc34a1 transcript levels from controls in the correlation analyses, thereby driving the intercept down. Without the Control data there does not appear to be a correlation between the Slc34a1 levels and tumor size.</p>
<p>There is more. The authors make statements (e.g. in the figure levels as: &quot;Correlations indicated by R2.&quot;. What does that mean? In a simple correlation, the P value is used to evaluate the strength of the slope being different from zero. The authors also give R2 values for the correlations but they do not provide R2 values for the other stats (like ANOVAs). Why not?</p>
<p>(2) The authors used antibodies for immunos and WBs. I checked those antibodies online and it was concerning:</p>
<p>(a) Many are discontinued.</p>
<p>(b) Many are not validated.</p>
<p>(c) Many performed poorly in the Immunos, e.g. FGF23, FGFR1, and Kotho are not really convincing. PO5F1 (gene: OCT4) is the one that looks convincing as it is expressed at the correct cell types.</p>
<p>(d) Others like NPT2A (product of gene SLC34A1) are equally unconvincing. Shouldn't the immuno show them to be in the plasma membrane?</p>
<p>If there is some brown staining, this does not mean the antibodies are working. If your antibodies are not validated then you ought to omit the immunos from the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study set out to examine microlithiasis associated with an increased risk of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT). This reviewer considers this to be an excellent study. It raises questions regarding exactly how aberrant Sertoli cell function could induce osteogenic-like differentiation of germ cells but then all research should raise more questions than it answers.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Data showing the link between a disruption in testicular mineral (phosphate) homeostasis, FGF23 expression, and Sertoli cell dysfunction, are compelling.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Not sure I see any weaknesses here, as this study advances this area of inquiry and ends with a hypothesis for future testing.</p>
