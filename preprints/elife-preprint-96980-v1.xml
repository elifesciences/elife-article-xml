<title>Summary</title>
<p>During neural tube patterning, a gradient of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling specifies ventral progenitor fates. The cellular response to Shh is processed through a genetic regulatory network (GRN) to specify distinct fate decisions. This process integrates Shh response level, duration and other inputs and is affected by noise in signaling and cell position. How reliably Shh response profile predicts the fate choice of a single cell is unclear. Here we use live imaging to track neural progenitors in developing zebrafish and quantify both Shh and fate reporters in single cells over time. We found that there is significant heterogeneity between Shh response and fate choice in single cells. We quantitatively modeled reporter intensities to obtain single cell response levels over time and systematically evaluated their correlation with cell fate specification. Motor neuron progenitors (pMN) exhibit a high degree of variability in their Shh responses, which is particularly prominent in the posterior neural tube where the Shh response dynamics are similar to those of the more ventrally fated lateral floor plate cells (LFPs). Our results highlight the precision limit of morphogen-interpretation GRNs in small and dynamic target cell fields.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Morphogens pattern tissue by acting over space in a concentration dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Wolpert 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kicheva and Briscoe 2023</xref>). Biochemically, morphogen molecules may either regulate transcription directly (Driever and Nusslein-Volhard, 1989), or through a specific transducer following a cascade of intracellular interactions - a signaling pathway. The latter involves additional, potentially non-linear steps of signaling. A prominent example of morphogen patterning is the vertebrate ventral neural tube where the morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh), produced from the notochord and floor plate, forms an extracellular gradient. Through its transcriptional effector Gli, this Shh gradient specifies different neural progenitor domains along the ventral-dorsal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Jessell 2000</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In this system, Gli activity profiles (cellular responses) regulate the expression of multiple homeobox transcription factors (fate genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Briscoe et al., 2000</xref>). These fate genes regulate their own and each other’s expression as a genetic regulatory network (GRN); this network finally settles into one of several discrete and stable states that correspond to different neuronal fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Lek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balaskas et al., 2012</xref>). On the basis of population-level observations of the Shh pathway and transcriptional network, different aspects of the Shh signaling/Gli activity profile have been proposed to control cell fate choices: e.g., threshold levels (presumably by different affinities between Gli and fate gene enhancers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ericson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Oosterveen et al., 2012</xref>), duration of response (sustained Gli levels under the adaptive negative feedback of the Patched [Ptc] receptor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Dessaud et al., 2007</xref>) and the time-integrated response level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Dessaud et al., 2010</xref>). As these response dynamics are integrated through the GRN towards fate decisions, inherent noise in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Rosenfeld et al., 2005</xref>) may generate heterogeneity in the response-fate correlation, despite the ability of the GRN to increase robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balaskas et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, our previous work reveals extensive cell movement (positional noise) and a role of cell sorting in refining the boundaries of fate domains in the zebrafish neural tube after cells are specified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>), which are mediated by an adhesion code downstream of cell fate choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Tsai et al., 2020</xref>). These studies suggest a possible limit of precision in morphogen signal interpretation in fate specification. To test this possibility, single cell observations using live imaging of transgenic reporters to simultaneously monitor both morphogen response and cell fate choices <italic>in vivo</italic> are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Xiong and Megason, 2015</xref>). The zebrafish neural tube, with established reporter lines of Shh signaling and neural progenitor fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Tsai et al., 2020</xref>), provides a feasible model system to perform this analysis.</p>

<title>Live tracking of individual neural progenitor fate choices in zebrafish embryos</title>
<p>To enable a direct, single-cell quantification of Shh response dynamics and fate choice, we developed an imaging protocol using double transgenic reporters along with a nuclear or membrane localized EBFP2 for cell tracking (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We combined the <italic>tgBAC(ptch2:kaede)</italic> reporter whose Kaede expression reports Shh response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Huang et al., 2012</xref>) and a second transgenic reporter (e.g., <italic>tg(nkx2.2a:mgfp)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ng et al, 2005</xref>], <italic>tg(olig2:gfp)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Shin et al, 2003</xref>], <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) whose expression levels indicate different fate choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>). Movies with good spatial-temporal coverage of the neural plate/tube (e.g., Movies S1) were analyzed by single cell tracking in GoFigure2, an open-source software we previously developed for image analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>). By manually placing a seed at the center of the same cell at each time-point in the dataset, we generated a series of spherical segmentations inside the cell, which capture the fluorescence intensity of each reporter and the position of the tracked cell over time. Together, this time-dependent positional and reporter intensity information represents what we call a ‘neural progenitor track’ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D-E</xref>, Movie S2). We analyzed over 200 randomly chosen tracked cells to cover the ventral progenitor types in the zebrafish neural tube: the medial floor plate cells (MFPs), lateral floor plate cells (LFPs), motor neuron progenitors (pMNs) and “More Dorsal” cells (e.g., p2,p1,p0 progenitors) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>These cell fates form distinct domains highly conserved among vertebrates and prescribe the pattern of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Jessell 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lewis and Eisen, 2003</xref>). In zebrafish, MFPs along with the notochord are the source cells of Shh; LFPs, pMNs and More Dorsal cells depend on Shh signaling for correct specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Park et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Taking advantage of the reporter expression and the stereotypic position at the end time point of each track, we identified and assigned different fates to the tracked neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>). We imaged cells from both the anterior spinal cord (approximately somite levels 4-9) as well as the posterior spinal cord (approximately somite levels 9-14). The shape, size and morphogenetic movements of both the Shh sending and receiving tissues vary along the AP axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>), thus allowing us to sample a diversity of input-output (i.e., Shh response-fate choice) relationships.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Heterogeneity is pervasive in Shh response dynamics and fate choice in single cells</title>
<p>Our set of ∼200 single cell tracks provide a first glimpse into the dynamics of Shh interpretation <italic>in vivo</italic>. The main new insights come from being able to observe the dynamics of two nodes of the GRN in the same live cell, namely a Shh response reporter (<italic>ptch2:kaede</italic>) and a fate reporter. To compare our data with previous studies, we first analyzed the average Shh response behavior of cells within each fate group (calculated by simple averaging of single cell tracks within each of the different fates). In both the anterior and posterior spinal cord in zebrafish (Movie S3 and S4, respectively), the average LFP shows the fastest increase of Kaede intensity, while the average pMN shows intermediate increase and the average More Dorsal cell is the slowest (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A,C</xref>). Accordingly, the <italic>olig2:gfp</italic> reporter is highly expressed in the average pMN but comes to a plateau after initial expression in the average LFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B,D</xref>). These data are consistent with observations that these cell types require different levels of Shh for specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ericson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Park et al., 2004</xref>) and that in amniotes the p3 progenitors (equivalent to LFPs in fish) initially express the pMN marker <italic>olig2</italic> but then shift to express <italic>nkx2.2</italic> with continued and/or increasing Shh exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Jeong and McMahon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Dessaud et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

Colored shades around the average tracks represent ±S.D. Individual <italic>ptch2:kaede</italic> traces (A’,C’) show significant overlap between fates. Note that intensity units are not comparable between different datasets (e.g., between A and C) due to variation in expression, sample depth, mounting position, and imaging settings. The average tracks appear noisier before 10hpf and after 15hpf due to some single cell tracks not being long enough temporally (e.g., a tracked cell leaves the field of view) therefore fewer data points are available for averaging at the ends.

<graphic xlink:href="412858v2_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>We next ask whether single cells behave stereotypically like the averaged cell. Strikingly, at the single cell level, we observed high variability in Shh-signaling reporter dynamics across cells of the same fate and some overlap of cells that finally take on different fates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>’-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>’). There are examples of cells that have similar <italic>ptch2:kaede</italic> traces but distinct fate reporter traces (e.g., in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, track 1 vs. 2, 3 vs. 4), as well as cells with very different <italic>ptch2:kaede</italic> traces but similar fate reporter traces (e.g., in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, track 1 vs. 3). These data show that single cells have heterogeneity in the correlation between Shh response and fate choice. Cells that choose the same fate could have distinct Shh responses and cells that have very similar Shh responses may make different fate choices.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Quantifying reporter activity dynamics from fluorescent intensity tracks</title>
<p>Given the apparent heterogeneity and overlap in the single cell track data, are there certain features in the reporter dynamics that predict fate outcome more accurately? In other words, are the apparently very similar <italic>ptch2:kaede</italic> tracks (as seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) different in a certain way that could explain their distinct fate choices? Our tracks offer us an opportunity to address this question by quantifying and systematically classifying Shh signaling activity, namely the transcription rate of the <italic>ptch2</italic> reporter, from the fluorescence intensities. However, the intensity measurements must be handled carefully and interpreted with consideration of experimental limitations to provide useful insights.</p>
<p>First, while the fluorescence intensity levels measured in single cells by image segmentation are in principle proportional to the reporter protein concentration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), the acquisition and analysis processes may introduce several errors: bleaching, bleed-through, saturation, and segmentation measurement error. Our sampling frequency is even lower here than our previous work, in which other imaging settings were similar and quantification of fluorescence signals indicated that bleaching was not significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that the bleaching factor can be ignored here. To account for bleed-through, which refers to the phenomenon of signal from one fluorophore contributing to another during simultaneous acquisition, we applied a percentage subtraction from each channel after determining the bleed-through ratio using all data points (methods). To account for saturation, which refers to signal intensity exceeding the dynamic range of detection causing an artificial signal plateau, we removed data points where the fraction of saturated pixels exceeds 5% within segmented cells (methods). To handle noise that arises from random fluctuations of segmentation measurement between time points (technical errors), we applied a moving-average smoothing to the tracks over windows of 6 time points (36min, see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> for effects of varying this time window).</p>

<caption><title>Estimation of dynamic reporter activity from fluorescence intensity measurements</title>
<p>(A) Example raw tracks (a pMN [green], a LFP [brown] and a More Dorsal cell [blue] each). The tracks were trimmed to contain only data points between 10 and 15 hpf as this time window is best covered in the tracks. Before 10 hpf the signal is low and by 15 hpf most progenitors have become specified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>).</p>

<p>(D) Modeled signaling level (<italic>ptch2:kaede</italic> transcription rate) of the same tracks using <xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (3)</xref>.

<graphic xlink:href="412858v2_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>This operation causes some short-time scale features of the tracks (which are otherwise not possible to analyze due to technical errors in the measurements) to be lost, but it preserves trends on longer time intervals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We further confirmed the mitigation of the impact of technical errors by re-tracking the same cells, where the average variation of intensity measurement over 6 time points is consistently &lt;5% (data not shown). Together this pipeline transforms raw tracks to an intensity track that reasonably approximates the reporter protein concentration dynamics in single cells.</p>
<p>Second, in order to estimate the cellular Shh response/Gli activity dynamics (reflected by the transcription dynamics at the <italic>ptch2:kaede</italic> reporter), we investigated the relationship between fluorescent intensity (<bold><italic>I</italic></bold>) and the transcription rate of <italic>kaede</italic> (<bold><italic>x</italic></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Elowitz and Leibler, 2000</xref>). Since Kaede and GFP proteins can be considered as stable on the time-scale of our experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ando et al., 2002</xref>; data not shown), assuming a constant coefficient (<bold><italic>c1</italic></bold>) for the rate of Kaede translation and maturation as a function of <italic>kaede</italic> mRNA level (<bold><italic>m</italic></bold>), the intensity change rate of Kaede (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) is given by:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="412858v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<bold><italic>m</italic></bold> is in turn a function of transcription and mRNA stability, given in the form of half-life (<bold><italic>t1/2</italic></bold>):
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="412858v2_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Combining (<xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>) and (<xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>) we have a simplified relationship between measured fluorescence intensity and Shh response (represented by <bold><italic>x</italic></bold>):
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="412858v2_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<bold><italic>c</italic></bold> is a constant. Note that the fluorescent signal is time delayed due to lags caused by transcription, translation, and maturation of the fluorescent protein, therefore our raw tracks do not show reporter responses (transcription) in real time. Importantly, use of destabilized RNA or proteins would not reduce this lag, but only diminish reporter intensity thus making their measurement noisier. Furthermore, because of the time and detection sensitivity differences between Kaede and GFP, we are prevented from cross-correlating the two reporter channels on the same time axis. Despite these limitations, <xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (3)</xref> still allows us to estimate the Shh response dynamics in each single cell and compare that between different cell fates within each dataset.</p>
<p>To validate <xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (3)</xref> and estimate reporter mRNA half-life (<bold><italic>t1/2</italic></bold>) <italic>in vivo</italic>, we first applied a heat-shock pulse on transgenic embryos with a <italic>hsp70l:EGFP</italic> transgene (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Halloran et al., 2000</xref>, constructed with an SV40 polyadenylation sequence like the <italic>ptch2:kaede</italic> transgene). This causes a defined pulse of transcriptional output at the reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Rieger et al., 2005</xref>). According to <xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (3)</xref>, the GFP intensity change that follows should reflect the exponential decay of the <italic>gfp</italic> mRNA. Indeed, single cell tracks we generated provide an excellent fit with the model’s prediction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), allowing us to estimate the mRNA half-life to be around 1.7 hours. Next, we performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization of <italic>kaede</italic> after sequential chemical inhibition of Shh response using cyclopamine (thereby stopping new <italic>kaede</italic> mRNA synthesis) and compared the overall mRNA signal with controls for signal level over a series of time points (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). This method suggests a ∼3-hour mRNA half-life. The two estimations are thus congruent on an <italic>in vivo</italic> half-life of fluorescent reporter mRNAs somewhere between 1-4 hours (effects of varying this parameter are assessed in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). These data support the validity of <xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (3)</xref> and enable us to use it and the estimated half-life to infer the dynamics of the <italic>ptch2</italic> transcription rate (i.e. Shh signaling response) in our single neural progenitor tracks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Note that as <xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (3)</xref> contains second derivative with respect to time of the intensity, this fitting is prone to measurement noise and requires good time resolution. However, due to our smoothing operation, sharp and short-time response changes have been filtered out. Our subsequent comparisons only consider those features that span over at least 0.5-hour windows (e.g., the peaks and valleys seen in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) which are comprised of at least 5 time-point measurements and describe trends that can readily be seen in the raw intensity track (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This compromise minimizes the impact of technical errors in the analysis at the expense of model resolution.</p>

<p>(B) Cell tracks of hsp70l:EGFP to validate <xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (3)</xref> and estimate mRNA stability. Assuming that the heat-shock between t=0 and t=0.5 causes a transient pulse of mRNA production, the intensity track then covers the simple decay period of mRNA (as no more mRNA is produced after the pulse). The decay is exponential according to <xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (3)</xref> and governed by the mRNA half-life. The fluorescent intensity increase rate then should correspondingly decrease exponentially towards a plateau value, predicting a linear relationship between time and <italic>- ln(1-I/Imax)</italic>, in which <bold><italic>I</italic></bold> is raw intensity and <bold><italic>Imax</italic></bold> is the plateau value of <bold><italic>I</italic></bold> in later times (when no more mRNA is left and new fluorescent protein production stops). This predicted linear relationship is found for the tracks suggesting the simple model correctly describes the process. The slope of the lines (∼0.4) suggests the mRNA half-life of <italic>hsp70l:egfp</italic> to be ∼1.7 hours. As <bold><italic>I</italic></bold> approaches <bold><italic>Imax</italic></bold>, the quantity of <italic>ln(1-I/Imax)</italic> becomes sensitive to small fluctuations in <bold><italic>I</italic></bold>, resulting in the noisy spikes seen after 6 hours.

When soaked in CyA (CyA ctrl), the embryos exhibit a low basal level of Kaede expression in the neural tube. When CyA was added around 9-somite stage and embryos followed over time, the high level of Kaede mRNA as seen in the DMSO control was not maintained but decayed towards the basal level. In the trunk/tail neural tube (but not in the head), the level became similar to basal at +7.5 hours by comparing the CyA and CyA ctrl images. This result suggests Kaede mRNA is around for more than 6 hours after inhibition of signaling, with a half-life of about 3 hours. Scale bar: 400µm.</p></caption>

<title>Systematic analysis of Shh response heterogeneity and association with fate outcome</title>
<p>The processed tracks allow us to gain deeper insights into the characteristics and sources of heterogeneity. First we performed K-means clustering of <italic>ptch2:kaede</italic> dynamics in all cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The resultant clusters are then compared in terms of their contribution to the LFP, pMN and more Dorsal fates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). We found that large clusters all show fate heterogeneity between “adjacent” fates (LFP and pMN, pMN and more Dorsal), such as Clusters 1,2,3,5 and 7. In contrast, a given cluster does not contribute both to LFP and more Dorsal, with the only exception in Cluster 11. These data show that the heterogeneity between Shh responses and fate choices is pervasive across distinct types (i.e. clusters) of response profiles, and primarily presents itself around progenitor domain boundaries. Over a larger spatial scale (such as between LFP and more Dorsal), the response-fate relationship can be considered predictive and accurate at single cell level.</p>

<p>To explore the sources of signal heterogeneity, we compared the average and variation of Shh response by fates in different datasets (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). The pMN tracks showed the most variability in all datasets while LFP and more Dorsal tracks are more similar on average and less variable. A striking feature that stands out is the similarity between pMN and LFP tracks in the posterior dataset, where the average pMN response appears as strong as the LFPs. To account for the heterogeneity in timing of response initiation, we used model-fit response levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) to identify the response initiation time and re-aligned the tracks by this time point (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). The re-aligned pMN average tracks are more similar to each other in the anterior datasets and show reduced variability, suggesting that some of the variability can be attributed to differences in timing of reporter activation. The posterior pMN tracks remain distinctly heterogeneous, suggesting a major contribution of variability is associated with the anterior-posterior level of the neural tube, which carries differences in tissue size and shape, cell movement, and morphogen source, among others.</p>

<title>Correlation of key aspects of Shh response with fate outcome</title>
<p>To further compare the correlation of some key dynamic features of morphogen response to cell fate outcome between the anterior and posterior neural tube, we used the model-fit responses to calculate the maximum transient response level (the peak Shh response within the track), the average response level (average Shh response over 10-15hpf), and the response time (the amount of time with an above-basal Shh response) in the tracked time windows. To give a visual indication of how well each metric correlates with the graded fate outcome, we ranked single cell tracks by the value of each metric high-to-low to make a vertical “French flag”: the sharper the flag, the stronger the correlation. The sharpness is quantified by the percentage of correct fate prediction by the metric thresholds. A value near 50% (coin toss) would suggest the metric does not correlate with fate choice at all, whereas 100% would suggest the metric makes perfect prediction. For example, when we use two late-stage cell position metrics, the lateral-medial/dorsal-ventral (LMDV, this distance refers to the axis along which cells are being patterned which is initially lateral-medial because patterning begins at the neural plate which then gradually transitions to dorsal-ventral as the neural tube is formed) should do well in the flag correlation while the anterior-posterior (AP) position should do poorly since we are trying to predict fates across the DV axis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref>). Indeed, we find that the LMDV position is highly correlated with cell fates. For the anterior tracks, the LMDV distance is consistently &gt;90% correlated while for the posterior tracks the LMDV distance is more poorly correlated at earlier stages but becomes better at later times consistent with a necessary role for cell sorting in sharpening fate domain boundaries over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Tsai et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast and as expected, the AP distances never correlate with fate choices in the anterior or posterior spinal cord (all around 50%). The diversity of tracks and tissue geometry both within and across the anterior and posterior regions of the spinal cord (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) enables us to search for a common metric that best correlates the Shh response dynamics with fate choice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The imaging, cell tracking, and data analysis reported in this study open a fresh perspective for looking at the important classic problem of morphogen interpretation. While it is reassuring that our data (obtained with a distinct technique) on average corroborate numerous previous studies on Shh mediated ventral neural tube patterning, the increased resolution into single cells and wide temporal coverage from when cells start responding to Shh to cell fate-specification reveal a high degree of previously unrecognized heterogeneity. This single cell variability could be due to other factors that differ between cells and their cross-talk with the Shh gene regulatory network (GRN), such as Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Huang et al., 2012</xref>), or just simply noise that arises in the GRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Rosenfeld et al., 2005</xref>). These possibilities are difficult to distinguish with the existing data, but they pose a challenge to morphogen patterning in general: how to ensure pattern precision despite this high heterogeneity in signal responses?</p>
<p>One possibility is to code morphogen response in a robust way under the given heterogeneity. Through quantifying the transcriptional dynamics at the Shh reporter, we are able to directly assess the correlation between certain proposed information-coding schemes and fate outcome. In the anterior spinal cord, maximum transient level, response time, and average level are all predictive of fates. In the more posterior spinal cord however, our results show that the temporal dimension of Shh response (which is part of the response time and the average level) no longer explains cell fate choices as well as the maximum transient level. The cause of this difference might be that there are intrinsic or environmental differences between neural progenitors in the anterior vs. posterior spinal cord, which affect their morphogen interpretation. Supporting this idea, the tissue geometry, and the range and movement of cells in zebrafish neural tube vary greatly along the body axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>; this study). We also found that the posterior LFP and pMN tracks still show very similar Shh response dynamics even after response initiation time re-alignment, distinct from the tracks from anterior datasets, suggesting an overall noisier environment in the posterior neural tube in zebrafish. This may be because posterior neural progenitors undergo more cell mixing, or because the spatially small Shh gradient as a result of the posterior neural tube’s small size introduces more positional noise in signaling. Overall, simple response-fate models are insufficient to account for all the heterogeneities observed or to make precise fate predictions.</p>
<p>While it is tempting to construct more complex models using our single cell data, certain limitations remain that warrant caution. First, our live imaging is limited by the brightness of reporters and the sensitivity of detection. Dynamics that fall below our imaging capacity, especially the Shh response activities before and in the early hours of our tracks, are not as well resolved. Second, due to the constraint of a live embryo undergoing morphogenesis, certain cells cannot be fully tracked throughout the imaging time window. Third, even though most ventral cells are specified and no longer require Shh by the end of our tracks (17-18hpf, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>), some cells may remain unspecified and their fate reporter could further change beyond our detection. These limitations could give misleading results in overly fine-grained comparisons (e.g., response level within each 1-hour window, data not shown), where a much smaller number of tracks and time points could dominate and thus bias the analysis.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the results presented here along with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>) raise an important consideration for the understanding of morphogen interpretation: given the pervasive heterogeneity of single cells in position, timing, and signaling, how is patterning precision achieved? We speculate that precision at the single cell level may not be necessary as the heterogeneity can average out on the population level, and thus important patterning features such as the size of each progenitor domain can remain robust even under single cell noise. An additional morphogen gradient such as BMP from the dorsal neural tube could provide information in parallel with Shh to improve fate choice precision as a function of position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Zagorski et al., 2017</xref>), which is inherently challenging for a single morphogen gradient to convey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Zagorski et al., 2024</xref>). After cell fate choices were made, remaining positional errors can be corrected by cellular mechanisms such as cell sorting to refine the final pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Tsai et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, additional mechanisms such as apoptosis may provide means of correction. Further testing of these ideas would require improved imaging capacities and access to multiple nodes of the GRN with more accurate live reporters (e.g., fluorescent protein knock-ins).</p>

<p>Homozygote parents from two different lines were paired to produce double transgenic embryos for imaging. Natural spawning was used and time of fertilization was recorded at the single cell stage of each clutch. Embryos were kept in 28°C incubators/chambers during imaging and other times except room temperature during injections, dechorionating and mounting. Staging was recorded using morphological criteria and aligned to the normal table (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kimmel et al, 1995</xref>). All fish are housed in fully equipped and regularly maintained and inspected aquarium facilities.</p>
<p>Fish-related protocols have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Harvard Medical School.</p>

<p>A pMTB construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>) containing <italic>mem-EBFP2</italic> or <italic>h2b-EBFP2</italic> was used for mRNA synthesis with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE system (Ambion). For mosaic injections, one blastomere of 8 to 16-cell stage embryos was injected (Nanoject) with approximately 1nl of 20ng/μl mem-EBFP2 or h2b-EBFP2. One round of screening was applied immediately after mosaic injections to eliminate damaged embryos and/or ones that missed the injection (no retention of co-injected Phenol Red label).

<title>Timelapse confocal imaging</title>
<p>Live imaging was performed using a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope (objective: C-Apochromat 40X 1.2 NA) with a home-made heating chamber maintaining 28°C. Embryos were mounted using the dorsal mount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Megason 2009</xref>) with a stereoscope (Leica MZ12.5). The mounting steps for imaging the neural plate/tube have been described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>. 405nm laser was used for photo conversion of Kaede and excitation of EBFP2 at the same time. 488nm and 561nm were then used in a separate track for the GFP and Kaede(Red) signals (See also <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). A typical stack covers an imaging space of 303μm(x), 303μm(y) and 120μm(z), divided by 700X700X80 voxels and is taken within 6 minutes. A typical movie lasts ∼10 hours containing ∼100 stacks at 6 minute intervals. Data analysis</p>

The datasets acquired in Zeiss .lsm format were first converted to Megacapture format for import into GoFigure2 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gofigure2.org">www.gofigure2.org</ext-link>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Xiong et al., 2014</xref>). Inside GoFigure2, segmentation and tracking were performed manually on each dataset on randomly selected ventral neural tube cells in the labeled embryo (e.g., <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D-E</xref>). To calculate the cell’s positions in relation to the embryo, notochord segmentations were generated every 10 time points (1 hour in real time) for each presented dataset. Segmentation and track tables exported from GoFigure2 were further processed using custom scripts (provided in accompanying supplemental data files) to generate the single slice labeled movies (Movie S2). The movies were watched individually to determine the fate choice of the cell using a combinatorial criteria including fate reporter expression and final position in the ventral neural tube, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>. First, at 16hpf, MFPs were identified as the centered, apically constricted, triangle-shaped column of cells immediately dorsal to the notochord (as illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This fate identification is checked with <italic>shh:gfp</italic> movies in which MFPs are GFP+. Next, LFPs are identified as the two columns of cells flanking both sides of the MFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). This fate identification is confirmed with <italic>nkx2.2:mgfp</italic> movies (e.g., Movie S1). Next, pMNs are identified as the cells dorsal to the floor plate cells that are strongly <italic>olig2:gfp</italic> positive. Finally, More dorsal cells are those that are further dorsal to the pMN domain and GFP-in <italic>olig2:gfp</italic> movies or that are located &gt;40% ventral dorsal distance at 16hpf in movies without <italic>olig2:gfp</italic> signal. The segmentations, tracks and cell fate information were then assembled through a preprocessing pipeline in Matlab (Mathworks).</p>

<title>Track processing</title>
<p>The output of the pipeline is a set of Matlab matrixes containing organized raw data for downstream analysis (e.g., <italic>NewFinalWrkSpace_olig2_9.mat</italic>, see supplemental data files). This organized raw data was then processed through a series of filters (provided in accompanying supplemental data files) to account for multiple experimental factors that introduce small errors in intensity measurements including bleed-through, saturation, and noise (e.g. <italic>SaturationMask.m</italic>: a first filter that removes aberrations in intensity calculation arising from saturated pixels in the image. <italic>BleedthroughCorr.m</italic>: correcting bleed-through signal between two channels. Bleed-through correction runs automatically after the algorithm assesses the degree of bleed-through and then applies a percentage subtraction on the values to further reduce errors in intensity calculation. <italic>SmoothData.m</italic>: a smoothing filter that handles short-time fluctuations that come from segmentation variations and acquisition noise. Different utility scripts were coded to allow user interactions with both the raw and filtered data, listed in <underline>AnalysisScript_List.xlsx</underline>.</p>

<title>Track alignment</title>
<p>ptch2:kaede reporter tracks were aligned at the point at which the corresponding promoter activity traces crossed an activation threshold value and maintained it for three timepoints (18 min). The activation threshold was determined by comparing promoter activity values from more dorsally-fated cells, in which the reporter is generally inactive, and those from LFP- and pMN-fated cells, in which the reporter is activated. A threshold value of 0.025 could distinguish the two sets of traces, with only ∼60% of more dorsally-fated cells crossing the threshold at any point within the observation period compared to 100% of LFP- and pMN-fated cells.</p>

<title>Track clustering analysis</title>
<p>ptch2:kaede reporter traces were clustered using the k-means clustering function in MATLAB. Each track was truncated to the set of timepoints for which &gt;80% of reporter traces had observations. After truncation, tracks were only included in the analysis if they had observations for &gt;80% of remaining timepoints. After filtering, 182 out of 216 traces were included in the clustering analysis. The elbow method was used to determine an appropriate number of clusters. The number of clusters was varied from 5 to 25, and for each value, the total Within Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) value was calculated. For each cluster the WCSS value corresponds to the sum of square distances for each point in the cluster from the centroid of the cluster. The total WCSS value decreases with an increasing number of clusters (because individual clusters become tighter) and begins to plateau at approximately 15 clusters. This value was therefore used for the analysis.</p>

<p>Throughout the paper, the authors do a fantastic job of highlighting caveats in their approach, from image acquisition to analysis. Despite this, some conclusions and viewpoints portrayed in this study do not appear well-supported by the provided data. Furthermore, there are a few technical points regarding the analysis that should be addressed.</p>
<p>(1) Analysis of signaling traces</p>
<p>- Relevance of &quot;modeled signaling level&quot;: It is not clear whether this added complexity and potential for error (below) provides benefits over a more simple analysis such as taking the derivative (shown in Figure 3C). Could the authors provide evidence for the benefits? For example, does the &quot;maximal response&quot; given a simpler metric correlate less well with cell fate than that calculated from the fitted response?</p>
<p>- Assumptions for &quot;modeled signaling level&quot;: According to equation (1) Kaede levels are monotonically increasing. This is assumed given the stability of the fluorescent protein. However, this only holds for the &quot;totally produced Kaede/fluorescence&quot;. Other metrics such as mean fluorescence can very well decrease over time due to growth and division. Does &quot;intensity&quot; mean total fluorescence? Visual inspection of the traces shown in Figure 2 suggests that &quot;fluorescence intensity&quot; can decrease. What does this mean for the inferred traces?</p>
<p>- Estimation of Kaede reporter half-live: It is not clear how the mRNA stability of Kaede is estimated. It sounds like it was just assessed visually, which seems not entirely appropriate given the quantitative aspects of the rest of the study. Also, given that Shh signaling was inhibited on the level of Smoothened, it is not obvious how the dynamics of signaling shutdown affect the estimate. Most results in Figure 7 seem to be quite robust to the estimate of the half-live. That they are, might suggest that the whole analysis is unnecessary in the first place. However, not all are. Thus, it would be important to make this estimate more quantitative.</p>
<p>(2) Assignment of fates and correlations</p>
<p>- Error estimate for cell-type assignment: Trying to correlate signaling traces to cell fate decisions requires accurate cell fate assignment post-tracking. The provided protocol suggests a rather manual, expert-directed process of making those decisions. Can the authors provide any error-bound on those decisions, for example comparing the results obtained by two experts or something comparable? I am particularly concerned about the results regarding the higher degree of variability in the correlation between signaling dynamics and cell fate in the posterior neural tube. Here, the expression of Olig2 does not seem to segregate between different assigned fates, while it does so nicely in the anterior neural tube. This would suggest to me that cells in the posterior neural tube might not yet be fully committed to a fate or that there could be a relatively high error rate in assigning fates. Thus, the results could emerge from technical errors or differences in pure timing. Could the authors please comment on these possibilities?</p>
<p>- Clustering and fates: One approach the authors use to analyze the correlation between signaling and fate is clustering of cell traces and comparison of the fate distributions in those clusters. There is a large number of clusters with only single traces, suggesting that the data (number of traces) might not be sufficient for this analysis. Furthermore, I am skeptical about clustering cells of different anterior-posterior identities together, given potential differences in the timing of signal reception and signaling. I am not convinced that this analysis reveals enough about how signaling maps to fate given the heterogeneity in traces in large clusters and the prevalence of extremely small clusters.</p>
<p>- Signaling vector and hand-picked metrics: As an alternative approach, that might be better suited for their data, the authors then pick three metrics (based on their model-predicted signaling dynamics) and show that the maximal response is a very good predictor of fate for different anterior-posterior identities. Previous information-theoretic analysis of signaling dynamics has found that a whole time-vector of signaling can carry much more information than individual metrics (Selimkhanov et al, 2014, PMID: 25504722). Have the authors tried to use approaches that make use of the whole trace (such as simple classifiers (Granados et al, 2018, PMID: 29784812), or can comment on why this is not feasible for their data? The authors should at least make clear that their results present a lower bound to how accurately cells can make cell-fate decisions based on signaling dynamics.</p>
<p>(3) Consequences of signaling heterogeneity</p>
<p>The authors focus heavily on portraying that signaling dynamics are highly variable, which seems visually true at first glance. However, there is no metric used or a description given of what this actually means. Mainly, the variability seems to relate to the correlation between signaling and fate. However, given the data and analysis, I would argue that the decoding of signaling dynamics into fate is surprisingly accurate. So signaling dynamics that seem quite noisy and variable by visual inspection can actually be very well discriminated by cells, which to me appears very exciting.</p>
<p>Indeed, simple features of signaling traces can predict cell fate as well as position (for anterior progenitors). Given that signaling should be a function of position, it naively seems as if signaling read-out could be almost perfect. It might be interesting to plot dorsal-ventral position vs the signaling metrics, to also investigate how Shh concentration/position maps to signaling dynamics, this would give an even more comprehensive view of signal transmission.</p>
<p>There remains the discrepancy between signaling traces and fate in the posterior neural tube. The authors point towards differences in tissue architecture and difficulties in interpreting a &quot;small&quot; Shh gradient. However, the data seems consistent with differences in timing of cell-fate decisions between anterior and posterior cells. The authors show that fate does initially not correlate well with position in the posterior neural tube. So, signaling dynamics should likely also not, as they should rather be a function of position, given they are downstream of the Shh gradient. As mentioned above, not even Olig2 expression does segregate the assigned fates well. All this points towards a difference in the time of fate assignment between the anterior and posterior. Given likely delays in reporter protein production and maturation, it can thus not be expected that signaling dynamics correlate better with cell fate than the reporter &quot;83%&quot;. Can the authors please discuss this possibility in the paper?</p>
<p>Thus, while this paper represents an example of what the community needs to do to gain a better understanding of robust patterning under variability, the provided data is not always sufficient to make clear conclusions regarding the functional consequences of signaling dynamics.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, Xiong and colleagues examine the relationship between the profile of the morphogen Shh and the resulting cell fate decisions in the zebrafish neural tube. For this, the authors combine high-resolution live imaging of an established Shh reporter with reporter lines for the different progenitor types arising in the forming neural tube. One of the key observations in this manuscript is that, while, on average, cells respond to differences in Shh activity to adopt distinct progenitor fates, at the single cell level there is strong heterogeneity between Shh response and fate choices. Further, the authors showed that this heterogeneity was particularly prominent for the pMN fate, with similar Shh response dynamics to those observed in neighboring LFP progenitors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>It is important to directly correlate Shh activity with the downstream TFs marking distinct progenitor types in vivo and with single cell resolution. This additional analysis is in line with previous observations from these authors, namely in Xiong, 2013. Further, the authors show that cells in different anterior-posterior positions within the neural tube show distinct levels of heterogeneity in their response to Shh, which is a very interesting observation and merits further investigation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This is a convincing work, however, adding a few more analyses and clarifications would, in my view, strengthen the key finding of heterogeneity between Shh response and the resulting cell fate choices.</p>
