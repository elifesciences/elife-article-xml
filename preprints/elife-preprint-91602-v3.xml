<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Schuster <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that bloodstream slender forms of African trypanosomes are readily transmissible to young tsetse flies where they can complete their complex life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In their experimental conditions, a single slender parasite was sufficient for productive infection. Here, we compared the infectivity of slender and stumpy bloodstream forms in adult flies with a mature immune system, and without using any chemical compounds that would alter the insect immune response and/or promote the infection. After ingestion of slender forms, infected flies were observed only in one out of 24 batches of non-immunocompetent teneral flies and with a high number of parasites. In contrast, infected flies were detected in 75% (18/24) of the batches infected with stumpy parasites, and as few as 10 stumpy parasites produced mature infections in immune adult flies. We discuss that, although Schuster <italic>et al</italic>. have demonstrated the intrinsic capacity of slender form trypanosomes to infect young and naive tsetse flies, highlighting the remarkable plasticity and adaptability of these protists, this phenomenon is unlikely to significantly contribute to the epidemiology of African trypanosomiases. According to both experimental and field observations, stumpy forms appear to be the most adapted forms for African trypanosome transmission from the mammalian host to the tsetse fly vector in natural conditions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protist parasites of the <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> group cause Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness in humans, and nagana in cattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). They are transmitted by the blood feeding tsetse fly following a long (at least 3 weeks) and complex (at least 9 distinct stages) cyclical development (review in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>)). In the mammalian host’s blood circulation, proliferating slender trypanosomes differentiate into cell cycle-arrested stumpy cells upon quorum sensing when they reach high parasite densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). This differentiation is thought not only to regulate the parasite load in the reservoir host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), but also to provide transmissible parasites adapted to pursue the life cycle in the vector host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Indeed, stumpy forms express several transcripts and proteins necessary to the next developmental stage in the insect, the procyclic form, including the Protein Associated to Differentiation 1 or PAD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). For decades, arrest of the cell cycle and differentiation to the stumpy stage were presumed essential for the developmental progression of bloodstream trypanosomes to the insect stages.</p>
<p>Recently, Schuster <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that slender trypanosomes can also present some intrinsic characteristic of transmissible forms (PAD1 mRNAs and proteins) and are readily transmissible to both young male and female tsetse flies, where they can complete their complex life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), yet with a lower efficiency than stumpy forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). In their experimental conditions, a single slender parasite was sufficient for productive infection. These laboratory conditions are however significantly different from what is encountered in the field. First, only young teneral flies (1-3 days post- eclosion) with an immature immune system were used. Second, in some experiments, chemical compounds altering the insect immune response (glutathione) and/or promoting the infection (N-acetyl-glucosamine) were added to the infective meal. To assess the importance of these parameters, we challenged the infectivity of slender bloodstream forms in adult tsetse flies, i.e. in conditions closer to the natural situation.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Strains, culture and <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation</title>
<p>The AnTat 1.1E Paris pleomorphic strain of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei brucei</italic> was derived from a strain originally isolated from a bushbuck in Uganda in 1966 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Bloodstream form trypanosomes were cultivated in HMI-9 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Proliferative slender cells were maintained at densities lower than 5.10<sup>5</sup> parasites/ml to prevent their natural quorum-sensing-dependent differentiation into stumpy forms. For <italic>in vitro</italic> slender to stumpy BSF differentiation, we used 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-5′-AMP, a nucleotide analogue of 5’-AMP (BIOLOG Life Science Institute, Germany). Briefly, 2×10<sup>6</sup> pleomorphic AnTat 1.1E slender forms were incubated with 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-5′-AMP (5 μM) for 48 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Freshly differentiated stumpy forms and slender cells were then centrifuged at 1,400 × g for 10 minutes and resuspended at the appropriate densities in SDM-79 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were resuspended at either 10<sup>3</sup>, 10<sup>4</sup> or 10<sup>5</sup> parasites / ml. Assuming individual bloodmeal volumes ranging between 10-100 μl, this would correspond to ingestions of 10-100, 100-1,000 or 1,000-10,000 parasites per condition.</p>

<title>Tsetse fly maintenance, infection and dissection</title>
<p><italic>Glossina morsitans morsitans</italic> tsetse flies were maintained in Roubaud cages at 27°C and 70% hygrometry and fed through a silicone membrane with fresh mechanically defibrinated sheep blood (BCL, France). Adult (between 2 and 3 weeks after emergence) or teneral males (between 24h and 72h post-emergence) were allowed to ingest parasites through a silicone membrane. No chemical supplement was used in the first set of experiments. For assessing the effect of immunomodulatory compounds in the second set of experiments, 60mM <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine were added to the infective meal. A total of 3 to 5 independent biological replicates per condition were performed with batches of 50 flies per condition.</p>
<p>Flies were starved for at least 24 hours before being dissected blindly 28 to 31 days post-ingestion for isolation of all stages from the midgut and salivary glands. For recovery of all tsetse organs, after rapid isolation of the salivary glands in a first drop of phosphate buffer saline (PBS), whole tsetse alimentary tracts, from the distal part of the foregut to the Malpighian tubules, were dissected and arranged lengthways in another drop of PBS as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Isolated organs were then scrutinized under a microscope at 40x magnification by two independent readers and infection rates per organ were scored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Immuno-fluorescence analysis (IFA)</title>
<p>Cultured parasites were washed in TDB and spread onto poly-L-lysine coated slides. For flash methanol fixation, slides were air-dried for 10 min, fixed in methanol at −20°C for 5 seconds and rehydrated for 20 min in PBS. For immunodetection of stumpy forms, slides were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with a rabbit polyclonal anti-PAD1 antibody (kindly provided by Keith Matthews, University of Edinburgh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) diluted at 1:300 in PBS containing 0.1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA). After 3 consecutive 5 min washes in PBS, a species and subclass-specific secondary antibody coupled to the Alexa 488 fluorochrome (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted at 1:1000 in PBS containing 0.1% BSA was applied for 1 h at 37°C. After washing in PBS, slides were finally stained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1 µg/ml) for visualization of kinetoplast and nuclear DNA content and mounted under coverslips with ProLong antifade reagent (Invitrogen), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Slides were observed under an epifluorescence DMI4000 microscope (Leica) with a 100x oil objective (NA 1.4) to assess the proportion of PAD1-positive cells in the infective meals (n &gt; 100 cells / condition).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Infections rates were compared by a two-sided ANOVA at 95% confidence with Prism V10.0.3 (GraphPad). MG infection rate comparisons were statistically significant between teneral and adult flies infected with ST in each amount (p&lt;0.02 with 10 parasites; p&lt;0.0001 with 100 and 1,000 parasites) and with 1,000 SL (p&lt;0.0001). MG infection rate comparisons were statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001) between parasite stages (SL and ST) in each amount (10, 100 and 1,000) and for each fly group (teneral and adult), excepted in teneral flies infected with 1,000 parasites (p=0.2356).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Pleomorphic <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> bloodstream forms were either maintained in culture at a density lower than 5.10<sup>5</sup> parasites / ml to prevent quorum-sensing-induced differentiation and obtain only slender forms or induced for differentiation with a 5’- AMP nucleotide analogue to obtain mostly stumpy forms. The expression of PAD1 at the cell surface was assessed by immunofluorescence analysis prior to each experimental infection: no PAD1 expression was detected in the slender group, whereas an average of 63% (52% to 71%, n = 12 replicates) of the induced cells were expressing PAD1. Batches of 50 teneral (&lt; 72h) or adult (2-3 weeks) male tsetse flies were fed in parallel with either slender or stumpy forms at densities corresponding to individual ingestion of about 10, 100 or 1,000 parasites per bloodmeal. In total, 1,384 flies from 12 distinct experimental infections were dissected about 4 weeks (28 to 31 days) after parasite ingestion. Infection rates in midguts and salivary glands were quantified and plotted for each condition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and Table S1).</p>

</fig>
<p>After ingestion of slender forms, infected flies were observed in only 1 batch out of 24. This occurred in not yet fully immunocompetent teneral flies and with the highest number of ingested parasites (1,000 to 10,000 parasites). In contrast, midgut and salivary glands infected flies were observed in 75% (18/24) and 62.5% (15/24) of the batches infected with stumpy parasites, respectively. As few as 10 stumpy parasites produced mature infections in immunocompetent adult flies and the infection rates were similar whatever the amounts of stumpy forms ingested. In more susceptible non- immune teneral flies, the infection rates were increasing with the number of stumpy forms ingested.</p>
<p>Differences between the strain clones, the cell culture conditions and/or the fly colony maintenance conditions could explain part of the differences in infection rates observed here as compared to the Schuster <italic>et al</italic>. study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Nevertheless, the use of the lectin- inhibitory sugar N-acetyl-glucosamine to enhance infection rates in the latter study could be a more likely explanation. To assess this hypothesis, an additional experimental challenge was performed to compare infection rates in teneral versus adult flies, with or without N-acetyl-glucosamine supplement in an infective meal containing 10<sup>5</sup> slender parasites / ml (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Whereas no infection was detected in adult flies, the N-acetyl-glucosamine supplementation of the infective meal led to an increase of the infection rates from 2,4% to 13,3% in teneral flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings of Schuster <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) have opened a debate on the traditional view of the trypanosome life cycle where slender trypanosomes are considered as non-competent for cyclical development in the insect vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). The authors proposed that their observations could provide a solution to a long-lasting paradox, namely the successful transmission of parasites in chronic infections, despite low parasitemia. Nonetheless, Schuster <italic>et al</italic>. performed all their experimental infections in laboratory conditions that were optimized for maximum transmission efficiency, with the use of teneral flies, and for some experiments, the addition of <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine or glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>).</p>
<p>Teneral flies are young flies that remain unfed for up to 3-5 days after emergence from their puparium. They are known to be significantly more susceptible to trypanosome infection as multiple studies demonstrated they are immunologically immature (weak immune system and, leaky peritrophic matrix) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). According to capture-recapture studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), teneral flies however represent a minority of individuals in wild tsetse populations. Hence, knowing that adults can live up to 9 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), the impact of teneral flies on trypanosome transmission may be limited, if not incidental.</p>
<p>In addition, Schuster <italic>et al</italic>. supplemented most infective meals with 60 mM <italic>N</italic>- acetylglucosamine, an inhibitor of tsetse midgut lectins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) that was also confirmed to enhance trypanosome infectivity in teneral flies in the present study. For infections with monomorphic parasites, the addition of 12.5 mM glutathione, an antioxidant that reduces the midgut environment, protected trypanosomes from cell death induced by reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). In total, these two chemical compounds used in Schuster <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) have inhibited the immune response in teneral flies and substantially enhanced the chances for slender trypanosomes to develop in the insect vector.</p>
<p>Conditions are far less favourable in the field; hence we investigated and compared the infection potential of slender and stumpy forms in adult and teneral flies without the addition of chemicals. We observed that slender forms were not infective to adult tsetse flies and only at densities higher than 10<sup>5</sup> parasites / ml. Nevertheless, in endemic areas, especially in Western Africa, parasitemia in confirmed cases are usually very low (&lt; 10<sup>4</sup> parasites / ml in Guinea for instance) and it is necessary to concentrate parasites in blood prior to microscopic examination to increase sensitivity of parasitological diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Hence, the possible transmission of a few slender trypanosomes from the blood of individuals with a chronic infection is unlikely to explain the maintenance of the parasite circulation in tsetse populations.</p>
<p>By contrast, we observed that as few as 10 stumpy parasites are enough to produce mature infections in both teneral and adult flies, already with a significant efficiency. In patients with low parasitemia, the quorum-sensing-triggered differentiation of slender to stumpy forms could be compatible with, or even more adapted to, extravascular forms present in some tissues and organs, with a limited dilution of the parasites and parasite factors remaining concentrated locally. Indeed, extravascular PAD1-positive trypanosomes were detected in high numbers at least in adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) and in the dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) of experimentally infected mice. The presence of PAD1-positive extravascular trypanosomes was also assessed in the skin of confirmed gambiense HAT cases and unconfirmed seropositive individuals in endemic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) (and unpublished data). This suggests that stumpy trypanosomes accessible to tsetse flies are likely more abundant than previously estimated in individuals with low parasitemia.</p>
<p>Schuster <italic>et al</italic>. have demonstrated the intrinsic capacity of slender form trypanosomes to infect young and naive tsetse flies, highlighting the remarkable plasticity and adaptability of these protists. The fine understanding of the underlying cellular mechanisms and / or transient adaptations involved in this process remains an exciting challenge. This event is however unlikely to contribute to the epidemiology of African trypanosomiases in natural settings. According to both experimental and field observations, stumpy forms appear to be the most adapted forms for African trypanosome transmission from the mammalian host to the tsetse fly vector in natural conditions.</p>

<p>African (or Salivarian) trypanosomes are significant pathogens of humans and domestic animals. For many decades is was accepted that only the &quot;stumpy&quot; non-proliferative form was capable of infecting the Tsetse-fly vector, but recent work challenged this, suggesting that the proliferative &quot;slender&quot; form is also infective. The current paper provides <bold>important</bold> and <bold>convincing</bold> laboratory evidence that the original concept is probably correct for most infections: the slender form was not infective for adult Tsetse, and was only able to infect young, less immunocompetent flies if N-acetyl glucosamine was added to the feed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In contrast to the recent findings reported by Schuster S et al., this brief paper presents evidence suggesting that the stumpy form of T. brucei is likely the most pre-adapted form to progress through the life cycle of this parasite in the tsetse vector.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>One significant experimental point is that all fly infection experiments are conducted in the absence of &quot;boosting&quot; metabolites like GlcNAc or S-glutathione. As a result, flies infected with slender trypanosomes present very low or nonexistent infection rates. This provides important experimental evidence that the findings of Schuster S and colleagues may need to be revisited.</p>
<p>In the revised submission the authors also compared trypanosome midgut infection levels in tsetse flies when either young (teneral) or mature adult flies received infected bloodmeals, with or without 60 mM GlcNAc. The data clearly show that, unlike in teneral flies, the addition of GlcNAc to the trypanosome-infected bloodmeal does not enhance midgut infection in mature adult flies. This is now convincingly demonstrated in Figure 2 and provides strong experimental support for the suggestion that the effect reported by Schuster S. et al. may have been influenced by both fly age and the inclusion of metabolic &quot;boosters&quot; in the bloodmeal.</p>

<p>The dogma in the Trypanosome field is that transmission by Tsetse flies is ensured by stumpy forms. This has been recently challenged by the Engstler lab (Schuster et al. ), who showed that slender forms can also be transmitted by teneral flies. In this work, the authors aimed to test whether transmission by slender forms is possible and frequent. The authors observed that most stumpy forms infections with teneral and adult flies were successful while only 1 out of 24 slender form infections were successful.</p>
<p>The comparison of midgut infection in adult vs teneral flies was significant in most of the conditions. However, the critical comparison is still missing: within each type of fly (adult or teneral), was the MG infection significantly different between slender and stumpy forms?</p>
<p>Figure 2 convincingly demonstrates the effect of the metabolite N-acetylglucosamine on Tsetse infection. This addition helps better integrate the study with previous work. I thank the authors for their effort in performing this experiment.</p>
<p>It is still remains unknown why this work and Schuster et al. reached different conclusions. As a result it remains unclear in which conditions slender forms could be important for transmission. Several variables could explain differences between the two groups: the strain used, the presence or absence of glutathione, how Tsetse colonies were maintained, thorough molecular and cellular characterisation of slender and stumpy forms (to avoid using intermediate forms as slender forms), comparison to recent field parasite strains.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>

<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>For decades it has been accepted that only the growth-arrested &quot;stumpy&quot; form of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> can infect the arthropod vector, the Tsetse fly, but this was recently challenged by a demonstration that - under artificial conditions that are known to enhance infectivity - the proliferative &quot;slender&quot; form can also establish Tsetse infections. The infectiousness of the two forms is a fundamental question in trypanosome biology and epidemiology, concerning both infection dynamics and parasite differentiation. The authors of the current study provide compelling evidence that without artificial enhancement, the &quot;stumpy&quot; form is indeed much more infective for Tsetse than the slender form; they suggest that this is probably also true in the wild.</p>
<p>Since the authors of this paper did not themselves test the effect of enhancing conditions, the precise reason for the discrepancy in results between the two laboratories has not been demonstrated conclusively.</p>

<p>This specific comment was addressed in the revision and illustrated with new data.</p>
<p>Differences between the strain clones, the cell culture conditions and/or the fly colony maintenance conditions could explain part of the differences in infection rates observed here as compared to the Schuster et al. study (1). However, the use of the lectin-inhibitory sugar N-acetyl-glucosamine to enhance infection rates in the latter study could be a more likely explanation. To assess this hypothesis, an additional experimental challenge was performed to compare infection rates in teneral versus adult flies, with or without N-acetyl-glucosamine supplement in an infective meal containing 10<sup>5</sup> slender parasites / ml (Figure 2). Whereas no infection was detected in adult flies, the N-acetyl-glucosamine supplementation of the infective meal led to an increase of the infection rates from 2,4% to 13,3% in teneral flies (Figure 2).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Ngoune et al. present compelling evidence that Slender cells are challenged to infect tsetse flies. They explore the experimental context of a recent important paper in the field, Schuster et al., that presents evidence suggesting the proliferative Slender bloodstream T.brucei can infect juvenile tsetse flies. Schuster et al. was disruptive to the widely accepted paradigm that the Stumpy bloodstream form is solely responsible for tsetse infection and T.brucei transmission potential. Evidence presented here shows that in all cases, Stumpy form parasites are exponentially more capable of infecting tsetse flies. They further show that Slender cells do not infect mature flies.</p>
<p>However, they raise questions of immature tsetse immunological potential and field transmission potential that their experiments do not address. Specifically, they do not show that teneral tsetse flies are immunocompromised, that tsetse flies must be immunocompromised for Slender infection nor that younger teneral tsetse infection is not pertinent to field transmission.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All these specific comments were addressed in the revision and illustrated with new data and references.</p>
<p>- The limited immunocompetence of teneral flies has been extensively studied by the labs of S. Aksoy at Yale and M. Lehane at Liverpool. In the discussion, we provide key references from these two labs 19-22.</p>
<p>- Differences between the strain clones, the cell culture conditions and/or the fly colony maintenance conditions could explain part of the differences in infection rates observed here as compared to the Schuster et al. study (1). However, the use of the lectin-inhibitory sugar N-acetyl-glucosamine to enhance infection rates in the latter study could be a more likely explanation.

Whereas no infection was detected in adult flies, the N-acetyl-glucosamine supplementation of the infective meal led to an increase of the infection rates from 2,4% to 13,3% in teneral flies (Figure 2).</p>
<p>- Our comment on the relevance to field transmission is simply based on field observations of the fly biology. For example, according to the capture-recapture experiments described in HARGROVE JW insect sci applic 1990 (new ref 23), wild female mortality was reported 6.8% shortly after emergence, &lt;1% for ages 20-50 days and rose to 5% by 130 day (a pattern similar to that for laboratory reared tsetse), while wild male daily mortality was 8.3% after emergence, fell to 5.5% by 9 days, then rose continuously to more than 10% by 30 days. This means that adult flies represent the majority of individuals in a wild tsetse population. Hence, knowing that both males and females are strictly hematophagous and that they can live up to nine months, the impact of teneral flies (up to 4 days after emergence) on trypanosome transmission appears limited, if not incidental.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Experimental Design is precise and elegant, outcomes are convincing. Discussion is compelling and important to the field. This is a timely piece that adds important data to a critical discussion of host:parasite interactions, of relevance to all parasite transmission.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As above, the authors dispute the biological relevance of teneral tsetse infection in the wild, without offering evidence to the contrary. Statements need to be softened for claims regarding immunological competence or relevance to field transmission.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In contrast to the recent findings reported by Schuster S et al., this brief paper presents evidence suggesting that the stumpy form of T. brucei is likely the most pre-adapted form to progress through the life cycle of this parasite in the tsetse vector.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>One significant experimental point is that all fly infection experiments are conducted in the absence of &quot;boosting&quot; metabolites like GlcNAc or S-glutathione. As a result, flies infected with slender trypanosomes present very low or nonexistent infection rates. This provides important experimental evidence that the findings of Schuster S and colleagues may need to be revisited.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, I believe the authors should have included their own set of experiments demonstrating that the presence of these metabolites in the infectious bloodmeal enhances infection rates in flies receiving blood meals containing slender trypanosomes. Considering the well-known physiological variabilities among flies from different facilities, including infection rates, this would have strengthened the experimental evidence presented by the authors.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>An ANOVA statistical analysis was performed and a dedicated section added to the revised version. MG infection rate comparisons were statistically significant between teneral and adult flies infected with ST in each amount (p&lt;0.02 with 10 parasites; p&lt;0.0001 with 100 and 1,000 parasites) and with 1,000 SL (p&lt;0.0001). MG infection rate comparisons were statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001) between parasite stages (SL and ST) in each amount (10, 100 and 1,000) and for each fly group (teneral and adult), excepted in teneral flies infected with 1,000 parasites (p=0.2356).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript is improved, but the author has not addressed much of the constructive criticism offered that would benefit the manuscript.</p>
<p>To clarify, evidence from Schuster et al did not demonstrate, rather it suggested. That is a major point of this paper - that the previous evidence presented had caveats. Terms such as demonstrate or prove are inappropriate in most biological contexts, unless evidence is without caveat.</p>

<p>Statements regarding teneral flies in the field are softened. Yet the referenced papers pertain more to commensurate coinfections rather than reduced immunocapacity of immature teneral flies in the field. This should be clarified.</p>
