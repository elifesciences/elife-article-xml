<abstract><p>Animals respond to tactile stimulations of the body with location-appropriate behavior, such as aimed grooming. These responses are mediated by mechanosensory neurons distributed across the body, whose axons project into somatotopically organized brain regions corresponding to body location. How mechanosensory neurons interface with brain circuits to transform mechanical stimulations into location-appropriate behavior is unclear. We previously described the somatotopic organization of bristle mechanosensory neurons (BMNs) around the <italic>Drosophila</italic> head that elicit a sequence of location-aimed grooming movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>). Here, we use a serial section electron microscopy reconstruction of a full adult fly brain to identify nearly all of BMN pre-and postsynaptic partners, uncovering circuit pathways that control head grooming. Postsynaptic partners dominate the connectome, and are both excitatory and inhibitory. We identified an excitatory hemilineage of cholinergic interneurons (hemilineage 23b) that elicit aimed head grooming and exhibit varied connectivity to BMNs from different head locations, revealing lineage-based development of a somatotopic parallel circuit architecture. Presynaptic partners provide extensive BMN presynaptic inhibition, consistent with models of sensory gain control as a mechanism of suppressing grooming movements and controlling the sequence. This work provides the first comprehensive map of a somatotopically organized connectome, and reveals how this organization could shape grooming. It also reveals the mechanosensory interface with the brain, illuminating fundamental features of mechanosensory processing, including feedforward excitation and inhibition, feedback inhibition, somatotopic circuit organization, and developmental origins.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The motivation for this work came from our studies of the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie complex sequential behavior. The capacity to perform complex behaviors by assembling different movements in sequence is crucial for adaptive behavior and ensuring survival. A prominent conceptual framework known as the“parallel model” elucidates the neural mechanisms underlying movement sequence generation. This model posits that premotor elements corresponding to individual movements scheduled for sequential execution are simultaneously activated, followed by a sequential selection process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bohland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bullock, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Houghton and Hartley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lashley, 1951</xref>). Central to the model is a parallel circuit architecture, wherein all alternative movements intended for sequential selection are activated simultaneously and compete for output. Performance order is established through suppression, wherein earlier movements inhibit later ones within the circuit architecture. Empirical support for this model is derived from physiological and behavioral evidence spanning diverse animal species, lending credence to its universality and applicability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Averbeck et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mushiake et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, a comprehensive elucidation of the underlying neural circuits remains an ongoing pursuit.</p>
<p>Investigations into the grooming behavior of fruit flies (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) offer insights into the circuit mechanisms underlying movement sequences. Coating flies with dust elicits a cleaning sequence that commences with the grooming of various head locations such as the eyes, proboscis, and antennae, before progressing to body locations including the abdomen, wings, and thorax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mueller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Phillis et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). This sequence is orchestrated by a mechanism consistent with a parallel model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). Essentially, different mutually exclusive grooming movements, aimed at specific head or body locations, are simultaneously activated by the presence of dust. The ensuing competition among these movements is resolved through hierarchical suppression. For instance, grooming of the eyes takes precedence, since it suppresses grooming elsewhere on the head and body. This parallel model of hierarchical suppression provides a conceptual framework for elucidating the neural circuitry governing <italic>Drosophila</italic> grooming (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Proposed grooming circuit architecture suggests parallel mechanosensory pathways that are somatotopically organized.</title>
<p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) This architecture facilitates aimed grooming of specific head and body locations (<bold>A</bold>) and controls hierarchical suppression during sequential grooming (<bold>B</bold>). (<bold>A</bold>) When a mechanical stimulus like dust touches a specific area (e.g., antennae), local mechanosensory neurons detect it. These neurons connect to excitatory postsynaptic circuits that elicit aimed grooming of those locations. This study emphasizes the connectome of bristle mechanosensory neurons (BMNs) responsible for grooming different head locations, such as the eyes (red), proboscis (orange), and antennae (aqua). The grooming pathway for body locations (gray) extends this parallel structure to any body part, like the abdomen or wings. (<bold>B</bold>) Dust covering multiple areas simultaneously causes competition among pathways that elicit exclusive grooming actions that are prioritized through hierarchical suppression (unidirectional connections between circuits shown). For clarity, only the nearest-neighbor connections are depicted. In this hypothesized structure, each circuit inhibits all lower-ranking circuits in the hierarchy. For instance, eye grooming occurs first as it inhibits all subsequent actions, like grooming the proboscis, antennae, and body areas. An alternative to the depicted unilateral inhibition is a sensory gain-mediated suppression mechanism (e.g. mechanosensory presynaptic inhibition). (<bold>C</bold>) Mechanosensory neurons from various head locations project to distinct somatotopically organized zones in the ventral brain. Mechanosensory neurons at different head locations elicit aimed grooming, such as the antennae (JONs (Johnston’s organ neurons) and BMNs), eyes (BMNs), and proboscis (BMNs). The projections of mechanosensory neurons in the brain connect with postsynaptic circuits (indicated by boxes) that elicit grooming via descending pathways that activate movement pattern generators in the ventral nerve cord.

<p>Previous studies focused on the first layer of the grooming circuit architecture: mechanosensory neurons. Mechanosensory structures are dispersed across the surface of the head and body that respond to mechanical stimuli and elicit grooming. Among these structures, bristles are the most prevalent. Displacement of single bristles elicits grooming, during which the legs are aimed towards the stimulated area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Corfas and Dudai, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Page and Matheson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Vandervorst and Ghysen, 1980</xref>). A single bristle mechanosensory neuron (BMN) innervates each bristle, becoming activated in response to the displacement of the corresponding bristle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Corfas and Dudai, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tuthill and Wilson, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Walker et al., 2000</xref>). As a result, specific aimed movements can be associated with bristles and their corresponding BMNs. Other mechanosensory structures, such as stretch receptors and chordotonal organs, also elicit grooming responses aimed at the location of the stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Optogenetic activation of mechanosensory neurons simultaneously across the body elicits sequential grooming that mirrors the order of the natural sequence induced by dust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hampel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, parallel mechanosensory pathways induce this sequence, each eliciting a movement to groom a specific location on the head or body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p>
<p>The parallel model predicts different circuit features underlying the grooming sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). One is a somatotopic mechanosensory circuit architecture that elicits aimed grooming of specific locations. Indeed, the BMN axon projections in the central nervous system (CNS) show a somatotopic arrangement, where distinct projection zones correspond to specific head and body locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Johnson and Murphey, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Murphey et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Newland, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Newland et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Tsubouchi et al., 2017</xref>). These parallel-projecting mechanosensory neurons are hypothesized to connect with circuits that elicit grooming of those locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). In support of this, mechanosensory-connected neural circuitry has been identified that elicits aimed grooming of specific head and body locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hampel et al., 2020b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yoshikawa et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zhang and Simpson, 2022</xref>). The model also features a hierarchical suppression mechanism among all mutually exclusive movements to be performed in the sequence, where earlier movements inhibit later ones. Activity gradients among the parallel circuits determine movement order, possibly regulated by presynaptic sensory gain control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>We focus on mechanosensory pathways that elicit grooming of different locations on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> head. Dust-induced head grooming is performed by the forelegs that start with the eyes and progress to other locations such as the proboscis and antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). The primary mechanosensory structures on the head that could detect the dust are populations of bristles on the eyes, antennae, proboscis, and other head locations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1D-G</xref>). Each population is innervated by specific BMN types that elicit aimed grooming of their corresponding bristle locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hampel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). We previously identified and reconstructed nearly all BMNs from around the head in a serial section electron microscopy (EM) volume of a full adult fly brain (FAFB) and mapped their distinct projections into the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>). The BMNs project in a somatotopic arrangement, wherein types innervating neighboring bristles project to overlapping zones, while those innervating distant bristles project to distinct zones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1 – figure supplement 2A-E</xref>). Connectomic analysis revealed that neighboring BMNs show higher postsynaptic connectivity similarity than distant BMNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>), consistent with the hypothesized parallel postsynaptic circuit architecture underlying grooming.</p>
<p>Here, we define the synaptic connectivity of the head BMNs by mapping nearly all their pre-and postsynaptic partners that include other BMNs, ascending and descending neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons.</p>
<p>Analysis of the different postsynaptic partners reveals preferential connectivity with BMNs innervating bristles on specific head locations. Further, we identify a neuron hemilineage (23b) whose members show differential postsynaptic connectivity with BMNs, and elicit aimed head grooming. This identifies putative parallel circuits whose developmentally-related parallel pathways elicit different aimed grooming movements. The BMN presynaptic partners are primarily GABAergic, supporting a previous hypothesis that presynaptic inhibition acts as a gain control mechanism to suppress grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). The BMN connectome provides a high-resolution view of the mechanosensory-brain interface and reveals how somatotopic organization underlies the parallel circuit architecture of grooming.</p>

<title>BMN synapses are somatotopically distributed in the ventral brain</title>
<p>The head bristle populations are innervated by BMN types whose axons project to distinct zones in the ventral brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1 – figure supplement 2A-E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>). We analyzed these projection zones at the synaptic level by comparing the spatial distributions of the BMN synapses identified in the FAFB dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Buhmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dorkenwald et al., 2022</xref>). Synapses of different BMN types exhibited distinct spatial distributions along their axonal projections (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Synapses from BMN types innervating neighboring bristle populations showed partial overlap, while those from distant bristles formed separate, non-tiling zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1 – figure supplement 3A-E</xref>).</p>
<p>Each BMN type contributed a distinct number of synapses, influenced by differences in BMN numbers and their average synapse counts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Some BMN types varied by nearly two orders of magnitude in average synapse count (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). For example, 35 BM-Taste neurons from the proboscis accounted for 45% of all head BMN synapses, with 1,028 synapses per neuron on average. In contrast, 405 eye BM-InOm neurons contributed only 9% to the total synapse count due to having the lowest average, with 18 synapses per neuron. Posterior head BMNs had some of the fewest total and average synapses among the BMN types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,C</xref>, BM-dPoOr,-dOcci, and-vOcci/vPoOr neurons). This shows how bristle locations on the head are differentially represented in the brain based on their BMN synapse distributions into distinct zones, and their synapse numbers.</p>

<title>The BMN connectome</title>
<p>The reconstruction and mapping of the head BMNs provided the framework for us to next determine how they interface with pre-and postsynaptic partners. The entire BMN pre-and postsynaptic connectome was previously edited in FAFB by our group and others using the FlyWire.ai platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dorkenwald et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>). We focused here on partners of BMNs from the left side of the head. 484 partners that met a 5 synapse connection threshold with BMNs were identified using the FAFB analysis platform Codex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Matsliah et al., 2023</xref>). The partners included neurons on both the ipsilateral and contralateral brain hemispheres. Contralateral connections are possible, in part, because some BMN types have projections that cross the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>). There were significantly more postsynaptic than presynaptic partners, in agreement with the BMNs containing more presynaptic than postsynaptic structures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <bold>Supplementary file 3, Supplementary file 6</bold>).

<p>Interneurons were classified based on their neurites being restricted to the brain. The ascending and descending neurons have neurites in the brain and ventral nerve cord (VNC), and their somas are located in the VNC and brain, respectively. Thus, the BMNs interface with a diverse set of partners with neurites both in the brain and VNC. Note that the FAFB dataset only includes the brain, and excludes ascending and descending neurites in the VNC.</p>

<title>BMN connectome general organizational features</title>
<p>We identified key organizational features of the BMN pre-and postsynaptic partners in FAFB, based on their connectivity, neurotransmitter identities, and neuron categories (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Eckstein et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Matsliah et al., 2023</xref>). The motor neurons comprise 3% of total BMN partners and were exclusively postsynaptic targets, receiving input from six distinct BMN types and accounting for 2% of total BMN output sites. Subsets of BMNs, ascending neurons, descending neurons, and interneurons are presynaptic, postsynaptic, or both pre-and postsynaptic (pre/post neurons) to the BMNs.</p>
<p>The BMNs are synaptically connected with each other via axo-axonal connections, with BMNs innervating the same or neighboring head bristle populations showing the highest interconnectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>). BMNs are likely cholinergic based on neurotransmitter predictions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>) and experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Tuthill and Wilson, 2016b</xref>), suggesting somatotopy-based mutual excitation.</p>
<p>Although 18% of BMN synaptic partners are other BMNs, BMN/BMN connections accounted for only 1% of BMN synaptic sites. The majority of synapses were formed with ascending, descending, and interneurons in the CNS. Interestingly, some BMN types lacked specific presynaptic partners from these categories (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). For instance, BM-InOc and-Oc neurons connect presynaptically with descending neurons but not ascending or interneurons. Conversely, dPoOr neurons on the posterior head connect with ascending presynaptic partners but lack interneuron or descending connections. Thus, while BMN types generally connect with diverse neuron categories, some have more restricted presynaptic inputs.</p>
<p>A striking feature of the presynaptic connectome was that most BMN synaptic input was predicted to be GABAergic (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, bottom), highlighting a major role for presynaptic inhibition of the BMNs. Further, some of these inputs were from pre/post neurons, revealing feedback inhibition. In contrast to the presynaptic partners, BMN postsynaptic partners mediate both excitation and inhibition downstream, with cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic partners (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings reveal that BMNs engage with diverse partners to form key circuit features, including direct BMN-to-motor-neuron output, mutual excitation among BMNs, presynaptic inhibition, feedback inhibition, and excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic output. Below, we describe these fundamental features of mechanosensation, and examine how they contribute to grooming behavior.</p>

<title>BMN postsynaptic motor neurons</title>
<p>Sixteen motor neurons postsynaptic to the BMNs were identified, revealing a direct link between mechanosensory input and motor output (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,B</xref>). These motor neurons were classified by their axonal projections through the labial, pharyngeal, or antennal nerves. Labial and pharyngeal nerve motor neurons produce proboscis movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">McKellar et al., 2020</xref>) and connect with BMN types innervating bristles on the proboscis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Labial motor neurons were exclusively postsynaptic to BM-Taste neurons on the distal proboscis, while pharyngeal motor neurons were connected with BM-Taste and-Hau neuron types innervating neighboring proboscis bristles. Optogenetic activation of BM-Taste neurons elicits proboscis grooming, during which the proboscis often extends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting that proboscis extension could be modulated via direct BM-Taste to motor neuron connections. The reconstructed antennal nerve motor neurons likely contribute to antennal movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Özdil et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Suver et al., 2023</xref>). These neurons received most of their BMN inputs from BM-Ant neurons on the antennae, but also from BMN types innervating bristles neighboring the antennae (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C,F</xref>). Thus, BMNs innervating bristles on the proboscis and antennae connect with motor neurons projecting to those appendages, potentially influencing grooming-related movements. However, BMN inputs accounted for only a small fraction of total synapses onto each motor neuron (≦6.28% of total inputs/BMN type, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>), leaving their exact contribution to movement uncertain.</p>

<title>Synapses of BMN partners are mostly concentrated in the ventral brain</title>
<p>Most BMN partner neurites were concentrated in the ventral brain, with some extending into dorsal regions <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-J</xref>). Synapse mapping of nearly all the pre-and postsynaptic sites of BMN partners revealed that partner synapses were predominantly located in the gnathal ganglia (GNG) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). The GNG is the ventral-most brain neuropil containing the BMN projections, and connects to the VNC via ascending and descending neurons through the cervical connective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ito et al., 2014</xref>). The GNG also contains interneurons and descending neurons whose activation elicits head grooming movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Guo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). On average, BMN partners had 24 times more synapses in the GNG than in their second-highest synapse location, the saddle (SAD), located just dorsal to the GNG. While most synapses were in the GNG and SAD, smaller numbers were found in other neuropils. For instance, presynaptic partners had synapses in the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC), and in the dorsal and the medial neuropils, vest (VES) and flange (FLA) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).

<title>Majority of BMN presynaptic input is GABAergic</title>
<p>GABAergic inhibition is the dominant feature of the presynaptic connectome, as shown by synapse counts from presynaptic or pre/post neurons onto BMNs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). BMNs receive minor inputs from cholinergic BMNs and serotonergic ascending neurons, while the GABAergic inputs originate from ascending, descending, and interneurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C-J</xref>). Thus, both the brain and VNC contribute to BMN presynaptic input. Partners that are exclusively presynaptic to the BMNs account for 13% of the total input, which is mostly from GABAergic ascending neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A,D</xref>).

Notably, 68% of feedback inhibition comes from interneurons, revealing strong influence of BMN feedback inhibition from local neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>).

<p>Unlike the primarily GABAergic presynaptic partners, the BMN postsynaptic partners include both excitatory and inhibitory neurons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). BMN output synapses were distributed as follows: 53% to excitatory cholinergic neurons, 33% to inhibitory GABAergic neurons, 4% to excitatory/inhibitory glutamatergic neurons, and 10% to neurons that could not be linked to a neurotransmitter by the prediction algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Eckstein et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Liu and Wilson, 2013</xref>). Notably, 29% of BMN outputs onto exclusively postsynaptic partners targeted cholinergic descending neurons, suggesting a major role for BMNs is to provide feedforward excitation to VNC circuits (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). BMNs also had significant connections with excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, indicating their integration with local brain circuits to provide both feedforward excitation and inhibition. This excitation is hypothesized to help form BMN feedforward circuits that elicit aimed grooming of specific body locations, while feedforward inhibition could produce the hierarchical suppression of grooming movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Pre/post interneurons, which provide a major portion of GABAergic presynaptic input to BMNs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>), also received the largest share of BMN outputs, as compared with other pre/post neuron categories (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). These GABAergic interneurons appear to have a major role in BMN feedback inhibition. Taken together, the BMN postsynaptic partners include a diverse set of neurons that mediate both feedforward excitation and inhibition and feedback inhibition.</p>

<title>Somatotopy-based connectivity among BMN synaptic partners in the CNS</title>
<p>The head location-specific BMN projection zones shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-D</xref> are hypothesized to be where BMN types connect with excitatory postsynaptic partners in the GNG that elicit aimed grooming of distinct locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). We previously found connectomic evidence of such a parallel architecture, showing that BMNs innervating the same or neighboring head bristle populations exhibit similarity in postsynaptic connectivity, whereas those innervating distant bristles demonstrate minimal or no postsynaptic connectivity similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>). Here, we extended this analysis to include all BMN pre-and postsynaptic partners in the CNS, and then determined the extent to which the second order connectome reflects the BMN type somatotopic organization.</p>
<p>All head BMNs were first reassessed in pairwise tests for postsynaptic connectivity similarity. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>), clustering the BMNs based on cosine similarity scores revealed the highest connectivity similarity among BMNs of the same type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9 – figure supplement 1A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp12">Supplementary file 12</xref>). The clustering also revealed different levels of head spatial resolution in connectivity similarity, from the level of BMN types, to the coarser level of BMNs from particular head regions.</p>
<p>These different levels of resolution were more apparent when excluding the BM-InOm neurons from the analysis. These BMNs are numerous and have relatively low synapse numbers, and therefore obscure cosine similarity clustering among the other BMN types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>). Excluding the BM-InOm neurons from the analysis revealed a coarse level of connectivity similarity among the other BMNs that includes the dorsal, ventral, and posterior head regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9 – figure supplement 1B,D</xref>).</p>
<p>We next investigated the somatotopy among the pre-and postsynaptic interneurons, descending and ascending neurons by defining their overall connectivity structure with the different BMN types. Because BMNs were clustered by type due to their high connectivity similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9 – figure supplement 1A-E</xref>), we generated a network graph of their connectome that was based on pooling BMN synapses by type (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>). Many types had unique pre-and postsynaptic partners, revealing independent BMN-type input and output channels. The BMN types varied widely in their numbers of connected partners, with the BM-Taste neurons on the proboscis having the most partners and the BM-dOcci neurons having the least (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1B</xref>). Further, BMN types innervating neighboring bristle populations showed common partners, and were in closer proximity in the network graphs than distant BMN types. Three regions with high connectivity similarity included the dorsal, ventral, and posterior head (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9 – figure supplement 1A,B,E</xref>). These results demonstrate somatotopic organization of the BMNs with their pre-and postsynaptic partners at different levels of head spatial resolution, and further reveal the organizational logic of BMN parallel pathways.</p>

<title>BMN feedback inhibition is mediated by somatotopically organized pre/post neurons</title>
<p>The BMN pre-and postsynaptic partners showed somatotopy-based connectivity corresponding to specific head locations (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A-E</xref>). However, 39 of these partners were pre/post neurons, and it was unclear whether they were grossly asymmetric—serving almost exclusively as presynaptic or postsynaptic targets with only relatively few reciprocal contacts—or truly formed robust bidirectional connections with BMNs. It was also unclear whether their inputs and outputs involved the same or different BMN types. Utilizing a presynaptic:postsynaptic connectivity ratio filtered to 0.1–10, five neurons were excluded for asymmetric wiring and 34 pre/post neurons were used for further analysis. A network diagram including these 34 pre/post partners showed that all formed connections with one or more BMN types, but not all connections were reciprocal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10 – figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp13">Supplementary file 13</xref>). Non-reciprocal connections are made with different pre-and postsynaptic BMN types, for example a pre/post partner receiving inputs from BM-InOm neurons on the eyes and sending outputs to BM-Ant neurons on the antennae. These non-reciprocal edges were removed in a subsequent analysis to better visualize all reciprocal relationships between pre/post partners and any given BMN type (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A</xref>). Of all the reciprocal connections, some were exclusive to particular BMN types (e.g. ventral head BM-Taste and-Vib neurons), while others connected with multiple types from neighboring head locations and clustered closely on the network diagram (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A</xref>). These findings reveal that pre/post neuron connections with BMNs are somatotopically organized. Furthermore, these neurons are predicted to be GABAergic, suggesting that they form feedback inhibitory loops onto BMNs innervating the same or neighboring bristles on the head. This could provide a gain control mechanism by which BMN presynaptic inhibition mediates hierarchical suppression of movements in the grooming sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p>

One of these eight pairs showed limited morphological similarity with each other, while the other seven were morphologically identical neurons from the left and right brain hemispheres (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B–I</xref>). Six of these identical pairs were previously annotated in Codex as present bilaterally (CB0786, CB2513, CB0516, CB0496, DNge122, DNg20).

<p>We next focused on defining the structure of the parallel BMN postsynaptic excitatory pathways that elicit grooming movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A,C</xref>), first categorizing the postsynaptic partners based on developmental birth timing. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, primary neurons derived from embryos function throughout larval and adult stages, while secondary neurons derived post embryonically function exclusively in adults. The FAFB-reconstructed descending neurons and interneurons were previously categorized as putative primary or secondary neurons, with ascending neurons remaining unclassified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Schlegel et al., 2024</xref>). Applying these classifications to the BMN postsynaptic partners revealed 163 putative primary neurons and 122 secondary neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11 – figure supplement 1A-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp14">Supplementary file 14</xref>).

<title>The entire cholinergic hemilineage 23b (LB23) is postsynaptic to BMNs</title>
<p>To identify neurons crucial for establishing the BMN-postsynaptic parallel pathways that elicit head grooming movements, we focused on hemilineages. This was motivated by earlier findings that neurons whose activation elicited head grooming had morphologies consistent with specific hemilineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). We hypothesized that some of these neurons could be postsynaptic to the BMNs. Nineteen hemilineages were found to be postsynaptic to BMNs, with most having fewer than 25% of their members connected (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A-T</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s2">Figure 11 – figure supplement 2</xref>). Hemilineage 23b on the other hand, referred to here as LB23, stood out with 100% of its members being connected with BMNs on the ipsilateral side and 46% on the contralateral side (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B</xref>). The LB23 neurons accounted for 7% of all BMN postsynaptic partners, and received 12% of the total BMN synapses.

<p>We also identified driver lines expressing in neurons eliciting aimed grooming of the antennae (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12A</xref>, R26B12-GAL4, aBN2-spGAL4-1 and 2). Prior to being recognised as LB23 neurons, a subset of three were shown to be necessary and sufficient for eliciting antennal grooming and named antennal brain neurons 2 (aBN2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). There are three proposed aBN2 neurons based on the observation that aBN2-spGAL4-1 labels three neurons whose silencing disrupts antennal grooming. We used aBN2-spGAL4-1 with the multicolor flipout (MCFO) method to stochastically label each neuron individually and determine the extent to which these three neurons resembled LB23 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Nern et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, the labeled aBN2 neurons were nearly morphologically identical, with an ipsilateral dendritic field and an axon projecting to the contralateral brain hemisphere (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12D,E</xref>, two examples). 7 out of 19 (37%) labeled aBN2 neurons had a dendritic branch approaching the brain midline (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12E</xref>, arrowhead). We concluded that one of the three aBN2 neurons has this midline branch, given that two were labeled in the same brain hemisphere that both lacked the branch (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12F</xref>).</p>
<p>There are 21 LB23 neurons in the FAFB left brain hemisphere (22 on the right) that consist of different morphologically distinct neurons including 18 interneurons and 3 descending neurons (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ngl.flywire.ai/?json_url=https://globalv1.flywire-daf.com/nglstate/4541825778974720">Flywire.ai link 1</ext-link>). Among these diverse interneurons, we identified three that resembled the MCFO-labeled aBN2s (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12G-I</xref>, named aBN2_1, 2, and 3). One of these neurons (aBN2_2) had a midline-projecting dendritic branch, in agreement with what we predicted from the MCFO data (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12E,H</xref>). These morphological similarities provide strong evidence that aBN2 neurons belong to the LB23 hemilineage. When taken with behavioral evidence, it uncovers a role for LB23 hemilineage neurons in eliciting aimed head grooming movements.</p>

<title>BMNs and LB23 neurons form somatotopic pathways that elicit aimed grooming</title>
<p>We hypothesize that BMNs connect with somatotopically organized excitatory parallel pathways eliciting aimed grooming of specific head locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). LB23 neurons could form these pathways, given that they are cholinergic and their activation elicits aimed grooming. We tested the extent to which BMNs and LB23 neurons connect to form a parallel architecture. Indeed, a network graph revealed that subpopulations of LB23 neurons are preferentially connected with particular BMN types from different head bristle locations (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp16">Supplementary file 16</xref>). Some LB23 interneuron members connected exclusively with particular BMN types, highlighting bristle population specific LB23 pathways (e.g. BM-Taste and-Hau neurons). However, most LB23 interneurons showed overlapping connectivity with at least two BMN types innervating neighboring head bristle locations, while showing minimal LB23 connectivity overlap with BMNs from distant locations. In contrast, the LB23 descending neurons were less selective, receiving BMN inputs from broader head regions. This indicates that BMNs form somatotopically organized connections with LB23 neurons, ranging in resolution from specific bristle populations (e.g., proboscis) to broader head regions (e.g., ventral head), supporting the existence of parallel BMN–LB23 pathways that correspond to head location.</p>

Node positions were computed using a Fruchterman–Reingold force-directed layout: each directed edge acts like a spring whose strength is proportional to the edge weight (synapse count), drawing highly connected nodes together, while all nodes repel one another to prevent overlap. Consequently, neurons with many or strong synaptic connections cluster closely in the 2D embedding, whereas weakly or unconnected neurons are pushed to the periphery. (<bold>C</bold>) LB23 neurons are derived from NB7-4 neuroblasts that divide to produce another neuroblast and a ganglion mother cell.

<p>Based on the results described above, we hypothesized that particular BMN head bristle locations are groomed with activation of subpopulations of postsynaptic LB23 hemilineage neurons (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13C,D</xref>). If this is correct, then antennal BM-Ant neurons should be presynaptic to the LB23 subpopulation of aBN2 neurons that elicit antennal grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, the majority of BMN output synapses onto aBN2 neurons were from BM-Ant neurons (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13E,F</xref>), demonstrating that the somatotopic connectivity of BMN and aBN2 neurons corresponds with behavioral output. Further, BMN types innervating bristles from neighboring locations were also connected to aBN2 neurons, including BM-Fr,-InOm, and-Vib neurons. This suggests that neighboring BMN types could elicit antennal grooming through their connections with aBN2 neurons (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13D</xref>).</p>
<p>While BM-Ant neurons showed the highest aBN2 connectivity among the BMN presynaptic partners, they only connected with two of the three aBN2 neurons, including aBN2_1 and _2, while aBN2_3 was connected with BM-InOm and-Vib neurons. This may indicate that aBN2_1 and _2 are connected mainly with BM-Ant neurons and elicit grooming of the antennae, while aBN2_3 has a role that is more specific for the BM-InOm and-Vib bristle locations. When taken together, our data uncovered a putative somatotopically organized and developmentally related circuit architecture that controls aimed grooming of the head (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13C,D</xref>, see Discussion). This provides the foundation for studies that will define how spatially organized sensory input is transformed into coordinated motor output through lineage-derived neural pathways.</p>

<title>Comprehensive definition of the Drosophila BMN connectome</title>
<p>A key advance of this research is the comprehensive mapping of pre-and postsynaptic partners of <italic>Drosophila</italic> head BMNs, providing an unprecedented view of the mechanosensory interface with central circuits. In our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>), we showed that activation of BMNs innervating bristles at different head locations elicited grooming of their respective locations. We then mapped the somatotopic projections of nearly all head BMNs, from their bristles at specific locations on the head, through their different nerves, and into specific zones in the ventral brain. We then preliminarily described the somatotopic connectivity of BMN types with their postsynaptic partners. However, a comprehensive description of the BMN pre-and postsynaptic partners remained unresolved, including their different anatomical categories, predicted neurotransmitters, somatotopic organization, and roles in controlling specific grooming movements.</p>
<p>Here, we analyzed the entire previously reconstructed pre-and postsynaptic connectome of the head BMNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dorkenwald et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>), focusing on partners with at least five synaptic connections with the BMNs. This revealed partners that are exclusively pre-or postsynaptic, while others are both pre-and postsynaptic to the BMNs (pre/post). The partners include BMNs, motor neurons, interneurons, descending and ascending neurons. The majority of the presynaptic and pre/post partners are predicted to use inhibitory neurotransmitters, while postsynaptic partners include both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. One striking feature of the BMN connectome is the extent to which it shows somatotopy with respect to different head locations. BMN synapses fill their respective projection zones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-D</xref>), and in turn show differential pre-and postsynaptic connectivity with their partners (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A-E</xref>). To reveal how postsynaptic neurons could elicit aimed head grooming, we identified hemilineage 23b (LB23), whose members show differential connectivity with BMNs from different head locations (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13B</xref>) and elicit aimed grooming. This provides an important advance in our understanding of how somatotopic organization could drive appropriate behavior.</p>
<p>While nearly all head BMN synaptic partners were described here, different knowledge gaps remain. First, BMN partners connected with fewer than five synapses are not included in this study. The strongest synaptic connections described in this work have a higher likelihood of being preserved across brains and hemispheres and important for function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Schlegel et al., 2024</xref>). The weaker synaptic connections are more likely to represent developmental noise rather than connections that are found across animals. However, some lower level connections are likely also important, but are missing from this analysis. For example, the 5 synapse threshold excluded some BM-InOm connections, given that not all were assigned as having postsynaptic partners. It is known that there are 555 BM-InOm neurons in the FAFB left brain hemisphere, but only 405 of them have synaptic connections when the 5 synapse cutoff is applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1B</xref>). The BM-InOm neurons have relatively few synapses, but are present in high numbers, suggesting that they may excite postsynaptic partners collectively through low level connectivity and spatial summation. A second knowledge gap is that this work only focuses on the connectome of left side BMNs, and lacks information about the contralateral connectome. Finally, the FAFB dataset only includes the brain and not the VNC. Therefore, we cannot determine much about the identities of the ascending neurons or where the descending neurons project in the VNC. Forthcoming datasets that include the brain and VNC will enable identifying the ascending and descending neurons and their VNC connectivity, and uncover how the brain and VNC communicate through ascending and descending neurons.</p>
<p>This study presents the first comprehensive description of a BMN connectome for any insect, and provides a valuable example of a somatotopically organized connectome. While previous work has examined the postsynaptic partners of BMNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Newland and Burrows, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tuthill and Wilson, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yoshikawa et al., 2024</xref>), no comprehensive description was possible because of a lack of synaptic resolution datasets. The global view of a mechanosensory connectome presented here marks a significant milestone for insect research on mechanosensation, and serves as a foundational reference for future investigations.</p>

<title>A synaptic resolution connectome of a head somatotopic map</title>
<p>In our previous work, EM reconstructions of the head BMNs were used to produce a near complete somatotopic map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dorkenwald et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>). This revealed that BMNs from the same bristle populations (same types) project into the same zones in the ventral brain, show high morphological similarity, and their morphology is stereotyped across individual flies. Further, BMNs from neighboring bristle populations have overlapping projections into zones corresponding roughly to the dorsal, ventral, and posterior head. Here, we find that the somatotopic organization of the BMN projections is preserved in the spatial distributions of their synapses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-D</xref>), further revealing the extent of somatotopy among head BMNs.</p>
<p>BMNs from different head locations are also differentially represented in their synapse numbers in the brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref>). For example, the BM-Taste neurons on the proboscis have the highest numbers of synapses among the different BMN types, while types on the posterior head had some of the lowest numbers. BM-Taste neurons are unique compared with the other head BMNs because many of their bristles are bichoid, containing both mechanosensory and gustatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nayak and Singh, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Shanbhag et al., 2001</xref>). The BM-Taste neurons were previously shown to be important for feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jeong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>), and we showed that they elicit grooming of the proboscis and ventral head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, there may be more BM-Taste neuron synapses because they have more roles, such as in feeding and grooming. In contrast, BMNs on the posterior head, may have fewer synapses because they have more specialized roles for the fly. However, the significance of these synapse number differences remains to be demonstrated.</p>
<p>Work presented here reveals that head BMN somatotopy extends to their second order synaptic partners. BMNs of the same type show the highest postsynaptic connectivity similarity, while neighboring BMNs also show high similarity. This somatotopic organization was found with both the pre-and postsynaptic partners (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A-E</xref>), and with the subset of pre/post partners on their own (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A</xref>). Somatotopy in connectivity exists at different levels, from the same BMN types at the same head locations, to neighboring types corresponding to head regions, including the dorsal, ventral, and posterior head. Overlapping connectivity among neighboring BMN type partners may enable responses to mechanosensory stimulations of neighboring bristles whose corresponding BMNs are likely to be stimulated together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Tuthill and Wilson, 2016b</xref>).</p>
<p>One notable exception to the somatotopy-based connectivity are the BM-InOm neurons that fall in the middle of all the head regions in a network diagram, indicating that they show broad connectivity similarity with BMN types all over the head (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A-E</xref>). This may reflect the large surface area of the eyes that extend over the dorsal, ventral, and posterior head, and are thus neighbors with BMN types around the head. BM-InOm neurons were previously shown to consist of morphologically diverse subtypes, and we proposed that these subtypes innervate bristles at different locations on the eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>). Similarly, connectivity analysis of output synapses presented here suggests there are several BM-InOm subtypes defined by distinct output partner profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Future experiments will test the extent to which the heterogeneous BM-InOm neurons show differential connectivity that is based on their location on the eye.</p>
<p>Somatotopic connections were found between BMNs and diverse partners. Some of the partners are putative primary neurons that function in the larval and adult stages, while others are secondary hemilineages that are only functional in adult brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11 – figure supplement 1A-G</xref>). In this work, we focused on two partner types, including cholinergic hemilineage LB23 neurons, and pre/post neuron pairs that participate in BMN inhibitory feedback. The BMN/LB23 connectivity was similar to the global BMN/postsynaptic connectome structure, showing overlapping connectivity among neighboring head BMNs (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A-E</xref>, <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13A,B</xref>). The different pre/post bilaterally symmetric GABAergic neuron pairs also show preferential connectivity with BMNs, suggesting that these neurons mediate somatotopy-based feedback inhibition (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B-I</xref>). Do all BMN pre-and postsynaptic partners show somatotopic connectivity? Future work will define the extent to which second order somatotopy is present at the level of neuron types other than LB23 and the pre/post feedback neuron pairs.</p>

<title>First comprehensive connectome of somatotopically-organized mechanosensory neurons</title>
<p>The work presented here provides the first comprehensive mechanosensory second order synaptic-level connectome of any head. Somatotopic maps have been identified across species, as exemplified by vertebrate head and body maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abraira and Ginty, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Adibi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brown et al., 1977</xref>). Somatotopic organization is preserved through different processing layers in the nervous system and thought to be fundamentally important, although the functional significance of this organization remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kaas, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Thivierge and Marcus, 2007</xref>). Therefore, it is important to produce high resolution maps of somatotopically organized mechanosensory neurons, define the neuron types and organization that make up their postsynaptic circuits, and determine how these circuits influence behavior.</p>
<p>Previous work in vertebrates and invertebrates examined the somatotopy and organization among the mechanosensory second-order neurons. This work revealed somatotopic receptive fields, diverse postsynaptic neuron types, responses to mechanical stimuli, and behavioral roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abraira et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abraira and Ginty, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brown et al., 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Newland and Burrows, 1997</xref>). Striking similarities emerged in the organization and integration of mechanosensory inputs between vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Newland and Burrows, 1997</xref>). However, these previous studies were experimentally limited in their scope, and could not provide a comprehensive view of a somatotopic mechanosensory circuit architecture and behavioral outputs. We overcame these limitations by leveraging the complete connectome of the brain to produce the first EM reconstructed head somatotopic map with a previously defined somatotopic behavioral output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>). The mechanosensory connectome described here reveals basic principles of mechanosensory processing and expands our understanding of the neural circuits that produce grooming behavior. This connectome enables studies that determine how somatotopic organization gives rise to body location appropriate behavior.</p>

<title>Hypothesis: LB23 neurons translate the head BMN somatotopic map into aimed grooming movements</title>
<p>Flies can groom specific locations on their head, such as the eyes, antennae, proboscis, dorsal and ventral head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dawkins and Dawkins, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hampel et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Szebenyi, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). These movements can be elicited by stimulating specific head bristles or through optogenetic activation of specific BMN types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hampel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Melzig et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). However, the range of aimed movements that are elicited by stimulating each bristle population remains to be experimentally determined. Head BMNs project from bristles to somatotopically organized zones in the brain, with those innervating neighboring populations occupying overlapping zones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-D</xref>). To understand how the BMNs elicit aimed head grooming, we examined their postsynaptic targets. We identified hemilineage 23b (LB23) neurons as important mediators of BMN-driven, aimed head grooming.</p>
<p>LB23 neurons were previously suggested to be connected with BMNs based on their anatomical overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Harris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Shepherd et al., 2019</xref>), and here we provide direct evidence of this connectivity. LB23 is the only hemilineage in which 100% of its members are connected with ipsilateral BMNs, suggesting a critical role in the processing of BMN inputs (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A,B</xref>). The BMN to LB23 connectivity network is somatotopic, showing overlapping connectivity among neighboring head BMNs, however, not among distant ones (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13B</xref>). Thus, the BMNs and LB23 neurons form different parallel pathways that correspond to head location.</p>
<p>In this work, we identified the LB23 hemilineage members among the neuron types previously shown to form a neural circuit that elicits grooming of the antennae in response to mechanical stimulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hampel et al., 2020b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">2015</xref>). The circuit receives inputs from mechanosensory chordotonal organ neurons called Johnston’s organ neurons (JONs) that detect mechanical displacements of the antennae and project to the ventral brain. There, they excite two brain interneuron types, including one aBN1 neuron and three aBN2 neurons, along with three descending neurons (aDNs). aDNs project to the VNC where they are hypothesized to engage pattern generation circuitry that produces antennal grooming leg movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berkowitz and Laurent, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>aBN2 was the only type in the antennal grooming circuit with morphological similarity to LB23 neurons. We used the MCFO technique to label individual aBN2s, showing that their morphologies were preserved across individuals (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12D-F</xref>). Two aBN2s were indistinguishable from each other, while the third had a midline projecting branch. The reconstructed LB23 neurons consist of different morphologically distinct neurons, and three of these neurons showed striking similarity to the individually labeled aBN2s, including one with a midline projecting branch (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12D-I</xref>). This linked previously studied aBN2s to the LB23 hemilineage. As further confirmation that the three reconstructed LB23 neurons are aBN2, they are all postsynaptic to aBN1 in FAFB, and thus a part of the antennal grooming circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hampel et al., 2020b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">2015</xref>). This identifies a subpopulation of three morphologically similar LB23 neurons as aBN2s that elicit aimed grooming of the antennae.</p>
<p>According to our model of grooming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A,C</xref>), BMN/LB23 connectivity should form parallel pathways that elicit grooming corresponding to BMN location. For example, the aBN2s that elicit antennal grooming should be postsynaptic to antennal BMNs. Indeed, antennal BM-Ant neurons are the most highly aBN2-connected BMNs with two aBN2 neurons, aBN2_1 and _2 (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13E,F</xref>). Thus, the location groomed corresponds to the location of the majority of BMN inputs. However, aBN2_1 and _2 also have lower level connections with BMN types from neighboring locations, including the BM-Fr,-InOm neurons. This overlap could explain our previous finding that optogenetic activation of specific BMN types elicits aimed grooming of their corresponding head bristle locations, but also neighboring locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>). An organization whereby neighboring BMNs connect with aBN2 neurons that elicit grooming of neighboring locations provides a means of cleaning locations neighboring the stimulus site. One caveat stems from the finding that BM-Ant neurons do not connect with aBN2_3 that is instead connected with BM-ImOn and-Vib neurons from locations neighboring the antennae. This raises the possibility that activation of aBN2_3 elicits grooming of areas neighboring the antennae, such as a ventral location where the BM-InOm and-Vib neurons are located, which might be impossible to distinguish by eye (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13A</xref>). Testing this will require high resolution behavioral analysis of the grooming elicited by activating individual aBN2 neurons.</p>
<p>While we find that a subpopulation of LB23 neurons elicits antennal grooming, we also find evidence that other LB23 neurons in the hemilineage elicit head grooming. We previously reported a driver line (R40F04-GAL4) that elicits grooming of the whole head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we show that this line expresses in a cluster of 14 ventral brain neurons whose collective morphology resembles that of the LB23 neurons (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12B,C</xref>). While previous work did not distinguish between the LB23 neurons and other neurons targeted by R40F04-GAL4 as the ones eliciting grooming (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12B</xref>), our unpublished work implicates LB23 as the relevant neurons in this pattern. Thus, collective activation of at least 14 LB23 neurons elicits grooming of the whole head, implicating LB23 hemilineage neurons, in addition to the previously described aBN2s, as drivers of head grooming.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that the BMNs and LB23 hemilineage neurons form a somatotopic parallel grooming circuit architecture that elicits grooming of different head locations in response to mechanical stimulations (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13D</xref>). LB23 neurons are morphologically diverse, and a preliminary assessment indicates that these neurons could be categorized into subpopulations based on morphological similarity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ngl.flywire.ai/?json_url=https://globalv1.flywire-daf.com/nglstate/4541825778974720">FlyWire.ai link 1</ext-link>), as we found with the aBN2 subpopulation (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12D-I</xref>). The different BMN types that are preferentially connected with subpopulations of LB23 neurons are hypothesized to elicit aimed grooming of their corresponding bristle locations. Further, BMNs innervating neighboring bristles show overlapping connections with LB23 subpopulations, providing a mechanism by which bristle stimulation results in grooming of the stimulus location, and neighboring locations. Future experiments will define the full morphological diversity of the LB23 neurons and test the extent to which activation of LB23 subpopulations elicits aimed grooming of different head locations.</p>
<p>This work provides evidence of a somatotopically organized parallel circuit architecture that is established by a developmentally related set of neurons. This suggests that development produces circuits dedicated to distinct body locations through lineage matching. Further, at least one subpopulation of LB23 neurons (aBN2 neurons) elicits grooming of the location of the BMN that they are connected to (BM-Ant neurons) (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13E,F</xref>), and we hypothesize that other LB23 neurons also elicit different aimed head grooming movements (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13D</xref>).</p>
<p>This supports a model where LB23 subpopulations are developmentally pre-committed to body-location-specific sensorimotor roles. In addition to being in the ventral brain, LB23 neurons are also in different segments in the VNC, where they are thought to be connected with BMNs from different body locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Harris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Shepherd et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies showed that stimulations to bristles on the body also elicit aimed grooming locations including the legs, wings, and thorax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Corfas and Dudai, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Matheson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Page and Matheson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Usui-Ishihara et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Vandervorst and Ghysen, 1980</xref>). Future studies will be necessary to test the BMN/LB23 connectivity and functional organization in both the ventral brain and VNC.</p>

<title>The antennal grooming circuit receives diverse mechanosensory inputs</title>
<p>Our work reveals that the antennal grooming circuit receives inputs from two different types of antennal mechanosensory neurons, the BMNs and JONs. We previously reported that different subpopulations of JONs converge onto the antennal grooming circuit and elicit grooming. These subpopulations are morphologically distinct, and respond to different types of antennal stimulations. They include JO-A neurons that respond to high frequency vibrations, JO-CE neurons that respond to antennal displacements and vibrations, and JO-F neurons that do not respond to any of these stimuli, whose activation stimulus remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hampel et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mamiya and Dickinson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Matsuo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Patella and Wilson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Yorozu et al., 2009</xref>). While JO-A neurons have not been tested, optogenetic activation of either JO-CE or JO-F neurons elicits antennal grooming. The different JON subpopulations, aBN1, aBN2s, and aDNs neurons were previously identified in the FAFB dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hampel et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Shiu et al., 2024</xref>). This revealed that JO-A,-CE, and-F neurons are all connected with aBN1, while only JO-F neurons are connected with aBN2 and aDN2 (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13F</xref>). Here, we find that the BMNs are also connected with the antennal circuit, implicating another mechanosensory modality involved in stimulating grooming behavior. The aBN2 neurons were shown to receive most BMN inputs in the antennal grooming circuit, although aDN2 also had connections with BMNs (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13F</xref>). Thus, different types of mechanical stimuli may elicit antennal grooming.</p>

<title>Parallel circuit architecture underlying the grooming sequence</title>
<p>Previous work identified the mechanosensory neurons hypothesized from the parallel model that elicit the <italic>Drosophila</italic> grooming sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hampel et al., 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mueller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). These neurons are at different locations on the body and head and elicit aimed grooming of their corresponding bristles. The different movements are performed in a sequence when mechanosensory neurons at different locations become simultaneously activated by dust covering the body. Supporting this, simultaneous optogenetic stimulation of mechanosensory neurons at these locations induces a sequence resembling natural dust-induced grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hampel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>BMNs play a pivotal role, as their activation alone can initiate aimed grooming, whereas their collective activation elicits a grooming sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we focus on BMN postsynaptic partners that could form parallel circuits that elicit aimed grooming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). Consistent with a parallel architecture, we identified subpopulations of LB23 neurons showing preferential connectivity with BMN types innervating neighboring head bristles (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13A,B</xref>). At least some LB23 neurons elicit aimed head grooming, as we demonstrated by linking previous optogenetic activation experiments with the LB23 anatomical comparisons (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12A-I</xref>). This leads us to hypothesize that different BMN types connect with morphologically distinct LB23 subpopulations, establishing a parallel architecture that elicits aimed head grooming (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13D</xref>).</p>
<p>The sensory to motor resolution of this parallel circuit architecture remains to be tested. While grooming is aimed at specific head locations in response to mechanical stimulations, grooming of neighboring locations can also be elicited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hampel et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">2015</xref>). The extent to which different BMN types elicit grooming of distinct locations versus neighboring locations remains to be systematically defined. The BMN to LB23 connectivity may offer insights into the circuit architecture underlying these responses, as neighboring types have overlapping connectivity with LB23 neurons (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13A,B</xref>). Thus, stimulation of a particular BMN type could excite multiple postsynaptic neurons, potentially eliciting grooming of local and neighboring locations. Future studies will test this by linking the connectivity with high resolution analysis of the grooming movements elicited with activation of different nodes in the BMN circuit architecture.</p>
<p>Simultaneous activation of the parallel circuit architecture by dust causes competition among the movements to be performed in sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). The competition is resolved through hierarchical suppression, where earlier movements in the sequence suppress later movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1B</xref>). An activity gradient is established among the parallel circuits to determine performance order where earlier movements have the highest activity and later ones have the lowest. The highest activity movement is selected by a winner-take-all network that suppresses the other movements. The activity gradient could be established through the control of sensory gain among the BMNs, or through lateral inhibitory connections between the parallel circuits. We previously hypothesized that this suppression could occur through unilateral inhibitory connections between the different parallel circuits or by modulating the sensory gain on the different grooming circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Work presented here reveals one possible mechanism of sensory gain control through presynaptic inhibition of the BMNs. Indeed this mechanism has been shown to control different movements by negatively regulating mechanosensory output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blagburn and Sattelle, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Burrows and Matheson, 1994</xref>; F <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Clarac and Cattaert, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gaudry and Kristan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hampel et al., 2017</xref>). Here we find that most of the presynaptic inputs onto the BMNs are GABAergic, further implicating presynaptic inhibition in controlling grooming behavior. These GABAergic neurons are somatotopically organized, showing preferential connectivity with BMNs from specific head locations (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B,C</xref>, <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A</xref>). Somatotopy-based presynaptic inhibition could establish the activity gradient across the different BMN parallel pathways described above. The presynaptic inhibitory neurons identified here enable future studies to test the roles of these neurons in mediating presynaptic inhibition and controlling grooming behavior.</p>

<title>BMN connectome organizational features reveal mechanosensory principles</title>
<p>Our synaptic-resolution map of the head BMNs delivers the first complete mechanosensory connectome in any animal, transforming long-standing inferences from anatomical and physiological experiments into a comprehensive anatomical framework. Nearly all pre-and postsynaptic partners reside in ventral neuropils (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-J</xref>), and few have synapses in dorsal higher-order centers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A–D</xref>). This ventral concentration suggests that early mechanosensory computations remain local, an architecture echoed in mammalian dorsal horn low-threshold mechanoreceptor circuits and in locust mechanoreceptor pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abraira et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Newland and Burrows, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>BMN presynaptic partners, excluding other BMNs, are overwhelmingly GABAergic (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), establishing presynaptic inhibition as a dominant feature that can scale BMN output, rather than abolish it, and sharpen spatial and temporal tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blagburn and Sattelle, 1987</xref>; F. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Clarac and Cattaert, 1996</xref>). Further, many GABAergic interneurons are pre/post neurons, embedding feedback loops directly into the afferent stream. In contrast, many ascending partners provide presynaptic inhibitory inputs originating in the VNC, suggesting that body-state signals gate head mechanosensation from below.</p>
<p>Postsynaptic partners are mainly cholinergic, but also include some GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). These partners consist of diverse neuron types, in line with vertebrate mechanosensory partners in the mammalian dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abraira et al., 2017</xref>). We focus here on LB23 hemilineage neurons that form excitatory parallel pathways whose selective activation can drive aimed grooming. This suggests that lineage-based subnetworks translate head somatotopy into location-specific action. Of all purely postsynaptic targets, descending neurons receive a major portion of BMN synapses (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). Their axons project to the VNC, providing a rapid conduit for head-derived mechanosensory signals to influence whole-body posture and reflexes.</p>
<p>The connectome also rationalizes several behavioural phenomena. Dense GABAergic feedback can transiently suppress competing BMN channels, explaining hierarchical grooming sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). Recurrent loops formed by pre/post neurons offer substrates for habituation and temporal summation of repeated touches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Corfas and Dudai, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Guzulaitis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sherrington, 1906</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Stein, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Across taxa, three organisational themes recur: local second-order hubs, extensive presynaptic inhibition, and somatotopically organized pathways. Yet only here are all synapses known, allowing quantitative tests of these principles. As larger connectomes emerge, the architectural solutions uncovered in the BMN system should serve as a template for unifying mechanosensory processing across phyla.</p>
<p>However, all connectivity described here must be validated using calcium imaging and electrophysiological approaches, and any behavioural relevance confirmed by targeted perturbations. Nevertheless, by cataloguing every synaptic partner of a peripheral mechanosensory population, the BMN connectome provides both a resource and a roadmap for dissecting how local touch stimuli are transformed into adaptive behaviour in insects and, by comparison, in vertebrates.</p>

<title>Connectome data and neuron meshes</title>
<p>Based on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eichler et al., 2024</xref>), bristle mechanosensory neurons (BMNs) were proofread, categorized, and compiled into a master list of left-sided BMNs (previously classified as right-sided BMNs) with their corresponding root ID in Flywire (v783) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dorkenwald et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>) as seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Synaptic connectivity data for BMNs and all pre-and postsynaptic partners with five or greater connections were obtained from the FlyWire Codex platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://codex.flywire.ai/">https://codex.flywire.ai/</ext-link>), which provides preprocessed reconstructions and synapse annotations across the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Buhmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dorkenwald et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Heinrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The full connections.csv data table was downloaded from Codex (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://codex.flywire.ai/">https://codex.flywire.ai/</ext-link>). This table contains one row for each pair of connected neurons within a given neuropil and reports the number of synapses between those neurons. Only connections involving five or more synapses (combined across all neuropils) are included in this dataset; pairwise connections with fewer than five synapses are excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dorkenwald et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, connections between BMNs and any partners with fewer than five synapses were not included in any analysis present in this work.</p>
<p>To identify BMN connectivity, the table was filtered for entries in which either the presynaptic or postsynaptic root ID (v783) matched a left-sided BMN. Rows with BMNs as the presynaptic root ID were classified as BMN outputs, and the postsynaptic root ID was classified as a postsynaptic partner of BMNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Similarly, rows with BMNs as the postsynaptic root ID were classified as BMN inputs, and the presynaptic root ID was classified as a presynaptic partner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Unique partner IDs were compiled from the filtered inputs and outputs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Partners that appeared as both pre-and postsynaptic to BMNs were categorized as “pre/post neurons” enabling us to quantify reciprocal interactions and assess the proportion of BMN inputs that originated from their downstream targets.</p>

<title>Categorization of BMN partners</title>
<p>We summarized the total number of synapses for each BMN type, broken down into inputs and outputs, and quantified the number of unique synaptic partners. To gain an overview of partner identity, all presynaptic and postsynaptic partners of BMNs – including partners classified as “pre/post” – were previously inspected manually in FlyWire and categorized into five broad morphological classes: interneurons, descending neurons, ascending neurons, other BMNs, and motor neurons. These classes were cross-referenced with existing annotations in FlyWire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dorkenwald et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Neurons with both dendritic and axonal processes, as well as a soma, entirely within the CNS were categorized as interneurons (noted as “Central Brain” or “CB” in flywire annotations). Neurons with their soma and dendritic processes in the CNS and axonal projections extending into the descending tracts of the VNC were categorized as descending neurons. Conversely, neurons originating from the cervical connective that contained axonal projections in the CNS were classified as ascending neurons.</p>
<p>To further characterize BMN partners, the full neurons.csv table was downloaded from Codex. This table provides a row for each neuron in the dataset, including its neurotransmitter prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Buhmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dorkenwald et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Heinrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>).

<title>Visualization of BMN partner category and synapse composition</title>
<p>Partner categories and connectivity patterns with BMNs were visualized using a Sankey diagram (i.e., directional flow diagram) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref><bold>, Supplementary file 4</bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) and two sunburst plots (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>) generated in R. In <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, normalized synapse counts between each BMN type and its presynaptic or postsynaptic partners were used. To achieve this, BMN synapses were grouped by target partner class (e.g., interneurons, descending neurons, etc.) and further subdivided into purely presynaptic, purely postsynaptic, or pre/post categories (<bold>Supplementary file 4)</bold>. Synapse values were normalized within each BMN type by setting all edge weights proportional to the total number of outputs for the particular BMN type (<bold>Supplementary file 5)</bold>. This allowed for direct comparison of synapse fractions across BMN types. The normalized matrix was reshaped into a long-format edge list and used to construct a directional flow diagram using the networkD3 package in R (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>To further characterize the composition of BMN synaptic partners and their associated synapses, sunburst plots were created using the sunburstR package in R (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). One plot represented the distribution of presynaptic, postsynaptic, and pre/post partners by category and neurotransmitter identity; the other depicted the same structure based on the number of pre-and postsynaptic sites rather than partner counts. Each sunburst plot consisted of three layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Schlegel et al., 2021</xref>): the first denoting a pre-or postsynaptic (or pre/post) relationship with BMNs; the second indicating morphological class (e.g. interneuron, ascending); and the third showing predicted neurotransmitter identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dorkenwald et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Eckstein et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Matsliah et al., 2023</xref>). Neurons for which neurotransmitter predictions were not available were labeled as “unknown”.</p>
<p>To visualize the brain occupying space of different partner categories, three-dimensional meshes of all partners were downloaded using fafbseg in R and displayed alongside BMNs for anatomical reference (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Here, partners were separated based on category (e.g., interneuron, ascending) as well as their relationship to BMNs (e.g., presynaptic, postsynaptic). Further analysis was performed to highlight the varying neurotransmitter profiles and brain occupying regions of presynaptic and postsynaptic partners (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref><bold>, Supplementary file 6</bold>).</p>

<title>Identification and visualization of BMN-connected motor neurons</title>
<p>Motor neurons postsynaptic to BMNs were identified using annotations available in the Codex platform. For each motor neuron, the number of presynaptic BMNs was quantified.

This matrix was visualized as a heatmap, with grayscale intensity indicating the number of presynaptic BMNs per motor neuron. Neurons were grouped by the peripheral nerve through which their axons exit the brain: labial, pharyngeal, or antennal, as annotated in FlyWire. These categories were color-coded for both heatmap visualization and mesh rendering (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Three-dimensional meshes of all postsynaptic motor neurons were downloaded using fafbseg in R and displayed alongside BMNs for anatomical reference (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

To visualize the peripheral organization of BMNs projecting to each motor nerve class, colored dots were overlaid on bristle maps, marking the head regions innervated by BMN types presynaptic to each class (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-F</xref>).

<title>Synaptic distribution of partners across neuropils</title>
<p>Using the Codex neuropil_synapse_table.csv table (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://codex.flywire.ai/">https://codex.flywire.ai/</ext-link>), we assessed the number of input and output synapses across brain neuropils for all BMN partners categorized as ascending, descending, or interneuron. This table includes a column with a neuron’s root ID and the number of synapses in each neuropil of the brain as a separate column. The root ID column of this table was filtered to include only root IDs matching the BMN partners (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>).</p>
<p>Partners were grouped into three categories: purely presynaptic, purely postsynaptic, and pre/post partners. For each partner category, synapses were grouped by neuropil based on the location annotation provided in the Codex dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). This enabled identification of the upstream input sources of BMN presynaptic partners and the downstream output targets of BMN postsynaptic partners. Partners with both pre-and postsynaptic connections to BMNs were analyzed separately, allowing us to assess synaptic distributions for purely presynaptic, purely postsynaptic, and bidirectionally connected partner populations independently.</p>
<p>Given the overwhelming concentration of synapses (82%) in the gnathal ganglia (GNG), data were normalized to emphasize distribution patterns outside of this region. Specifically, for each partner category, the neuropil with the second-highest synapse count was used as the normalization reference. This neuropil was assigned a value of 1.0, and synapse counts in all other neuropils were expressed as fractions of that value. By excluding the GNG from normalization and referencing the second-most prevalent neuropil, this approach avoids compression of signal in other regions due to GNG dominance and enables clearer comparison of neuropils outside the GNG.</p>
<p>For visualization of neuropil distributions, normalized synapse data were merged with neuropil surface meshes in Blender (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Neuropil meshes and the full brain mesh were imported into Blender’s Python API using the navis package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Schlegel et al., 2024</xref>). A custom Python script applied color values to neuropil mesh materials based on the normalized synapse fractions using a linear interpolation between white (low) and red (high) values. Separate interpolation functions were applied to base color, emission, transmission, and transparency values to enhance visualization results. Neuropils with no associated synapses were automatically hidden from both the viewport and render output.</p>
<p>Normalized data used for visualization and raw synapse counts are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>. Neuropils and images were colored and rendered independently for each partner group (presynaptic, postsynaptic, and pre/post). For each panel in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> color intensity reflects synapse density relative to the second-most innervated region in each respective group.</p>

<title>Network visualizations</title>
<p>Network graphs were generated separately for BMN presynaptic and postsynaptic connections using Codex-derived data (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B-E</xref>). The filtered connectome data obtained from the Codex connections.csv table in the form of an edge list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>) was converted into two bipartite adjacency matrices: one for BMNs and their presynaptic partners, and another for BMNs and their postsynaptic partners. Neurons classified as “pre/post” were included in both network graphs.</p>
<p>Each adjacency matrix was imported into R and converted into a directed weighted graph using the igraph package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Csárdi and Nepusz, 2006</xref>). Edge weights reflected the number of synapses between BMNs and their partners. Node metadata, including classification of BMNs and their partners, was obtained from manually curated annotation tables (<bold>Supplementary file 1, Supplementary file 6</bold>).</p>
<p>Network graphs were visualized using the visNetwork package and its interface with igraph in R. The visIgraphLayout function was used to generate spatial node arrangements based on the force-directed layout algorithm by Fruchterman-Reingold, with a fixed random seed (1234) to ensure consistency across plots. Node shapes were assigned based on partner categories (BMNs, interneuron, descending, or ascending), and edge thickness was scaled to synapse count. Node positions were determined by the Fruchterman–Reingold force-directed layout, in which each directed edge acts like a spring whose strength is proportional to the edge weight, drawing highly connected nodes together, while all nodes repel one another to prevent overlap.</p>
<p>Consequently, neurons with many or strong synaptic connections cluster closely in the 2D embedding, whereas weakly or un-connected neurons are pushed to the periphery.</p>
<p>The relative spatial positioning of nodes in the network layouts was used to evaluate the organization of BMN types based on their corresponding anatomical origins on the head. Nodes corresponding to individual BMN types were grouped according to their associated head bristle locations as belonging to the dorsal, ventral, or posterior portion of the head, and their positions in the network were assessed to determine whether these groups exhibited spatial separation or clustering (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C,E</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s4i">
<title>Cosine similarity clustering of individual BMNs</title>
<p>To assess the similarity of BMNs based on their synaptic outputs, pairwise cosine similarity scores were calculated using an adjacency matrix constructed from Codex synapse data. The matrix was derived from a directed edge list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>) in which each row represented the presence of a connection from a BMN to a postsynaptic partner. The adjacency matrix was binarized such that entries indicated the presence (1) or absence (0) of a synaptic connection, without incorporating synaptic weight. The matrix was transposed so that each BMN was represented as a vector of its output connections, and cosine similarity was computed between all BMN vectors using the lsa package in R (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp12">Supplementary file 12</xref>).</p>
<p>To reduce background and emphasize stronger pairwise relationships, we applied a threshold of 0.3 to the similarity scores, with all values below this threshold set to zero. The resulting matrix was visualized as a clustered heatmap using the heatmaply package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Galili et al., 2017</xref>) with Ward’s hierarchical clustering method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9 - figure supplement 1A</xref>). Color bars were included to indicate BMN subtype and corresponding anatomical head position.</p>
<p>BMNs classified as interommatidial (InOm) were excluded from a second round of plotting to better visualize the relationships between other BMN subtypes. The previously computed similarity matrix was subset by removing rows and columns corresponding to InOm BMNs, and a second heatmap was generated including all the remaining BMN types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9 - figure supplement 1B)</xref>.</p>
<p>The thresholded similarity matrix was also used to construct an undirected weighted network graph using the igraph package in R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9 - figure supplement 1E)</xref>. A force-directed layout was applied, with edge weights corresponding to cosine similarity scores and node colors representing BMN subtype. Node positions were computed with igraph’s default Fruchterman–Reingold force-directed layout, such that edges weighted by cosine similarity act as springs attracting similar neurons, while all nodes repel to avoid overlap. Consequently, neurons with higher similarity scores (i.e., similar postsynaptic connectivity profiles) are drawn close together, forming visually distinct clusters with varying overlap. This graph was used to visualize the spatial relationships among individual BMNs in similarity space.</p>
<p>Several versions of the analysis were performed, including matrices that incorporated synaptic weights and omitted cosine similarity thresholding. All approaches revealed consistent overall structure; however, the binarized matrix with similarity thresholding yielded the clearest organization and was selected for final visualization.</p>

<title>Pre/post neurons as feedback loops</title>
<p>To investigate potential feedback loops between BMNs and their synaptic partners, we performed further analysis on partners that were both pre-and postsynaptic to BMNs (“pre/post” partners). As described above, synaptic edge lists were compiled from Codex data containing all BMN connections. These lists were then filtered to retain only connections between BMNs and the 39 non-BMN partners identified as both pre-and postsynaptic.</p>
<p>To more precisely define true pre/post partners and exclude those with highly asymmetric connectivity, we calculated the ratio of total presynaptic to postsynaptic connections for each partner. Only neurons with a ratio between 0.1 and 10 were retained, meaning that a partner could not be predominantly presynaptic or postsynaptic by more than one order of magnitude. This criterion allowed us to identify neurons with reasonably balanced bidirectional connectivity and improved the interpretability of the visualization. Five neurons were excluded based on this threshold, leaving 34 true pre/post partners in the final analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp13">Supplementary file 13</xref>).</p>
<p>A network graph showing all connections between BMNs and the 34 true pre/post partners was generated using the igraph and visNetwork packages in R, as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10 – figure supplement 1</xref>). We further filtered the edge data to include only reciprocal connections between BMN subtypes and pre/post neurons. For each pair of BMN type and pre/post partner, both presynaptic and postsynaptic connections were required for the edge to be retained. All non-reciprocated edges (i.e., those where a partner is postsynaptic to one BMN type and presynaptic to another BMN type) were excluded. This filtered subset was visualized as a second directed network graph, highlighting bidirectional loops between specific BMN types and pre/post partners (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A</xref>).</p>

<title>Identifying BMN postsynaptic hemilineages</title>
<p>Postsynaptic partners of BMNs were further annotated by developmental origin using hemilineage assignments from the classification.csv table in Codex (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://codex.flywire.ai/">https://codex.flywire.ai/</ext-link>). This allowed each partner to be assigned to one of three categories: putative primary neurons, secondary hemilineage-derived neurons, or undefined/unassigned neurons. Predicted neurotransmitter identities for each partner were retrieved from the Codex neurons.csv table and merged with the hemilineage assignments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).</p>
<p>For each hemilineage, we counted the number of BMN-connected neurons per hemisphere and compared this to the total number of neurons in that hemilineage as reported by Schlegel <italic>et al</italic>. This allowed calculation of the fraction of each hemilineage that receives direct BMN input (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A</xref>). The complete list of connected hemilineages and their synapse counts is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp14">Supplementary file 14</xref>.</p>
<p>Anatomical distributions of BMN-connected versus unconnected neurons within each hemilineage were visualized by mapping neuron meshes in FlyWire (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B–T</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). The overall composition of BMN postsynaptic partners across all partner categories (e.g., interneurons, descending neurons), subdivided by hemilineage and neurotransmitter, was summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s2">Figure 11—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Assessing relationship between BMNs and LB23 neurons</title>
<p>To explore the connectivity between BMNs and neurons of hemilinegage 23b (LB23), we constructed two network visualizations based on Codex-derived synapse data. Synaptic output data from BMNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>) were filtered to include only postsynaptic partners annotated as LB23 neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp16">Supplementary file 16</xref>). The resulting matrix was used to generate a bipartite adjacency graph in which BMN types and LB23 neurons were represented as nodes, and the edges represented synaptic connectivity (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13B</xref>).</p>
<p>The adjacency matrix was transposed and converted into a weighted directed graph using the igraph package in R, as described above. Node metadata were added from a manually curated annotation file (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Node shapes were assigned based on neuron categories (e.g. BMN, interneuron) and edge thickness was scaled to synapse count. The visIgraphLayout function was used to generate spatial node arrangements based on the force-directed layout algorithm by Fruchterman-Reingold, as described above.</p>
<p>In a second analysis, we focused on connections between BMNs and three individual antennal grooming neurons within the 23b lineage: aBN2_1, aBN2_2, and aBN2_3. Two rounds of filtering were performed on the BMN synaptic output matrix. First, the matrix was filtered to include only connections with the three aBN2 neurons, removing all other postsynaptic partners. Next, this reduced matrix was further filtered to retain only connections that met at least one of two criteria: (1) at least two BMNs from the same subtype were connected to the same aBN2 neuron, or (2) the connection contained more than five synapses. The resulting subset of connections was used to generate a simplified bipartite network graph, which was visualized using the visNetwork package with a hierarchical Sugiyama layout to highlight directional connectivity between BMN subtypes and aBN2 neurons (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13E</xref>).</p>

<title>Immunohistochemical analysis</title>
<p>We evaluated the expression pattern of the R40F04-GAL4 driver line by crossing it to 10XUAS-IVS-mCD8::GFP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:RRID:BDSC_32194">RRID:BDSC_32194</ext-link>) (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12B</xref>).

We imaged individually labeled neurons from at least 10 brains.</p>
<p>Stained brains were imaged using a Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Image preparation and adjustment of brightness and contrast were performed with Fiji software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fiji.sc/">http://fiji.sc/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Calle-Schuler et. al. reconstruct all the pre- and post-synaptic neurons to the bristle mechanosensory neurons on the adult fly head to understand how neural circuits determine the sequential motor patterns during fly grooming. They find that most presynaptic neurons, interneurons, and excitatory postsynaptic neurons are also somatotopically organized, such that each neuron is more connected to bristles mechanosensory neurons that are closer on the head and less connected to bristles mechanosensory neurons that are further away. These include the direct BMN-BMN circuits, excitatory interneurons, as well as the inhibitory networks. They also identify that the entire hemi-lineage 23b forms excitatory postsynaptic circuits with BMNs, highlighting how these circuits and hence their function could be developmentally determined.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a complete map of all the neurons that make 5 or more pre- and post-synaptic connections of the fly head BMNs. Using this, the authors have identified various trends, such as ascending neurons providing most of the GABAergic inhibitory input, which could provide the presynaptic inhibition essential for the parallel model for sequential grooming generation. Moreover, they identified that the entire cholinergic hemilineage 23b is postsynaptic to BMNs.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the somatotropic organization is an elegant mechanism to generate sequential motor sequences during grooming, none of the analyses in the paper directly demonstrate that this somatotropic connectivity is sufficient to generate hierarchical suppression and reconstruct the grooming sequence. If somatotropic organization is sufficient, then hierarchical clustering should recover the grooming sequence. Their detailed connectome enables the authors to test if some networks are more crucial for grooming sequence than others: to what extent can each network individually (ascending neurons-BMN alone) or a combination (BMN-BMN, ascending-BMN, BMN-descending, etc.) recover the sequence observed during grooming. If all the pre- and post-synaptic neurons put together cannot explain the sequence, then the sequence is probably determined by individual synaptic strengths or other key downstream neurons.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Schuler et al. present an extensive analysis of the synaptic connectivity of mechanosensory head bristles in the brain of Drosophila melanogaster. Based on the previously described set of bristle afferent neurons, (BMNs), located on the head, the study aims to provide a complete, quantitative assessment of all synaptic partners in the ventral brain. Activation of head bristles induces grooming behavior, which is hierarchically organized, and hypothesized to be grounded in a parallel cellular architecture in the central brain. The authors found evidence that, at the synaptic level, neurons downstream of the BMN afferents, namely the postsynaptic LB23 interneurons and recurrent GABAergic neurons (involved in sensory gain control), are organized in parallel, following the somatotopic organization described for the BMN afferents. This study, therefore, represents an important step towards a better understanding of the cellular circuits that govern the hierarchical order of sequentially organized grooming behavior in Drosophila melanogaster.</p>
<p>The study is well done, the images are well designed and extensive in number, but the account is challenging to read and digest for the reader outside the Drosophila /connectome community. It is amazing what can be done with the connectome nowadays using the up-to-date FAFB dataset, the analytical and visual tools (as in FlyWire), in combination with known anatomy/physiology/behavior in DM. I suggest that the authors provide more detail on hemilineages, their relationship to the FAB connectome, the predicted neurotransmitter identity, and the use of statistical CatMAID tools used in some of the Figures.</p>
<p>A graphical summary at the end of the study would be very useful to highlight the important findings focusing on neuron populations identified in this study and their position in the hypothesized parallel central circuitry of BMNs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors set out to extend their previous mapping of Drosophila head mechanosensory neurons (Eichler et al., 2024) by reconstructing their full second-order connectome. Their aim is to reveal how bristle mechanosensory neurons (BMNs) interface with excitatory and inhibitory partners to generate location-specific grooming movements, and to identify the circuit motifs and developmental lineages that support this transformation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of this work are clear. The authors present a comprehensive synaptic-resolution connectome for BMNs, identifying nearly all of their pre- and postsynaptic partners. This dataset reveals important circuit motifs:</p>
<p>(1) BMNs provide feedforward excitation to descending neurons, feedforward inhibition to interneurons, and are themselves strongly regulated by GABAergic presynaptic inhibition.</p>
<p>(2) These motifs together support the idea that BMN activity is locally gated and hierarchically suppressed, fitting well with known behavioural sequences of grooming.</p>
<p>(3) The study also shows that connectivity preserves somatotopy, such that BMNs from neighbouring bristle populations converge onto shared partners, while distant BMNs remain segregated.</p>
<p>(4) A developmental analysis reveals both primary and secondary partners, suggesting a layered scaffold plus adult-specific elaborations.</p>
<p>(5) Finally, the identification of hemilineage 23b (LB23) as a core postsynaptic pathway - incorporating previously described antennal grooming neurons (aBN2) - provides a striking link between developmental lineage, anatomical connectivity, and behavioral output.</p>
<p>(6) Together, the dataset represents a valuable resource for the neuroscience community and a foundation for future functional studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are also some weaknesses that mostly only limit clarity.</p>
<p>(1) The writing is dense, with results often presented in a cryptic fashion and the functional implications deferred to the discussion. As a result, the significance of circuit motifs such as BMN→motor or reciprocal inhibitory loops is sometimes buried, rather than highlighted when first described.</p>
<p>(2) Some assumptions require more explanation for non-specialist readers - for example, how bristle identity is inferred in EM in the absence of cuticular structures, or what is meant by &quot;ascending&quot; and &quot;descending&quot; in a dataset that does not include the ventral nerve cord. While some of this comes from the earlier paper, it would help readers of this one to explain this.</p>
<p>(3) Visualization choices also sometimes obscure key conclusions: network graphs can be visually appealing but do not clearly convey somatotopy or BMN-type differences; heatmaps or region-level matrices would make the parallel, block-like organization of the circuit more evident.</p>
<p>(4) The data might also speak to roles beyond grooming (e.g., mechanosensory modulation of posture or feeding), and a brief acknowledgement of this would broaden the impact.</p>
<p>(5) The restriction to one hemisphere should be explicitly acknowledged as a limitation when framing this as a 'comprehensive' connectome.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors achieve their main goal: they convincingly show that BMNs connect into parallel, somatotopically organized pathways, with LB23 providing a key lineage-based link from sensory input to grooming output. The dataset is carefully analyzed, and while the presentation could be streamlined, the connectome will be a valuable resource for researchers studying sensory processing, motor control, and the logic of circuit organization.</p>
