<title>Abstract</title>
<p>While physiologic stress has long been known to impair mammalian reproductive capacity through hormonal dysregulation, mounting evidence now suggests that stress experienced prior to or during gestation may also negatively impact the health of future offspring. Rodent models of gestational physiologic stress can induce neurologic and behavioral phenotypes that persist for up to three generations, suggesting that stress signals can induce lasting epigenetic changes in the germline. Treatment with glucocorticoid stress hormones is sufficient to recapitulate the transgenerational phenotypes seen in physiologic stress models. These hormones are known to bind and activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-inducible transcription factor, thus implicating GR-mediated signaling as a potential contributor to the transgenerational inheritance of stress-induced phenotypes. Here we demonstrate dynamic spatiotemporal regulation of GR expression in the mouse germline, showing expression in the fetal oocyte as well as the perinatal and adult spermatogonia. Functionally, we find that fetal oocytes are intrinsically buffered against changes in GR signaling, as neither genetic deletion of GR nor GR agonism with dexamethasone altered the transcriptional landscape or the progression of fetal oocytes through meiosis. In contrast, our studies revealed that the male germline is susceptible to glucocorticoid-mediated signaling, specifically by regulating RNA splicing within the spermatogonia, although this does not abrogate fertility. Together, our work suggests a sexually dimorphic function for GR in the germline, and represents an important step towards understanding the mechanisms by which stress can modulate the transmission of genetic information through the germline.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The impact of stress on mammalian reproductive capacity has long been appreciated. The hypothesis that psychological stress not only limits the ability to conceive, but may also impact the health of offspring has gained considerable attention in recent years. A growing body of work has demonstrated that rodent models of stress can induce a variety of neurologic and behavioral phenotypes that may persist across generations, even in generations unexposed to the initial stressor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The persistence of such phenotypes for up to three generations suggests that stress signals can induce lasting epigenetic changes in the germline. As the committed precursors of eggs and sperm established during early embryogenesis, germ cells are responsible for transmitting genetic as well as epigenetic information across generations. Perturbations of the messenger can potentially corrupt the transmission of this information, thus understanding the mechanism by which stress can lead to epigenetic alterations in the germline remains a crucial unanswered question.</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that treatment of rodents with synthetic glucocorticoid stress hormones is sufficient to recapitulate the transgenerational phenotypic inheritance seen in physiologic stress models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. These hormones are known to bind and activate nuclear hormone receptors such as glucocorticoid receptor (GR; encoded by the <italic>Nr3c1</italic> gene), thus implicating GR-mediated signaling in transgenerational inheritance of stress. The engagement of GR with its ligand in the cytoplasm promotes translocation to the nucleus where it then binds DNA response elements and recruits transcriptional cofactors to modulate target gene expression. As such, GR functions as a ligand-inducible transcription factor, allowing for robust changes to gene expression in response to stress hormones. While GR is known to be a potent transcriptional regulator in a wide variety of cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, its function in the cells of the gonad remains less clear.</p>
<p>Prior evidence for GR expression in the germ cells is sparse. In the adult mouse testis, one study suggested GR expression was limited to primary spermatocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, while others suggested that GR is expressed in both spermatogonia as well as spermatocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In humans, multiple studies have shown robust GR expression in differentiating spermatogonia, as well as low expression in primary spermatocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. In the female, a single study of the human fetal ovary found evidence for GR expression by IHC in the oocytes of a nine week old embryo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, although expression was heterogeneous across the tissue. A more recent study of mouse fetal oocyte development using single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed increasing expression of GR in the oocytes between E12.5 to E14.5 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Together these data suggest that GR may be expressed in the rodent / human germline, but in limited developmental windows. However, no studies to date have directly assessed the cell-intrinsic role of GR in the germ cells. While several publications describe a variety of defects to the male and female germline in response to glucocorticoid treatment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, it is unclear whether the phenotypes observed are due to the direct action of glucocorticoids on germ cells, or the indirect effects of systemic glucocorticoid treatment on hormone production by gonadal somatic cells and/or the hormone producing cells of the hypothalamus and pituitary.</p>
<p>Here, we characterized the expression of GR in the germline of the developing and adult mouse gonads, and determined the role of GR in normal germline formation and function. We discovered that GR is expressed in the female germline exclusively during fetal development, but absent from the adult oocyte. We demonstrated that the female germline is, surprisingly, resistant to changes in GR signaling. Negligible changes in transcription or meiotic progression of fetal oocytes resulted from either genetic deletion or agonism of GR with dexamethasone (dex), suggesting that the female germline is intrinsically buffered from changes in GR signaling. In contrast, we found that GR is expressed in pro-spermatogonia of the perinatal testis and spermatogonia of the adult testis, and transcriptomic analysis of germ cells from dex-treated males revealed a potential role of GR in regulating RNA splicing. Together our data confirm the dynamic spatiotemporal regulation of GR expression in both the male and female germ cells, and suggest a sexually dimorphic role for this receptor in the mammalian germline.</p>

<title>Spatiotemporal expression of GR and novel isoforms in fetal oocytes</title>
<p>To assess GR expression in the developing female germline, we performed immunofluorescence (IF) on mouse fetal ovaries ranging from embryonic day (E) 12.5 through E18.5. Female germ cells, identified by either Oct4-GFP (<italic>Pou5f1-ΔPE-eGFP</italic> transgene) or TRA98, showed robust levels of GR starting at E13.5, which waned as development progressed (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). GR consistently localized to the nucleus of fetal germ cells, irrespective of developmental stage, suggesting that GR may function as a transcription factor within the female germline (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). To rigorously quantify GR expression dynamics in germ cells, we normalized GR expression levels to DAPI signal at the individual cell level, using the membrane marker wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) for segmentation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1A</xref></bold>). These studies confirmed that GR expression in the germline decreased from E13.5 to E18.5 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>).</p>

Previously annotated exon 1 variants have been arbitrarily labeled as exons 1A through 1G (with exon 1A being closest to exon 2).

</fig>
<p>At postnatal day 0 (PN0), IF revealed a small number of oocytes at the cortex of the ovary with nuclear GR, with expression declining and virtually absent by PN2 (apart from sporadic cortical oocytes with cytoplasmic GR) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1B</xref></bold>). GR was not expressed in postnatal oocytes between PN5 and PN21, nor in adult oocytes of all follicular stages (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1C</xref></bold>). In the somatic compartment, GR was virtually absent from FOXL2<sup>+</sup> granulosa cells, but was strongly expressed in the theca cell layer (marked by α-SMA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>) from as early as PN7 through adulthood (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>It has been hypothesized that spatiotemporal differences in GR expression across different tissues can be due to the use of alternative, non-coding <italic>Nr3c1</italic> exon 1 splice isoforms in different cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. To explore this possibility, we looked for evidence of exon 1 alternative splicing in our paired-end RNA-seq data of E15.5 sorted Oct4-GFP<sup>+</sup> germ cells and GFP<sup>−</sup> somatic cells (see <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold> for details). Sashimi plots visualizing the junctions between exon 2 and known exon 1 variants demonstrated that while somatic cells exclusively use exon 1B, 1D and 1F, female germ cells use a much wider range of known exon 1 variants, including 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D and 1F (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). Surprisingly, we also found evidence of three novel splice isoforms exclusively in the germ cells, labeled here as predicted exons 1α, 1β, and 1γ (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>, blue lines). These cell type-specific patterns of exon 1 isoform usage were validated using RT-PCR on bulk and sorted populations, with primers designed specifically to amplify each of the known and predicted exon junctions (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). This wider diversity of <italic>Nr3c1</italic> exon 1 variants in the female germline suggests that alternative promoters may be cooperatively regulating the expression of GR, thus leading to the more dynamic temporal regulation of GR seen in the germline in comparison to the soma.</p>

<title>Genetic deletion of GR leads to minimal changes in the female germline</title>
<p>The strong, nuclear localization of GR in germ cells of the fetal ovary led us to hypothesize that GR may be functioning as a transcriptional regulator of early oocyte development. This possibility was raised in a single-cell RNA-seq study of the developing mouse ovary that noted that GR expression is highly correlated with progression of fetal oocytes through prophase I <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In zebrafish, genetic ablation of GR led to accelerated ovarian aging and decline in fertility later in life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. To interrogate the potential role of GR in meiosis, we utilized a mouse line with a constitutive genetic deletion of GR. <italic>Nr3c1</italic> exon 3 floxed mice were crossed to a constitutive β-actin Cre mouse line to generate a constitutive null allele of GR (henceforth referred to as “KO”). <italic>Nr3c1</italic> exon 3 deletion has previously been shown to result in efficient loss of functional GR protein (reviewed extensively elsewhere <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>), which we confirmed by IF at E17.5 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>), immunoblot at E13.5 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>), and qRT-PCR at E15.5 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). To functionally test whether meiotic progression was delayed or disrupted following loss of GR, we scored meiotic prophase I in spreads for E15.5 WT and KO ovaries stained for SYCP3, SYCP1 and γH2AX (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). No significant changes in substage distribution could be detected between WT and KO nuclei, suggesting that loss of GR does not disrupt meiotic progression. qRT-PCR on E15.5 WT and KO bulk ovary tissue for a panel of genes known to have important roles in meiotic progression similarly revealed no changes in the transcription of meiotic genes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To assess whether GR regulates the transcriptional landscape of alternative cellular pathways in the female germline, we employed two orthogonal transcriptomic approaches. We first performed low-input RNA-seq on FACS-sorted Oct4-GFP<sup>+</sup> germ cells from individual WT and KO ovaries at E17.5. While our differential gene expression analysis pipeline revealed robust expression differences between WT female and WT male germ cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F, i</xref></bold>), we saw no statistically significant differentially expressed genes between female WT and KO germ cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F, ii</xref></bold>). Conditional deletion of GR specifically in the germ cells using <italic>Oct4-CreERT2</italic> yielded the same result (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F, iii</xref></bold>). In tandem, we performed single-cell RNA-seq on E15.5 WT and KO germ cells. All expected cell types of the fetal ovary were detected in both WT and KO embryos (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2A</xref></bold>), and total <italic>Nr3c1</italic> transcript was depleted in all cell types of the ovary (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2B</xref></bold>). Differential gene expression analysis of WT and KO cells within the germ cell cluster revealed an extremely low number of differentially expressed genes with minor fold changes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2C</xref>)</bold>, corroborating our bulk RNA-seq results that the loss of GR has little effect on the transcriptional landscape of fetal oocytes.</p>

<title>Developing ovarian somatic cells, but not germ cells, show GR transcriptional activation following exogenous glucocorticoid treatment</title>
<p>While homeostatic GR signaling does not appear to regulate fetal oocyte gene expression or meiotic progression, we next asked whether the GR agonist dexamethasone (dex) could elicit a transcriptional response in the female germline. Pregnant dams were administered either 10 μg dex / g or saline vehicle by intraperitoneal (IP) injection daily from E12.5 to E15.5, coinciding with the window of highest GR expression in the female germline. We validated this dosing regimen by sufficiency to induce expression of the canonical GR response gene <italic>Fkbp5</italic> in bulk ovary, testis, and lung tissue of E15.5 embryos (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3A</xref></bold>), confirming dex was able to transit the placenta to the embryos. Accordingly, we performed bulk RNA-seq on sorted Oct4-GFP<sup>+</sup> germ cells and total GFP<sup>−</sup> somatic cells from E15.5 ovaries of dex vs saline-treated dams. While the somatic cells showed a robust transcriptional response following dex treatment (1477 total differential genes with adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05), by comparison, the response was severely dampened in germ cells (156 total differential genes with adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05; <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). GO term analysis of differentially expressed genes from the somatic cells showed low fold enrichment across a wide range of unrelated categories, likely due to the heterogeneity of the GFP<sup>−</sup> population (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3B</xref></bold>). The set of upregulated (i.e. dex-induced) genes in the germ cells did not show any significant GO term enrichment (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3B</xref></bold>).

<title>GR in fetal oocytes relocalizes in response to ligand, but resistance to glucocorticoid signaling cannot be explained by the presence of inhibitory isoforms</title>
<p>The observed lack of a transcriptional response in the germ cells to both deletion of GR and dex treatment in contrast to adjacent somatic cells led us to hypothesize that the female germline may be resistant to GR signaling. As the function of GR as a transcription factor requires nuclear localization, we tested whether its subcellular localization is altered in response to ligand. In ovaries cultured <italic>ex vivo</italic> without dex, GR localized to the cytoplasm of virtually all germ cells; in contrast, dex-treated cultures retained nuclear localization similar to fetal oocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, ii</xref></bold>). As GR localization still dynamically responded to the presence or absence of ligand, despite not robustly altering transcription, an alternative modification to the GR protein specifically in the germ cells could be accounting for this attenuated activity.</p>
<p>GR is a highly modified protein, with a wide range of transcriptional isoforms, translational isoforms, and post-translational modifications described to date <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Multiple translation initiation sites in the <italic>Nr3c1</italic> gene lead to a variety of protein isoforms with varying truncations in the regulatory N-terminal domain of the protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. The most truncated forms of GR (the “GR-D” isoforms) can exert an inhibitory dominant negative effect <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. We used an antibody designed specifically to recognize all known GR isoforms to immunoblot E13.5 ovary lysate but did not detect any GR-D isoforms (∼50 kDa or less), confirming that this dominant negative isoform is not the cause of decreased GR activity in the germline (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). In mice, alternative splicing and subsequent retention of <italic>Nr3c1</italic> intron 8 results in a GRβ isoform that functions as a dominant negative regulator of the predominant GRα isoform <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. However, we saw no evidence of intron 8 retention in our paired-end RNA-seq reads (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>), suggesting that the GRβ isoform is also not the cause of attenuated GR activity in fetal oocytes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The growing evidence that stress-induced phenotypes can persist across multiple generations has sparked considerable interest in understanding the mechanisms by which stress can act on the germline. Our efforts to characterize the role of GR-mediated signaling in male and female germ cells represent an important step in understanding the germ cell intrinsic effects that stress hormones can play on the integrity of the germline and subsequent transmission of genetic information across generations. In this study, we confirmed that germ cells of the testis and the ovary both show dynamic temporal regulation of GR expression over fetal and adult development, with distinct sex-specific differences in expression. We demonstrated that in the context of pharmacologic activation or genetic deletion of GR, fetal oocytes show minimal transcriptional changes and no significant changes in progression through meiotic prophase I, suggesting that the fetal oocytes are somehow resistant to changes in GR signaling. In contrast, we show that prospermatogonia downregulate genes important for RNA splicing in response to GR activation, suggesting a potential role for stress signaling in regulating transcript diversity in the male germline. Together, our work demonstrates a sexually dimorphic response to GR signaling within the germline, and suggests alternative mechanisms by which the male and female germline may be differentially affected by stress.</p>

<p>Our time course of GR expression in the fetal ovary revealed a peak in GR expression in E13.5 fetal oocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>), a result highly consistent with a scRNA-seq study that found GR was expressed in the developing oocytes (at both the transcript and protein level) between E12.5 to E14.5 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.

We also observed that in both the testis and ovary, GR is expressed just prior to the onset of meiotic initiation in male and female germ cells.

<title>The female germline is insulated from changes in GR-mediated signaling</title>
<p>Given that GR is a potent transcription factor with a wide variety of functions across cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, it was striking to find that both complete genetic deletion of GR and robust pharmacologic activation led to minimal changes in the transcriptional landscape of the female germline (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref></bold>). Furthermore, the robust response of the ovarian soma, yet not of the germ cells, to dex administration between E12.5 - E15.5 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>) indicated that this was not a technical artifact, and instead suggested that the transcriptional response to changes in GR signaling was buffered in the cellular context of fetal oogonia. This is an interesting premise, as it may be advantageous for the germ cells to evolve protection against rampant GR-induced transcriptional changes in response to stress hormones experienced during gestation. Why the female germline has retained temporally restricted expression of GR given its apparent lack of a functional role, however, remains unclear. We have shown there is no evidence for inhibitory isoforms of GR, including both known truncated protein isoforms, as well as the GRβ transcriptional isoform (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref></bold>). We did, however, observe that GR is able to change its subcellular localization in response to ligand (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, ii</xref></bold>), suggesting that the ligand binding and nuclear translocation abilities of GR remain intact despite this attenuated function in female germ cells.</p>
<p>A possible mechanism for insulating fetal germ cells from response to GR signaling involves post-translational modifications (PTMs) to the receptor that could interfere with its ability to bind DNA, interact with other transcription factors, or recruit other cofactors required for its transcriptional activity. While a wide variety of PTMs to GR have been documented <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, the limiting number of germ cells that can be obtained from the fetal ovary has made the detection of these PTMs via biochemical methods difficult. One particular PTM of interest is acetylation of GR by the circadian histone acetyltransferase protein, CLOCK. Acetylation of lysines within the hinge region of GR by CLOCK has been shown to result in normal ligand binding and nuclear translocation, but a complete loss of the ability of GR to both activate and repress transcription <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>, very similar to what is seen in fetal oocytes. Interestingly, our single-cell RNA-seq data shows a strong enrichment for <italic>Clock</italic> expression in the germ cells in comparison to the soma (data not shown), further bolstering the idea that CLOCK could acetylate and inactivate GR specifically in the germ cells. Further biochemical analyses will be required to determine whether GR is being modified in this manner, or by any other PTMs.</p>

<title>GR in the regulation of RNA splicing in the male germline</title>
<p>In contrast to the lack of dex-induced transcriptional changes in the female germ cells, the male germline showed a considerable transcriptional response to dex treatment at PN1 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). While the somatic cells of the testis showed a more stereotyped glucocorticoid response with induction of canonical GR response genes such as <italic>Tsc22d3</italic>, <italic>Klf9</italic>, and <italic>Per1</italic>, germ cells did not show changes in these canonical genes.

To our knowledge, this is the first time GR has been implicated in regulating the expression of genes involved in RNA splicing.

Both chronic stress and dex administration have been shown to inhibit testosterone production by Leydig cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>, and given that testosterone is essential for regulating spermatogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>, it was not possible with current tools to tease apart the cell intrinsic effects of dex administration and GR activation specifically in spermatogonia. Future studies using transgenic overexpression of GR in the spermatogonia could address this effect of elevated GR signaling on fertility.</p>

<title>Implications for understanding sex-specific differences in the transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of stress induced phenotypes</title>
<p>Together, our work demonstrates that the male and female germline have differential susceptibilities to GR signaling, which may have important implications for understanding sex-specific differences in the transgenerational inheritance of stress induced phenotypes. In this study, we observed that the male germline shows a robust transcriptional response to GR signaling in comparison to the attenuated response of the female, which may suggest that the male germline is inherently more vulnerable to GR-mediated stress signals. In fact, multiple studies have shown a more pronounced transmission of stress-induced and glucocorticoid-induced phenotypes through the paternal lineage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>, leading to the hypothesis that epigenetic changes to the sperm are a likely causative factor. While it has been shown that some histone modifications such as H3K4me3 can be transmitted transgenerationally through sperm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>, there is also a growing body of evidence demonstrating that regulation of non-coding RNA within the sperm is potentially a major mechanism through which the stress-induced phenotypes are transmitted <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>. Our finding that dex-mediated agonism of GR activity in male germ cells leads to an alteration in RNA splicing could represent a mechanism by which stress hormones alter the transcriptional milieu within the spermatogonia, impacting the overall RNA landscape within the germline. Future studies looking into the effect of GR signaling specifically on small non-coding RNAs will be imperative as we attempt to further elucidate the germ cell intrinsic impact of stress hormones on the germline and subsequent transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.</p>

In summary, final cell suspensions were loaded onto the 10X Chromium microfluidics chip along with reaction master mix, partitioning oil, and Single-Cell 3’ v3 Gel Beads in order to generate Gel Beads-in-emulsion (GEMs) containing individual cells. RT reactions were performed within individual GEMs to generate cell-barcoded full-length cDNA, followed by GEM breakdown, cDNA pooling, cDNA PCR amplification, cleanup, and QC. Amplified cDNA was enzymatically fragmented, end repaired, A-tailed, size selected, and ligated with adapters. Following a sample indexing PCR reaction and final size selection, sample libraries were pooled, QC’ed, and sequenced on an Illumina NovoSeq 6000 platform. Resulting paired-end sequencing reads were processed using the 10X Cell Ranger software to generate feature-barcode matrices.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All single-cell RNA-seq data processing was performed in house using Seurat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup> v3.2.3. Count matrices for both WT and KO conditions were read into Seurat to create Seurat Objects, and were then filtered as follows: WT: { nFeature_RNA: 1500 – 6500 // nCount_RNA: 5500 – 40000 // % mitochondria: &lt; 10% }; KO: { nFeature_RNA: 1200 – 5500 // nCount_RNA: 3000 – 30000 // % mitochondria: &lt; 10% }. Both WT and KO Seurat objects were combined using the “merge” function, and the resulting objects were processed for dimensional reduction using the standard Seurat workflow using the following functions: NormalizeData, FindVariableFeatures, ScaleData, RunPCA, RunUMAP, FindNeighbors, and FindClusters. During ScaleData, the following variables were regressed out: nFeature_RNA, nCount_RNA, percent.mito, and percent.ribo. The cell type identities of each cluster were determined by comparing top cluster markers to a previously annotated list E16.5 ovarian cell type specific markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>. Pairwise differential gene expression analyses were performed between WT and KO cells independently for each of the main cell type clusters (germ, theca, granulosa, and epithelia) using the FindMarkers function using the default Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Genes with an adjusted p-value less than 0.05 and a log fold change greater than 0.25 were considered significant.</p>

<title>Sample preparation</title>
<p>To generate embryos homozygous for the GR knockout allele (GR<sup>KO/KO</sup>), heterozygous females (GR<sup>KO/+</sup>) were crossed to heterozygous males also carrying an Oct4-GFP transgene (GR<sup>KO/+</sup> ; Tg:Oct4<sup>GFP/GFP</sup>) to facilitate FACS sorting of germ cells. Pregnant dams were dissected the morning of E17.5, and tail clips were taken from each embryo to determine GR genotype. Fetal ovaries were dissected on ice, the mesonephroi removed, and the ovaries were digested for FACS sorting as described above. Tg:Oct4-GFP<sup>+</sup> germ cells from individual embryo ovary pairs were FACS sorted directly in QIAgen RLT+ buffer and stored at -80 until ready for RNA extractions as outlined above. To generate embryos with a conditional deletion of GR (GR<sup>cKO/cKO</sup>), females homozygous for an exon 3 floxed GR allele (GR<sup>flox/flox</sup>) were crossed to similar males that were also heterozygous for the germ cell specific Oct4<sup>CreERT2</sup> allele (GR<sup>flox/flox</sup> ; Oct4<sup>CreERT2/+</sup> ; Tg:Oct4<sup>GFP/GFP</sup>). Pregnant dams were injected at E10.5 with 125 μg / g tamoxifen to induce recombination and deletion of GR exon 3 specifically in the germ cells. Pregnant dams were dissected the morning of E17.5 and processed for FACS sorting as described for GR<sup>KO/KO</sup> females above.</p>

<title>Library Preparation and Sequencing</title>
<p>All library preparations and sequencing were performed by the University of California, Davis DNA Technologies &amp; Expression Analysis Core. Gene expression profiling was carried out using a 3’ Tag-RNA-Seq protocol. Barcoded sequencing libraries were prepared using the QuantSeq 3’ mRNA-Seq Library Prep FWD kit (Lexogen) for multiplexed sequencing according to the manufacturer recommendations. The library fragment size distribution was determined using microcapillary gel electrophoresis on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent), and libraries were quantified using a Qubit fluorometer (LifeTechnologies). Final libraries were pooled in equimolar ratios and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000.</p>

<p>This work reports a <bold>valuable</bold> finding on glucocorticoid signaling in male and female germ cells in mice, pointing out sexual dimorphism in transcriptomic responsiveness. The <bold>convincing</bold> evidence provided supports an inert GR signaling despite the presence of GR in the female germline and GR-mediated alternative splicing in response to dexamethasone treatment in the male germline. The work may interest basic researchers and physician-scientists working on reproduction and stress-related disease conditions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Cincotta et al set out to investigate the presence of glucocorticoid receptors in the male and female embryonic germline. They further investigate the impact of tissue specific genetically induced receptor absence and/or systemic receptor activation on fertility and RNA regulation. They are motivated by several lines of research that report inter and transgenerational effects of stress and or glucocorticoid receptor activation and suggest that their findings provide an explanatory mechanism to mechanistically back parental stress hormone exposure induced phenotypes in the offspring.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- A chronological immunofluorescent assessment of GR in fetal and early life oocyte and sperm development.</p>
<p>
- RNA seq data that reveal novel cell type specific isoforms validated by q-RT PCR E15.5 in the oocyte.</p>
<p>
- 2 alternative approaches to knock out GR to study transcriptional outcomes. Oocytes: systemic GR KO (E17.5) with low input 3-tag seq and germline specific GR KO (E15.5) on fetal oocyte expression via 10X single cell seq and 3-cap sequencing on sorted KO versus WT oocytes - both indicating little impact on polyadenylated RNAs -</p>
<p>
- 2 alternative approaches to assess the effect of GR activation in vivo (systemic) and ex vivo (ovary culture): here the RNA seq did show again some changes in germ cells and many in the soma.</p>
<p>
- They exclude oocyte specific GR signaling inhibition via beta isoforms</p>
<p>
- Perinatal male germline shows differential splicing regulation in response to systemic Dex administration, results were backed up with q-PCR analysis of splicing factors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Sequencing techniques used are not Total RNA but either are focused on all polyA transcripts (10x) - effects on non-polyA-transcripts are left unexplored.</p>
<p>
The number of replicates in the low input seq is very low and hence this might be underpowered. Since Dex treatment showed some (modest) changes in oocyte RNA effects of GR depletion might only become apparent upon Dex treatment as an interaction. Meaning GR activation in the presence of GR shows changes, upon GR depletion those changes are abolished --&gt; statistically speaking an interaction --&gt; conclusion: there are germline GR effects that get abolished when there is no GR hinting on germline GR autonomous effects.</p>
<p>
- Effects in oocytes following systemic Dex might be indirect due to GR activation in the soma. The changes observed might be irrelevant to meiosis and thus in the manuscript are deemed irrelevant, but they could still lead to settle consequences. in other terms.</p>
<p>Even though ex vivo culture of ovaries shows GR translocation to nucleus it is not sure whether the in vivo systemic administration does the same. The authors argue in their rebuttal that GR is already nuclear in fetal oocytes hence the</p>
<p>
conclusion that fetal oocytes are resistant to GR manipulation is understandable, at least for the readouts that were considered. Yet the question arises: If GR is already nuclear (active) in the absence of additional Dex treatment why does GR knock out not elicit any changes in the considered readouts -&gt; what are we missing.</p>
<p>This work is a good reference point for researchers interested in glucocorticoid hormone signaling fertility and RNA splicing. It might spark further studies on germline-specific GR functions and the impact of GR activation on alternative splicing.</p>
<p>
The study provides a characterization of GR and some aspects of GR perturbation, and the negative findings in this study do help to rule out a range of specific roles of GR in the germline. This will help the study of unexplored options. The authors do acknowledge the unexplored options in their discussion.</p>
<p>
The intro of the study eludes to implications for intergenerational effects via epigenetic modifications in the germline and points out additional potential indirect effects of reproductive tissue GR signaling on the germline. Future studies might hence focus on further exploration of epigenetic modifications and/or indirect effects.</p>

<p>eLife assessment
This work reports a valuable finding on glucocorticoid signaling in male and female germ cells in mice, pointing out sexual dimorphism in transcriptomic responsiveness. While the evidence supporting the claims is generally solid, additional assessments would be required to fully confirm an inert GR signaling despite the presence of GR in the female germline and
GR-mediated alternative splicing in response to dexamethasone treatment in the male germline. The work may interest basic researchers and physician-scientists working on reproduction and</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Cincotta et al set out to investigate the presence of glucocorticoid receptors in the male and female embryonic germline. They further investigate the impact of tissue-specific genetically induced receptor absence and/or systemic receptor activation on fertility and RNA regulation. They are motivated by several lines of research that report inter and transgenerational effects of stress and or glucocorticoid receptor activation and suggest that their findings provide an explanatory mechanism to mechanistically back parental stress hormone exposure-induced phenotypes in the offspring.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A chronological immunofluorescent assessment of GR in fetal and early life oocyte and sperm development.</p>
<p>RNA seq data that reveal novel cell type specific isoforms validated by q-RT PCR E15.5 in the oocyte.</p>

<p>Perinatal male germline shows differential splicing regulation in response to systemic Dex administration, results were backed up with q-PCR analysis of splicing factors.
Weaknesses:</p>
<p>COMMENT #1: The presence of a protein cannot be entirely excluded based on IF data</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that very low levels of GR could escape the detection by IF and confocal imaging. We feel that our IF data do match transcript data in our validation studies of the GR KO using (1) qRT-PCR on fetal ovary in Fig 2E and (2) scRNA-seq in germ cells and ovarian soma in Fig S2B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>COMMENT #2: (staining of spermatids is referred to but not shown).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>You are correct that this statement was based on a morphological identification of spermatids using DAPI morphology. We have performed a co-stain for GR with the spermatocyte marker SYCP3, and the spermatid/spermatozoa marker PNA (Peanut Agglutinin; from Arachis hypogaea) in adult testis tissue. We have updated Figure 4D to reflect this change, as well as the corresponding text in the Results section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>COMMENT #3: The authors do not consider post-transcriptional level a) modifications also triggered by GR activation b) non-coding RNAs (not assessed by seq).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this very important point about potential post-transcriptional (non-genomic) effects of GR in the fetal oocyte. We agree that while our RNA-seq results show only a minimal transcriptional response, we cannot rule out a non-canonical signaling function of GR, such as the regulation of cellular kinases (as reviewed elsewhere1), or the regulation of non coding RNAs at the post-transcriptional level, and we have amended the discussion to include a sentence on this point. However, while we fully acknowledge the possibility of GR regulating non-genomic level cellular signaling, we chose not to explore this option further based on the lack of any overall functional effect on meiotic progression when GR signaling was perturbed- either by KO (Figure 2D) or dex-mediated activation (Figure S3C).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>COMMENT #4: Sequencing techniques used are not total RNA but either are focused on all polyA transcripts (10x) or only assess the 3' prime end and hence are not ideal to study splicing</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this concern, however this statement is not correct and we have clarified this point in the Results section to explain how the sequencing libraries of the male germ cell RNA-seq were prepared. We agree that certain sequencing techniques (such as 3’ Tag-Seq) that generate sequencing libraries from a limited portion of an entire transcript molecule are not appropriate for analysis of differential splicing. This was not the case, however, for the RNA-seq libraries prepared on our male germ cells treated with dexamethasone. These libraries were constructed using full length transcripts that were reverse transcribed using random hexamer priming, thus accounting for sequencing coverage across the full transcript length. As a result, this type of library prep technique should be sufficient for capturing differential splicing events along the length of the transcript. We do, however, point out that these libraries were constructed on polyA-enriched transcripts. Thus while we obtained full length transcript coverage for these polyA transcripts, any differential splicing taking place in non poly-adenylated RNA moieties were not captured. While we are excited about the possibility of exploring GR-mediated splicing regulation of other RNA species in the future, we chose to focus the scope of our current study on polyA mRNA molecules specifically.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>COMMENT #5: The number of replicates in the low input seq is very low and hence this might be underpowered</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While the number of replicates (n=3-4 per condition) is sufficient for performing statistical analysis of a standard RNA-seq experiment, we do acknowledge and agree with the reviewer that low numbers of FACS-sorted germ cells from individual embryos combined with the low input 3’ Tag-Seq technique could have led to higher sample variability than desired. Given that we validated our bulk RNA-seq analysis of GR knockout ovaries using an orthogonal single-cell RNA-seq approach, we feel that our conclusions regarding a lack of transcriptional changes upon GR deletion remain valid.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>COMMENT #6: Since Dex treatment showed some (modest) changes in oocyte RNA - effects of GR depletion might only become apparent upon Dex treatment as an interaction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We may be missing the nuance of this point, but our interpretation of an effect that is seen only when the KO is treated with Dex would be that the mechanism would not be autonomous in germ cells but indirect or off-target.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>COMMENT #7: Effects in oocytes following systemic Dex might be indirect due to GR activation in the soma.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As both the oocytes and ovarian soma express GR during the window of dex administration, we agree that it is possible that the few modest changes seen in the oocyte transcriptome are the result of indirect effects following robust GR signaling in the somatic compartment. However, given that these modest oocyte transcript changes in response to dex treatment did not significantly alter the ability of oocytes to progress through meiosis, we chose not to explore this mechanism further.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>COMMENT #8: Even though ex vivo culture of ovaries shows GR translocation to the nucleus it is not sure whether the in vivo systemic administration does the same.</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>The conclusion that fetal oocytes are resistant to GR manipulation is very strong, given that &quot;only&quot; poly A sequencing and few replicates of 3-prime sequencing have been analyzed and information is lacking on whether GR is activated in germ cells in the systemically dex-injected animals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>If we understand correctly, the first part refers to a technical limitation and the second part takes issue with our interpretation of the data. For the former, we appreciate this astute insight on the conundrum of detecting a response to systemic dex in fetal oocytes, which is generally monitored by nuclear translocation of GR. As shown in Figure 1A and 1B, GR localization is overwhelmingly nuclear in fetal oocytes of WT animals at E13.5 without addition of any dex. We could not, therefore, use GR translocation as a proxy for activation in response to dex treatment. We instead used ex vivo organ culture to monitor localization changes, as we were able to maintain fetal ovaries ex vivo in hormone-depleted and ligand negative conditions. As shown in Fig. 3, these defined culture conditions elicited a shift of GR to the cytoplasm of fetal oocytes. This led us to conclude that GR is capable of translocating between nucleus and cytoplasm in fetal oocytes, and we were able to counteract this loss in nuclear localization by providing dex ligand in the media.</p>
<p>We feel that our conclusion that oocytes are resistant to manipulation of glucocorticoid signaling despite their possession of the receptor and capacity for nuclear translocation is substantiated by multiple results: meiotic phenotyping, bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq analysis of both GR KO and dex dosed mice. Our basis for testing the timing and fidelity of meiotic prophase I was the coincident onset of GR expression in female germ cells at E13, and the disappearance of GR in neonatal oocytes as they enter meiotic arrest. The lack of transcriptional changes observed in oocytes in response to dex has made it even more challenging to demonstrate a bona fide “activation” of GR. Observation of a dose-dependent induction of the canonical GR response gene Fkbp5 in the somatic cells of the fetal ovary (Figure S3A and 3A) affirmed that dex traverses the placenta. We agree with the reviewer that it remains possible that dex or GR KO could lead to changes in epigenetic marks or small RNAs in oocytes, and have mentioned these possibilities in the discussion, but we note that even epigenetic perturbations during oocyte development such as the loss of Tet1 or Dnmt1 result in measurable changes in the transcriptome and the timing of meiotic prophase 2–4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>COMMENT #9: This work is a good reference point for researchers interested in glucocorticoid hormone signaling fertility and RNA splicing. It might spark further studies on germline-specific GR functions and the impact of GR activation on alternative splicing. While the study provides a characterization of GR and some aspects of GR perturbation, and the negative findings in this study do help to rule out a range of specific roles of GR in the germline, there is still a range of other potential unexplored options. The introduction of the study eludes to implications for intergenerational effects via epigenetic modifications in the germline, however, it does not mention that the indirect effects of reproductive tissue GR signaling on the germline have indeed already been described in the context of intergenerational effects of stress.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises an excellent point that we have not made sufficient distinction in our manuscript between prior studies of gestational stress and preconception stress and the light that our work may shed on those findings. We have revised the introduction to clarify this difference, and added reference to an outstanding study that identifies glucocorticoid-induced changes to microRNA cargo of extracellular vesicles shed by epididymal epithelial cells that when transferred to mature sperm can induce changes in the HPA axis and brain of offspring 5. Interestingly, this GR-mediated effect in the epididymal epithelial cells concurs with our observation in the adult testis that GR can be detected only cKit+ spermatogonia but not in subsequent stages of spermatids.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>COMMENT #10: Also, the study does not assess epigenetic modifications.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that exploring the role of GR in regulating epigenetic modifications within the germline is an area of extreme interest given the potential links between stress and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. As this is a broader topic that requires a more thorough and comprehensive set of experiments, we have intentionally chosen to keep this work separate from the current study, and hope to expand upon this topic in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>COMMENT #11: The conclusion that the persistence of a phenotype for up to three generations suggests that stress can induce lasting epigenetic changes in the germline is misleading. For the reader who is unfamiliar with the field, it is important to define much more precisely what is referred to as &quot;a phenotype&quot;. Furthermore, this statement evokes the impression that the very same epigenetic changes in the germline have been observed across multiple generations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We see how this may be misleading, and we have amended the text of the introduction and discussion accordingly to avoid the use of the term “phenotype”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>COMMENT #12: The evidence of the presence of GR in the germline is also somewhat limited - since other studies using sequencing have detected GR in the mature oocyte and sperm.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described above in response to Comment #2, we have included immunostaining of adult testis in a revised Figure 4D and shown that we detect GR in PLZF+ and cKIT+ spermatogonia. We also show low/minimal expression in some (SYCP3+) early meiotic spermatocytes, but not in (Lectin+) spermatids. We are not aware of any studies that have shown expression of GR protein in the mature oocyte.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>COMMENT #13: The discussion ends again on the implications of sex-specific differences of GR signaling in the context of stress-induced epigenetic inheritance. It states that the observed differences might relate to the fact that there is more evidence for paternal lineage findings, without considering that maternal lineage studies in epigenetic inheritance are generally less prevalent due to some practical factors - such as more laborious study design making use of cross-fostering or embryo transfer.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this valid point, and we have amended the discussion section.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>There is increasing evidence in the literature that rodent models of stress can produce phenotypes that persist through multiple generations. Nevertheless, the mechanism(s) by which stress exposure produces phenotypes are unknown in the directly affected individual as well as in subsequent offspring that did not directly experience stress. Moreover, it has also been shown that glucocorticoid stress hormones can recapitulate the effects of programmed stress. In this manuscript, the authors test the compelling hypothesis that glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-signaling is responsible for the transmission of phenotypes across generations. As a first step, the investigators test for a role of GR in the male and female germline. Using knockouts and GR agonists, they show that although germ cells in male and female mice have GR that appears to localize to the nucleus when stimulated, oocytes are resistant to changes in GR levels. In contrast, the male germline exhibits changes in splicing but no overt changes in fertility.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Although many of the results in this manuscript are negative, this is a careful and timely study that informs additional work to address mechanisms of transmission of stress phenotypes across generations and suggests a sexually dimorphic response to glucocorticoids in the germline. The work presented here is well-done and rigorous and the discussion of the data is thoughtful. Overall, this is an important contribution to the literature.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>RECOMMENDATION #1: To assess whether in females the systemic Dex administration directly activates GR in oocytes it would be great to assess GR activation following Dex administration, and ideally to see the effects abolished when Dex is administered to germline-specific KO animals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In regard to the recommendation to assess GR activation in response to systemic dex administration, we refer the reviewer back to our response in Comment #8 highlighting the difficulties defining and measuring GR activation in the germline.</p>
<p>This therefore has made it difficult to assess whether any of the modest effects seen in response to dex are abolished in our germline-specific KO animals. While repeating our RNA-seq experiment in dex-dosed germline KO animals would address whether the ~60 genes induced in oocytes are the result of oocyte-intrinsic GR activity, we have decided not to explore this mechanism further due to the overall lack of a functional effect on meiotic progression in response to dex (Figure S3C).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>RECOMMENDATION #2: To further strengthen the link between GR and alternative splicing it would be great to see the dex administration experiment repeated in germline specific GR KO's.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we understand the reviewer’s suggestion to explore whether deletion of GR in the spermatogonia is sufficient to abrogate the dex-mediated decreases in splice factor expression, we chose not to explore the details of this mechanism given that deletion of GR in the male germline does not impair fertility (Figure 6).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>RECOMMENDATION #3: I am wondering how much a given reduction in one of the splicing factors indeed affects splicing events. Can the authors relate this to literature, or maybe an in vitro experiment can be done to see whether the level of differential splicing events detected is in a range that can be expected in the case of the magnitude of splicing factor reduction?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It has been shown in many instances in the literature that a full genetic deletion of a single splice factor leads to impairments in spermatogenesis, and ultimately infertility 6–16. We suspect that dex treatment leads to fewer differential splicing events than a full splice factor deletion, given that dex treatment causes a broader decrease in splice factor expression without entirely abolishing any single splice factor. We have amended the discussion section to include this point. While we share the reviewer’s curiosity to compare the effects of dex vs genetic deletion of splicing machinery on the overall magnitude of differential splicing events, we unfortunately do not have access to mice with a floxed splice factor at this time. While we have considered knocking out one or more splice factors in an ex vivo cultured testis to compare alongside dex treatment, our efforts to date have proven unsuccessful due to high cell death upon culture of the postnatal testis for more than 24 hours.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>RECOMMENDATION #4: It is unclear from the methods whether in germline-specific KO's also the controls received tamoxifen.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for catching this missing piece of information. All control embryos that were assessed received an equivalent dose of tamoxifen to the germline-specific KO embryos. The only difference between cKOs and controls was the presence of the Cre transgene. We have updated the Materials and Methods 3’ Tag-Seq sample preparation section to include the sentence: “Both GRcKO/cKO and control GRflox/flox embryos were collected from tamoxifen-injected dams, and thus were equally exposed to tamoxifen in utero”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I just have only a few comments/questions.</p>
<p>RECOMMENDATION #5: It is somewhat surprising that GR is expressed in female germ cells, yet there doesn't seem to be a requirement. Is there any indication of what it does? Is the long-term stability of the germline compromised?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these questions, and we agree that it was quite surprising to find a lack of GR function in the female germline despite its robust expression. The question of whether loss of GR affects the long-term stability of the female germline is interesting, given that similar work in GR KO zebrafish has shown impairments to female reproductive capacity, yet only upon aging 17–19.</p>
<p>While we have shared interest in this question, technical limitations thus far have prevented us from properly assessing the effect of GR loss in aged females. Homozygous deletion of GR results in embryonic lethality at approximately E17.5. Conditional deletion of GR using Oct4-CreERT2 with a single dose of tamoxifen (2.5 mg / 20g mouse) at E9.5 results in complete deletion of GR by E10.5, although dams consistently suffer from dystocia and are no longer able to deliver viable pups. While using the more active tamoxifen metabolite (4OHT) at 0.1 mg / 20g has allowed for successful delivery, the resulting deletion rate is very poor (see qPCR results in panel below, left). While using half the dose of standard tamoxifen (1.25 mg / 20g mouse) at E9.5 has on rare occasions led to a successful delivery, the resulting recombination efficiency is insufficient (Author response image 1 right panel).</p>
<fig id="sa2fig1">
<label>Author response image 1.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-90164-sa2-fig1.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>While a Blimp1-Cre conditional KO model was used to assess male fertility on GR deletion, we believe this model may not be ideal for studying fertility in the context of aging. While Blimp1-Cre is highly specific to the germ cells within the gonad, there are many cell types outside of the gonad that express Blimp1, including the skin and certain cells of the immune system. It is unclear, particularly over the course of aging, whether any effects on fertility seen would be due to an oocyte-intrinsic effect, or the result of GR loss elsewhere in the body. While we hope to explore the role of GR in the aging oocyte further using alternative Cre models in the future, this is currently outside the scope of this work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>RECOMMENDATION #6: Figure 5b: what is the left part of that panel? Is it the same volcano plot for germ cells as shown in part a but with splicing factors?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize if this panel was unclear. Yes, the left panel of Figure 5B is in fact the same volcano plot in 5A, labeled with splicing factors instead of top genes. We have edited Figure 5B and corresponding figure legend to clarify this.</p>
