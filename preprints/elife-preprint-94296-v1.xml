<title>Abstract</title><p>Perception can be highly dependent on stimulus context, but whether and how sensory areas encode the context remains uncertain. We used an ambiguous auditory stimulus - a tritone pair - to investigate the neural activity associated with a preceding contextual stimulus that strongly influenced the tritone pair’s perception: either as an ascending or a descending step in pitch.</p>
<p>We recorded single-unit responses from a population of auditory cortical cells in awake ferrets listening to the tritone pairs preceded by the contextual stimulus. We find that the responses adapt locally to the contextual stimulus, consistent with human MEG recordings from the auditory cortex under the same conditions. Decoding the population responses demonstrates that pitch-change selective cells are able to predict well the context-sensitive percept of the tritone pairs. Conversely, decoding the <italic>distances</italic> between the pitch representations predicts the <italic>opposite</italic> of the percept. The various percepts can be readily captured and explained by a neural model of cortical activity based on populations of adapting, pitch and pitch-direction selective cells, aligned with the neurophysiological responses.</p>
<p>Together, these decoding and model results suggest that contextual influences on perception may well be already encoded at the level of the primary sensory cortices, reflecting basic neural response properties commonly found in these areas.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In real world scenarios, the elements of the sensory environment do not occur independently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Temporal, spatial and informational predictability exists within and across modalities, already as a consequence of the basic physical properties, such as spatial and temporal continuity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Neural systems make efficient use of this inherent predictability of the environment in the form of expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Expectations are valuable, because they provide an internal mechanism to recognize stimuli faster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] and more reliably under noisy conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] with speech being of specific relevance for humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. As a consequence, the same stimulus can be perceived differently, depending on the context it occurs in, e.g. which stimuli it is preceded by or which stimuli co-occur with it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. We can thus study the expectation underlying a percept by studying the nature of the contextual influence.</p>
<p>Within audition, several forms of contextual influences have been found to shape perception. They range from spatial (e.g. localization in different contexts), to grouping (e.g. ABA sequences, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]) and phonetic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] contextual influences. A striking example in human communication concerns the perception of certain two-syllable words, such as /alga/ or /arda/. In both, the second syllable is physically identical, but is heard as <italic>/da/</italic> or <italic>/ga/</italic> depending on the preceding syllable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Subsequent psychoacoustic investigations have revealed that this effect still occurs if the preceding syllable was replaced by appropriately chosen tone sequences, that it persists with substantial silent gaps between the two syllables, and that only very few tones are in fact necessary to bias the percepts one way or another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Hence, these contextual effects are likely not linguistic in nature, but reflect more basic adaptive neural mechanisms. Different interpretations have been provided to interpret these findings, such as the enhancement of contrasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we investigate the neural correlates of these contextual effects using a simplified paradigm, in which the context reliably biases the percept of an <italic>ambiguous</italic> acoustic stimulus: A sequence of two <italic>Shepard</italic> tones, separated in frequency by half an octave, can be perceived as ascending or descending in frequency. Shepard tones are complex tones with octave spaced constituent tones. This percept can be reliably manipulated by presenting a suitably chosen sequence of Shepard tones before, setting up different contexts. This contextual influence is highly effective, rapidly established and can last for multiple seconds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Importantly, the ability to determine the changes in pitch has relevance for a wide spectrum of real-world tasks, ranging from distinguishing an approaching from a departing vehicle to distinguishing different emotions in human communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>].</p>
<p>We presented various Shepard tone sequences to awake ferrets and humans while simultaneously performing single-unit population recordings using chronically implanted electrode arrays in the left primary auditory cortex, and MEG (magnetoencephalographic) recordings, respectively. Exposure to the contextual sequence resulted in localized adaptation that faded over the time-course of ∼1 s, consistent with Stimulus Specific Adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] and with findings from a related human MEG study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. A straight-forward decoding approach demonstrates that the perceived pitch-change direction can be directly related to the contextually adapted activity of direction selective cells. Conversely, decoding the represented Shepard tone pitches and their respective differences, predicts a repulsive effect, opposite to the perceived direction of pitch change. These results align in direction and dynamics with the human MEG recordings collected for the same sounds.</p>
<p>We can account for these effects in a simplified model of the cortical representation based on known properties of pitch-change selective cells, which matches both the results from the directional- and the distance-decoding analysis. Further, the model is consistent with multiple observed properties of the neural representation, including tuning changes and directional tuning of individual neurons as well as the build-up of the contextual effect in humans.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We collected neural recordings from 7 awake ferrets (662 single units) and from 16 behaving humans (MEG recordings) in response to sequences of Shepard tones (the ‘Bias’) followed by an ambiguous, semi-octave separated test pair (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). It has been previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] that the presence of the Bias reliably influences human perception, towards hearing a pitch step ‘bridging’ the location of the Bias, i.e. if the Bias is located above the first tone an ascending step is heard (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> middle), and a descending one, if it is below (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> bottom). The present study investigates the neural representation underlying these modified percepts.</p>

<caption><title>Stimulus design and recording techniques</title>
<p><bold>A</bold> Shepard tones are acoustic complexes, composed of octave-spaced pure-tones (top). Each Shepard tone is uniquely characterized in frequency by its base frequency f<sub>base</sub>, and the difference between two Shepard tones by the difference of their base frequencies f<sub>diff</sub>, usually given in semitones. A Shepard tone shifted by a full octave ‘projects’ onto itself, and is therefore the physically same stimulus. The space of Shepard tones therefore forms a circle (bottom). We use this color mapping (hue) throughout the paper.</p>
<p><bold>B</bold> We used the tritone paradox - a sequence of two Shepard tones - to investigate how ambiguous percepts are resolved, for example by preceding stimuli. In the tritone paradox, two Shepard tones are presented, which are separated by half an octave (6 semitones). Listeners, asked to judge the relative pitch between the two Shepard tones, are ambiguous as to their percept of an ascending or a descending step. If the ambiguous Shepard pair is preceded with a sequence of Shepard tones with pitches above the first but below the second tone (red area), listeners report an ascending percept. Conversely, if the ambiguous Shepard pair is preceded by a sequence of Shepard tones with pitches below the first, but above the second tone (blue area), listeners perceive a descending step. The neural representation of this contextual influence is not known, and we conducted a series of physiological and psychophysical experiments to elucidate the neural basis.</p>
<p><bold>C</bold> Neural responses from individual neurons were collected in awake ferrets from the auditory cortex (left). Individual neurons modulated their firing rate during the presentation of the stimulus sequence and exhibited tuned responses (see <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). Using MEG recordings, we also collected neural response from populations of neurons in auditory cortex from human subjects, performing the up/down discrimination task. The amplitude of the magnetic field was modulated as a function of time during the stimulus presentation.</p>

<p>In the following, we first show that the bias sequence induces a local adaptation in the neural population activity in both passive (ferret) and active (human) condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, see Discussion for more details). Next, we demonstrate the effect of this adaptation on the stimulus representation by decoding the neural population response. We find a repulsive influence of the Bias sequence on the pitches in the pair. This increases their distance in pitch along the perceived direction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and is thus not compatible with a siple, pitch-distance based decoder (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). We then provide a simplified model of neuronal activity in auditory cortex that captures both the population representation and the adaptive changes in tuning of individual cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Finally, based on this model, we provide an alternative explanation for the perceived directionality percept of the ambiguous pair by showing that the adaptation pattern of directional cells predicts the percept (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Neural responses adapt locally during the bias sequence for awake ferrets (top) and behaving humans (bottom).</title>
<p><bold>A1</bold> During the presentation of the bias sequence (10 tones, black bars), the neural response adapts over time (individual cell). This adaptation occurs for all parts of the response, shown here is the onset part (0-50 ms, black). See <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref> for more details on the different response types. Errorbars denote 2 SEM across trials.</p>
<p><bold>A2</bold> On the population level, the response reaches an adapted plateau 13% below the initial response after about 5 stimuli (τ=3.9 stimuli). This rate of reduction is similar to the rate of build-up of perceptual influence in human behavior (Chambers et al. 2010, 2017). Errorbars denote 2 SEM across neurons.</p>
<p><bold>A3</bold> After the bias the activity of the cells is significantly more reduced (Δ=33%, p=0.001) around the center or the bias (&lt;2.5 semitones from the center) compared to the edges (2.5-3 semitones from the center). Errorbars denote 2 SEM across neurons.</p>
<p><bold>B1</bold> In human auditory cortex the bias sequences also evoked an adapting sequence of responses, here shown is the activity for a single subject (#8). Errorbars denote 2 SEM across trials.</p>
<p><bold>B2</bold> On average, the adaptation of the neural response proceeded with a similar time course as the single-unit response (A2), and plateaus after about 3-4 stimuli. Errorbars denote 2 SEM across subjects.</p>
<p><bold>B3</bold> Following the Bias, the activity state of the cortex is probed with a sequence of brief stimuli (35 ms Shepard tones, after 0.5 s silence). Responses to probe tones in the same (red) semi-octave are significantly reduced (21% for the first time window, signed ranks test, p&lt;0.0001) compared to the corresponding responsed in the opposite semioctave (blue), indicating a local effect of adaptation. Errorbars denote one SEM across subjects.</p>

<caption><title>Population decoding predicts a bias-induced, repulsive shift in pitchclass.</title>
<p><bold>A</bold> We decoded the represented stimulus using dimensionality reduction techniques (see <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref> for population-vector decoding). The stimulus identity (top) is reflected in the joint activity of all neurons (middle). If the neurons are considered as dimensions of a high-dimensional response space, the circular stimulus space of Shepard tones induces a circular manifold of responses, which lies in a lower dimensional space (light red plane). Colors represent a Shepard tone’s pitchclass, also in the following graphs.</p>
<p><bold>B</bold> The entire set of responses to the 240 distinct Shepard tones (from the various bias sequences) is projected by the decoding into a low dimensional space (dots, hue = true pitchclass), in which neighboring stimuli fall close to each other and the stimuli overall form a circle. The thick, colored line is computed from local averages along the range of pitchclasses and emphasizes the circular structure. The Shepard tones in the ambiguous pairs are projected using the same decoder (denoted by the different triangles, hue = true pitchclass), and roughly fall into their expected locations. However, if a stimulus was relatively above the bias sequence (△, bright, upward triangles), their representation is shifted to higher pitchclasses, compared to the same stimulus when located relatively below the bias sequence (▾, dark, downward triangles). Hence, the preceding bias repulsed the stimuli in the ambiguous pair in their represented pitchclass. Both stimuli of the pair are treated equally here.</p>
<p><bold>C</bold> To demonstrate that decoding in this way is reliable, we compare real and estimated pitchclasses (by taking the circular position in B) for each stimulus, which exhibits a reliable relation (r=0.995).</p>
<p><bold>D</bold> The influence of the bias can be compared quantitatively by centering the represented test stimuli around their actual pitchclass and inspecting the difference between the two different bias conditions. The bias shifts them away with high significance (p&lt;10<sup>-43</sup>, Wilcoxon-test).</p>
<p><bold>E</bold> The size of the shift is influenced by the length of the bias sequence (5 tones = red, 10 tones = black) and the time between the bias and the test tones (τ=1.1s).</p>

<label>Figure 4:</label>
<caption><title>Repulsive shifts are not consistent with minimal distance hypothesis</title>
<p><bold>A</bold> In the case of an unbiased Shepard pair, steps of less than 6 pitch-classes lead to unambiguous percepts, e.g. a 0st to 3st steps leads to an ascending percept (red) and a 0st to 9st (i.e. 0st =&gt;-3st) step to a descending percept (blue). Semioctave (0st to 6st, blue/red) steps lead to an ambiguous percept, whose percept at a time can depend on individual properties (Deutsch 1986) and the stimulus history (Chambers et al. 2012). This suggests the <italic>minimal distance hypothesis</italic> which predicts the percept to follow the smaller of the two distances along the circle between the two pitch-classes</p>
<p><bold>B</bold> In the case of an ambiguous Shepard pair (0st to 6st), preceded by a bias sequence (red bar, right), here an <italic>UP</italic>-Bias, the ascending percept together with the <italic>minimal distance hypothesis</italic> would predict the distance between the Shepard tones to be reduced on the side of the <italic>UP</italic>-Bias (red dots). However, the population decoding shows that the distance between the tones is indeed increased on the side of the <italic>UP</italic>-Bias, challenging the <italic>minimal distance hypothesis</italic>.</p>

<caption><title>Distributed activity &amp; local adaptation predict tuning changes and repulsive shifts</title>
<p><bold>A</bold> We model the encoding by a simplified model, which starts from the cochlea, includes only one intermediate station (e.g. the MGB), and then projects to cortical neurons. The model is general in the sense that a cascaded version would lead to the same response, as long as similar mechanisms act on each level. A stimulus elicits an activity distribution along the cochlea (bottom) which is retained in shape on the intermediate level (2nd from below). In the native state, the stimulus is transferred to the cortical level without adaptation (2nd from top, black) and integrated by the cortical neuron (top, black). After a stimulus presentation, an adapted trough is left behind in the connections leading up to the cortical level (2nd from top, red), which reduces the cortical tuning curve locally. Since tuning curves closer to the center adapt more strongly, the stimulus representation in the neural population shifts away from the region of adaptation.</p>
<p><bold>B</bold> Applying the same analysis as above (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) for the real data leads again to a circular decoding (B1), with the estimated pitches of the tones the Shepard pair shifted repulsively by the preceding bias (B2, for more details see the description of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>C</bold> Single cells show adaptation of their responses colocalized (different colors) with the biased region (colored bars, bottom). The bias was presented in 4 different regions in separate trials, and the tuning of the cell probed in between the biasing stimuli. The left side shows a model example and the right side a representative neural example.</p>
<p><bold>D</bold> Centered on the bias, neurons in the auditory cortex adapt their onset and sustained responses colocal with the bias, and more broadly for the offset response. The curves represent the difference in response rate between the unadapted tuning and the adapted tuning, again for model cells on the left and actual data on the right.</p>
<p><bold>E</bold> The presence of the bias reduces the firing rate relative to the initial discharge rate, by ∼40% (red), while the rate stays the same or is slightly elevated outside of the bias regions (green) (see <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref> for the decoding results and two related, incompatible models, which demonstrate noteworthy subtleties of the decoding process).</p>

<caption><title>Decoding based on the directionality of the individual cells predicts the directional percept.</title>
<p><bold>A</bold> The directional percept (left) is predicted by the average over the cells activity (right), weighted by their directionality (right) and their distance to the stimulus (middle).</p>
<p><bold>B</bold> Examples three directional cells based on the Shepard tones based spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs). Directionality was determined by the asymmetry of the 2nd column of the STRF (response to previous stimulus), centered at the maximum (BF) of the first column (response to current stimulus, see Methods for details). As usual, time on the abscissa runs into the past. The middle cell for example is a down-cell, since it responds more strongly to a stimulus sequence 10st =&gt; 7st, than 4st =&gt; 7st based on the STRF.</p>
<p><bold>C</bold> The prediction of the decoding (ordinate) compared to the usually perceived direction for the two sequences (abscissa). Predictions depended on the length of the sequence (o = 5 tones, <bold>•</bold> = 10 tones) and the predicted tone (red = 1st tone, blue = 2nd tone). The dashed red line corresponds to a flat prediction.</p>
<p><bold>D</bold> Predictive performance increased as a function of bias length and distance to the bias, reflected as 1st (red) or 2nd (blue) tone after the bias. Both dependencies are consistent with human performance and the build-up and recovery of adaptive processes.</p>
<p><bold>E</bold> The basis for the directional decoding can be analyzed by considering the entire set of bias-induced differences in response, arranged by the directional preference of each cell (abscissa), and the location in BF relative to each stimulus in the Shepard pair (abscissa). Applying the analysis to the neural data, the obtained pattern of activity (top) is composed of two angled stripes of positive and negative differential activity. For cells with BFs close to the pitchclass of the test tones, the relative activities are significantly different (p=0.03, 1-way ANOVA) between ascending and descending preferring cells, thus predicting the percept of these tones. Grey boxes indicate combinations of directionality and relative location which did not exist in the cell population.</p>
<p><bold>F</bold> Applied to a population of model neurons (as in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, see Methods for details) subjected to the same stimulus as the real neurons, in the absence of adaptation (left) no significant pattern emerges. If no directional cells are present (middle), adaptation leads to a distinct pattern for different relative spectral locations, but the lack of directional cells prevents a directional judgement. Finally, with adaptation and directional cells a pattern of differential activation is obtained, similar to the pattern in the neural data. T Cells located close to the target tone (near 0 on the ordinate) show a differential activity, predictive of the percept, which was used in the direct decoding above (shown separately in the lower plots). While these activities exhibit no significant dependence in the absence of adaptation or directional cells, the dependence becomes significantly characteristic with adaptation (p&lt;0.001, 1-way ANOVA, bottom right).</p>
<p><bold>G</bold> The above results can be summarized as a symmetric imbalance in the activities of directional cells after the Bias around it (right), which when decoded predict steps consistent with the percept, i.e. both are judged in their relative position to the bias. Hence the percept of the frequency change direction is determined by the local activity, rather than by a global distance.</p>

<p>Adaptation to a stimulus is a ubiquitous phenomenon in neural systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Multiple kinds and roles of adaptation have been proposed, ranging from fatigue to adaptation in statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] to higher-order adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Since adaptation has previously been implicated in affecting perception, e.g. in the tilt-after effect in vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], we start out by characterizing the adaptation in neural response during and following the Bias under awake (ferrets, single units) and behaving (humans, MEG) conditions.</p>
<p>In the single unit data the average response strength decreases as a function of the position in the Bias sequence. Cells adapted their onset, sustained and offset response within a few tones in the biasing sequence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A1). This behavior was observable for the vast majority of cells (91%), and is thus conserved in the grand average (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A2). The adaptation plateaued after about 3-4 stimuli (corresponding to a time-constant of 0.59s) on a level about 13% below the initial level.</p>
<p>The single-unit response strength is reduced locally by the Bias sequence. The responses to the tones in the ambiguous pair (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A3, blue) - which are at the edges of the Bias sequence - are significantly less reduced (33%, p=0.0011, 2 group t-test) compared to within the bias (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A3, blue vs. red), relative to the first responses of the bias. The average response was here compared against the unadapted response of the neurons measured via their Shepard tone tuning curve, collected prior to the Bias experiment. This difference is enhanced, if longer sequences are used and the entire non-biased region is measured (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> D2).</p>
<p>The response strength remains adapted on the order of one second for single cells. The average spontaneous activity recovered with a time constant of 1.2 s (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A4, see also <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> &amp; S2 for another measure of recovery time). The initial buildup before the reduction is probably due to offset responses of some cells.</p>
<p>For the human recordings, we obtained quite similar time-courses and qualitative response progressions. The neural response adapted both for individuals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B1) and on average (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B2), with slightly faster time-constants (0.69s), which could stem from the lower repetition rate (4 Hz compared to 7 Hz) used in the human experiments, potentially leading to less adaptation. To the contrary though, the amount of adaptation under behaving conditions in humans appears to be more substantial (40%) than for the average single units under awake conditions. While this difference could be partly explained by desynchronization, adaptation appears to be dominantly present under behaving conditions as well. However, comparisons between the level of adaptation in MEG and single neuron firing rates may be misleading, due to the differences in the signal measured and subsequent processing.</p>
<p>Similarly to the neuronal data, in the MEG data the responses to probe tones in the same semi-octave (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>3, red) are significantly reduced (21%, signed ranks test, p&lt;0.0001) compared to the corresponding response in the opposite semi-octave (blue). This local reduction is not surprising, given that single neurons in auditory cortex can be well tuned to Shepard tones, with tuning widths of as little as 2-3 semitones (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). The detailed effect adaptation has on individual cells is studied in detail further below (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Note, that the term local here could mean that a neuron is adapted in multiple octaves, but this is collapsed into the Shepard tone space.</p>
<p>In summary, both under awake (ferret) and behaving (humans) conditions, we find that neural responses adapt with similar time courses. The adaptation is local in nature, despite the global nature of the Shepard tones. Together, this suggests that adaptation may play an important role in explaining the effect the Bias sequence has on perceiving the ambiguous Shepard pair, and that effects from passive data may translate to stronger effects in active data.</p>

<title>The contextual bias repels the ambiguous pair in pitch</title>
<p>Adaptation can have a variety of effects on the represented stimulus attributes (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]): stimulus properties can be attracted, repelled or left unchanged depending on the kind of adaptation. In the present paradigm, one hypothesis to explain the percept would be that <italic>the bias attracts subsequent tones, thus reducing the distance along this side of the pitch-circle</italic>, e.g. an <italic>UP</italic>-Bias would reduce an ambiguous 6 semitone step to a non-ambiguous 5 semitone step (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we decoded the represented stimulus using various decoding techniques from the neural population.</p>
<p>In population decoding the goal is to estimate a mapping from neural activity to stimulus properties, which assigns a stimulus to the population response. In the present context, this amounts to predicting the pitch class for a given neural response. Several decoding techniques exist which apply different algorithms and start from different assumptions. We here present a dimensionality reduction technique, based on principal component analysis, however, other techniques gave very similar results (e.g. Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (tSNE, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]), or for a population vector decoding see <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
<p>Decoding techniques based on dimensionality reduction attempt to discover a new coordinate system, which accounts for a substantial portion of the variance within much fewer dimensions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). In other words, they estimate a new representation adapted to the intrinsic geometry of the set of neural responses. In the case of Shepard tones, we predict this geometry to be circular (assuming the neural representation is not degenerate), given the circular nature of the Shepard tones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). As a circular variable can be represented (embedded) in a 2D Euclidean space, we only consider two dimensions of the decoding, typically the first two, if sorted by explained variance.</p>
<p>The projection of the neural data onto the first two principal components, forms indeed a circular arrangement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Each point corresponds to a Shepard tone, with its actual pitch given by its color. The dimensionality reduction was based on the neural responses of 662 neurons to 240 distinct Shepard tones, compiled from the 32 biasing sequences (16 for both sequence lengths, 5 &amp; 10), which covered the octave evenly. The orderly progression of colors indicates that a proximity in stimulus space leads to a proximity in neural response space.</p>
<p>To reassign a pitch-class to each point, we estimated a continuous pitch-circle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, colorful polygon), by computing the local average of each set of 10 adjacent points (w.r.t. actual pitch) and interpolating in between these points. This decoder produces an excellent mapping between actual and estimated pitch-classes on the training set (r=0.995, Pearson correlation, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Based on the responses to the Bias sequences, we have thus constructed a decoder of high accuracy.</p>
<p>Next, we apply the decoder to the responses of the Shepard tones in the ambiguous pair to estimate their represented pitch-class, and check whether they are represented at their expected pitch-class. We find that their pitch-classes are shifted <italic>away</italic> from the bias, i.e. tones in the pair that occur above the bias are shifted further above (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>/D/E, △, bright, upward triangles), and vice versa (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>/D/E, ▾, dark, downward triangles). This result is highly significant (p=10<sup>-41</sup>, exact ranks test, MATLAB <italic>signrank</italic>) and holds for all tested pitch-classes in the pair ([0,3,6,9], <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). The size of the shift increases with the length of the Bias sequence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, red: L=5, black: L=10) and decreases with the separation between Bias and ambiguous pair (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, τ=1.1s). This time constant agrees well with the time course of recovery from adaptation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>3). The effect size - ranging up to a total of 0.8 semitones - much greater than the human threshold of ∼0.2 semitones for distinguishing two Shepard tones (internal pilot experiment, data not shown). Practically the same result is obtained using population vector decoding instead (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
<p>Consequently, the presence of the Bias has a <italic>repulsive</italic> effect on the tones in the pair. Consequently, their distance increases (when measured on the Shepard pitch circle) on the side of the pitch circle where the bias was presented, e.g. for a 6 semitone step an <italic>UP</italic>-Bias leads to a represented 7 semitone (or correspondingly -5 semitone) step (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Hence, the population decoding suggests that a decoder based on circular distance in pitch <italic>cannot</italic> account for the effect of the Bias on the percept, since this would have predicted the distance to shrink on the side of the bias.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>An SSA-like model accounts for repulsion &amp; local adaptation</title>
<p>Before we can propose an alternative decoder for the directionality percept, we devise a basic neural model which is consistent with both the local nature of the adaptation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) and the repulsion in pitch (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>/4). This will serve to highlight a few boundary conditions coming from the neural activity and tuning properties that a complete model of the perceptual effect will have to obey.</p>
<p>As detailed below, the Bias not only leads to ‘local’ adaptation in the sense of ‘cells close to the location of the Bias’, but the adaptation even acts locally within the tuning curve of a given cell (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> D1). Hence, while global, postsynaptic adaptation (fatigue) has been shown to be sufficient in producing a repulsion from the adaptor in decoded stimuli (see <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]), the local reduction of individual tuning curves actually observed in our data requires us to consider non-global adaptation in the model. Adaptation of this type is not unheard of in the auditory cortex, given that another cortical property of stimulus representation - stimulus specific adaptation (SSA, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] - is likely to rest on similar mechanisms.</p>
<p>The simplest possibility along these lines is very local adaptation, i.e. specific and limited to each stimulus. While this adaptation could account for the local changes in tuning- curves, it would not predict a repulsion to occur in decoding (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref> A, see Method for details on the model implementation). Since this adaptation is assumed to be specific for each stimulus, the population activity for this decoded stimulus would simply be scaled, which would leave the mean and all other moments the same (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref> A3).</p>
<p>A more biological variant is adaptation that is matched to the <italic>internal</italic>, <italic>neural representation of the stimulus</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). As the auditory system has non-zero filter-bandwidths, every stimulus elicits a distributed, rather than a perfectly localized activity. At least up to the primary auditory cortex, acoustic stimuli are represented in a distributed manner. If this distribution of activity adapts the corresponding channels locally, the tuning curves of cells in field AI of the primary auditory cortex will be locally reduced, however, less local than in the point-like representation due to the width of the distribution in its inputs (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref> C1). On the other hand, decoding of pitches will be repulsive after an adaptor, because cells closer in BF to the adapting stimulus will integrate more adaptation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> top right), and thus contribute less to the decoding weight. This imbalance shifts the average in the decoded pitch further away (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref> C3). For simplicity, the adaptation here is attributed to the incoming synaptic connections to AI, yet, it could equally be localized at another or multiple levels.</p>
<p>The models discussed above (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>) were implemented non-dynamically to illustrate the interaction between context and different types of adaptation. Based on the aforementioned considerations, we implemented a dynamical rate model including local adaptation and distributed representation (as in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref> C3), which receives the identical stimulus sequences as were presented to the real neurons. The dynamical model provides a quantitative match to the adaptation of single cells and the repulsive representation of Shepard tones after the Bias and further allows us to estimate parameters of the underlying processing (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-E</xref>). Certain parameters could be directly matched to the actual data, e.g. the time-constant of recovery (1.2 s, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A4).</p>
<p>First, when subjected to population decoding analysis as for the real data before, the model exhibits a very similar circular representation of the space of Shepard tones (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>1) and repulsive shifts in represented pitchclass (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>2). The basis for this representation is analyzed in the following.</p>
<p>Local adaptation in the tuning of individual cells is retained in the model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Individual cells showed adaptation patterns matched in location to the region where the bias was presented (different colors represent different Bias regions), in comparison to the unbiased tuning curve (gray). Similarly, in the model, the locally implemented adaptation together with the distributed activity in the middle level leads to similarly adapted individual tuning curves.</p>
<p>To study the adaptation in a more standardized way, we computed the pointwise difference between adapted and unadapted tuning curve. These differences were then cocentered with the Bias before averaging (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Both for the onset (brown) and the sustained response (red), the reduction is highly local, with steep flanks at the boundaries of the bias for both the model and the actual data. The offset data appears to show some local reduction but not as sharply defined as the other two.</p>
<p>In order to find the relative reduction, the response rates inside (reddish lines) and outside (green lines) the biased regions are plotted against their unbiased counterparts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). while small firing rates appear to be less influenced, a reduction of ∼40% stabilized for higher firing rates, largely independent of the response bin. This analysis can illustrate dependencies on firing rate and prevents degenerate divisions by small firing rates.</p>
<p>The adaptation encapsulated in the model makes only few assumptions, yet provides an qualitatively matched description of the neural behavior in response to the stimulus sequences (w.r.t. the present level of analysis). The model can now be extended to directional cells, to provide a novel explanation for the directionality percept of the biased Shepard pairs.</p>

<title>The contextual bias differentially adapts directional cells predicting the percept</title>
<p>The decoding techniques used in the previous sections relied only on the cells’ tunings to the <italic>currently</italic> presented Shepard tone. However, cells in the auditory cortex also possess preferences for the <italic>succession of two</italic> (or more) stimuli, e.g. differing in pitch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. We hypothesized that perception of pitch steps could rely on the relative activities of cells preferring ascending and descending steps in pitch-class (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>), instead of the difference in pitch (as in the <italic>minimal distance hypothesis,</italic> disproven above).</p>
<p>We tested this <italic>directional hypothesis</italic> by decoding the perceived direction more directly by taking the directional preferences of each cell into account (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). The directional percept is predicted by the population response weighted by each cell’s directionality index (DI) and the distance to the currently presented stimulus (see Methods for details). The DI is computed from the cells’ STRFs, which are estimated from the sequences of Shepard tones This approach avoids estimating receptive fields from stimuli with different statistics. Directional cells have asymmetric spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRF, see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> for some examples): down-selective cells have STRFs with active zones (red) angled down (from past to future, current time being on the left), up-selective cells the opposite. In both cases the STRF is dominated by the activity in response to the current stimulus, i.e. the recent past.</p>
<p>The directional decoding successfully predicts the percept for both stimuli in the ambiguous pair. Predictions are performed for each stimulus in the test pair separately. The step direction of the first stimulus is defined based its relative position to the center of the Bias. For the analysis of the second Shepard tone in the pair, the step is assumed to be perceived on the side of the Bias, i.e. as previously shown in human perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Predictions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>) for the first tone (red) were generally more reliable than for the second tone (blue), and predictions also improved for both tones with the length of the Bias sequence (5 tones = o, 10 tones = •). This dependence of prediction reliability is consistent with the certainty of judgment in human psychophysics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. On average, the prediction was correct in 88% and 95% for the first tone, for a Bias length of 5 and 10 tones, respectively, and 67% and 88% for the second tone, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). In summary, the Bias seems to influence the relative activities of up- and down-preferring cells differentially above and below the Bias, such that responses from down-preferring cells prevail below the Bias, and up-preferring cells prevail above the Bias, predicting the human percept correctly.</p>
<p>We next investigate in what way the activities of directional cells are modified by the Bias to generate these perception-matched decodings. In the previous sections, we have seen that rather local adaptation occurs during the Bias and modifies the response properties of a cell. How does this adaptation affect a cell that has a directional-preference? To address this question we distinguish the differential response between the <italic>Up</italic> and <italic>Down</italic> Bias as a function of a cell’s directionality and frequency separation from the test tone, i.e. Shepard tones in the ambiguous pair. Hence, the analysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>/F) plots the difference in response between a preceding <italic>Up</italic>- and <italic>Down</italic>-Bias (specifically: Bias-is-locally-above-tone minus Bias-is-locally-below-tone, color scale), as a function of the cells directional selectivity (abscissa) and the cell’s best frequency location with respect to each tone (ordinate). For the present analysis the responses to the first and second tone in the pair were analyzed together. For the second tone, a cell thus contributes also to a second relative-to-tone bin (ordinate) at the same directionality, however, with a different set of responses. Also, each cell contributed for each tone in multiple locations, since multiple target tones (4) were tested in the paradigm.</p>
<p>For the neural data, the differential responses exhibit an angled stripe pattern, formed by a positive and a negative stripe (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref> top). The stripes are connected at the top and bottom ends, due to the circularity of the Shepard space. The pattern of differential responses conforms to the <italic>directional hypothesis</italic>, if <italic>down</italic>-cells (left half) are more active than <italic>up</italic>-cells (right half) close to the pair tones (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>, ordinate around 0). This central region was considered here, since these are the cells that will respond most strongly to the tone. For the neural data, this differential activity is significantly dependent on the directionality of the cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref> bottom, ANOVA, p&lt;0.005).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Extending the neuronal model to directionally sensitive cells</title>
<p>In order to better understand the mechanisms shaping this biasing pattern, the same analysis was applied to neural models including different properties (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). The same model as in the previous section was used, with the only difference that the tuning of the cells extended in time to include two stimuli instead of only one, comparable to the STRFs of the actual cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). To illustrate the effect of adaptation, three models are compared: without adaptation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref> left), without directionally tuned cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref> middle), and with adaptation and directionality tuned cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref> right).</p>
<p>Without adaptation, the cells do not show a differential response (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref> left), since the Bias does not affect the responses in the test pair (Note, that there is a 200 ms pause between the end of the Bias and the test pair, such that the directionality itself cannot explain the pattern of responses). Here, the difference in activity around the current tone is not significant (ANOVA, p=0.5; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref> left bottom).</p>
<p>Without directional cells, the pattern reflects only the difference in activity generated by the interaction of the Bias with the adaptation. The lack of directional cells limits the pattern to a small range of directionalities, generated by estimation inaccuracy. Hence, the local pattern of differential response around the test tone is not significantly modulated, due to the lack of directional cells to span the range (ANOVA, p=0.7; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref> middle bottom).</p>
<p>In the model with adapting and directional cells, the pattern resembles the angled double stripe pattern from the neural data. The stripes in the pattern are generated by the adaptation, whereas the directionality of the cells leads to the angle of those stripes. Locally around the test tone, this difference shows a statistically significant dependence on the directionality of the cells (ANOVA, p&lt;0.0001; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref> right bottom).</p>
<p>The resulting distribution of activities in their relation to the Bias is, hence, symmetric around the Bias (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). Without prior stimulation, the population of cells is unadapted and thus exhibits balanced activity in response to a stimulus. After a sequence of stimuli, the population is partially adapted (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref> right), such that a following stimulus now elicits an imbalanced activity. Translated concretely to the present paradigm, the Bias will locally adapt cells. The degree of adaptation will be stronger, if their tuning curve overlaps more with the biased region. Adaptation in this region should therefore most strongly influence a cell’s response. For example, if one considers two directional cells, an <italic>up-</italic> and a <italic>down-</italic>selective cell, cocentered in the same frequency location below the Bias, then the Bias will more strongly adapt the <italic>up</italic>-cell, which has its dominant, recent part of the STRF more inside the region of the Bias (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref> right). Consistent with the percept, this imbalance predicts the tone to be perceived as a descending step relative to the Bias. Conversely, for the second stimulus in the pair, located above the Bias, the <italic>down</italic>-selective cells will be more adapted, thus predicting an ascending step relative to the previous tone.</p>
<p><italic>In summary</italic>, taking into account the directional selectivities of the population of cells and local neural adaptation, the changes in the directional percept induced by the Bias sequences can be predicted from the neural data. Specifically, the local adaptation of specifically the directionally selective cells caused by the Bias underlies the imbalance in their responses, and thus is likely to be the underlying mechanism of the biased Shepard tones percept.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have investigated the physiological basis underlying the influence of stimulus history on the perception of pitch-direction, using a bistable acoustic stimulus, pairs of Shepard tones. Stimulus history is found to persist as spectrally-localized adaptation in animal and human recordings, which specifically shapes the activity of direction-selective cells in agreement with the percept. The adaptation’s spectral and temporal properties suggest a common origin with previously described mechanisms, such as stimulus specific adaptation (SSA). Conversely, the classically assumed, but rarely explicitly discussed, circle-distance hypothesis in Shepard tone judgements is in conflict with the repulsive effect on cortically represented pitch revealed presently using different types of population decoding.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Relation to previous studies</title>
<p>While context-dependent auditory perception of Shepard tones has been studied previously in humans, we here provide a first account of the underlying neurophysiological representation. Previous studies have considered how the stimulus context influences various judgements, e.g. whether subsequent tones influence each other in frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], whether a sound is continuous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] or which of two related phonemes is perceived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. In the present study, we chose directional judgements, due to the fundamental role frequency-modulations play in the perception of natural stimuli and language. We find the preceding stimulus to locally bias directional cells, such that on a population level the first Shepard tone is perceived as a step downward, and the second tone as a step upward for an UP Bias, and conversely for a DOWN Bias. While the present study cannot directly rule out that the local adaptation occurs before the thalamo-cortical junction, both physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] and psychophysical (binaural fusion, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]) results suggest a location beyond the olivary nuclei.</p>
<p>Are these results compatible with the cellular mechanisms that give rise to direction selectivity? The cellular mechanisms underlying the emergence of directional selectivity in the auditory system have been elucidated in recent years using <italic>in-vivo</italic> intracellular recordings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Two mechanisms have been identified in the auditory cortex, (i) excitatory inputs with different timing and spectral location and (ii) excitatory &amp; inhibitory inputs with different spectral location. In both mechanisms local adaptation by prior stimulation would tend to equalize direction selectivity, by diminishing (i) one excitatory channel or (ii) either the inhibitory or the excitatory channel. The observed changes in response properties under local stimulation are thus compatible with the network mechanisms underlying direction selectivity. This makes the prediction that [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>] the presentation of FM-sweeps of one direction should bias subsequent perception to the opposite direction. Psychophysical evidence in this respect has been observed previously in terms of threshold shifts of directional perception, which are in agreement with a local bias influencing the directional percept of subsequent stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. More specific adaptation paradigms are required to resolve some of the more detailed effects e.g. local differences across the octave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>].</p>
<p>Conversely, we could disprove the hypothesis that directional judgements are based on the distance between the tones on the circular Shepard space. Earlier studies on directional judgements of Shepard pairs have - implicitly or explicitly - used the circular nature of the Shepard space to predict the percept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], starting from the fundamental work of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] The original idea was to construct a stimulus with tonal character but ambiguous pitch, and as such it has interesting applications in the study of pitch perception. However, as presently shown, the percept of directionality does not rest on the circular construction. This conclusion is obtained by decoding the represented pitch of the Shepard tones in the context of different biasing sequences. This analysis demonstrated that the biasing sequence exerts a repulsive rather than an attractive effect on the pitch of following stimuli. Repulsive effects of this kind have been widely investigated in the visual literature, in particular the <italic>tilt after-effect</italic> ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>], where exposure to a single oriented grating perceptually repels subsequently presented gratings of similar orientation. Repulsive effects have also been described in the auditory perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], but not in auditory physiology. In conclusion, we find the percept to be inconsistent with the increase in the circular distance in the Shepard tone space.</p>
<p>An interesting approach would be to provide a Bayesian interpretation for the effect of the Bias on the cortical representation. Typically an increase in activity is considered as a representation of the prior occurrence probability of stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Given the local reduction in activity described above, this interpretation would, however, not predict the percept. Alternatively, one could propose to interpret the <italic>negative</italic> deviation, i.e. local adaptation, as the local magnitude of the prior, which could be consistently interpreted with the percept in this paradigm, as has been proposed before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Recordings from different areas in the auditory cortex might, however, show different characteristics, including a sign inversion.</p>

<title>Relation to other principles of adaptation in audition</title>
<p>Adaptation has been attributed with several functions in sensory processing, ranging from fatigue (adaptation in excitability of spiking), representation of stimulus statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], compensation for stimulus statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], sensitization for novel stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>] and sensory memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Adaptation is also present on multiple time-scales, ranging from milliseconds to minutes ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Based on the time-scales of the stimulus and the task-design, the present experiments mainly revealed adaptation in the range of fractions of a second. Adaptation can be global - in the sense that a neuron responds less to all stimuli - or local - in the sense that adaptation is specific to certain, usually the previously presented stimuli, as in SSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Here, adaptation was well confined to the set of stimuli presented before. Hence, the adaptation identified presently is temporally and spectrally well matched to SSA described before. In recent years, the research on SSA has focussed on the aspect of stimulus novelty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>], as a potential single-cell correlate of mismatch-negativity (MMN) recorded in human EEG and MEG tasks. While the connection between SSA and MMN appears convincing when it comes to some properties, e.g. stimulus frequency, it appears to not transfer in a similar way to other, still primary properties, such as stimulus level or duration, which elicit robust MMN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. The present results reemphasize another putative role of SSA, namely sensory memory. Naturally, adaptation - if it is local - constitutes a ‘negative afterimage’ of the preceding stimulus history. Recent studies in humans suggest a functional role for this adapted state in representing properties of the task. This was recently demonstrated in an auditory delayed match-to-sample task, where a frequency-specific reduction in activity was maintained between the sample and the match ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>], see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]). Localized adaptation as described presently provides a likely substrate for such a sensory memory trace.</p>

<title>Future directions</title>
<p>While in human perception task engagement is not necessary to be influenced by the biasing sequence, a natural continuation of the present work would be to record from behaving animals. This would allow us to investigate potential differences in neural activity depending on the activity state, and how individual neurons contribute to the decision on a trial-by-trial basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. Furthermore, the current study was limited to primary auditory cortex of the ferret, but secondary areas as well as parietal and frontal areas could also be involved and should be explored in subsequent research. Switching to mice as an experimental species would allow us to differentiate the roles of different cell types better [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. On the paradigm level, an extension of the time between the end of the bias sequence and the test pair would be of particular interest in the active condition, where human research suggests that the bias can persist for more extended times than suggested by the decay properties of the adaptation in the present data set.</p>

<title>Magnetoencephalography &amp; Psychophysics : Stimulation, Recording and Data Analysis</title>
<p>Acoustic stimuli were generated at 44.1 kHz using custom written software in MATLAB and presented via a flat calibrated (within +/-5 dB in the range 40–3000 Hz) sound system. During MEG experiments, the sound was delivered to the ear via sound tubing (ER-3A, Etymotic), inserted with foam plugs (ER-3-14) into the ear canal, while during psychophysical experiments an over-the-ear headphone (Sony MDR-V700) was used. While the limited calibration range (due to the sound tubing) is not optimal, it still encompasses &gt;6 octaves/constituent tones for every Shepard tone. Sound stimuli were presented at 70 dBSPL. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals were recorded in a magnetically shielded room (Yokogawa Corp.) using a 160 channel, whole-head system (Kanazawa Institute of Technology, Kanazawa, Japan), with the detection coils (ø = 15.5 mm) arranged uniformly (∼25 mm center-to-center spacing) around the top part of the head. Sensors are configured as first-order axial gradiometers with a baseline of 50 mm, with field sensitivities of &gt;5 fT/Hz in the white noise region. Three of the 160 channels were used as reference channels in noise-filtering methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. The magnetic signals were band-passed between 1 Hz and 200 Hz, notch filtered at 60 Hz, and sampled at 1 kHz.

<title>Acoustic Stimuli</title>
<p>All stimuli were composed of sequences of Shepard tones. A Shepard tone is a complex tone built as the sum of octave-spaced pure-tones. To stimulate a wide range of neurons, we used a flat envelope, i.e. all constituent tones had the same amplitude. Phases of the constituents tones were randomized for each trial. Each Shepard tone was gated with 5 ms sinusoidal ramps at the beginning and end.</p>
<p>A Shepard tone can be characterized by its position in an octave, termed pitchclass (in units of semitones), w.r.t. a base-tone. In the present study, the Shepard tone based on 440 Hz was assigned pitchclass 0. The Shepard tone with pitchclass 1 is one semitone higher than pitchclass 0 and pitchclass 12 is identical to pitchclass 0, since all constituent tones are shifted by an octave and range from inaudibly low to inaudibly high frequencies. Hence, the space of Shepard tones is circular (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Across the entire set of experiments the duration of the Shepard tones was 0.1 s (neural recordings) / 0.125 s (MEG recordings) and the amplitude 70 dB SPL (at the ear).</p>
<p>We used two different stimulus sequences to probe the neural representation of the ambiguous Shepard pairs and their spectral and temporal tuning properties, (i) the Biased Shepard Pair and (ii) the Biased Shepard Tuning:</p>
<p><italic>i) Biased Shepard Pair</italic> In this paradigm, an ambiguous Shepard pair (6 st separation) preceded by a longer sequence of Shepard tones, the bias (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The bias consists of a sequence of Shepard tones (lengths: 5 and 10 stimuli) which are within 6 semitones above or below the first Shepard tone in the pair. These biases are called ‘up’ and ‘down’ bias respectively, as they bias the perception of the ambiguous pair to be ‘ascending’ or ‘descending’, respectively, in pitch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. A pause of different length ([0.05,0.2,0.5] s) was inserted between the bias and the pair, to study the temporal aspects of the neural representation. Altogether we presented 32 different bias sequences (4 base pitch classes ([0,3,6,9] st), 2 randomization, 2 bias lengths ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] stimuli), ‘up’ and ‘down bias), which in total contained 240 distinct Shepard tones. Their individual pitch classes in the bias were drawn randomly and continuously from their respective range. Each stimulus was repeated 10 times. For the neural data, these 240 different Shepard tones were also used to obtain a ‘Shepard tone tuning’ for individual cells (see <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). The stimulus described above was presented to both animals and humans. The human psychophysical data were only used to reproduce the previous findings by Chambers et al. (2014) with the current parameters. For the MEG recordings, a variation of the biased Shepard pair stimulus was used, which enabled the separate measurement of the activation state in the biased and the unbiased frequency regions. For this purpose a second sequence of Shepard tones (tone duration: 30 ms; SOA: 250 ms; frequency: 3 st above or below the tone of the pair) was inserted between the bias sequence and the Shepard pair, with the time between the two adapted to include the duration of the sequence (2s) and a pause after the bias sequence ([0.5,1,2] s).</p>
<p><italic>ii) Biased Shepard Tuning</italic> For estimating the changes in the tuning curve of individual neurons, much longer sequences (154 Shepard tones) was presented to a subset of the neurons. The Shepard tones in these sequences were chosen to maintain the influence of the bias over the entire sequence, while intermittently probing the entire octave of semitones to estimate the overall influence of the bias on the tuning of neurons. For this purpose, 5/6 (∼83%) of the tones in the sequence were randomly drawn from one of the four bias regions ([0-5],[3-8],[6-11],[9-2]st), while the 6th tone was randomly drawn from the entire octave, discretized to 24 steps (reminiscent of the studies of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]). The 6th tone could thus be used to measure each neurons ‘Shepard tuning’ at a resolution of 0.5 semitones, adapted to different bias locations.. To avoid onset effects, a lead-in sequence of 15 bias tones preceded the first tuning estimation tone. Individual stimulus parameters (intensity, durations of tone and interstimulus interval) were chosen as above. Five pseudorandom sequences were presented for each of the four bias regions, repeated 6 or more times, providing at least 30 repetitions for each location in the tuning curve (Results of these conditions are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). A randomly varied pause of ∼5 s separated the trials.</p>

<title>Population Decoding</title>
<p>The represented stimuli in the ambiguous pair were estimated from the neural responses by training a decoder on the biasing sequences and then applying the decoder to the neural response of the pair. We used two different decoders to compare their results, one based on dimensionality reduction (PCA, Principal Component Analysis) and one based on a weighted population-vector, which both gave very similar results (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and S2). For both decoders, we first built a matrix of responses which had the (240) different Shepard tones occuring in all bias sequences running along one dimension and the neurons along the other dimension.</p>
<p>The PCA decoder performed a linear dimensionality reduction, utilizing the stimuli as examples and the neurons as dimensions of the representation. The data were projected to the first three dimensions, which represented the pitchclass as well as the position in the sequence of stimuli (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> for a schematic). A wide range of linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques - e.g. tSNE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] - was tested leading to very similar results.</p>
<p>The weighted population decoder was computed by assigning each neuron its best pitchclass (i.e. pitchclass that evoked the highest response) and then evaluating the firing-rate weighted sum of all neurons’ best pitchclasses (see <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref> for a schematic). Since the stimulus space is circular, this weighted average was performed in the complex domain, where each neuron was represented by a unit vector in the complex plane, with an angle corresponding to the best pitchclass. More precisely, this decoder is simply (omitting indices in the following)
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="573229v1_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>PC</italic><sub><italic>i,best</italic></sub> is the preferred pitchclass of a cell, <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>S</italic>) the firing rate of the neuron <italic>i</italic> for stimulus <italic>S</italic>. In the decoding, firing rate is normalized to the maximal firing rate for each cell, and the preferred pitchclass for the empirical frequency of occurrence <italic>P</italic>(<italic>PC</italic><sub><italic>i,best</italic></sub>), to compensate for uneven sampling of preferred pitchclasses.</p>
<p>To assign a pitchclass to the decoded stimuli of the test pair, we projected them onto the ‘pitch-circle’ formed by the decoded stimuli from the bias sequences. More precisely, we estimated a smoothed trajectory through the set of bias-tones which was assigned a pitchclass at every point, by averaging the pitchclasses of the closest 4 bias stimuli, weighted by their distance to the point. Then, the pitchclass of the test tone was set to the pitchclass of the closest point on the trajectory.</p>

<title>Neural modeling</title>
<p>We used rate-based models of neural responses in the auditory cortex to investigate the link between the bias-induced changes in response characteristic and the population decoding results. These are not trivially related, as different kinds of adaptation can lead to different - repulsive or attractive - effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Two types of models were investigated for this purpose:</p>
<p>(i) a <italic>non-dynamic tuning model</italic>, which serves to investigate generally the effect of different types of adaptation on the represented stimuli. This model is detailed in the Supplementary Methods and results are shown in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>.</p>
<p>(ii) a <italic>dynamic model</italic>, which serves to use the insights of the non-dynamic model to account in more detail for the neural data. We used the identical stimulus sequences and analyses as for the real data. The structure of the dynamic model corresponded to non-dynamic model (c) (see Supplementary Methods), i.e. a distributed stimulus representation before cortex and local adaptation in the thalamo-cortical synapses and (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> for a schematic representation of the model). A sampling rate of 20 Hz was used for the simulations to speed up computations. Stimuli were represented as spectrograms - i.e. time-frequency representations - with frequency being encoded as Shepard tones, i.e. they ranged over one octave and wrapped at the frequency boundaries.</p>
<p>In the mid-level (e.g. MGB) neural representation of the stimulus, each cell’s response was modeled by a peak-normalized <italic>von Mises</italic> distribution for each time t of the filter, i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="573229v1_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>ϕ</italic> denotes the stimulus, <italic>μ</italic> denotes the best pitchclass and <italic>σ</italic> the standard deviation, all in semitones. The maximal rate R<sub>max</sub> was arbitrarily set to 1. Hence, the responses on the mid-level <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)) of each neuron <italic>j</italic> were modeled as a convolution of the spectrogram with the neuron’s tuning curve
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="573229v1_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
On the top-level, corresponding to auditory cortex, the activity of each neuron was modeled as a spectrotemporal filter on the activity of the mid-level representation with local synaptic depression at the synapses
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="573229v1_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where the <italic>STRF</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>τ</italic>, <italic>j</italic>) is the time-frequency filter for cortical neuron i, weighting the activity of the MGB neurons <italic>j</italic> at times <italic>τ</italic>=0…T before the current time. The state of synaptic depression between cortical neuron <italic>i</italic> and thalamic neuron <italic>j</italic> is given by <italic>A<sub>i,j</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>). The adaptation was determined by the activity locally present at each synapse and thus led to relatively local changes in the postsynaptic tuning curves. The dynamics of <italic>A<sub>i,j</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>) are given by
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="573229v1_ueqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>F<sub>A</sub></italic> is a constant weighting factor, which scales the amount of adaptation. In both cases the response computed via the SSTRF is weighted with the adaptation coefficients <italic>A</italic><sub>&lt;=/?</sub>, and each coefficient recovers by a fraction <italic>F<sub>R</sub></italic> in each step (leading to exponential recovery).</p>
<p>For the final simulations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), the model was extended to contain a subset of directional cells, by extending the dependence of the SSTRF by another 150 ms (3 timesteps at the SR). A directional preference was implemented by adding a von Mises distribution (see above for definition) at the time range 150-250 ms with a peak size of 0.25, roughly matching the observed peak-sizes in the SSTRFs of real directional cells. For downward preferring cells the center of the von Mises was placed relatively higher than the best semitone of the cell, and vice versa for upward preferring cells, in each case wrapping at the edges to account for the circularity of the Shepard tone response. The simulated population of 500 cells was split into one third non-directional cells, one third upward selective cells and one third downward selective cells.</p>

<title>Tuning Curve Adaptation Analysis</title>
<p>We estimated the <italic>biased</italic> Shepard tunings from the long stimulus sequences (see Acoustic Stimuli: <italic>Biased Shepard Tuning</italic>) by averaging the test stimuli for each location in the octave (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, different colors indicate different locations of the bias sequence). To get an estimate of the unadapted tuning curve, we collected the initial 5 stimuli from each condition and thus constructed a corresponding tuning curve at a resolution of 1st.

<title>Directionality Analysis</title>
<p>We investigated the effect of the bias sequence on directionally selective cells. For this purpose, each cell’s directional selectivity was estimated from the steps contained in the biasing sequences. Shepard Spectro-temporal receptive fields (SSTRF) were approximated by reverse correlating each neuron’s response with the bias sequences of Shepard tones (using normalized linear regression, three examples are shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>First, directional preference was assessed by computing the asymmetry in response strength in the second time bin, centered on the maximal response in the first time bin, i.e.

</disp-formula></p>
<p>Positive values of <italic>D</italic> indicate up-ward selective cells and vice versa. The SSTRF was first normalized to the maximal value to obtain comparable values between cells.</p>
<p>Second, a cell’s spectral location relative to the test stimulus was determined by computing the distance between a cell’s SSTRF center-of-mass and the pitch class of the test tone. These first two steps, located a cell on the x- and y-axis of the following analysis (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>/D, top).</p>
<p>Third, the difference in response for identical test stimuli with different preceding bias locations (relative to each tone in the pair) was computed (‘above’ - ‘below’).</p>
<p>Finally these differences were averaged for all cells with a given directionality and relative location.</p>
<p>This analysis was also applied for the second test-stimulus, which means that each cell contributes to two locations, separated by the semi-octave distance between the two test-tones, however, the contribution was constituted by different (later) responses of the cell. This analysis was conducted both for the actual neural data, as well as for model data. These modeling results were obtained with the same model as above (local adaptation, distributed input on the intermediate level), although adaptation was set to 0 in one condition to demonstrate its role in generating the asymmetry of responses.</p>

<title>Tuning Halfwidth</title>
<p>A neuron’s tuning halfwidth with respect to Shepard tones was estimated using the range of Shepard tones that the firing rate was above f<sub>50%</sub> = (f<sub>Max</sub> - f<sub>Min</sub>)/2.

As before, if a stimulus was relatively above the bias sequence (△, bright, upward triangles), their representation is shifted to higher pitchclasses, compared to the same stimulus when located relatively below the bias sequence (▾, dark, downward triangles). Hence, the preceding bias repulsed the stimuli in the ambiguous pair in their represented pitchclass. Both stimuli of the pair are treated equally here.</p>
<p><bold>C</bold> As before for the dimensionality reduction decoding we compare real and estimated pitchclasses (by taking the circular position in B) for each stimulus, which explains &gt;99% of the variance.</p>
<p><bold>D</bold> The influence of the bias can be compared quantitatively, by centering the represented test stimuli around their actual pitchclass and inspecting the difference between the two different bias conditions. The bias shifts them away with high significance (p&lt;10^-43, Wilcoxon-test).</p>
<p><bold>E</bold> As before, the size of the shift is influenced by the length of the bias sequence (5 tones = red, 10 tones = black) and the time between the bias and the test tones (τ=0.92s).</p>

<title>Non-dynamic neural models</title>
<p>In the non-dynamic model each neuron is represented as a <italic>von Mises</italic> distribution</p>
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="573229v1_ueqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>with two parameters, best pitchclass <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and standard deviation <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, both measured in semitones, and <italic>M<sub>total</sub></italic> normalizing the response to an area of 1. We simulate the response of a population of N=100 cortical neurons with <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> equally spaced within [0,12] st. The models were run at the same sampling rate (20Hz) as the data analysis for consistency.</p>
<p>The influence of the bias is modeled assuming an idealized, continuous range of biases, rather than individual tones. We consider three different models of adaptation: (a) local adaptation (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref> A) (b) global adaptation (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref> B), and (c) local adaptation with spreaded representation (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref> C):</p>
<p>a) <bold>Local adaptation</bold> refers to a multiplicative reduction of responses to individual stimuli, based on the local, recent stimulus history. The amount of local adaptation is taken as the prominence of this stimulus in the recent history, i.e.</p>
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="573229v1_ueqn6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>where <italic>S<sub>Bias</sub>(φ)</italic> is defined as a function over [0,12] st taking values in [0,1]. <italic>A</italic><sub>5</sub>is the maximal fraction of adaptation, set to 0.8 in Fig.S3. The cells adapted/biased response to a single Shepard tone is then given by</p>
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="573229v1_ueqn7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>In the more general case of a complex stimulus <italic>S</italic>, one would replace <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>S</italic>) with <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>S</italic>) ∗ <italic>S</italic>, i.e. the convolution of response and stimulus distribution.</p>
<p>This form of local adaptation resembles a highly stimulus specific version of adaptation. Hence, the responses are adapted only to previously presented stimuli, but no transfer to other stimuli occurs (see <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>). This type of local adaptation leads to no adaptation, since neurons uniformly reduce their response to the test stimulus, which keeps the mean of the population response the same.</p>
<p>b) <bold>Global adaptation</bold> refers to a multiplicative reduction of the <italic>entire</italic> tuning curve, based on the recent response history, irrespective of which stimulus caused it. The amount of global adaptation is computed as the correlation between a cell’s tuning curve and the stimulus history <italic>S<sub>Bias</sub>(PC)</italic>, i.e.</p>
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="573229v1_ueqn8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>where * denotes convolution. By the normalization of both <italic>S<sub>Bias</sub></italic> and <italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic>, <italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic> will also be normalized within [0,A<sub>0</sub>]. The cells biased tuning curve to a single Shepard tone is then given by</p>
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="573229v1_ueqn9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>Global adaptation in this sense captures summarized adaptation effects that occur ‘globally’ for the postsynaptic cell (e.g. a change in excitability which changes the slope of the IF-curve) (see <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref> B). Global adaptation shifts subsequent stimuli away from the adapting stimulus, since neurons close to the adaptor adapt more strongly (Series et al. 2009).</p>
<p>c) <bold>Local adaptation with input spread</bold> combines local adaptation with a distributed neural representation of pointlike stimuli (like a single tone or single Shepard tone), i.e. the stimulus is first represented on an intermediate level (e.g. the MGB) and then integrated on the cortical level, with adaptation occurring locally at the synapses connecting MGB-AI (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> for an illustration of the architecture). Concretely, the cortical response is given as</p>
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="573229v1_ueqn10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>Where the intermediate representation <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>S</italic>) is given as</p>
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="573229v1_ueqn11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>i.e. the convolution of the stimulus with the intermediate response properties <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>ϕ</italic>) assumed to also be given by <italic>von Mises</italic> distributions as well. The adaptation <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>ϕ</italic>) is equated with the midlevel activity induced by the bias</p>
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="573229v1_ueqn12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>This form of local adaptation is ‘less local’ than the purely local adaptation described above. Hence, a presentation of a given stimulus will adapt the neural response not only to this stimulus, but - via the distributed representation - also for neighboring stimuli (see <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref> C), which in the decoding leads to repulsive shifts, while reducing tuning curves locally. The resulting shape of the adaptation has been described as a shift in tuning curve combined with a global adaptation (Jin et al. 2005). We propose that the adaptation proposed here provides a simpler explanation for this observed shape of tuning curve change.</p>
<p>Note that the differences in decoding emerge only at the boundaries of the bias region, depicted by the encoding-decoding matrices in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref> A3/B3/C3. If the distribution at the vertical line (at 0) has more weight above 0 on the abscissa, this corresponds to a repulsive shift.</p>
<p>In summary, purely local adaptation can account for the local changes in Shepard tunings of the real data, but fails to explain the repulsive decoding (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>). Global adaptation is consistent with the repulsive decoding results, but fails to explain the local tuning curve changes (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>). The combination of local adaptation and distributed input on the intermediate level (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig.S3C</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4</xref>) is consistent with both the encoding and decoding findings.</p>

<label>Supplementary Figure 3:</label>
<caption><title>Local and global (postsynaptic) adaptation cannot explain both influences of the bias on the tuning (<bold>A1-C1</bold>) and the represented stimuli (<bold>A2-C2</bold>).</title>
<p><bold>A</bold> The observed tuning curves could also be obtained if the adaptation was assumed to be strictly local, and no distributed activity in response to a stimulus was considered. In this case, however, no change in stimulus representation is expected (<bold>A2</bold>, below (red) and above (blue) curves are identical), since the local adaptation would reduce the response of each neuron (either multiplicatively or subtractively) and, hence, not changing the center of the represented stimulus.</p>
<p><bold>B</bold> The repulsive shifts in the represented stimulus could also be obtained, if adaptation was assumed to be global across all inputs, i.e. only on the postsynaptic side, determined by the total postsynaptic activity. In this case, however, tuning curves are predicted to scale, rather than change in shape or position (<bold>B1</bold>). This is inconsistent with the observed changes in tuning curve shape (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-E</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>C</bold> If local adaptation (either on the synaptic level or in the cells projecting on the present cell) is combined with a distributed activity in the ascending auditory system, sharply adapted tuning curves are obtained as well as a repulsive influence of a preceding sequence of bias stimuli. In response to a stimulus, both local changes in tuning curves (<bold>C1</bold>) and bias-repulsed stimulus representation are obtained (<bold>C2</bold>). It should be noted that other models exist which would produce similar results, yet, the present model makes only a limited set of well accepted assumptions and is consistent with the data. <bold>A3-C3</bold> The decoding curves are obtained from the encoding-decoding matrix, which relates the stimulus (abscissa) to the response for each neuron (ordinate). Decoding consists of reading off the population response at the test stimulus (blue vertical line). Here, the bias below condition is illustrated (red curves in the other plots).</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study explores the neural basis for a well-known auditory illusion, often utilized in movie soundtracks, in which a sequence of two complex tones can be perceived as either rising or falling in pitch depending on the context in which they are presented. <bold>Solid</bold> single-neuron data and analyses are presented to show that correlates of these pitch-direction changes are found in the ferret primary auditory cortex. The manuscript is, however, difficult to assess in places and would benefit from greater consideration of how the results fit more broadly into models of auditory coding.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Previous work demonstrated a strong bias in the percept of an ambiguous Shepard tone as either ascending or descending in pitch, depending on the preceding contextual stimulus. The authors recorded human MEG and ferret A1 single-unit activity during presentation of stimuli identical to those used in the behavioral studies. They used multiple neural decoding methods to test if context-dependent neural responses to ambiguous stimulus replicated the behavioral results. Strikingly, a decoder trained to report stimulus pitch produced biases opposite to the perceptual reports. These biases could be explained robustly by a feed-forward adaptation model. Instead, a decoder that took into account direction selectivity of neurons in the population was able to replicate the change in perceptual bias.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study explores an interesting and important link between neural activity and sensory percepts, and it demonstrates convincingly that traditional neural decoding models cannot explain percepts. Experimental design and data collection appear to have been executed carefully. Subsequent analysis and modeling appear rigorous. The conclusion that traditional decoding models cannot explain the contextual effects on percepts is quite strong.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Beyond the very convincing negative results, it is less clear exactly what the conclusion is or what readers should take away from this study. The presentation of the alternative, &quot;direction aware&quot; models is unclear, making it difficult to determine if they are presented as realistic possibilities or simply novel concepts. Does this study make predictions about how information from auditory cortex must be read out by downstream areas? There are several places where the thinking of the authors should be clarified, in particular, around how this idea of specialized readout of direction-selective neurons should be integrated with a broader understanding of auditory cortex.</p>

<p>The authors aim to better understand the neural responses to Shepard tones in auditory cortex. This is an interesting question as Shepard tones can evoke an ambiguous pitch that is manipulated by a proceeding adapting stimulus, therefore it nicely disentangles pitch perception from simple stimulus acoustics.</p>
<p>The authors use a combination of computational modelling, ferret A1 recordings of single neurons, and human EEG measurements.</p>
<p>Their results provide new insights into neural correlates of these stimuli. However, the manuscript submitted is poorly organized, to the point where it is near impossible to review. We have provided Major Concerns below. We will only be able to understand and critique the manuscript fully after these issues have been addressed to improve the readability of the manuscript. Therefore, we have not yet reviewed the Discussion section.</p>
<p>Major concerns</p>
<p>Organization/presentation</p>
<p>
The manuscript is disorganized and therefore difficult to follow. The biggest issue is that in many figures, the figure subpanels often do not correspond to the legend, the main body, or both. Subpanels described in the text are missing in several cases. Many figure axes are unlabelled. There is an inconsistent style of in-text citation between figures and the main text. The manuscript contains typos and grammatical errors. My suggestions for edits below therefore should not be taken as an exhaustive list. I ask the authors to consider the following only a &quot;first pass&quot; review, and I will hopefully be able to think more deeply about the science in the second round of revisions after the manuscript is better organized.</p>
<p>Frequency and pitch</p>
<p>
The terms &quot;frequency&quot; and &quot;pitch&quot; seem to be used interchangeably at times, which can lead to major misconceptions in a manuscript on Shepard tones. It is possible that the authors confuse these concepts themselves at times (e.g. Fig 5), although this would be surprising given their expertise in this field. Please check through every use of &quot;frequency&quot; and &quot;pitch&quot; in this manuscript and make sure you are using the right term in the right place. In many places, &quot;frequency&quot; should actually be &quot;fundamental frequency&quot; to avoid misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Insufficient detail or lack of clarity in descriptions</p>
<p>
There seems to be insufficient information provided to evaluate parts of these analysis, most critically the final pitch-direction decoder (Fig 6), which is a major finding. Please clarify.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an elegant study investigating possible mechanisms underlying the hysteresis effect in the perception of perceptually ambiguous Shepard tones. The authors make a fairly convincing case that the adaptation of pitch direction sensitive cells in auditory cortex is likely responsible for this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is overall well written. My only slight criticism is that, in places, particularly for non-expert readers, it might be helpful to work a little bit more methods detail into the results section, so readers don't have to work quite so hard jumping from results to methods and back.</p>
<p>The methods seem sound and the conclusions warranted and carefully stated. Overall I would rate the quality of this study as very high, and I do not have any major issues to raise.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I think this study is about as good as it can be with the current state of the art. Generally speaking, one has to bear in mind that this is an observational, rather than an interventional study, and therefore only able to identify plausible candidate mechanisms rather than making definitive identifications. However, the study nevertheless represents a significant advance over the current state of knowledge, and about as good as it can be with the techniques that are currently widely available.</p>
