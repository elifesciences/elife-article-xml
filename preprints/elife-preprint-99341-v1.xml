<title>Abstract</title>
<p>A central goal of cancer genomics is to identify, in each patient, all the cancer driving mutations. Among them, point mutations are referred to as Cancer Driving Nucleotides (CDNs), which recur in cancers. The companion study shows that the probability of <italic>i</italic> recurrent hits in <bold>n</bold> patients would decrease exponentially with <italic>i</italic>; hence, any mutation with <italic>i</italic> ≥ 3 hits in the TCGA database is a high-probability CDN. This study characterizes the 50∼150 CDNs identifiable for each cancer type of TCGA (while anticipating 10 times more undiscovered ones) as follows: i) CDNs tend to code for amino acids of divergent chemical properties. ii) At the genic level, far more CDNs (&gt;5-fold) fall on non-canonical than canonical cancer driving genes (CDGs). Most undiscovered CDNs are expected to be on unknown CDGs. iii) CDNs tend to be more widely shared among cancer types than canonical CDGs, mainly because of the higher resolution at the nucleotide than the whole-gene level. iv) Most important, among the 50∼100 coding region mutations carried by a cancer patient, 5∼8 CDNs are expected but only 0∼2 CDNs have been identified at present. This low level of identification has hampered functional test and gene targeted therapy. We show that, by expanding the sample size to 10<sup>5</sup>, most CDNs can be identified. Full CDN identification will then facilitate the design of patient-specific targeting against multiple CDN-harboring genes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tumorigenesis in each patient is driven by mutations in the patient’s genome. Hence, a central goal of cancer genomics is to identify <italic>all</italic> driving mutations in each patient. This task is particularly challenging because each driving mutation is present in only a small fraction of patients. As the number of driver mutations in each patient has been estimated to be &gt;5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Armitage and Doll 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bozic et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hanahan and Weinberg 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Belikov 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anandakrishnan et al. 2019</xref>), the total number of driver mutations summed over all patients must be quite high.</p>
<p>This study, together with the companion paper (supplement File S2), are based on one simple premise: In the massively repeated evolution of cancers, any advantageous cancer-driving mutation should recur frequently, say <italic>i</italic> times in <bold>n</bold> patients. The converse that non-recurrent mutations are not advantageous is part of the same premise. We focus on point mutations, referred to as Cancer Driving Nucleotides (CDNs), and formulate the maximum of <italic>i</italic> (denoted <italic>i*</italic>) in <bold>n</bold> patients if mutations are not advantageous. For example, in the TCGA database with <bold>n</bold> generally in the range of 500∼1000, <italic>i*</italic> = 3. Hence, any point mutation with <italic>i</italic> ≥ 3 is a CDN. At present, a CDN would have a prevalence of 0.3% among cancer patients. If the sample size approaches 10<sup>6</sup>, a CDN only needs to be prevalent at 5×10<sup>−5</sup>, the theoretical limit (supplement File S2).</p>
<p>Although there are many other driver mutations (e.g., fusion genes, chromosomal aberrations, epigenetic changes, etc.), CDNs should be sufficiently numerous and quantifiable to lead to innovations in functional tests and treatment strategies. Given the current sample sizes of various databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cerami et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Weinstein et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tate et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">de Bruijn et al. 2023</xref>), each cancer type has yielded 50∼150 CDNs while the CDNs to be discovered should be at least 10 times more numerous. The number of CDNs currently observed in each patient is 0∼2 for most cancer types. This low-level of discovery has limited functional studies and hampered treatment strategies.</p>
<p>While we are proposing the scale-up of sample size to discover most CDNs, we now characterize CDNs that have been discovered. The main issues are the distributions of CDNs among genes, across cancer types and, most important, among patients. In this context, cancer driver genes (CDGs) would be a generic term. We shall use “canonical CDGs” (or conventional CDGs) for the driver genes in the union set of three commonly used lists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bailey et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sondka et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Martínez-Jiménez et al. 2020</xref>). In parallel, CDN-harboring genes, referred to “CDN genes”, constitute a new and expanded class of CDGs.</p>
<p>The first issue is that CDNs are not evenly distributed among genes. The canonical cancer drivers such as <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic> tend to have many CDNs. However, the majority of CDNs, especially those yet-to-be-identified ones, may be rather evenly distributed with each gene harboring only 1∼2 CDNs. Hence, the number of genes with tumorigenic potential may be far larger than realized so far. The second issue is the distribution of CDNs and CDGs among cancer types. It is generally understood that the canonical CDGs are not widely shared among cancer types. However, much (but not all) of the presumed cancer-type specificity may be due to low statistical resolution at the genic level.</p>
<p>The third issue concerns the distribution of CDNs among patients. Clearly, the CDN load of a patient is crucial in diagnosis and treatment. However, the conventional diagnosis at the gene level may have two potential problems. One is that many CDNs do not fall in canonical CDGs as signals from one or two CDNs get diluted. Second, a canonical CDG, when mutated, may be mutated at a non-CDN site. In those patients, the said CDG does not drive tumorigenesis. We shall clarify the relationships between CDN mutations and genes that may or may not harbor them.</p>
<p>The characterizations of discovered CDNs are informative and offer a road map for expanding the CDN list. A complete CDN list for each cancer type will be most useful in functional test, diagnosis and treatment. We should note that, given the sharing of CDNs across cancer types, CDN lists in a subset of cancer types may be of general use across other cancer types.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In molecular evolution, a gene under positive selection is recognized by its elevated evolutionary rate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). There have been numerous methods for determining the extent of rate elevation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Li et al. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Nei and Gojobori 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Yang and Swanson 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lawrence et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Martincorena et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sherman et al. 2022</xref>) and cancer evolution studies have adopted many of them. However, no model has been developed to take advantage of the massively repeated evolution of cancers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), which happens in tens of millions of people at any time.</p>

<p>In the whole-gene analysis, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-E</xref> are identical, each with <italic>A</italic> : <italic>S</italic> = 10 : 1 where <italic>A</italic> and <italic>S</italic> denote nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations, respectively. However, the presence of a 4-hit site in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> is far less likely to be neutral than <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>. Although ratio in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, <italic>A</italic> : <italic>S</italic> = 4 : 1, is statistically indistinguishable from the neutral ratio of about 2.5 : 1, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref> in fact has much more power to reject the neutral ratio than <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>. After all, the probability that multiple hits are at the same site in a big genome is obviously very small.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<label>1.</label><title>The analyses of CDNs across the whole genome</title>
<p>For the entire coding regions in the cancer genome data, we define <bold><italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic></bold> (or <bold><italic>S<sub>i</sub></italic></bold>) as the number of nonsynonymous (or synonymous) sites that harbor a mutation with <italic>i</italic> recurrences. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents the distribution of <bold><italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic></bold> and <bold><italic>S<sub>i</sub></italic></bold> across the 12 cancer types with <bold>n</bold> &gt; 300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Weinstein et al. 2013</xref>).</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<label>Table 1</label>
<caption><title>Mutation recurrences (<italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic>’s and <italic>S<sub>i</sub></italic>’s) in 12 cancer types.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="596367v1_tbl1.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>For neutral mutations, we define <italic>i*</italic> as the threshold above which the expected numbers of <bold><italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic></bold> would be &lt;1, i.e. <italic>E</italic>[<bold><italic>A</italic></bold><sub><italic>i</italic>≥<italic>i</italic>∗</sub>] &lt; 1, The corollary is that all <bold><italic>A</italic></bold><sub><italic>i</italic>≥<italic>i</italic>∗</sub> sites are advantageous CDNs. (Since <bold><italic>S<sub>i</sub></italic></bold> is ∼ <bold><italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic></bold>/2.3, the same <italic>i*</italic> would apply to <bold><italic>S<sub>i</sub></italic></bold> as well: <italic>E</italic>[<bold><italic>S</italic></bold><sub><italic>i</italic>≥<italic>i</italic>∗</sub>] &lt; 1) As <italic>i*</italic> is a function of the number of patients (<bold>n</bold>), it is shown mathematically in the companion study (supplement File S2) that <italic>i*</italic> = 3 for <bold>n</bold> &lt; 1000. Interestingly, while the <italic>E</italic>[<bold><italic>A</italic></bold><sub><italic>i</italic>≥3</sub>] is &lt; 1, the expected <italic>E</italic>[<bold><italic>A</italic></bold><sub><italic>i</italic>≥4</sub>] is ≪ 1, in the order of 0.001. Hence, <italic>i*</italic> = 4 may be considered unnecessarily stringent.</p>
<p>We should note that this study is constrained by <bold>n</bold> &lt; 1000 in the TCGA databases. (Databases with larger <bold>n</bold>’s are also used where the actual <bold>n</bold>’s are often uncertain.) At <italic>i*</italic> = 3, we could detect only a fraction (&lt;10%; see below) of CDNs. Many more tumorigenic mutations may be found in the <italic>i</italic> = 1 or 2 classes although not every one of them is a CDN. Since these two classes of mutations are far more numerous, they should account for the bulk of CDNs to be discovered. Indeed, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows 76 <bold><italic>A</italic></bold><sub><italic>i</italic>≥3</sub> CDN mutations per cancer type but 681 <bold><italic>A<sub>2</sub></italic></bold> and 56,648 <bold><italic>A<sub>1</sub></italic></bold> mutations in the lower recurrence groups. If <bold>n</bold> reaches 10<sup>5∼6</sup>, most of the undiscovered CDNs in the <bold><italic>A<sub>1</sub></italic></bold> and <bold><italic>A<sub>2</sub></italic></bold> classes should be identified (see supplement File S2).</p>
<p>In <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, we estimate the proportion of the <bold><italic>A<sub>1</sub></italic></bold> and <bold><italic>A<sub>2</sub></italic></bold> mutations that are possible CDNs. The relationships of <bold><italic>A<sub>3</sub></italic></bold>/<bold><italic>S<sub>3</sub></italic></bold> &gt; <bold><italic>A<sub>2</sub></italic></bold>/<bold><italic>S<sub>2</sub></italic></bold>, <bold><italic>A<sub>2</sub></italic></bold>/<bold><italic>S<sub>2</sub></italic></bold> &gt; <bold><italic>A<sub>1</sub></italic></bold>/<bold><italic>S<sub>1</sub></italic></bold>, and <bold><italic>A<sub>1</sub></italic></bold>/<bold><italic>S<sub>1</sub></italic></bold> &gt; <bold><italic>A<sub>0</sub></italic></bold>/<bold><italic>S<sub>0</sub></italic></bold> are almost always observed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> with 32 <italic>(3 × 8 + 2 × 4)</italic> out of 36 such relationships. The use of <bold><italic>A</italic>/<italic>S</italic></bold> ratios may still under-estimate the selective advantages of <bold><italic>A<sub>1∼3</sub></italic></bold> mutations because <bold><italic>S<sub>1∼3</sub></italic></bold> may have slight advantages as well (see supplement File S2). Assuming <bold><italic>S<sub>1</sub></italic></bold> is truly neutral, we use <bold><italic>S<sub>0</sub></italic></bold> to <bold><italic>S<sub>1</sub></italic></bold> as the basis to calculate the excess of <bold><italic>A<sub>1∼3</sub></italic></bold> in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> where 35 of the 36 <italic>Obs</italic>(<bold><italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic></bold>) &gt; <italic>Exp</italic>(<bold><italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic></bold>) relationships can be observed. The implication is that hundreds and, likely low thousands, of <bold><italic>A<sub>1</sub></italic></bold>’s and <bold><italic>A<sub>2</sub></italic></bold>’ should be CDNs whereas we have only confidently identified ∼76 strong CDNs, on average, for a cancer type. (Note that <bold><italic>A<sub>1</sub></italic></bold> excesses are less reliable since a 1% error in the calculation would mean 566 CDNs.)</p>

<label>2.</label><title>CDNs and the amino acids affected</title>
<p>We now ask whether the amino acid changes associated with CDNs bear the signatures of positive selection. Amino acids that have divergent physico-chemical properties have been shown to be under strong selection, both positive and negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen, He, et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen, Lan, et al. 2019</xref>). We note that, in almost all cases in cancer evolution, when a codon is altered, only one nucleotide of the triplet codon is changed. Among the 190 amino acid (AA, 20×19/2) pairs, only 75 of the pairs differ by one bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tang et al. 2004</xref>). For example, Pro (CCN) and Ala (GCN) may differ by only one bp but Pro and Gly (GGN) must differ by at least 2 bp. These 75 AA changes, referred to as the elementary AA changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Grantham 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Li et al. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yang et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Meyer et al. 2021</xref>), account for almost all AA substitutions in somatic evolution.</p>
<p>In a series of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tang et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen, He, et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen, Lan, et al. 2019</xref>), we have defined the physico-chemical distances between AAs of the 75 elementary pairs as <italic>ΔUi</italic>, where <italic>i</italic> = 1 to 75. <italic>ΔUi</italic> reflects 47 measures of AA differences including hydrophobicity, size, charge etc. and ranges between 0 and 1. The most similar pair, Ser and Thr, has <italic>ΔUi</italic> = 0 and the most dissimilar pair is Asp and Try with <italic>ΔUi</italic> = 1. These studies show that <italic>ΔUi</italic> is a strong determinant of the evolutionary rates of DNA sequences and that large-step changes (i.e., large <italic>ΔUi</italic>’s) are more acutely “recognized” by natural selection. These large-step changes are either highly deleterious or highly advantageous. Most strikingly, advantageous mutations are enriched with AA pairs of <italic>ΔUi</italic> &gt; 0.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen, He, et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>To analyze the properties of CDNs, we choose 6 cancer types from <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> that have the largest sample sizes (<bold>n</bold> &gt; 500) but leap over kidney since kidney cancers have unusually low CDN counts. In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, we divide the CDNs into groups according to the number of recurrences, <italic>i</italic>. CDNs of similar <italic>i</italic>’s are merged into the same group in the descending order of <italic>i</italic>, until there are at least 10 CDNs in the group. The 6 cancer types show two clear trends: 1) the proportion of CDNs with <italic>ΔUi</italic> &gt; 0.8 (red color segments) increases in groups with higher recurrences; 2) in contrast, the proportion of CDNs with <italic>ΔUi</italic> &lt; 0.4 (green segments) decreases as recurrences increase. These two trends would mean that highly recurrent CDNs tend to involve larger AA distances (<italic>ΔUi</italic> &gt; 0.8) and similar AAs tend not to manifest strong fitness increases. In general, CDNs alter amino acids in ways that expose the changes to strong selection.</p>

<label>3.</label><title>CDNs in relation to the genes harboring them</title>
<p>We shall use the term “CDN genes” for genes having at least one CDN site. Since CDN genes contribute to tumorigenesis when harboring a CDN mutation, they should be considered cancer drivers as well. CDN genes have two desirable qualities for recognition as driver genes. First, CDNs are straightforward and unambiguous to define (e.g., <italic>i</italic> ≥ 3 for <bold>n</bold> &lt; 1000). In the literature, there have been multiple definitions of cancer driver genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Reimand and Bader 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Porta-Pardo and Godzik 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mularoni et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arnedo-Pac et al. 2019</xref>), resulting in only modest overlaps among cancer gene lists (see Fig. S3). Second, the evolutionary fitness of CDN, and hence the tumorigenic potentials of CDN genes, can be computed (supplement File S1).</p>
<p>We now present the analyses of CDN genes, using the same 6 cancers of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Two types of CDN genes are shown in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Type I genes fulfill the conventional criterion of fast evolution with the whole-gene Ka/Ks (or dN/dS) significantly larger than 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Martincorena et al. 2017</xref>). Averaged across cancer types, Type I overlaps by 95.7% with the canonical CDG list, which is the union of three popular lists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bailey et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sondka et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Martínez-Jiménez et al. 2020</xref>). Type I genes are mostly well-known canonical CDGs (e.g., <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, and <italic>EGFR</italic>).</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl3" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<label>Table 3</label>
<caption><title>Distribution of CDNs among genes.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="596367v1_tbl3.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>Type II (CDN genes) is the new class of cancer driver genes. These genes have CDNs but do not meet the conventional criteria of whole-gene analysis. Obviously, if a gene has only one or two CDNs plus some sporadic hits, the whole-gene Ka/Ks would not be significantly greater than 1. As shown in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, over 80% of CDN genes have only 1∼2 CDN sites. The salient result is that Type II genes outnumber Type I genes by a ratio of 5 : 1 (229 : 45, column 8, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Furthermore, Type II genes overlap with the canonical CDG list by only 23%.</p>
<p>Type II genes represent a new class of cancer drivers that concentrate their tumorigenic strength on a small number CDN sites. They have been missed by the conventional whole-gene definition of cancer drivers. One such example is the <italic>FGFR3</italic> gene in lung cancer. This gene of 809 codons has only 8 hits, among which one is a CDN (<italic>i</italic> = 3) in lung cancer. It is noticed solely for this CDN. In the supplemental text, we briefly annotate these new cancer driver genes for comparisons with the canonical driver genes (supplement File S1). Possible functional tests in the future can be found in Discussion.</p>
<p>We now briefly discuss the driver genes listed in previous studies as shown at the lower part of <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bailey et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sondka et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Martínez-Jiménez et al. 2020</xref>). From the total number of CDGs listed, it is clear that the overlaps are limited. As analyzed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wu et al. 2016</xref>), conventional gene lists overlap mainly by a core set of high Ka/Ks genes. This core set has not changed much as various criteria such the replication timing, expression profiles, epigenetic features are introduced. These criteria are the reasons for the many CDGs recognized by only a small subset of CDG lists. CDN genes, in contrast, can be objectively defined as CDN mutations (<italic>i</italic> recurrences in <bold>n</bold> samples) themselves are unambiguous.</p>
<sec id="s2c1">
<title>Variation in CDN number and tumorigenic contribution among genes</title>
<p>By and large, the distribution of CDNs among genes is very uneven. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> shows 10 genes with at least 6 CDNs whereas 87 genes have only one CDN. Two genes stand out for the number of CDNs they harbor, <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, which also happen to be the only genes mutated in &gt;15% of all cancer patients surveyed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kandoth et al. 2013</xref>). Clearly, the prevalence of mutations in a gene is a function of the number of strong CDNs it harbors.</p>

<label>Figure 3:</label>

<graphic xlink:href="596367v1_fig3.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Although a small number of genes have unusually high number of CDNs, these genes may not drive the tumorigenesis in proportion to their CDN numbers in individual patients. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> shows the number of CDN mutations on <italic>TP53</italic> that occur in any single patient. Usually, only one CDN change is observed in a patient whereas 2 or 3 CDN mutations are expected. It thus appears that CDNs on the same genes are redundant in their tumorigenic effects such that the second hit may not yield additional advantages. This pattern of disproportionally lower contribution by CDN-rich genes is true in other genes such as <italic>EGFR</italic> and <italic>KRAS</italic>. Consequently, the large number of genes with only 1 or 2 CDN sites are disproportionately important in driving the tumorigenesis of individual patients.</p>

<label>4.</label><title>CDNs in relation to the cancer types - The pan-cancer properties</title>
<p>In the current literature, cancer driver genes (however they are defined) generally meet the statistical criteria for driver genes in only one or a few cancer types. However, genes may in fact contribute to tumorigenesis but are insufficiently prevalent to meet the statistical requirements for CDGs. Many genes are indeed marginally qualified as drivers in some tissues and barely miss the statistical cutoff in others. To see if genes that drive tumorigenesis in multiple tissues are more common than currently understood, we need to raise the sensitivity of cancer driver detection. Thus, CDNs may provide the resolution.</p>
<p>To test the pan-cancer driving capacity of CDNs, we define <italic>i<sub>max</sub></italic> as the largest <italic>i</italic> values among the 12 cancer types for each CDN. The number of cancer types where the said mutation can be detected (i.e., <italic>i</italic> &gt; 0) is designated NC12. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> presents the relationship between the observed NC12 of each CDN against <italic>i<sub>max</sub></italic> of that CDN. Clearly, many CDNs are observed in multiple cancer types (NC12 &gt; 3), even though they do not qualify as a driver gene in all but a single cancer type. It happens frequently when a mutation has <italic>i</italic> &gt; 3 in one cancer type but has <italic>i</italic> &lt; 3 in others. One extreme example is C394 and G395 in <italic>IDH1</italic>. In CNS, both sites show <italic>i</italic> ≫ 3, while in 6 other cancer types (lung, breast, large intestine, prostate, urinary tract, liver), their hits are <italic>i</italic> &lt; 3 but &gt; 0. Conditional on a specific site informed by a cancer type, a mutation in another cancer type should be very unlikely if the mutation is not tumorigenic in multiple tissues. Hence, the pattern in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> is interpreted to be drivers in multiple cancer types, but with varying statistical strength.</p>

The blue and red dots denote, respectively, mutations classified as a CDN in one or multiple cancer types. Grey dots are non-CDNs. The table in the lower panel summarizes the number of sites and the number of genes harboring these sites.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="596367v1_fig4.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Examining <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> more carefully, we could see that CDNs with a larger <italic>i<sub>max</sub></italic> in one cancer type are more likely to be identified as CDNs in multiple cancer types (red dots, <italic>r</italic> = 0.97, p = 9.23×10<sup>−5</sup>, Pearson’s correlation test). Of 22 sites with <italic>i<sub>max</sub></italic> &gt; 20, 15 are identified as CDNs (<italic>i</italic> ≥ 3) in multiple cancer types, with a median NC12 of 9. On the opposite end, 2 CDNs with <italic>i<sub>max</sub></italic> &gt; 20 are observed in only one cancer type (<italic>EGFR</italic>: T2573 in lung and <italic>FGFR2</italic>: C755 in endometrium cancer). The bimodal pattern suggests that a few cancer driver mutations are tissue specific whereas most others appear to have pan-cancer driving potentials.</p>
<p>To conclude, when a driver is observed in more than one cancer type, it is often a cancer driver in many others, but insufficiently powerful to meet the statistical criteria for driver mutations. This pan-cancer property can be seen at the higher resolution of CDN, but is often missed at the whole-gene level. Cancers of the same tissue in different patients, often reported to have divergent mutation profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Nik-Zainal et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Roberts and Gordenin 2014</xref>), should be a good test of this hypothesis.</p>

<label>5.</label><title>CDNs in relation to individual patients and therapeutic strategies</title>
<p>In previous sections, the focus is on the population of cancer patients; for example, how many in the patient population have certain mutations. We now direct the attention to individual patients. It would be necessary to pinpoint the CDN mutations in each patient in order to delineate the specific evolutionary path and to devise the treatment strategy. We shall first address the cancer driving power of CDN vs. non-CDN mutations in the same gene.</p>
<sec id="s2e1">
<title>1) Efficacy of targeted therapy against CDNs vs non-CDNs</title>
<p>In general, a patient would have many point mutations, only a few of which are strong CDNs. We may ask whether most mutations on the canonical genes, such as <italic>EGFR</italic>, are CDNs. Presumably, synonymous, and likely many nonsynonymous, mutations on canonical genes may not be CDNs. It would be logical to hypothesize that patients whose <italic>EGFR</italic> has a CDN mutation (Group1 patients) should benefit from the gene-targeted therapy more than patients with a non-CDN mutation on the same gene (Group2 patients). In the second group, <italic>EFGR</italic> may be a non-driver of tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">AACR Project GENIE Consortium 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Choudhury et al. 2023</xref>) are re-analyzed as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. The hypothesis that patients of Group2 would not benefit as much as those of Group1 is supported by the analysis. This pattern further strengthens the underlying assumption that non-CDN mutations, even on canonical genes, are not cancer drivers.</p>

<title>2) Number of CDNs in each patient</title>
<p>We postulate that a full set of CDNs should be able to inform about the cause of each cancer as well as the design of gene-targeted therapy. In <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the known CDNs based on TCGA are tallied.

<p>In most cancer types, 10%∼30% of patients, shown in the <bold>n<sub>0</sub></bold> row of <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, have no known CDNs (and &gt;50% among breast cancer patients). Hence, the current practice is to rely on missense mutations, regardless of CDNs or non-CDNs, on the canonical genes. The CDN column vs. the gene column in <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> address this issue. For example, the CDN column suggests that 33% of lung cancer patients (the <bold>n<sub>0</sub></bold> row) would not respond well to gene-targeted therapy whereas the gene column show only 5.3%. The difference is due to a higher, and likely inflated, detection rate of candidate drivers in the gene column. We suggest that patients who have a non-CDN mutation on a driver gene would not respond to the targeted therapy against that gene, as demonstrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. In the above example, 27.7% (33%∼5.3%) of patients may be subjected to the targeted treatment but may not respond well.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e3">
<title>3) Prevalence vs. potency of CDN-bearing genes in driving tumorigenesis</title>
<p>The last question is the relationship between mutation prevalence and tumorigenic strength (or potency) among CDN-bearing genes. For example, when a patient is diagnosed to have 5 CDNs in 5 genes, what may be their relative contributions to the tumorigenesis? Are they equally valid candidates for targeted therapy? It would seem logical that canonical CDGs with many CDNs should be the targets. However, because these genes would contribute at most one CDN to the tumorigenesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), targeting a high prevalence gene may not yield more benefits to the patients than targeting a low prevalence gene that has a CDN.</p>
<p>The implication is that prevalence and potency of CDNs may not be strongly correlated. Some genes may be prevalently mutated in the patient population but, in each affected patient, these genes may not be more potent than the less prevalent genes with a CDN mutation. Potency can be tested in vitro by gene editing or in vivo by targeting treatment. In this interpretation, targeting a CDN of low prevalence (say, <italic>i</italic> = 3) may be as effective in treatment as targeting a high prevalence CDN with <italic>i</italic> = 20. The model and <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> present this hypothesis based on cancer hallmarks.</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl5" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<label>Table 5</label>
<caption><title>Gene numbers for different cancer hallmarks.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="596367v1_tbl5.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>The hallmarks of cancer were first proposed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hanahan and Weinberg 2000</xref>) with several updates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hanahan and Weinberg 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hanahan 2022</xref>). Each hallmark is a cancer phenotype shown in <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> that lists the number of genes involved in each particular hallmark (see <bold>Methods</bold>). While each hallmark may be associated with a number of genes, many genes are also involved in multiple hallmarks. As even the highly prevalent genes would usually have at most one mutation in each patient, we assume that each gene is associated with one hallmark in each patient.</p>
<p>Suppose that tumorigenesis requires a mutation in most (but perhaps not all) of the hallmarks, then the number of mutation combinations would be the product of all numbers in the corresponding column. For breast cancer, it would be 8 × 12 × 4 …. × 11 × 2 ∼ 1.7 × 10<sup>11</sup>. In other words, the possible mutation combinations that can drive breast cancer is over a billion. Hence, two breast cancers are unlikely to have the same set of CDGs or CDNs. In this view, the prevalence of a gene would be inversely proportional to the hallmark gene number. For example, genes of “<italic>invasion and metastasis</italic>” in breast cancer would have a prevalence of &lt; 1/52. In contrast, the potency in tumorigenesis should depend on the hallmark phenotype itself, and independent of gene number for that hallmark. In this example, each gene of “<italic>invasion and metastasis</italic>” may be lowly prevalent, but could also be highly potent in each patient.</p>
<p>In short, the prevalence and potency of CDNs may be poorly correlated. The hypothesis can be functionally tested (by gene-editing in vitro or targeting treatment in vivo) in conjunction with the data on the attraction (i.e., co-occurrences) vs repulsion (lack of co-occurrences) of CDNs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The companion study presents the theory that computes the limit of recurrences (<italic>i</italic>/<bold>n</bold>, <italic>i</italic> times in <bold>n</bold> patients) of reachable by neutral mutations. Above the cutoff (e.g., 3/1000), a recurrent mutation is deemed an advantageous CDN. At present, the power of CDN analysis is hampered by the still small sample sizes, generally between 300 and 3000. We show that, when <bold>n</bold> reaches 10<sup>5</sup>, a mutation only has to recur 12 times to be shown as a CDN, i.e., 25 times more sensitive than 3/1000. In short, nearly all CDNs should be discovered with <bold>n</bold> ≥ 10<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we apply the theory on existing data to characterize the discovered CDNs. Based on the TCGA data, this study concludes that each cancer patient carries only 1∼2 CDNs, whereas 6∼10 drivers are usually hypothesized to be present in each cancer genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hanahan and Weinberg 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Vogelstein et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Campbell et al. 2020</xref>). This deficit signifies the current incomplete understanding of cancer driving potentials. Across patients of the same cancer type, about 50 to 150 CDNs have been discovered for each cancer type, representing perhaps only 10% of all possible CDNs. Given a complete set of CDNs, it should be possible to delineate the path of tumor evolution for each individual patient.</p>
<p>Direct functional test of CDNs would be to introduce putative cancer-driving mutations and observe the evolution of tumors. Such a task of introducing multiple mutations that are collectively needed to drive tumorigenesis has been done only recently, and only for the best-known cancer driving mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ortmann et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Takeda et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hodis et al. 2022</xref>). In most tumors, the correct combination of mutations needed is not known. Clearly, CDNs, with their strong tumorigenic strength, are suitable candidates.</p>
<p>Many CDNs in a patient may not fall on conventional CDGs, whereas these conventional CDGs may have passenger or weak mutations. Therefore, the efforts in gene-targeting therapy may well be shifted to the CDN-harboring genes. Given a complete set of CDNs, many more driver genes can be identified. Since many driver genes cannot be targeted for biological or technical reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dang et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Danesi et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Waarts et al. 2022</xref>), a large set of CDGs will be desirable. The goal is that each cancer patient would have at least one targetable CDG driven by its CDN. In fact, it would be most beneficial if patients can have multiple targetable CDGs. In that case, the probability that resistant mutations eluding multiple targeting drugs should be diminished.</p>
<p>Another interesting insight revealed may be the distributions of CDNs across different cancer types. It suggests that CDNs previously identified to be cancer-specific may have pan-cancer effects. Such recurrences across cancer types are likely selection-driven but, in many cancer types, the strength is not sufficient to rise above the statistical threshold. While tumorigenesis in the same tissue type is a process of massively repeated evolution, cancer evolution in different tissues represents massive parallel evolution. The parallelism represents processes driven by the same selective forces (for cell proliferation) under different ecological conditions.</p>
<p>CDNs can also be used in cancer screening with the advantage of efficiency as the targeted mutations are fewer. Being efficient, the false negative rate should be lower too. Most interesting of all, the false positive rate should be far lower than the gene-based screen which often shows a false positive rate of &gt;50% (supplement File S1).</p>
<p>Cancer evolution falls within the realm of ultra-microevolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wu et al. 2016</xref>). The repeated evolution addresses the single most severe criticism of evolutionary studies, namely all evolutionary events have a sample size of one. Individual advantageous mutations should repeat themselves as CDNs. Mutations that have been favored by positive selection in each individual patient are also the most fruitful targets in cancer therapy. The two studies thus unite evolutionary biology and cancer medicine.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Data preparation</title>
<p>Single-nucleotide variant (SNV) data for TCGA patients were downloaded from the GDC Data Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/</ext-link>). Mutations exceeding a 1‰ frequency in the Genome Aggregation Database (<italic>gnomAD</italic>) were excluded to minimize potential false positives arising from germline variants. Patients with more than 3000 coding region point mutations were filtered out as potential hypermutator phenotypes. This filtering process yielded a final analysis set encompassing 7369 patients across 12 diverse cancer types for subsequent analysis. The calculation of <bold><italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic></bold> and <bold><italic>S<sub>i</sub></italic></bold> follows the same method as described in the companion paper.</p>
<p>For CDN analysis in non-cancerous tissues, mutation profiles for normal tissues were retrieved from <italic>SomaMutDB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sun et al. 2022</xref>). Mutations from different samples originating from the same individual were consolidated. Donners above the age of 80 were excluded from our dataset. The mutation processing followed the same pipeline as previously described. In total, we have mutation profiles from 487 donners serving as a negative control.</p>
<p>The canonical lists of cancer driver genes were obtained from three distinct data sources. The CGC Tier 1 genes, encompassing genes with the highest confidence of driver status, were retrieved from the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census">https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sondka et al. 2018</xref>). The IntOGen driver gene list, which employs an integrated pipeline for gene discovery, was downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.intogen.org/download">https://www.intogen.org/download</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Martínez-Jiménez et al. 2020</xref>). Bailey’s driver gene list comprises 299 cancer driver genes identified through a PanSoftware strategy, with further experimental validation confirming their role in driving cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bailey et al. 2018</xref>). The consistency of cancer types across all studies was manually verified using oncotree (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://oncotree.mskcc.org/#/home">https://oncotree.mskcc.org/#/home</ext-link>). For the analysis of driver gene overlap, only drivers from the same cancer type were compared.</p>
<p>The hallmark annotation of genes is downloaded from COSMIC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/download">https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/download</ext-link>), encompassing 331 genes with annotated dysregulated biological processes. It is important to note that these hallmarks are manually annotated as part of an ongoing effort to characterize the role of genes in cancer based on literature evidence. The actual scale of hallmark genes may be substantially larger than the current version.</p>
<p>For gene-level selection analysis, we utilized the R package ‘<italic>dndscv</italic>’ to quantify selection signals for missense and nonsense mutations in a given gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Martincorena et al. 2017</xref>). Specifically, the package calculates the Ka/Ks ratio, denoted as ‘<bold><italic>w</italic></bold>’ in the final results, for a given mutation impact (missense or nonsense). The significance of selection is presented as <italic>q</italic> values after Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjustment. Genes with <bold><italic>w</italic></bold> &gt; 1 and <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.1 were identified as being significantly under positive selection.</p>
<p>We employ <italic>i*</italic> = 3 as a cutoff for identifying Cancer Driving Nucleotides (CDNs) across various cancer types. The specific value of <italic>i*</italic> is detailed in Eq. 10 of the companion paper (supplement File S2). Here, <italic>i*</italic> = 3 is chosen consistently across all cancer types, taking into account the abundance of sites under positive selection given <italic>i</italic> = 3 in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Throughout our analysis, emphasis is placed on CDNs of the missense category, where missense mutations with a recurrence ≥3 are identified as CDNs. For <italic>ΔUi</italic> analysis, the reference table for 75 single-step amino acid changes was obtained from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen, He, et al. 2019</xref>), and the <italic>ΔUi</italic> for each CDN is derived by mapping the amino acid change to the reference table.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Calculation of <italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic>_e</title>
<p>We employ Eq. 9 from the companion paper to calculate the expected value for <bold><italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic></bold> under neutrality. For a given site, the cumulative probability for recurrence <italic>x</italic> ≤ <italic>i</italic> − 1 could be expressed as:
<disp-formula id="eqnS1">
<graphic xlink:href="596367v1_eqnS1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <bold>n</bold> is the population size of a given cancer type, and <bold>E(u)</bold> is the mutation rate per site per patient derived from singleton synonymous mutations:
<disp-formula id="eqnS2">
<graphic xlink:href="596367v1_eqnS2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Then by expectation, site number of recurrence <italic>i</italic> (<bold><italic>A</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic>x</italic></bold>≥<italic>i</italic></sub>) could be represented by:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="596367v1_ueqnS1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Following the same logic, we’ll have <bold><italic>A</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic>x</italic></bold>≥<italic>i</italic>+1</sub> as:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="596367v1_ueqnS2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Then the expected value for <bold><italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic>_e</bold> is then:
<disp-formula id="eqnS3">
<graphic xlink:href="596367v1_eqnS3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
<bold><italic>L<sub>A</sub></italic></bold> and <bold><italic>L<sub>S</sub></italic></bold> are missense and synonymous sites, respectively. The calculation procedure is described in methods of the companion paper (supplement File S2).</p>
<p>With Eqs. S1∼S3, we could solve for the expected number of sites with missense mutation recurrence <italic>i</italic>.</p>

<title>Survival analysis of <italic>EGFR</italic>-targeted therapy</title>
<p>The mutation and clinical profiles of 23,253 patients were retrieved from the GENIE project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cerami et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">de Bruijn et al. 2023</xref>), with 7,216 patients harboring <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations. Survivor months were calculated as the time elapsed between the date of sequencing and the date of the last contact (or day of death). In cases where patients had multiple sequencing reports, the earliest one was selected. For CDN calling, we applied Eq. 10 from the companion paper (supplement File S2). With ε = 0.01, we set the CDN cutoff <italic>i*</italic> = 14. To mitigate potential biases from other common drivers in lung cancer, patients with indels in exon 19 and 20 of <italic>EGFR</italic>, G12/13 mutations in <italic>KRAS</italic>, V600 mutations in <italic>BRAF</italic>, exon 20 insertions in <italic>HER2</italic>, fusions in <italic>MET</italic>, <italic>ALK</italic>, <italic>ROS1</italic>, <italic>RET</italic>, <italic>NTRK</italic>, and <italic>MET</italic> were filtered out. The final survival analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism 8.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Annotation for non-canonical CDN genes</title>
<p>We conducted functional annotation and enrichment analysis for newly identified non-canonical CDN genes using four independent databases (Gene Ontology, KEGG, Disease Ontology, and Reactome) with R packages (<italic>clusterProfiler</italic>, <italic>DOSE</italic>, <italic>ReactomePA</italic>). For each analysis, we set a <italic>p</italic>-value cutoff of 0.05 and a <italic>q</italic>-value cutoff of 0.2, with <italic>p</italic> value adjustment method set to “BH”. To explore the connections between non-canonical CDN genes and canonical cancer driver genes (CDGs), enrichment analyses were performed alongside cancer drivers from IntOGen. Specifically, for enrichment annotations related to cancer hallmarks, the corresponding genes were subjected to manual confirmation using CancerGeneNET (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://signor.uniroma2.it/CancerGeneNet/">https://signor.uniroma2.it/CancerGeneNet/</ext-link>).</p>

<p>The study investigates Cancer Driving Nucleotides (CDNs) using the TCGA database, finding that these recurring point mutations could greatly enhance our understanding of cancer genomics and improve personalized treatment strategies. Despite identifying 50-150 CDNs per cancer type, the research reveals that a significant number remain undiscovered, limiting current therapeutic applications, and underscoring the need for further larger-scale research.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study provides a detailed examination of cancer-driving mutations at the nucleotide level, offering a more precise understanding than traditional gene-level analyses. The authors found a significant number of CDNs remain undiscovered, with only 0-2 identified per patient out of an expected 5-8, indicating that many important mutations are still missing. The study indicated that identifying more CDNs could potentially significantly impact the development of personalized cancer therapies, improving patient outcomes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study is constrained by relatively small sample sizes for each cancer type, which reduces the statistical power and robustness of the findings. ICGC and other large-scale WGS datasets are publicly available but were not included in this study.</p>
<p>To be able to identify rare driver mutations, more samples are needed to improve the statistical power, which is well-known in cancer research.</p>
<p>The challenges in direct functional testing of CDNs due to the complexity of tumor evolution and unknown mutation combinations limit the practical applicability of the findings.</p>
<p>The QC of the TCGA data was not very strict, i.e, &quot;patients with more than 3000 coding region point mutations were filtered out as potential hypermutator phenotypes&quot;, it would be better to remove patients beyond +/- 3*S.D from the mean number of mutations for each cancer type. Given some point mutations with &gt;3 hits in the TCGA dataset, they were just false positive mutation callings, particularly in the large repeat regions in the human genome.</p>
<p>The codes for the statistical calculation (i.e., calculation of Ai_e, et al) are not publicly available, which makes the findings hard to be replicated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study proposes that many cancer driver mutations are not yet identified but could be identified if they harbor recurrent SNVs. The paper leverages the analysis from Paper #1 that used quantitative analysis to demonstrate that SNVs or CDNs seen 3 or more times are more likely to occur due to selection (ie a driver mutation) than they are to occur by chance or random mutation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Empirically, mutation frequency is an excellent marker of a driver gene because canonical driver mutations typically have recurrent SNVs. Using the TCGA database, the paper illustrates that CDNs can identify canonical driver mutations (Figure 3) and that most CDNs are likely to disrupt protein function (Figure 2). In addition, CDNs can be shared between cancer types (Figure 4).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Driver alteration validation is difficult, with disagreements on what defines a driver mutation, and how many driver mutations are present in a cancer. The value proposed by the authors is that the identification of all driver genes can facilitate the design of patient-specific targeting therapies, but most targeted therapies are already directed towards known driver genes. There is an incomplete discussion of oncogenes (where activating mutations tend to target a single amino acid or repeat) and tumor suppressor genes (where inactivating mutations may be more spread across the gene). Other alterations (epigenetic, indels, translocations, CNVs) would be missed by this type of analysis.</p>
<p>The method could be more valuable when applied to the noncoding genome, where driver mutations in promoters or enhancers are relatively rare, or as yet to be discovered. Increasingly more cancers have had whole genome sequencing. Compared to WES, criteria for driver mutations in noncoding regions are less clear, and this method could potentially provide new noncoding driver CDNs. Observing the same mutation in more than one cancer specimen is empirically unusual, and the authors provide a solid quantitative analysis that indicates many recurrent mutations are likely to be cancer-driver mutations.</p>

<p>We are grateful to the reviewers and editors for their insightful comments. All recognized that, while mutation recurrences have been used for inferring cancer drivers, our approach has the rigor of quantitative analysis. We would like to add that, without rigorously ruling out mutational hotspots, most CDNs have not been accepted as driver mutations.</p>
<p>This paper develops the theory stating that (i) recurrent point mutations are true Cancer Driving Nucleotides (CDNs); and (ii) non-recurrent mutations are unlikely to be CDNs. The reviewers question that, with the theory, we still have not discovered new driving mutations. This is done in the companion paper. Table 3 shows that, averaged across cancer types, the conventional method would identify 45 CDGs while the CDN method tallies 258 CDGs. The power of the CDN method in identifying new driver genes is evident.</p>
<p>The second question is &quot;By this theory, will we be able discover most CDNs when the sample size increases from ~ 1000 to 10,000?&quot; This is a question of forecast and can be partially answered using GENIE data. Fig. 7 of this study shows that, when n increases from ~ 1000 to ~ 9,000, the numbers of discovered CDNs increase by 3 – 5 fold, most of which come from the two-hit class, as expected.</p>
<p>Fig. 7 also addresses the queries whether we have used datasets other than TCGA. We indeed have used all public data, including GENIE, ICGC and other integrated resources such as COSMIC. For the main study, we rely on TCGA because it is unbiased for estimating the probability of CDN occurrences. In many datasets, the numerators are given but the denominators are not (the number of patients with the mutation / the total number of patients surveyed).</p>
<p>The third question is about mutation recurrences among cancer types. As stated by one reviewer, &quot;different cancer types have unique mutational landscapes&quot;. While this is true when the analysis is done at the whole-gene level, one gets a different picture at the nucleotide level where the resolution is much higher. The pan-cancer trend of point mutations is evident in Fig. 4 of the companion paper.</p>
<p>Again, we heartily appreciate the criticisms and suggestions of the reviewers and editors!</p>
