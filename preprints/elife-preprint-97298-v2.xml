<title>Abstract</title><p>Seasonal polyphenism enables organisms to adapt to environmental challenges by increasing phenotypic diversity. <italic>Cacopsylla chinensis</italic> exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism, specifically in the form of summer-form and winter-form, which have distinct morphological phenotypes. Previous research has shown that low temperature and the temperature receptor <italic>CcTRPM</italic> regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> by impacting cuticle content and thickness. However, the underling neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. Bursicon, also known as the tanning hormone, is responsible for the hardening and darkening of the insect cuticle. In this study, we report for the first time on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Firstly, we identified <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β as two typical subunits of Bursicon in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, which were regulated by low temperature (10°C) and <italic>CcTRPM</italic>. Subsequently, <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β formed a heterodimer that mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing the cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the up-stream signaling of the chitin biosyntheis pathway, regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Finally, we discovered that miR-6012 directly targets <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>, contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. In summary, these findings reveal the novel function of neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism and provide critical insights into insect Bursicon and its receptor.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polyphenism is a transformation phenomenon of phenotypic plasticity, where a single genome produces multiple distinct phenotypes in response to environmental cues (Simpson and Sword, 2011). In recent years, polyphenism has garnered increasing attention and has become a focal point of research, such as ecology, evolutionary biology, epigenetics, and entomology. Nature presents us with numerous remarkable examples of polyphenism. For instance, we observe seasonal polyphenism in psylla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Butt and Stuart, 1986</xref>) and butterflies (Emily et al., 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baudach and Vilcinskas, 2021</xref>), sexual and wing polyphenism in aphids and planthoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Shang et al., 2020</xref>), caste polyphenism in ants and honeybees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kucharski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonasio et al., 2012</xref>), sex determination in reptiles and fish regulated by temperature and social factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Janzen and Phillips, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), and environmentally induced polyphenism in plants (Gratani, 2014). Undoubtedly, polyphenism plays a major contributor to the population dynamics of insects worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Noor et al., 2008</xref>). Numerous studies have reported that insect polyphenism is influenced by a range of external environment factors, such as temperature, population density, photoperiod, and dietary nutrition (Simpson and Sword, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">An et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, internal neuro-hormones, including insulin, dopamine, and ecdysone, have been found to play crucial roles in insect polyphenism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Uehara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Vellichirammal et al., 2017</xref>). However, the specific molecular mechanism underling temperature-dependent polyphenism still require further clarification.</p>
<p><italic>Cacopsylla chinensis</italic> (Yang &amp; Li) is a pear psylla belonging to Hemiptera order, which causes severe damage to trees and fruits in the major pear production areas across East Asian countries, including China and Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hildebrand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wei et al., 2020</xref>). This phloem-sucking psylla inflicts harm on young shoots and leaves in both adult and nymph stages, leading to stunted and withered pear trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ge et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>C. chinensis</italic> secretes a substantial amount of honeydew and acts as a vector for plant pathogenic microorganisms, such as the phytoplasma of pear decline disease and <italic>Erwinia amovora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hildebrand et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, this pest demonstrates strong adaptability to its environment and exhibits seasonal polyphenism, manifesting as summer-form (SF) and winter-form (WF), which display significant differences in morphological characteristics throughout the seasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). The summer-form has a lighter body color and causes more severe damage, while the winter-form, in contrast, has a brown to dark brown body color, a larger body size, and stronger resistance to weather condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Tougeron et al., 2021</xref>). In a previous study, Zhang et al. demonstrated that a low temperature of 10°C and the temperature receptor <italic>CcTRPM</italic> regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> by affecting cuticle thickness and chitin content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Up to now, no insect hormones or neuropeptides underling this seasonal polyphenism in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> have been identified.</p>
<p>Bursicon, also known as the tanning hormone, was initially discovered in the 1960s through neck-ligated assays. It serves a highly conserved function in insects by inducing the clerotization and melanization of the new cuticle in larvae and facilitating wing expansion in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dewey et al., 2004</xref>). Bursicon is a heterodimer neuropeptide composed of two subunits, Bursicon-α and Bursicon-β, which exert their effects through the leucine-rich repeats-containing G- protein-coupled receptor, also known as the Bursicon receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Luo et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, flies with mutated Bursicon receptor, such as the <italic>rk</italic> gene, or deficient in one of Bursicon subunits, exhibit improper tanning and altered body shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Luan et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, in the model insect <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, RNA interference experiments have demonstrated that the Bursicon receptor (<italic>Tcrk</italic>) is not only required for cuticle tanning, but also crucial for the development and expansion of integumentary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai and Palli, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, it has been reported that Bursicon homodimers can activate the NF-kB transcription factor <italic>Relish</italic>, leading to the induction of innate immune and stress genes during molting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">An et al., 2012</xref>). Consequently, insects exposed to cold conditions exhibit larger body size and darker cuticular melanization than those reared in warmer environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Shearer et al., 2016</xref>). Given this background, Bursicon and its receptor are expected to play a significant role in the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>.</p>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are approximately 23 nucleotides in length and belong to a class of small noncoding RNAs, play a crucial role in the regulation of posttranscriptional gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lucas and Raikhel, 2013</xref>). Increasing studies have shown that miRNAs are important in insect polyphenism, such as miR-31, miR-9, and miR-252, as well as hormone signaling, for examples, miR-133 in dopamine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Shang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). However, there have been no reports on miRNAs targeting Bursicon and its receptor. Therefore, studying the molecular mechanism of miRNA regulation of the Bursicon receptor at the post-transcriptional level would be highly innovation. In this study, we conducted bioinformatics analysis, qRT-PCR, and Western blot to identify two Bursicon subunits (<italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β) and their association with low temperature of 10°C. We then employed RNAi, cuticle staining, and transmission electron microscopy to study the effects of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β on cuticle content, cuticle thickness, and the transition percent from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Furthermore, we identified <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> as the Bursicon receptor and investigated its role in the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Finally, through <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, we discovered that miR-6012 targets <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> and is involved in the seasonal polyphenism. These efforts not only shed light on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in mediating the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, but also enhance our understanding of the neuroendocrine basis of insect seasonal polyphenism.</p>

<title>Investigation of the relationship between nymph phenotype, cuticle pigment absorbance, and cuticle thickness during the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic></title>
<p>In <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, exposure to a low temperature of 10°C triggers the activation of the temperature receptor <italic>CcTRPM</italic>, leading to the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing cuticle tanning and cuticle thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>To elucidate the association between these parameters and the cuticle tanning threshold, we investigated nymph phenotypes, cuticle pigment absorbance levels, and cuticle thickness in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> over varying time intervals (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days) under either 10°C or 25°C temperature conditions. Nymphs exhibited a light yellow and transparent hue at 3, 6, and 9 days, while those at 12 and 15 days displayed shades of yellow-green or blue-yellow under 25°C conditions. Conversely, under 10°C conditions, nymphs darkened at the abdomen’s end at 3, 6, and 9 days, developed numerous light black stripes on their chest and abdomen at 12 days, and presented an overall black-brown appearance with dark brown stripes on the left and right sides of each chest and abdominal section at 15 days (Figure S1A). Notably, the abdomen and back exhibited a pronounced black-brown coloration at 10°C. The UV absorbance of the total pigment extraction at a wavelength of 300 nm significantly increased following 10°C exposure for 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days compared to the 25°C treatment group (Figure S1B). Moreover, cuticle thicknesses exhibited an increase following 10°C exposure for 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days compared to the 25°C treatment group (Figure S1C).</p>

<title>Molecular identification of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β in <italic>C. chinensis</italic></title>
<p>Sequence analysis showed that the open reading frame (ORF) of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α (GenBank: OR488624) was 480 bp long, encoding a predicted polypeptide of 159 amino acids. The polypeptide had a molecular weight of 17.45 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point (<italic>pI</italic>) of 6.13. The complete ORF of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β (GenBank: OR488625) was 405 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 134 amino acids residues. The predicated molecular weight of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β was 15.21 kDa and a theoretical <italic>pI</italic> of 5.24. Amino acid sequence alignment analysis revealed that CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β shared high amino acid identity with homologs from other selected insect species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Both subunits contained eleven conserved cysteine residues, marked with red stars. Phylogenetic analysis (Figure S2A and S2B) indicated that <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α was most closely related to the <italic>DcBurs-</italic>α homologue (<italic>Diaphorina citri</italic>, XP_008468249.2), while <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β was most closely related to <italic>DcBurs-</italic>β (<italic>D. citri</italic>, AWT50591.1) among the selected species. The potential tertiary protein structure and molecular docking of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β were constructed using the Phyre<sup>2</sup> server and PyMOL-v1.3r1 software (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). To investigate the identities of homodimer and heterodimer of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β, SDS-PAGE with reduced and non-reduced gels was used. When expressed as individual subunits, they formed α+α and β+β homodimers, as the molecular size of α or β doubled in the non-reduced gel compared to the reduced gel (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). When co-expressed, most α and β subunits formed the <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α<italic>+</italic>β heterodimer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>The temporal expression profile revealed that both <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β were ubiquitous in all developmental stages, with lower expression in eggs and nymphs and higher expression in adults of both summer-form and winter-form (Figure S3A and S3D). Increased gene expression levels may potentially contribute to the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Spatially, <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β were detected in all investigated nymph tissues and were expressed most prominently in the head (Figure S3E and S3F). In addition to the midgut, both <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β showed higher expression in other selected tissues of the winter-form compared to the summer-form, especially in the head and cuticle. Results from temperature treatment exhibited that the mRNA expression of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β significantly increased after 10°C treatment for 3, 6, and 10 days compared to 25°C treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). Meanwhile, qRT-PCR results indicated that the transcription levels of both <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β were noticeably down-regulated after successful knockdown of the temperature receptor <italic>CcTRPM</italic> by RNAi at 3, 6, and 10 days (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>, S4). These data suggest that <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β are regulated by a low temperature of 10°C and <italic>CcTRPM</italic>, and may serve as down-stream signals involved in the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>.</p>

<p>To investigate the role of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β in the transition from summer-form to winter-form of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, newly hatched 1st instar nymphs of summer-form were fed with dsCcBurs-α, dsCcBurs-β, or dsEGFP. qRT-PCR results exhibited that feeding dsCcBurs-α or dsCcBurs-β extremely reduced the expression of the target gene under 10°C condition.

<p>After successful knockdown of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α, <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β, or both, the UV absorbance of total pigment extraction at a wavelength of 300 nm in dsCcBurs-α-treated (0.18), dsCcBurs-β-treated (0.19), and dsCcBurs-α+β-treated (0.07) nymphs was dramatically lower than that in dsEGFP-treated nymphs (0.85) under 10°C condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This finding indicates that <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β play a prominent role in cuticle pigment formation in the winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Moreover, both the results of cuticle chitin content determination and cuticle ultrastructure observation indicated that knockdown of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α, <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β, or both markedly reduced the cuticle chitin content (about 0.33, 0.32, 0.14) and cuticle thicknesses (about 1.44, 1.53, 0.73 μm) compared with dsEGFP-treated nymphs (1.00, 3.39 μm) under 10°C condition, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). Interestingly, the results of pigmentation absorbance and cuticule thickness after <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α or <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β knockdown were similar to those after <italic>CcTRPM</italic> knockdown (Table S2).

<title><italic>CcBurs-R</italic> was identified as the Bursicon receptor in <italic>C. chinensis</italic></title>
<p>To study the role of neuropeptide Bursicon in seasonal polyphenism, we identified a leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor and named it as Bursicon receptor <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> (GenBank: OR488626). The open reading frame of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> is 3498 bp long and encodes a 1165-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 118.61 kDa, a theoretical <italic>pI</italic> of 8.64, and seven predicted transmembrane domains. Multiple alignment analysis showed a high degree of conservation in the transmembrane domains of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> with <italic>Burs-R</italic> sequences from other four selected insect species (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> is most closely related to the <italic>DcBurs-R</italic> homologue (<italic>D. citri</italic>, KAI5703609.1) in evolutionary relationship, and both are important Hemiptera pest of fruit trees (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The potential tertiary protein structure of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> and its molecular docking with <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β were constructed using the online server Phyre2 and modified with PyMOL-v1.3r1 software (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Development expression pattern indicated that <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> had relatively lower levels of expression in eggs and nymphs, but extremely higher levels in adult stages (Figure S5A-B). The mRNA level of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> was higher in each developmental stage of winter-form than summer-form, suggesting its important role in the transition from summer-form to winter-form. In terms of tissue-specific expression, <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> was found to be present in all determined tissues, with relatively higher expression in five tissues (head, cuticle, midgut, wings, and foot) of winter-form than summer-form (Figure S5C). To confirm that <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> is the Bursicon receptor of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, we employed a fluorescence-based assay to quantify calcium ion concentrations and investigate the binding affinities of bursicon heterodimers and homodimers to the bursicon receptor across varying concentrations. Our findings suggest that activation of the receptor by the burs α-β heterodimer leads to significant alterations in intracellular calcium ion levels, whereas stimulation with burs α-α and burs β-β homodimers, in conjunction with Adipokinetic hormone (AKH), maintains consistent intracellular calcium ion levels. Consequently, this research definitively identifies <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> as the bursicon receptor (Figure S6). In addition, we determined the effect of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α or <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β knockdown on its mRNA expression. qRT-PCR results showed that RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α or <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β significantly decreased <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> expression after dsRNA feeding at 3, 6, and 10 days compared to the dsEGFP group under 10°C condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). Moreover, the heterodimer protein of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α<italic>+</italic>β fully rescued the effect of RNAi-mediated knockdown on <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> expression, while α+α or β+β homodimers did not (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Additional results demonstrated that 10°C treatment markedly increased <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> expression compared to 25°C treatment, and <italic>CcTRPM</italic> knockdown obviously decreased the mRNA level of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> compared to the dsEGFP treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>). Therefore, these findings indicate that <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> is the Bursicon receptor of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> and is regulated by a low temperature of 10°C and <italic>CcTRPM</italic>.</p>

<p>The function of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> in seasonal polyphenism was further investigated using RNAi technology. qRT-PCR results revealed that RNAi efficiency was 66-82% after dsCcBurs-R feeding for 3, 6, and 10 days compared to the dsEGFP treatments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

<title>miR-6012 directly targeted <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> by inhibiting its expression</title>
<p>To determine if miRNAs are involved in the regulation of Bursicon hormone in the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, we amplified the 3’UTR of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> and predicted relevant miRNAs. Four miRNAs, including miR-6012, miR-375, miR-2796, and miR-1175, were predicted to have binding sites in the 3’UTR of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> by two software programs, miRanda and Targetscan (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Polyphenism is a conserved adaptive mechanism in species ranging from insects to mammalian, and evidence is mounting that it also extends to many nematode and fish species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Stockton et al., 2018</xref>; Yang and Pospisilik, 2019). Seasonal polyphenism can provide overwintering species with better adaptability to extreme climates through beneficial shifts in morphology, physiology, or behavior (Simpson and Sword, 2011). Physiological studies have shown that the neuroendocrine hormone system communicates environmental signals to facilitate downstream morphology and physiology transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zera and Denno, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Overgaard and MacMillan, 2017</xref>). Having a good model is extremely important for answering specific scientific questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhardwaj et al., 2020</xref>). In <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, cuticle pigment absorbance and cuticle thickness, both have an increasing trend over time under 10°C condition, showed very high correlation with nymphs phenotype of cuticle tanning during the transition from summer-form to winter-form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; Figure S1). To clarify the role of neuropeptide Bursicon in the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, we identified two Bursicon subunits, <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β, in this study. The SDS-PAGE results of non-reduced and reduced gels showed that <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β can form both homodimers (α+α or β+β) and a heterodimer (α+β) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). During the transition of the <italic>C. chinensis</italic> between two forms, this study focused on the overall phenotypic changes. Therefore, for qPCR experiments, whole <italic>C. chinensis</italic> samples were selected for analysis. Temporal expression patterns showed that <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β have very similar gradually increasing expression trends and higher expression in winter-form than summer-form (Figure S3C and 3D), indicating that Bursicon may play a significant role in winter-form. This result is consistent with the report on gypsy moths, where transcript levels of <italic>Ldbursicon</italic> in adult stages were higher than in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>). The transcript levels of both subunits were higher in the head and cuticle of winter-form compare to summer-form, implying a potential role of Bursicon in seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> (Figure S3E and 3F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Luan et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>As the transition of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> from summer-form to winter-form is regulated by a low temperature of 10°C and <italic>CcTRPM</italic>, we next determined the effect of 10°C treatment and <italic>CcTRPM</italic> RNAi on the expression of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β. As expected, 10°C treatment significantly increased the expression of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β, while <italic>CcTRPM</italic> RNAi markedly decreased their mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>). This is the first report on the relationship between the neuropeptide Bursicon and low temperature. Further results from RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α, <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β, or both showed that Bursicon prominently regulates the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> by affecting cuticle pigment content, cuticle chitin content, and cuticle thickness (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>). Moreover, the presence of both thin and thick chitin layers observed in the dsEGFP treatment of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> could potentially be ascribed to the chitin content in the insect midgut or fat body as previously discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). It is notable that during the process of cuticle staining, the chitin located in the midgut and fat body of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> may exhibit green fluorescence, leading to the appearance of a thin chitin layer. In many insects, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, Bursicon is believed to be the main hormone responsible for cuticle tanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Luo et al., 2005</xref>; Bai et al., 2010). However, knockdown of Bursicon subunits did not cause visible defects in cuticle sclerotisation or pigmentation of <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> and <italic>Lymantria dispar</italic> adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Huang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>). The insect cuticle typically comprises three distinct layers (endocuticle, exocuticle, and epicuticle), with the thickness of each layer varying among different insect species. Cuticle differentiation is closely linked to the molting cycle of insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mrak et al., 2017</xref>). In our study, nymphal cuticles exhibited normal differentiation patterns, characterized by a thin epicuticle and comparable widths of the endocuticle and exocuticle following dsEGFP treatment, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>. Conversely, nymphs treated with dsCcBurs-α, dsCcBurs-β, and dsCcburs-R displayed impaired development, manifesting only the exocuticle without a discernible endocuticle layer. These findings suggest that bursicon genes and their receptor play a pivotal role in regulating insect cuticle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Costa et al., 2016</xref>). These researches indicate that Bursicon may not be necessary for cuticle tanning in all insects. Although the reactions involved in cuticle tanning are well-known, further studies are needed to understand how Bursicon mediates the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>.</p>
<p>To further elucidate the role of the Bursicon signal in seasonal polyphenism, we identified the Bursicon receptor of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Temporal and spatial expression patterns of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> were very similar to those of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β, and it also had higher expression in winter-form than summer-form (Figure S5). By comparing its expression profiles with those in other insects, we can conclude that the spatio-temporal expression of Bursicon receptor is related to the specificity of insect species. The activation of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> by the burs α-β heterodimer exhibited a robust dose-dependent pattern. Conversely, no activation was observed when <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> was transfected with an empty vector or exposed to burs α-α and burs β-β homodimers or AKH (Figure S6). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, Bursicon comprises two cystine knot polypeptides, pburs and burs, which are known to stimulate a G protein-coupled receptor, <italic>DLGR2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Luo et al., 2005</xref>). Through a radioligand receptor assay, specific and high-affinity interactions between <italic>C. chinensis</italic> burs α-β heterodimer and <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> were successfully confirmed. A recent study indicated that silencing of <italic>Burs-</italic>α, <italic>Burs-</italic>β, or its receptor significantly affected the reproduction of <italic>T. castaneum</italic> (Bai et al., 2010). Knockdown of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α, <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β, or both obviously decreased the expression of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>, while feeding the heterodimer protein of α+β fully rescued <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> expression after knockdown of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β together, which further confirmed the relationship between subunits and the receptor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). 10°C treatment clearly improved the expression of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>, but <italic>CcTRPM</italic> RNAi sharply reduced its mRNA level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>). Notably, elimination of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> obviously affected cuticle pigment content, cuticle chitin content, and cuticle thickness, leading to the failure of the transition from summer-form to winter-form (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). Feeding the α+β heterodimer protein fully rescued the defect in the transition percent and morphological phenotype after <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). Following the administration of dsCcBur-R to <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, the expression of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> exhibited a reduction of approximately 66-82% as depicted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, rather than complete suppression. Activation of endogenous <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> through feeding of the α+β heterodimer protein results in an increase in <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> expression, with the effectiveness of the rescue effect contingent upon the dosage of the α+β heterodimer protein. Consequently, the capacity of the α+β heterodimer protein to effectively mitigate the impacts of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> knockdown on the conversion rate is clearly demonstrated. Therefore, these findings strongly support our hypothesis that Bursicon and its receptor are essential for the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Actually, seasonal polyphenism is a complex process that may be regulated by multiple cascade reaction. Further studies are needed to clarify the regulatory mechanism of Bursicon and its receptor in mediating the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>.</p>
<p>In animals, miRNAs are essential for tissue development and behavioral evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lucas and Raikhel, 2013</xref>). Previous studies have reported that many miRNAs function upstream of the neurohormone signaling pathway in insect polyphenism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Suderman et al., 2006</xref>). For example, miR-133 controls behavioral aggregation by targeting the dopamine synthesis gene in Locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), and miR-9b targets insulin receptor to mediate dimorphism and wing development in aphids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Shang et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we identified miR-6012 as a regulator of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> in the Bursicon hormone signaling pathway for the first time. We found that miR-6012 was inhibited by a low temperature of 10 °C and targeted <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> by binding to its 3’UTR. When nymphs were treated with agomir-6012, they exhibited lower cuticle pigment content, reduced cuticle chitin content, and thinner cuticle thickness compared to the agomir-NC control under 10 °C condition. In addition, agomir-6012 treatment markedly decreased the transition percent from summer-form to winter-form and affected the morphological phenotype compared to the control. The significantly decreased in <italic>CcTre1</italic> and <italic>CcCHS1</italic> expression after agomir-6012 treatment suggested that miR-6012 also functions as the up-stream regulator of chitin biosynthesis signaling.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study uncovered a novel role of Bursicon and its receptor in regulating the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, in addition to their known functions in cuticle-hardening of nymphs and wing expansion of adults. In <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, we proposed a molecular working model to describe this novel mechanism. Under 10 °C condition, Bursicon signaling pathway is first activated in the head of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> by low temperature and <italic>CcTRPM</italic>. Then, <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α and <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β form a heterodimeric neuropeptide that acts on its receptor <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> to mediate the transition from summer-form to winter-form by affecting cuticle pigment content, cuticle chitin content, and cuticle thickness. Moreover, miR-6012 targets <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> to modulate the function of Bursicon signaling pathway in this seasonal polyphenism. As a result, the 1st instar nymphs of summer-form develop into 3rd instar nymphs of winter-form to better adapt to low-temperature adversity. Future research will focus on: (1) studying the combined effect of Bursicon with other neuro-hormones on the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, (2) identifying the down-stream signaling of Bursicon in mediating this phenomenon through multi-omics and RNAi approaches.</p>

<title>qRT-PCR for mRNA and miRNA</title>
<p>Samples for the temporal expression profile were collected at different developmental stages of summer-form and winter-form, including egg; nymphs of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th instar; and adults of the 1st, 3rd, and 7th day. For the tissue expression pattern, six types of tissue (head, cuticle, midgut, fat body, wings, and foot) were dissected from both summer-form and winter-form of 5th instar nymphs. To examine the effect of different temperatures treatments on the expression of mRNAs and miRNAs, the newly hatched 1st instar nymphs of summer-form were treated at 25°C and 10°C, respectively. Whole <italic>C. chinensis</italic> samples were collected at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days after different temperatures treatments. For the effect of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> knockdown on the transcription level of <italic>CcBurs-</italic>α, <italic>CcBurs-</italic>β, and <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> under 10°C conditions, the newly hatched 1st instar nymphs of summer-form were fed with <italic>CcTRPM</italic> dsRNA, and the whole <italic>C. chinensis</italic> samples were collected on the 3rd, 6th, and 10th day after dsRNA feeding. Each sample was performed in three replications, with approximately 100 individuals for each replication of egg samples and at least 50 insects were included for each nymph or adult sample. All samples were immediately stored at -80°C for total RNA extraction.</p>
<p>Total RNAs were isolated from the above <italic>C. chinensis</italic> samples using TRNzol Universal (Cat# DP424, TIANGEN, Beijing, China) and miRcute miRNA isolation kit (Cat# DP501, TIANGEN, Beijing, China) for mRNA and miRNA, respectively, based on the manufacturer’ protocol.

<p><italic>In vitro</italic> luciferase reporter gene assays: The full sequence of the 3’UTR or 3’UTR sequence with binding sites removed from <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> was amplified and inserted downstream of the luciferase gene in the pmirGLO vector (Promega, Wisconsin, USA) to construct recombinant plasmids. Agomir-6012 and antagomir-6012, chemically synthesized and modified RNA oligos with the same sequence or anti-sense oligonucleotides of miR-6012, were obtained from GenePharma (Shanghai, China). Agomir-NC and antagomir-NC, provided by the manufacture, were used as negative controls. Approximate 500 ng of the recombinant plasmid and 275 nM of agomir were co-transfected into HEK293T cells using the Calcium Phosphate Cell Transfection Kit (Cat# C0508, Beyotime, Nanjing, China). After 24 h of co-transfection, the activity of the luciferase enzymes was determined following the protocol of Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Cat# E1910, Promega, Wisconsin, USA).</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic> RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assay (RIP): The RIP assay was performed using the Magna RIP Kit (Cat# 17–704, Merck, Millipore, Germany) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Fifty nymphs were collected after feeding with agomir-6012 or agomir-NC for 24 h, and crushed with an auto homogenizer in ice-cold RIP lysis buffer. Magnetic beads were incubated with 5 μg of Ago-1 antibody (Merck, Millipore, Germany) or IgG antibody (Merck, Millipore, Germany) to form a magnetic bead-antibody complex. The target mRNAs were pulled down by the magnetic bead-antibody complex from the supernatants in the RIP lysates. The immunoprecipitated RNAs were released by digestion with protease K and quantification of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> and miR-6012. Each experiment had six replicates.</p>
<p>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH): The antisense nucleic acid probes for <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> (5’-GCGCUUGUGCUGCUUCUGCU-3’) were labeled with FAM, and miR-6012 (5’-UGACCGACUAGAGUAGCGGCUU-3’) was labeled with FITC (GenePharma, Shanghai, China). In short, nymph samples at different stages were immersed in Carnoy’s fixative for 24-48 h at room temperature. After washing and decolorization, the samples were pre-hybridized three times using the hybridization buffer without the probes keep in dark. For co-localization, two fluorescent probes (1 μM) were combined to hybridize the samples for about 12 h in the dark. DAPI (1 μg/mL) was used to stain cell nuclei.

<title>Analysis of total cuticle pigment and cuticle chitin contents</title>
<p>To compare the difference in cuticle contents between summer-form and winter-form nymphs, the total cuticle pigment and cuticle chitin contents were determined. For the measurement of total cuticle pigment, the cuticle of dsRNA-treated nymphs were dissected and treated with acidified methanol (with 1% concentrated hydrochloric acid). The cuticle tissues were then pestled and placed in a thermostatic oscillator at 200 rpm for 24 h under 25°C condition. The total pigment extraction was obtained after filtering and centrifuging the supernatants through a 0.45 μm filter membrane. Pigments were not modified during extraction and the UV absorbance of the total pigment extraction at different wavelengths was determined using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Futahashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Osanai-Futahashi et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

Briefly, nymph samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and subjected to a gradient concentration dehydration with sucrose solution (10%, 20%, 30%). The dehydrated samples were then embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Cat# 4583, SAKURA, Ningbo, China) after the pre-embedding stages at -25°C. Ultra-thin sections (approximately 70 nm thickness) of the embedded material were cut using a Leica freezing ultra-cut microtome (CM1850, Leica, Weztlar, Germany). The sections were stained with WGA-FITC (50 μg/mL) and DAPI (10 μg/mL) for 15 min, followed by rinsing three times with sterile PBS buffer. Fluorescence images were acquired using a Leica SP8 confocal microscopy (Weztlar, Germany). To further quantify the cuticle chitin content, a chitin Elisa kit (Cat# YS80663B, Yaji Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) was used according to the previously described method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to determine the cuticle tanning threshold in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, we examined the nymph phenotypes, cuticle pigment absorbance, and cuticle thickness levels in multiple time points (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days) under two distinct temperatures of 10°C and 25°C. Each experimental condition encompassed nine independent biological replicates, with a minimum of 30 whole nymphs analyzed in each replicate for comprehensive assessment.</p>

<title>Transmission electron microscopy assay</title>
<p>The TEM assay was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). In short, nymph samples without heads were fixed in 4% polyformaldehyde (PFA) for 48 h, followed by post-fixation in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1.5 h. The samples were then dehydrated in a standard ethanol/acetone series, infiltrated, and embedded in spurr medium. Subsequently, superthin sections (-70 nm) of the thorax were cut and stained with 5% uranyl acetate followed by Reynolds’ lead citrate solution. The same dorsal region of the thorax was specifically chosen for subsequent fluorescence imaging or transmission electron microscopy assessments aimed at quantifying cuticle thickness. Lastly, the sections were observed, photographed and measured using a HT7800 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 120 kv. Regarding the measurement of cuticle thickness, use the built-in measuring ruler on the software to select the top and bottom of the same horizontal line on the cuticle. Measure the cuticle of each nymph at two close locations. Six nymphs were used for each sample. Randomly select 9 values and plot them.</p>

<p>Figures preparation and statistical analysis were performed with GraphPad Prism 8.0 software and IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0, respectively. All data were shown as means ± SE (Standard Error of Mean) with different independent biological replications. Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was performed for pairwise comparisons to determine statistically significant differences between treatments and controls (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, and ***<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD multiple comparison test was used for multiple comparisons in SPSS Statistics 26.0 (different letters denoted by <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study reports that the neurohormone, bursicon, and its receptor, play a role in the seasonal polyphenism of the bug Cacopsylla chinensis. Low temperature activates the bursicon signaling pathway during the transition from the summer to the winter form, affecting cuticle pigment and thickness as well as chitin content. The <bold>solid</bold> experiments reveal how bursicon signaling, which is modulated by the microRNA miR-6012, regulates features of polyphenism related to the exoskeleton, although it is less clear what the upstream regulatory events are.</p>

<p>Bursicon is a key hormone regulating cuticle tanning in insects. While the molecular mechanisms of its function are rather well studied--especially in the model insect Drosophila melanogaster, its effects and functions in different tissues are less well understood. Here, the authors show that bursicon and its receptor play a role in regulating aspects of the seasonal polyphenism of Cacopsylla chinensis. They found that low temperature treatment activated the bursicon signaling pathway during the transition from summer form to winter form and affect cuticle pigment and chitin content, and cuticle thickness. In addition, the authors show that miR-6012 targets the bursicon receptor, CcBurs-R, thereby modulating the function of bursicon signaling pathway in the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis. This discovery expands our knowledge of the roles of neuropeptide bursicon action in arthropod biology.</p>
<p>Reviewer comments on revised version</p>
<p>(a) Major concerns</p>
<p>
(1) The revision did not respond to the major concern regarding the threshold response that defines polyphenism. Therefore, it still falls short of the claims made, since the claims were not revised either. Specifically, the authors now include a time series of tanning at two different temperatures, demonstrating the time points at which the induced tanning proceeds (Fig. S1). However, the appropriate response to that comment would have temperatures on the x-axis, not time. Intermediate temperatures are needed to test whether the induction is a threshold response or simply a continuous norm of reaction.</p>
<p>
(2) The authors also did not respond to the major comment regarding environmental induction of miR-6012 expression. Rather, Fig. 5E shows a time series under two temperatures, similar to the tanning time series. To test whether its induction is a threshold response (again, what defines polyphenism), a series of induction conditions is needed. Fig. 5E simply shows changes in expression over time under one induction temperature (25 ºC).</p>
<p>
(3) Although the manuscript title has been changed, little to nothing else in the revised text addresses the concern that this study is about tanning in psyllids, not seasonal polyphenism. The other traits making up the polyphenism, as well as their threshold response, were not measured.</p>
<p>In summary, this revision failed to address most of the chief concerns of the review summary. This manuscript should be reframed as a study of tanning in a species other than Drosophila, and any claims about polyphenism (that is, an environmentally induced threshold trait) still need to be tested.</p>
<p>Regarding the other concerns raised by the reviewers:</p>
<p>(4) Issues related to the assignment of the receptor used as a bursicon receptor were satisfactorily addressed.</p>
<p>
(5) Experiments regarding the timing of cuticle production presented in Supplementary Figure 1 are valuable, albeit, there are still some inaccuracies: i) the layering of the cuticle is not given accurately as there are more than the 3 layers indicated in the manuscript; ii), the reduced endocuticle in all relevant dsRNA cases suggests a massive molting defect that may underline the involvement of bursicon in molting in general, potentially masking its effect on morph transition. In other words, the phenotype is too strong to allow for the interpretation of its function with respect to morph transition. It would have been necessary to apply different concentrations of dsRNA in order to address this point. iii) The developmental timing at 10oC vs. 25oC seem to be similar, although duration would be expected to be longer at 10oC; iv) It would have been nice to see the days of development also for dsRNA injected animals.</p>
<p>
(6) Another unresolved point regards the source and target tissue of bursicon signaling. Admittedly, this problem is difficult to solve in a small insect species.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Review:</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Bursicon is a key hormone regulating cuticle tanning in insects. While the molecular mechanisms of its function are rather well studied--especially in the model insect <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, its effects and functions in different tissues are less well understood. Here, the authors show that bursicon and its receptor play a role in regulating aspects of the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>Cacopsylla chinensis</italic>. They found that low temperature treatment activated the bursicon signaling pathway during the transition from summer form to winter form and affect cuticle pigment and chitin content, and cuticle thickness. In addition, the authors show that miR-6012 targets the bursicon receptor, <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>, thereby modulating the function of bursicon signaling pathway in the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. This discovery expands our knowledge of the roles of neuropeptide bursicon action in arthropod biology.</p>
<p>However, the study falls short of its claim that it reveals the molecular mechanisms of a seasonal polyphenism. While cuticle tanning is an important part of the pear psyllid polyphenism, it is not the equivalent of it. First, there are other traits that distinguish between the two morphs, such as ovarian diapause (Oldfield, 1970), and the role of bursicon signaling in regulating these aspects of polyphenism were not measured. Thus, the phenotype in pear psyllids, whereby knockdown bursicon reduces cuticle tanning seems to simply demonstrate the phenotypes of Drosophila mutants for bursicon receptor (Loveall and Deitcher, 2010, BMC Dev Biol) in another species (Fig. 2I, 4H). Second, the study fails to address the threshold nature of cuticular tanning in this species, although it is the threshold response (specifically, to temperature and photoperiod) that distinguishes this trait as a part of a polyphenism. Whereas miR-6012 was found to regulate bursicon expression, there no evidence is provided that this microRNA either responds to or initiates a threshold response to temperature. In principle, miR-6012 could regulate bursicon whether or not it is part of a polyphenism. Thus, the impact of this work would be significantly increased if it could distinguish between seasonal changes of the cuticle and a bona fide reflection of polyphenism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your valuable suggestion. We concur with the review’s comment that cuticle tanning does not equate to the <italic>C. chinensis</italic> polyphenism. To better reflect the core focus of our research, we have revised the title to &quot;Neuropeptide Bursicon and its receptor mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form of <italic>Cacopsylla chinensis</italic>&quot;.</p>
<p>In response to the reviewer's inquiry regarding the threshold nature of cuticular tanning in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, we have included a detailed analysis of the phenotypic changes (including nymph phenotypes, cuticle pigment absorbance, and cuticle thickness) during the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> at distinct time intervals (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days) under different temperature conditions (10°C and 25°C). As shown in Figure S1, nymphs exhibit a light yellow and transparent coloration at 3, 6, and 9 days, while nymphs at 12 and 15 days display shades of yellow-green or blue-yellow under 25°C conditions. At 10°C conditions, the abdomen end turns black at 3, 6, and 9 days. By the 12 days, numerous light black stripes appear on the chest and abdomen of nymphs at 10°C. At 15 days, nymphs exhibit an overall black-brown appearance, featuring dark brown stripes on the left and right sides of each chest and abdominal section. Furthermore, the end of the abdomen and back display a large black-brown coloration at 10°C (Figure S1A). The UV absorbance of the total pigment extraction at a 300 nm wavelength markedly increases following 10°C exposure for 6, 9, 12, and 15 days compared to the 25°C treatment group (Figure S1B). Cuticle thicknesses also increased following 10°C exposure for 6, 9, 12, and 15 days compared to the 25°C treatment group (Figure S1C). The detailed results (L122-143), materials and methods (L647-652), and discussion (L319-322) have been added in our revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Regarding the response of miR-6012 to temperature, we have already determined its expression at 3, 6, 10 days under different temperatures in the previous Figure 5E. We now included additional time intervals (9, 12, 15 days) in the updated Figure 5E. Our results indicate a significant decrease in the expression levels of miR-6012 after 10°C treatment for 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days compared to the 25°C treatment group. Detailed information regarding this has been integrated into the Materials and Methods (Line 608-610) of our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study convincingly identifies homologs of the genes encoding the bursicon subunits and its receptor, showing an alignment with those of another psyllid as well as more distant species. It also demonstrates that the stage- and tissue-specific levels of bursicon follow the expected patterns, as informed by other insect models, thus validating the identity of these genes in this species. They provide strong evidence that the expression of bursicon and its receptor depend on temperature, thereby showing that this trait is regulated through both parts of the signaling mechanism.</p>
<p>Several parallel measurements of the phenotype were performed to show the effects of this hormone, its receptor, and an upstream regulator (miR-6012), on cuticle deposition and pigmentation (if not polyphenism per se, as claimed). Specifically, chitin staining and TEM of the cuticle qualitatively show difference between controls and knockdowns, and this is supported by some statistical tests of quantitative measurements (although see comments below). Thus, this study provides strong evidence that bursicon and its receptor play an important role in cuticle deposition and pigmentation in this psyllid.</p>
<p>The study identified four miRNAs which might affect bursicon due to sequence motifs. By manipulating levels of synthetic miRNA agonists, the study successfully identified one of them (miR-6012) to cause a cuticle phenotype. Moreover, this miRNA was localized (by FISH) to the cuticle, body-wide. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstrated function for this miRNA, and this study provides a good example of using a gene of known function as an entry point to discovering others influencing a trait. Thus, this finding reveals another level of regulation of cuticle formation in insects.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The introduction to this manuscript does not accurately reflect progress in the field of mechanisms underlying polyphenism (e.g., line 60). There are several models for polyphenism that have been used to uncover molecular mechanisms in at least some detail, and this includes seasonal polyphenisms in Hemiptera. Therefore, the justification for this study cannot be predicated on a lack of knowledge, nor is the present study original or unique in this line of research (e.g., as reviewed by Zhang et al. 2019; DOI: 10.1146/annurev-ento-011118-112448). The authors are apparently aware of this, because they even provide other examples (lines 104-108); thus the introduction seems misleading as framed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your excellent suggestion. We have added the paper of Zhang et al. 2019 which recommended by reviewer (DOI: 10.1146/annurev-ento-011118-112448) in Line 57 of our revised manuscript. The statement has been revised to “However, the specific molecular mechanism underling temperature-dependent polyphenism still require further clarification” in Line 60-61 of our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The data in Figure 2H show &quot;percent of transition.&quot; However, the images in 2I show insects with tanned cuticle (control) vs. those without (knockdown). Yet, based on the description of the Methods provided, there appears to be no distinction between &quot;percent of transition&quot; and &quot;percent with tanning defects&quot;. This an important distinction to make if the authors are going to interpret cuticle defects as a defect in the polyphenism. Furthermore, there is no mention of intermediate phenotypes. The data in 2H are binned as either present or absent, and these are the phenotypes shown in 2I. Was the phenotype really an all-or-nothing response? Instead of binning, which masks any quantitative differences in the tanning phenotypes, the authors should objectively quantify the degree of tanning and plot that. This would show if and to what degree intermediate tanning phenotypes occurred, which would test how bursicon affects the threshold response. This comment also applies to the data in Figures 4G and 6G. Since cuticle tanning is present in more insect than just those with seasonal polyphenism, showing how this responds as a threshold is needed to make claims about polyphenism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your insightful comments. As shown in Figure 1 of our published paper (Zhang et al., 2013; doi.org/10.7554/eLife.88744.3) and Figure 2C-2I of the current manuscript, the transition from summer-form to winter-form entails not only external cuticular tanning but also alterations in internal cuticular chitin levels and cuticle thickness. While external cuticular tanning serves as a prominent and easily observable indicator of this transition, it is crucial to acknowledge that internal changes also play a significant role and should be taken into consideration. Therefore, we propose that the term &quot;percent of transition&quot; may be more suitable than &quot;percent with tanning defects&quot; to describe this process accurately.</p>
<p>In order to provide a more visually comprehensive understanding of the phenotypic changes during the transition from summer-form to winter-form, we have included images at different time points (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days) under different temperature conditions in Figure S1A of our revised manuscript. Specifically, under the 10°C condition, nymphs exhibit abdomen tanning after 6 and 9 days of treatment, while the thorax remains untanned. By days 12 to 15, both the abdomen and thorax of the nymphs show tanning, resulting in the majority of summer-form nymphs transitioning into winter-form, as depicted in Figure 2I for comparison. This observation indicates the presence of a critical threshold for cuticle tanning of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> following exposure to 10°C. Nymphs that did not undergo the transition to winter-form succumbed to the cold, highlighting the absence of intermediate phenotypes at 12-15 days under the 10°C condition. The UV absorbance of the total pigment extraction at a 300 nm wavelength markedly increases following 10°C exposure for 6, 9, 12, and 15 days compared to the 25°C treatment group (Figure S1B). Additionally, cuticle thickness shows an increase following 10°C exposure for 6, 9, 12, and 15 days compared to the 25°C treatment group (Figure S1C). These results highlight the relationship between the threshold of cuticular tanning and the transition process. The detailed description and information have been added in Results (L122-143), Materials and Methods (L647-652), and Discussion (L319-322) of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) This study also does not test the threshold response of cuticle phenotypes to levels of bursicon, its receptor, or miR-6012. Hormone thresholds are the most widespread and, in most systems where polyphenism has been studied, the defining characteristic of a polyphenism (e.g., Nijhout, 2003, Evol Dev). Quantitative (not binned) measurements of a polyphenism marker (e.g., chitin) should be demonstrated to result as a threshold titer (or in the case of the receptor, expression level) to distinguish defects in polyphenism from those of its component trait.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your valuable feedback. We have supplemented additional data on the phenotypes (Figure S1A), cuticle pigment absorbance (Figure S1B), cuticle thickness (Figure S1C), expression levels of bursicon (Figure 1E and 1F), its receptors (Figure 3G), and miR-6012 (Figure 5E) corresponding to nymphs treated over different time periods (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days) under both 10°C and 25°C conditions in our revised manuscript.</p>
<p>While all these identified markers exhibit a strong correlation with the transition from summer-form to winter-form, it is important to note that they are not suitable as definitive thresholds due to the nature of relative gene expression quantification and chitin content assessment, rather than absolute quantitation. Further, given that tanning hormones are neuropeptides present in trace amounts in insects, unlike steroid hormones, determining their titers poses a considerable challenge.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Cuticle issue:</p>
<p>(a) Unlike Fig. 6D and F, Figs. 2D and F do not correspond to each other. Especially the lack and reduction of chitin in ds-a+b! By fluorescence microscopy there is hardly any signal, whereas by TEM there is a decent cuticle. Additionally, the dsGFP control cuticle in 2D is cut obliquely with a thick and a thin chitin layer. This is misleading.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your insightful feedback. We have replaced the previous WGA chitin staining images in the dsCcbursα+β treatment of Figure 2D with new representative images aligning with Figure 2F. Furthermore, the presence of both thin and thick chitin layers observed in the dsEGFP treatment of Figure 2D could potentially be ascribed to the chitin content in the insect midgut or fat body as previously discussed (Zhu et al., 2016). It is notable that during the process of cuticle staining, the chitin located in the midgut and fat body of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> may exhibit green fluorescence, leading to the appearance of a thin chitin layer. A detailed analysis and elucidation of these observations have been added in the discussion section (Lines 347-352) of our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(b) In Figs. 2F and 4F, the endocuticle appears to be missing, a portion of the procuticle that is produced post-molting. As tanning is also occurring post-molting, there seems to be a general problem with cuticle differentiation at this time point. This may be a timing issue. Please clarify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. The insect cuticle typically comprises three distinct layers (endocuticle, exocuticle, and epicuticle), with the thickness of each layer varying among different insect species. Cuticle differentiation is closely linked to the molting cycle of insects (Mrak et al., 2017). In our study, nymphal cuticles exhibited normal differentiation patterns, characterized by a thin epicuticle and comparable widths of the endocuticle and exocuticle following dsEGFP treatment, as illustrated in Figure 2F and 4F. Conversely, nymphs treated with dsCcBurs-α, dsCcBurs-β, and dsCcburs-R displayed impaired development, manifesting only the exocuticle without a discernible endocuticle layer. These findings suggest that bursicon genes and their receptor play a pivotal role in regulating insect cuticle development (Costa et al., 2016). We have added some discussion about these results in Lines 356-367 of our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(c) To provide background information, it would be useful analyze cuticle formation in the summer and winter morphs of controls separately by light and electron microscopy. More baseline data on these two morphs is needed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your valuable feedback. To provide more background information about cuticle formation, we supplied the results of nymph phenotypes, cuticle pigment absorbance, and cuticle thickness at distinct time intervals (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days) under different temperatures of 10°C and 25°C in Figure S1 of our revised manuscript. Hope these results can help better understand the baseline data on these two morphs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(d) For the TEM study, it is not clear whether the same part of the insect's thorax is being sectioned each time, or if that matters. There is not an obvious difference in the number of cuticular layers, but only the relative widths of those layers, so it is difficult to know how comparable those images are. This raises two questions that the authors should clarify. First, is it possible that certain parts of the thoracic cuticle, such as those closer to the intersegmental membrane, are naturally thinner than other parts of the body? Second, is the tanning phenotype based on the thickness or on the number of chitin layers, or both? The data shown later in Figure 4I, J convincingly shows that the biosynthesis pathway for chitin is repressed, but any clarification of what this might mean for deposition of chitin would help to understand the phenotypes reported. Also, more details on how the data in Fig. 2G were collected would be helpful. This also goes for the data in Fig. 4 (bursicon receptor knockdowns).</p>

<p>Thanks for your great comment. The TEM investigation adhered to a standardized protocol was used as previous description (Zhang et al., 2023), Initially, insect heads were uniformly excised and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Subsequently, a consistent cutting and staining procedure was executed at a uniform distance above the insect's thorax. The dorsal region of the thorax was specifically chosen for subsequent fluorescence imaging or transmission electron microscopy assessments with the specific objective of quantifying cuticle thickness. Regarding the measurement of cuticle thickness, use the built-in measuring ruler on the software to select the top and bottom of the same horizontal line on the cuticle. Measure the cuticle of each nymph at two close locations. Six nymphs were used for each sample. Randomly select 9 values and plot them. The related description has been added in the Materials and Methods (Line 660-668) of our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(5) Tissue issue:</p>
<p>The timed experiments shown in all figures were done in whole animals. However, we know from <italic>Drosophila</italic> that Bursicon activity is complex in different tissues. There is, thus, the possibility, that the effects detected on different days in whole animals are misleading because different tissues--especially the brain and the epidermis, may respond differentially to the challenge and mask each other's responses. The animal is small, so the extraction from single tissue may be difficult. However, this important issue needs to be addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your excellent suggestion. We express our heartfelt appreciation to the reviewer for their valuable input regarding the challenges involved in dissecting various tissue sections from the diminutive early instar nymphs of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. In light of the metamorphic transition of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> across developmental stages, this study concentrated on examining the extensive phenotypic alterations. Consequently, intact samples of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> were specifically chosen for for qPCR analysis. The related descriptions have been added in the Materials and Methods (Line 513, 517, 553, 555, and 613) and Discussion (Line 327-329) of our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(6) No specific information is provided regarding the procedure followed for the rescue experiments with burs-α and burs-β (How were they done? Which concentrations were applied? What were the effects?). These important details should appear in the Materials and Methods and the Results sections.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your excellent suggestion. For the rescue experiments, the dsRNA of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> and proteins of burs α-α, burs β-β homodimers, or burs α-β heterodimer (200 ng/μL) were fed together. The concentration of heterodimer protein of <italic>CcBurs-α+β</italic> was 200 ng/μL. The heterodimer protein of <italic>CcBurs-α+β</italic> fully rescued the effect of RNAi-mediated knockdown on <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> expression, while α+α or β+β homodimers did not (Figure 3F). Feeding the α+β heterodimer protein fully rescued the defect in the transition percent and morphological phenotype after <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> knockdown (Figure 4G-4H). We have added the detailed methods of rescued experiments and specific concentrations in the Materials and Methods (Line 561-563), and Results (Line 263) of our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(7) Pigmentation</p>
<p>(a) The protocol used to assess pigmentation needs to be validated. In particular, the following details are needed: Were all pigments extracted? Were pigments modified during extraction? Were the values measured consistent with values obtained, for instance, by light microscopy (which should be done)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your excellent comment. Our protocol for pigment extracted as detailed in <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, the cuticles were pulverized in liquid nitrogen and then dissolved in 30 milliliters of acidified methanol (Futahashi et al., 2012; Osanai-Futahashi et al., 2012). Thus, all cuticle pigments were dissected and treated with acidified methanol. Pigments were not modified during extraction.. The details description have been integrated into the Materials and Methods (Line 630-633) of our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(b) In addition, pigmentation occurs post-molting; thus, the results could reflect indirect actions of bursicon signaling on pigmentation. The levels of expression of downstream pigmentation genes (ebony, lactase, etc) should be measured and compared in molting summer vs. winter morphs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your valuable suggestion. Actually, we already studied the function of some downstream pigmentation genes, including <italic>ebony</italic>, <italic>Lactase</italic>, <italic>Tyrosine hydroxylase</italic>, <italic>Dopa decarboxylase</italic>, and <italic>Acetyltransferase</italic>. The variations in the expression patterns of these genes are closely tied to the molting dynamics of nymphs undergoing transitions between summer-form and winter-form. These findings will put in another manuscript currently being prepared for submission, thus detailed outcomes are not suitable for inclusion in the current manuscript.</p>

<p>(8) L236: &quot;while the heterodimer protein of CcBurs α+β could fully rescue the effect of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> knockdown on the transition percent (Figure 4G 4H)&quot;. This result seems contradictory. If <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> is the receptor of bursicon, the heterodimer protein of CcBurs α+β should not be able to rescue the effect of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> knockdown insects. How can a neuropeptide protein rescue the effect when its receptor is not there! If these results are valid, then the <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> would not be the (sole) receptor for CcBurs α+β heterodimer. This is a critical issue for this manuscript and needs to be addressed (also in L337 in Discussion).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your insightful suggestion. Following the administration of dsCcBur-R to <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, the expression of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> exhibited a reduction of approximately 66-82% as depicted in Figure 4A, rather than complete suppression. Activation of endogenous <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> through feeding of the α+β heterodimer protein results in an increase in <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> expression, with the effectiveness of the rescue effect contingent upon the dosage of the α+β heterodimer protein. Consequently, the capacity of the α+β heterodimer protein to effectively mitigate the impacts of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> knockdown on the conversion rate is clearly demonstrated. We have added additional discussion in Line 396-403 of our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(9) Fig. 5D needs improvement (the magnification is poor) and further explanation and discussion. mi6012 and <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> seem to be expressed in complementary tissues--do we see internal tissues also (see problem under point 2)? Again, the magnification is not high enough to understand and appreciate the relationships discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your valuable suggestion. In order to enhance the resolution of the magnified images, we conducted FISH co-localization of miR-6012 and <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> in 3rd instar nymphs and obtained detailed zoomed-in images. As shown in the magnified view of Figure 5D, miR-6012 and <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> appear to exhibit complementary expression patterns in tissues. During the FISH assays, epidermis transparency of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> was achieved via decolorization treatment. Noteworthy observations from Figure 3G and Figure 5E reveal an inverse correlation in the expression profiles of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> and miR-6012. Consequently, the FISH results distinctly highlight a significant disparity in the expression levels of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> and miR-6012 within the same tissue. We have added related explanation and discussion in Line 291-293 of our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) The schematic in Fig. 7 is a useful summary, but there is a part of the logic that is unsupported by the data, specifically in terms of environmental influence on cuticle formation (i.e., plasticity). What is the evidence that lower temperatures influence expression of miR-6012? The study measures its expression over life stages, whether with an agonist or not, over a single temperature. Measuring levels of expression under summer form-inducing temperature is necessary to test the dependence of miR-6012 expression on temperature. Otherwise, this result cannot be interpreted as polyphenism control, but rather the control of a specific trait.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your great suggestion. We actually conducted the assessment of miR-6012 expression at specific time intervals (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days) under different temperatures of 10°C and 25°C. As depicted in Figure 5E, the expression levels of miR-6012 were notably reduced at 10°C compared to 25°C. Additionally, the evaluation of agomir-6012 expression level of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> under 25°C conditions at various time points (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days) revealed no significant changes. Hence, we suggest that the impact of miR-6012 on the seasonal morphological transition is influenced upon temperature.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p>The authors report a novel role of Bursicon and its receptor in regulating the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>Cacopsylla chinensis</italic>. They found that low temperature treatment (10°C) activated the Bursicon signaling pathway during the transition from summer-form to winter-form, which influences cuticle pigment content, cuticle chitin content, and cuticle thickness. Moreover, the authors identified miR-6012 and show that it targets <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>, thereby modulating the function of Bursicon signaling pathway in the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. This discovery expands our knowledge of multiple roles of neuropeptide bursicon action in arthropod biology. However, the m</p>
<p>anuscript does have several major weaknesses, described under &quot;Public review&quot;, which the authors need to address.</p>
<p>Major issues:</p>
<p>(1) L152-154 Fig S2E and S2F: Bursicon has been shown to be expressed in the CNS in a specific set of neurons. For example, In the larval CNS of <italic>Manduca sexta</italic>, bursicon expression is restricted to the subesophageal ganglion (SG), thoracic ganglia, and first abdominal ganglion. Pharate pupae and pharate adults show expression of this heterodimer in all ganglia. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, expression of a bursicon heterodimer is confined to abdominal ganglia. The additional neurons in the ventral nerve cord express only burs. In pharate adults, bursicon is produced by neurons in the SG and abdominal ganglia. I am wondering where bursicon subunits are expressed in the <italic>C. chinensis</italic> CNS? Since the authors have the antibodies, it would be useful to include immunocytochemical staining of bursicon alpha and beta in the CNS. The qPCR results from head or other tissues (Fig S2E and S2F) is not the most informative way to document localization of gene expression. Regarding the qPCR results, they show that the cuticle and the fat body express <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>. Can the authors confirm this unexpected results independently?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your insightful comment. In this study, we did not directly used antibodies targeting bursicon subunits, instead, the bursicon subunits along with a histidine tag were integrated into the expression vector pcDNA3.1 using homologous recombination. The experimental procedures were executed as follows: initially, the histidine tag was fused to the pcDNA3.1-mCherry vector through homologous recombination to generate the recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1-his-mCherry. Subsequently, the amino acid sequences of the two bursicon subunits were introduced into the pcDNA3.1-his-mCherry vector via homologous recombination to produce the recombinant plasmids pcDNA3.1-CcBurs-α-his-mCherry and pcDNA3.1-CcBurs-β-his-mCherry. Finally, the P2A sequence was incorporated into the vector using reverse PCR to yield the recombinant plasmids pcDNA3.1-CcBurs-α-his-P2A-mCherry and pcDNA3.1-CcBurs-β-his-P2A-mCherry. Consequently, the bursicon subunits, along with the histidine tag, were capable of generating fusion proteins with the histidine tag. Western blot analysis was conducted using antibodies targeting the histidine tag, enabling the detection of histidine expression, which corresponds to the expression of the bursicon subunits. However, they are not suitable to conduct the in vivo immunocytochemical staining of bursicon alpha and beta in the CNS.</p>
<p>Due to the diminutive size of the <italic>C. chinensis</italic> nymphs, dissection of the central nervous system (CNS) was unfeasible, precluding specific assessment of bursicon expression in the CNS. Prior literature has documented the expression of bursicon subunits in the epidermis and fat body of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Studies suggest that bursicon subunits not only play a role in the melanization and sclerotization processes of insect epidermis but also have significant roles in insect immunity (An et al., 2012). The presence of bursicon subunits in the epidermis, gut, and fat body of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> may indicate their crucial roles in the immune functions of these tissues. Further investigation is required to elucidate the specific immune functions they perform, hinting at the potential expression of these bursicon subunits in these two tissues.</p>

<p>(2) L222: &quot;<italic>CcBurs-R</italic> is the Bursicon receptor of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>&quot;. Is this statement supported by affinity binding assay results?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your excellent suggestion. We employed a fluorescence-based assay to quantify calcium ion concentrations and investigate the binding affinities of bursicon heterodimers and homodimers to the bursicon receptor across varying concentrations. Our findings suggest that activation of the receptor by the burs α-β heterodimer leads to significant alterations in intracellular calcium ion levels, whereas stimulation with burs α-α and burs β-β homodimers, in conjunction with Adipokinetic hormone (AKH), maintains consistent intracellular calcium ion levels. Consequently, this research definitively identifies <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> as the bursicon receptor.
