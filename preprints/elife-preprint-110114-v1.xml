Non-translating (hibernating) ribosomes carrying no mRNA, feature numerous proteins shielding ribosomal functional centers. Elongation factor 2 (eEF2) is the most abundant hibernation factor bound to &gt;95% of ribosomes and, unexpectedly, to 60S subunits. eEF2•GDP is stabilized by interactions with the sarcin-ricin loop and protein uL14. Hibernating ribosomes also feature LARP1 involved in initiation and mTOR signaling; eIF5A implicated in elongation and termination; and other factors, exposing the variety of hibernation scenarios.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The renaissance of structural biology, thanks to high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], is rapidly expanding our understanding of biological processes, from visualizing dynamic macromolecules to discovering new cellular compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Transmission electron microscopy is employed to study biological samples in two major applications: single-particle (<italic>in vitro</italic>) cryo-EM of purified macromolecules or reconstituted complexes, and cellular/tissue (<italic>in situ</italic>) cryo-EM, the most notable approach being cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET). Each approach has advantages and limitations. Single-particle cryo-EM allows elucidation of structural details of interactions and reactions. Here, analyses of large datasets (hundreds of thousands to &gt;1 million of particles) separate conformationally and compositionally distinct states (“classes”), yielding near-atomic-resolution (∼2 to 3.5 Å) insights into macromolecular dynamics and interactions. Furthermore, datasets can be collected at different time points of a reaction, allowing time-resolved cryo-EM to uncover transient intermediates in the absence of inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. For example, recent studies revealed the dynamics of the ribosome and translation factors during translation initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], termination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], and recycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. However, because samples are usually assembled from a limited set of purified components, this approach does not account for yet-to-be-discovered cellular interactions that may be important for the processes under investigation. To fill that gap, electron microscopy can be performed on cellular samples. Cryo-ET is one of the most popular approaches, providing impressive three-dimensional views of cellular compartments and large macromolecular complexes <italic>in situ</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Because the cellular environment is densely filled with macromolecules, electron microscopy of cellular samples remains a challenge and requires laborious sample preparation, data collection and processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. For example, focused ion beam (FIB) milling of frozen cells to generate the number of thin areas (lamellae) necessary to collect large datasets can take days if not weeks. Furthermore, sub-tomogram averaging of specific macromolecular densities usually does not achieve the near-atomic resolution of similar macromolecules analyzed by single-particle cryo-EM. Finally, it remains challenging to manipulate cells to study a particular aspect of a cellular process, such as a specific step of a multi-step pathway, without using modulators/inhibitors that may bias cells off pathway.</p>
<p>In this work, we tested whether the advantages of both methods can be combined by exploiting cellular extracts to elucidate novel cellular complexes and interactions at high resolution. We demonstrate that high-resolution 2D template matching (2DTM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] enables the reconstructions of mammalian 80S complexes at ∼2.2 Å resolution, similar to single-particle cryo-EM from purified ribosomes. We studied 80S translation complexes in several mammalian lysates, starting with the optimization of the cryo-EM/2DTM pipeline on lysates obtained from a human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and a monkey kidney cell line BSC-1. Our aim was to compare the translational states of ribosomes in distinct cell types and to visualize how cellular stress affects these states in MCF-7. We find that MCF-7 and BSC-1 lysates feature 60-70% of elongation-like complexes, echoing the analyses of mammalian translation in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. In nutrient-deprived MCF-7, the abundance of elongation complexes is reduced by ∼15%, consistent with inhibition of translation upon eIF2α phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>].</p>
<p>We also characterized the widely used rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL), the predominant model system to study translation since the 1970s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. RRL is a flexible and tunable system that allows monitoring of translation of a single mRNA (e.g, a reporter mRNA encoding a luciferase). Studies in RRL have led to discoveries or mechanistic descriptions of translation factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], internal ribosome entry sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], and other translational regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Yet, the composition of translation complexes in RRL remains uncharacterized. Unlike purified ribosome complexes, we find more multi-part compositions of 80S complexes, bringing new insights into translation regulation. For example, we find that after a few minutes of translation in RRL, only a small fraction of ribosomes is involved in translating a reporter mRNA (10-12%), whereas the majority of 80S complexes are in “hibernating” complexes bound with eEF2 but lacking mRNA. In addition, these complexes contain eIF5A, primarily implicated in translation elongation and termination, La-related protein 1 (LARP1) implicated in regulation of terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP)-containing mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], and previously identified hibernation factors SERBP1, CCDC124 and IFRD2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. These findings reveal that all functional centers of the ribosome are shielded in 80S hibernating complexes.</p>
<p>Simple lysate preparation and straightforward data processing make “<italic>in extracto</italic> cryo-EM<italic>”</italic> an efficient approach, allowing visualization of cellular complexes at near-atomic resolution. Furthermore, some parameters, such as substrate (<italic>e.g.,</italic> mRNA) composition and concentration, can be tuned to assemble the desired complex(es) without the need to reconstitute the specific complex(es) or to perturb cells by modulators/inhibitors. Our approach therefore offers a flexible method to study translation, and potentially other processes, in the context of authentic cellular components that may affect these processes.</p>

<title>2DTM resolves translating and hibernating ribosomes in fresh cell lysates</title>
<p>In our recent work describing angiogenin activation by ribosomes in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], we investigated how the angiogenin-ribosome interaction is affected by other cellular components. Typical lysate preparations produce dense and viscous samples, making it challenging to prepare cryo-EM grids with thin sample layers and to analyze them by standard cryo-EM methods. Indeed, standard data-processing workflows using Relion and <italic>cis</italic>TEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], which we and others routinely use to process single-particle data, failed to yield high-quality maps of distinct classes. Extensive culling of micrographs, manual particle picking, and 2D classification to remove low-quality particles was required, but this eventually resulted in small, good-quality particles stacks (∼6 or ∼17 thousand) yielding only three distinct ribosome classes at ∼3.2-4.4 Å resolution. To overcome this problem, we used high-resolution two-dimensional template matching (2DTM), which recently was shown to successfully identify ribosomes in dense cellular environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. This method substantially improved the number of picked particles (∼84,000), yielding higher-resolution maps (3 Å), and separating tens of classes from the same dataset (Methods and Table S1).</p>
<p>Inspired by the success of the 2DTM approach on a previously published dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], we used this approach on freshly prepared mammalian cell lysates. We analyzed the breast-cancer-derived MCF-7 cell line under normal and nutrient-deprived conditions, testing whether the expected downregulation of the translational apparatus can be observed in lysates. We also analyzed the African Green Monkey kidney cell line BSC-1 under normal growth conditions to compare the distribution of translational complexes in distinct organisms and tissues.</p>
<p>We use a mild lysis procedure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) relying on permeabilization of cellular membranes by the non-ionic detergent digitonin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], allowing preservation of translation-competent ribosome states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. In the first approach, MCF-7 cells were permeabilized by a digitonin-containing lysis buffer, and the cytosol was collected from cell-containing wells and applied to cryo-EM grids. In the second approach, BSC-1 cells were detached from wells, incubated in the lysis buffer, briefly centrifuged to remove cell debris, and the supernatant was applied to cryo-EM grids. Preparation of the lysate in both cases was fast (under 10 minutes) and the resulting grids were directly suitable for cryo-EM data collection. In cryo-EM images, collected using standard data collection procedures employed in single-particle EM, cellular filaments can be seen next to ribosomes in the cytosol of permeabilized cells (Fig. S1). Even in the lysates separated from cell debris, additional cellular components are readily visible, including mitochondria (Fig. S1). Thus, a simple and streamlined approach can be used to visualize ribosomes and other cellular components.</p>

<p>Particles were picked in the collected datasets using a high-resolution template obtained from a vacant (i.e. without translation factors) mammalian 60S ribosomal subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], and they were classified, with 3D maximum-likelihood classification and a focus mask on the ribosomal A site (Methods; Figs. S2-S4). Classification yielded primarily 80S ribosomes, and most 60S particles contained additional bound factors, underscoring that picking with the vacant 60S-template yielded largely template-unbiased results (Fig. S2). The reconstruction of individual maps achieved the resolution of ∼2.2 Å for the larger BSC-1 dataset (∼525,000 particles) and ∼3 Å for each MCF-7 dataset featuring a much lower number of particles (∼80,000).</p>
<p>Data obtained from MCF-7 and BSC-1 grown under normal growth conditions, yielded predominantly translation elongation states containing mRNA and tRNAs (∼70% in MCF-7 and ∼60% in BSC-1, Table S2). Most of these particles are in an mRNA-decoding state, containing canonical eEF1A with A/T tRNA (A/Ternary complex) docked into the small-subunit A site or with density resembling extended-eEF1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] with A, P and E tRNAs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>, S5A). The remaining elongation classes contain mRNA with at least two tRNAs within a non-rotated or rotated (post-translocation) ribosome. A translocated 80S ribosome contains eEF2 in the A site, in the presence of P and E tRNAs, similar to the post-translocation state (POST-3: PDB ID 6GZ5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). These maps closely resemble the structures of cellular elongation-state ribosomes identified in other cell types via cryo-ET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] or cryo-EM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Notably, all ribosome and 60S classes contain EBP1 (ErbB3-binding protein 1) bound next to the polypeptide exit tunnel (Fig. S6). Previously implicated in transiently binding hibernating/vacant ribosomes and regulating translation under stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>], EBP1 may be a resident protein on both translating and non-translating ribosome populations.</p>

</fig>
<p>In lysates made from nutrient-deprived MCF-7 cells, the percentage of elongation-like ribosomes bound to mRNA and tRNAs decreased to 58% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I-L</xref>), consistent with reduced translation. The abundance of unassociated 60S subunits increased from ∼10% to ∼15% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G, H, O, P</xref>), in keeping with depletion in translation initiation. In both datasets, a fraction of 60S subunits is bound with elongation factor eEF2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2O</xref>). This is unexpected because the primary function of eEF2 is to translocate mRNA and tRNAs on fully assembled 80S ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Indeed, eEF2 has been predominantly found on 80S ribosomes in this and previous studies. We discuss the implications of eEF2 binding to the 60S subunit in the next section.</p>
<p>Another notable difference between normal and nutrient-deprived MCF-7 cells concerns non-translating 80S ribosomes formed without an mRNA, also termed “hibernating” ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Their content rises from 18% to 27% upon nutrient deprivation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2F</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2M</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2N</xref>). All hibernating ribosome classes feature eEF2. In addition, these maps contain Serpine1 mRNA-binding protein 1 (SERBP1) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2N</xref>), suggested to be the predominant eukaryotic hibernation factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. In nutrient-deprived cells, an additional hibernation class appeared, which contains coiled-coil-domain protein CCDC124 in the ribosomal P-site (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2M</xref>), resembling CCDC124-bound ribosomes purified from stressed cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] and in stressed ER-bound ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Helical density in the mRNA tunnel in this class does not align with SERBP1 and likely corresponds to a different protein, such as La-related protein 1 (LARP1), as discussed below. Similarly, the non-translating 80S classes contain eEF2 in the BSC-1 dataset, with SERBP1 being the second most abundant hibernation factor with ∼32% of the total population (Fig. S2).</p>
<p>To further investigate the potential functional roles of eEF2 on 60S subunits and hibernating 80S ribosomes, we obtained larger datasets of commercial RRLs, which contain larger fractions of non-translating 80S ribosomes.</p>

<p>2DTM with the 60S template, as described above, yielded ∼1.1 million particles in cryo-EM data collected from commercially available rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Fig. S7). Such preparations are derived from nuclease-treated lysates to inhibit translation from endogenous mRNAs, allowing studies of reporter constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Indeed, we collected data from translationally active lysates, as evidenced by luminescence from a NanoLuciferase reporter mRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). After translating a reporter mRNA for 10 minutes, only ∼12.4% of ribosomes are bound with mRNA and tRNAs, indicating a depletion of translationally active states (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and S7). This finding coincides with biochemical estimates of ∼10% of RRL ribosomes remaining on a reporter mRNA following a burst of translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. The predominant elongating ribosomes feature eEF1A, A/T, P and E tRNAs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) or eEF2 with chimeric ap/P and pe/E tRNAs resembling the nearly post-translocated state (POST-2: PDB ID 6GZ4; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). In addition, an unusual class emerged with density at the GTPase center that could not be assigned to canonical elongation factors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>, Fig. S5B). The shape of the density most closely resembles developmentally regulated GTP-binding proteins DRG1 or DRG2, whose homologs (Rbg1/2) were recently visualized on yeast ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. The protein interacts with the A-site tRNA—as if stabilizing the acceptor arm docked at the peptidyl transferase center—consistent with the proposed role of DRG and Rbg proteins in restoring elongation on stalling-prone sequences, such as poly-proline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Whereas the overall shape and secondary structure resemble DRG1 or DRG2, the local resolution is insufficient to distinguish between these proteins. Both yeast and mammalian counterparts are reported to function with a companion factor (Tma146p or Gir2 in yeast; or DFRP1 and DFRP2 in mammals), but our maps do not contain density that could correspond to DFRP1/2 near the putative DRG1/2 density. Future work will elucidate the function of these or other DRG-like GTPases in the context of an elongation complex.</p>

<p>Most ribosome particles in RRL—nearly 60%—are in non-translating states, evidenced by the absence of mRNA density. Like in primate lysates described above, eEF2 is the predominant translation factor bound to 97% of hibernating ribosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The most abundant class represents nearly half of hibernating ribosomes and adopts a partially rotated ribosome conformation. Here, the small subunit body is rotated by ∼5° and the head is swiveled by ∼20° relative to a non-rotated decoding state (5LZS; Table S3), so that the ribosome resembles a late translocating ribosome with two “chimeric” ap/P and pe/R tRNAs and eEF2 or EF-G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. The most abundant hibernating ribosome, however, features no tRNA, and instead three proteins overlap with the three tRNA binding sites: eEF2 spanning from the sarcin-ricin loop (SRL) on the large subunit to the decoding center (DC) on the small subunit; SERBP1 occupying the mRNA tunnel extending into the P site; and eIF5A extending from the E site into the peptidyl transferase center, PTC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). As such, the ribosomal RNA at the key functional centers—SRL, DC and PTC—are inaccessible to other proteins, which was proposed to serve as protection against nucleolytic cleavage that may occur in stressed cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>].</p>
<p>Our classification also yielded three previously unreported, to our knowledge, states of hibernating ribosomes that adopt non-rotated conformations (body rotation less than 1°), in which the head of the small subunit is swiveled by ∼18° (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3. H-J</xref>). Like in the predominant state described above, the ribosomal functional centers are protected by the simultaneous binding of eEF2 with CCDC124 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>) or eEF2 with IFRD2 (interferon-related developmental regulator 2; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). Remarkably, helical density in the mRNA tunnels in these maps differs from the coiling SERBP1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) and most closely resembles La-related protein 1 (LARP1; residues 651-724), which was recently imaged by cryo-EM on vacant 40S ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. LARP1 is a component of RRL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>] and is implicated in translation initiation on pyrimidine-rich mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. LARP1 was shown to bind 80S ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], although no structure was reported.</p>

<p>Our finding suggests that instead of SERBP1, LARP1 or another protein with LARP1-like binding mode binds the hibernating 80S ribosomes adopting a head-swiveled state in the presence of eEF2 with CCDC124 or IFRD2. Due to density features that closely resemble LARP1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) and LARP1 regulation during stress (see below), we hypothesize that the density corresponds to a LARP1 isoform. The protein interacts simultaneously with eEF2 and CCDC124 or IFRD2 in the decoding center (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), and this interaction likely accounts for the ribosome rotational state. The functional interplay between CCDC124 and LARP1, as well as between IFRD2 and LARP1, is intriguing. Their simultaneous recruitment to the hibernating ribosomes may enhance their individual roles as translational repressors during stress and may be cell- or tissue-specific. In addition, as LARP1 controls translation of mRNAs with a terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif, which encode ribosomal proteins, the protein’s recruitment into hibernating ribosomes may help downregulate ribosome expression during stress. Finally, the binding of the extra-ribosomal DM15 domain of LAPR1 to TOP mRNAs may prepare these mRNAs for translation upon stress relief. Indeed, like SERBP1, LARP1 is the substrate of TORC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. TORC1 was shown to stimulate translation at least in part by activating dormant ribosomes via phosphorylation of Stm1, the yeast counterpart of SERBP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. LARP1 binding to and release from 80S ribosomes may similarly be controlled by TORC1 and Akt/S6K1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>] to switch between stress and proliferation conditions.</p>
<p>The hibernating ribosomes imaged directly in RRL lysates differ from ribosomes purified from RRL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], in that the latter only contained eEF2 with SERBP1, or tRNA with or without IFRD2, but not eIF5A, or eEF2 with IFRD2/CCDC124, and LARP1. While some of these proteins may be low in abundance and may have fallen below the detection limit of the previous study, the absence of highly abundant eIF5A and eEF2 in the corresponding classes indicates that they likely dissociated from ribosomes during purification. Indeed, fractions of IFRD2-bound ribosomes with or without eEF2 in the RRL lysate data (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3I-J</xref>) suggest transient eEF2 interactions with some types of hibernating ribosomes. Nevertheless, the most abundant class with eEF2, eIF5A, and SERBP1 is readily detected in cellular cryo-EM or single-particle cryo-EM studies from other mammalian cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>], whereas no CCDC124 or IFRD2 bound ribosomes were reported before with LARP1. These findings underscore the importance of imaging ribosomes within cells or lysates to enable the identification of cellular interactions.</p>
<p>The 60S classes contain eEF2 bound next to the sarcin-ricin loop, featuring open (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>) and compact (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>) conformations. eEF2 and its bacterial counterpart EF-G rearrange between open and compact conformations on the complete translocating ribosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>] or when free in solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. Capturing these conformations in the 60S subunit likely reflects an equilibrium that eEF2 is spontaneously sampling, resembling that of free EF-G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. The obvious potential role of 60S•eEF2 complexes may be to preserve the SRL in free subunits under stress. Future studies will bring insight into this and/or other functions.</p>

<title>Structural basis for eEF2•GDP binding to hibernating ribosomes</title>
<p>The essential cellular function of eEF2, and of its better studied bacterial counterpart EF-G, is to catalyze translocation of mRNA and tRNA during elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. To this end, the translocase binds to a pre-translocation ribosome, containing peptidyl-tRNA in the hybrid A/P state and deacyl-tRNA in the P/E state (in the tRNA hybrid-state nomenclature, the first letter denotes the position on the small subunit and the second letter on the large subunit). The ribosome adopts a rotated state, in which the small subunit is rotated by ∼10° relative to its position in a non-rotated ribosome harboring the “classical-state” A and P tRNAs (aka A/A and P/P). Upon binding, the GTPase domain of eEF2/EF-G docks at the universally conserved sarcin-ricin loop (SRL) critical for triggering GTP hydrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>]. The translocase domain (domain IV) is placed next to the A site on the small subunit. Due to the ribosome’s inherent propensity to undergo subunit rotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>], the spontaneous reversal of the small subunit results in the arrival of translocase domain IV to the A site (also known as the decoding center) and the movement of tRNA-mRNA helix from the A to P site on the small subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>]. The enzyme dissociates upon the completion of subunit rotation and translocation after GTP hydrolysis and P<sub>i</sub> release from the GTPase domain, resulting in the departure of this domain from SRL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>While the roles of eEF2 and GTP hydrolysis in tRNA-mRNA translocation are reasonably well understood, their functions in ribosome hibernation remain a puzzle. Unlike the preferred translocase substrate—the pre-translocation ribosome—hibernating ribosomes do not contain peptidyl-tRNA or mRNA in the A site, which could stabilize eEF2 on the ribosome. Furthermore, previous studies captured eEF2 on hibernating ribosomes in the presence of SERBP1 in the decoding center, suggesting that the latter might contribute to eEF2 stabilization on the ribosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Indeed, SERBP1, spanning the mRNA tunnel, contacts domain IV of eEF2 in the A site in this (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-C</xref>) and previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>]. Our work, however, also identifies eEF2 on hibernating ribosomes in the presence of several other factors, or in their absence (on the 60S subunit), suggesting novel insights into the function of eEF2 on hibernating ribosomes.</p>
<p>In hibernating 80S ribosomes, eEF2 interacts with SERBP1 or LARP1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), arguing that the latter can replace SERBP1 in its function to stabilize eEF2 in the A site of the small subunit. By contrast, eEF2 binding to free 60S in this work, as well as binding of eEF2/EF-G to rotated ribosomes with a single tRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>] placed away from domain IV, argue that the contact in the 40S A site is not necessary for eEF2 binding. Instead, binding on the 60S subunit may be the predominant interaction to stabilize eEF2.</p>
<p>eEF2 binds to the hibernating ribosomes or 60S subunits similarly to that in translocation complexes, in which the GTPase domain is placed next to the SRL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The binding of eEF2/EF-G to pre-translocation ribosomes requires a GTP-bound conformation (e.g. GTP, non-hydrolysable GTP analogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>], or GDP+Pi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]), as the ordered GTPase switch loops bridge the large subunit with the rotated small subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. On translocating ribosomes, the release of Pi after GTP hydrolysis and subunit rotation is coupled with switch-loop disordering and translocase dissociation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Remarkably, we find that hibernating 80S ribosomes, in both rotated and non-rotated conformations, feature eEF2 with GDP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>), and that the eEF2 switch loops remain ordered on the rotated ribosome.</p>

<p>Our examination of the eEF2-containing cryo-EM maps revealed that the GTPase domain is held at the SRL near ribosomal protein uL14. The N-terminal tail of uL14 has been unmodeled in previous structures of mammalian ribosomes with GTPases, likely due to disorder. Indeed, in cryo-EM maps of ribosomes bound with elongation factor 1, eEF1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>] or eRF3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>], harboring homologous GTPase centers, density for the first 10 residues of uL14 is absent or placed farther from the GTPase centers. By contrast, continuous density is evident in our maps of eEF2-bound ribosomes and indicates that the N-terminus is reaching within 5 Å of GDP in the GTPase center of eEF2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). The switch-I (SW-I) helix of eEF2 (aa 55-66) contacts residues 4-7 of uL14 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). This interaction resembles that in recent structures of <italic>G.gallus</italic> eEF2 bound to translocation-like ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>], although the path of the N-terminal tails of uL14 was modeled differently (Fig. S8). Similarly, continuous density is observed for the N-terminal tail of uL14 in our 60S•eEF2 complexes, where domain IV also contacts helix 69 of 28S rRNA (Fig. S9), suggesting additional stabilization of eEF2. In sum, our findings demonstrate that SERBP1 is not required to stabilize eEF2 in the absence of mRNA and tRNA. The N-terminus of uL14, which adopts different conformations in the presence of different translational GTPases, may be involved in stabilizing eEF2 on the ribosome or isolated 60S subunits.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We demonstrate that <italic>in extracto</italic> cryo-EM enables high-resolution visualization of ribosome complexes in the presence of cellular components. In comparison with canonical single-particle cryo-EM (usually involving purified macromolecules) and cellular cryo-EM/ET, this method offers advantages of both methods (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). First, the preservation of cytoplasmic components in lysates enables the identification of interactions between cytoplasmic macromolecules. Indeed, the identification of eEF2 and other novel factors in 60S and 80S complexes in our work contrasts with approaches in which ribosomes were purified prior to cryo-EM analyses. Furthermore, the comparison of fresh lysates prepared from normally treated MCF-7 cells and nutrient-deprived cells demonstrates the reduction of actively translating ribosomes and increase in non-translating ribosomes and individual 60S subunits Additional optimization of buffer conditions may be required to more accurately represent the translation states observed in cells, as ionic conditions are known to affect the conformation of the ribosomes (e.g. rotated/non-rotated) and binding of protein factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>]. Nevertheless, our initial analyses demonstrate the expected changes in the translational machinery, consistent with translational repression during nutrient deprivation in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>].</p>

<p><italic>In extracto</italic> cryo-EM is a flexible method allowing to add purified components, such as an mRNA reporter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), to lysates at different concentrations and time points, enabling equilibrium and time-resolved cryo-EM studies, resembling <italic>in vitro</italic> single-particle cryo-EM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Although purified components could also be added to cells, their intracellular concentrations and time course are difficult to control and measure, making conditions in <italic>in situ</italic> cryo-EM more challenging to control than in <italic>in extracto</italic> cryo-EM. While this manuscript was in preparation, canonical single-particle cryo-EM analyses of bacterial lysates were reported, revealing numerous 70S ribosome structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>]. Similarly to mammalian lysates, bacterial systems are widely used with different reporters and translation factor combinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>], further underscoring the flexibility and broad applicability of <italic>in extracto</italic> cryo-EM.</p>
<p>Finally, we demonstrate that fast grid preparation with lysates (∼10 minutes) enables data collection similar to or even faster than traditional single-particle cryo-EM requiring sample purification. The resulting sample layers are thicker than those of purified macromolecules, necessitating the use of template matching, such as 2DTM and GisSPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>], which are slower than conventional particle picking methods implemented in most cryo-EM software packages. Yet, since no FIB milling of cellular samples is necessary for lysates, the overall throughput including sample preparation and fast GPU-accelerated data processing is superior to <italic>in situ</italic> cryo-ET or cryo-EM. Furthermore, although 2DTM may be computationally more expensive than traditional template-based particle picking employed with <italic>in situ</italic> samples, the latter is often subject to a large number of false positives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>] that have to be removed in subsequent image processing steps.</p>
<p>In this work, we use cryo-EM to grant a unique glimpse into the translation system that has been used in hundreds of studies in the past five decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>]. In comparison with freshly made lysates from MCF-7 cells featuring ∼55-70% ribosomes bound to an mRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), the translationally active commercial nuclease-treated RRL contains a much smaller ∼12% fraction of elongating ribosomes following the translation of an added mRNA construct. These findings are consistent with previous estimates of mRNA-bound ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] and likely indicate the expedient exhaustion of the added resources, degradation of mRNA and/or other time-sensitive aspects of the cell-free lysate.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, thanks to the large fraction of non-translating ribosomes in RRL, our analyses have substantially expanded the understanding of the translational hibernation repertoire. We find that eEF2 is bound to the majority of hibernating ribosomes, highlighting that eEF2 functions beyond its canonical role of the translocase. The binding of eEF2 to hibernating 80S and 60S can occur in the absence of the previously identified abundant hibernation factor SERBP1, underscoring that the stabilization by SERBP1 is not required for this binding. Instead, eEF2 appears to be stabilized predominantly by the interactions with the SRL region on the large subunit. These interactions feature the N-terminus of uL14 approaching the GDP molecule in the eEF2 active site. The conformation of the N-terminal uL14 tail differs from those in eEF1- and eRF3-bound complexes, suggesting that the tail may contribute to stabilizing eEF2.</p>
<p>We also find that LARP1 is an abundant hibernation factor occupying the mRNA tunnel in 80S ribosomes. As discussed above, the simultaneous recruitment of LARP1 with IFRD2 or CCDC124, two other translational repressors, may serve to both protect all ribosome active centers and enhance their translational repression potential. Furthermore, LARP1 may co-localize TOP mRNAs with hibernating ribosomes to expediently resume translation of ribosomal proteins when stress subsides.</p>
<p>In summary, although the composition of hibernation factors differs among hibernating ribosomes, their binding to the SRL (eEF2), mRNA tunnel and decoding center (SERBP1 or LARP1), P-site and peptidyl-transferase center (eIF5A, CCDC124 or IFRD2) make these sites inaccessible for nucleolytic or other enzymes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). These strategic positions are consistent with the proposed function of hibernating ribosome complexes being kept “in reserve” to enter the pool of translating ribosomes when necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>]. Together, our findings underscore the opportunities to uncover novel cellular interactions using <italic>in extracto</italic> cryo-EM.</p>

<title>Optimization of 2DTM in RRL</title>
<p>To study angiogenin interactions with translating ribosomes, we collected a test cryo-EM dataset of translationally competent commercial lysate supplemented with recombinant angiogenin as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. The sample contained 33% rabbit reticulocyte lysate (without nuclease treatment; Green Hectares), 1 µM angiogenin, and 2.5 ng/µl nanoluciferase mRNA and was applied to grids and vitrified using standard single-particle cryo-EM conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. During grid screening, we readily distinguished ribosomes in thin ice areas of the grid and performed overnight collection yielding 10,084 micrographs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Standard single-particle cryo-EM pipelines, however, either failed to yield high resolution reconstructions or discarded most of the particle data (Table S1). We first utilized our standard pipeline aligning movies in IMOD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref>], importing micrographs into <italic>cis</italic>TEM for CTF-correction and particle picking (272,478 particles), and searching alignment angles at low resolution (30-60 Å) against a 25-Å low-pass-filtered rabbit ribosome map (EMDB 4729) in Frealign 9.11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>]. The reconstructions displayed low resolution (&gt;30 Å) and were dominated by a preferred orientation. Limiting the micrographs to ones where CTF Thon rings could be fitted to better than 3.2 Å resolution (600 micrographs with 7,915 particles) and manual particle picking (removing areas of thick carbon or crystalline ice, recentering some picks) were required to accumulate a 6,126-particle stack, yielding a reconstruction at 3.1 Å resolution (FSC 0.143). The cryo-EM map was further classified into 6 or 8 classes yielding four types of classes: 80S+Angiogenin+strong Ternary Complex (80S+Ang+strong TC), 80S+Angiogenin+weak Ternary Complex (80S+Ang+weak TC), hibernating 80S with eEF2, and 60S at 3.4-4.2 Å resolution. We also tried to use a Relion v3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref>] pipeline with CTF correction in GCTF, particle picking using the Laplacian-of-Gaussian picker (140,721 particles), with two rounds of sorting and 8 rounds of 2D classification to remove ice contaminants and particles too small to be ribosomes, then aligning picked particles to a reference derived from EMD-4729, yielding an initial reconstruction at lower than 6.64 Å resolution (4× binned particle stack) from 52,580 particles. Two rounds of 3D classification yielded the same three classes as the <italic>cis</italic>TEM pipeline and at similar resolution (up to 3.2 Å) from ∼16,480 particles. Thus, despite imaging in cell lysates, with manual particle picking we could distinguish and align some ribosome particles and find a novel, high-resolution state (80S+Ang+TC).</p>
<p>Inspection of the micrographs suggested that many ribosome particles were missed by the manual picking process. We therefore employed particle picking with 2DTM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. We started with a limited particle stack of the 1,600 best micrographs from a total of 10,084 micrograph total and picked with a high-resolution template prepared from the 60S of the 80S•poly(GR) complex (PDB:7TOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref>]). The coordinates corresponding to the 60S subunit were saved as a separate PDB and converted into a .mrc map using the e2pdb2mrc.py program from EMAN2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref>] using a super-sampled pixel size of 0.415 Å, box size of 1024, and specifying that coordinates should be centered. The map was resampled to 2× using resample.exe from cisTEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] and then B-factor filtered using bfactor.exe from Frealign 9.11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>], applying a B-factor of 80 Å<sup>2</sup> as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Particle picking with 2DTM in cisTEM yielded a stack of 37,859 particles, of which &gt;95% belonged to high-resolution classes. 3D classification of this larger stack revealed states that were not previously separated in the <italic>cis</italic>TEM/Frealign v9.11 nor Relion 3 pipelines. We optimized high-resolution template matching procedures for faster performance (increasing default values of out-plane angles (from 2.5 to 3.5) and in-of-plane search angles (from 1.5 to 2.5), omitting the defocus (z direction) search, and resampling the micrographs and the search template to a 1.5 Å/pixel, and we picked the full set of micrographs, excluding off-target grid locations (black images, images with broken ice, images on thick carbon), with the 60S template yielding 88,488 particles. The new dataset was rich in substates, including collided ribosomes in the translationally competent 80S•eEF2 and different positions or identities of ternary complexes in 80S•Ang•TC (see Table S1). Thus, high-resolution template matching identifies ribosome particles in micrographs from cell lysates and reveals an abundance of novel states for analysis as compared to traditional single-molecule processing from select micrographs.</p>

MCF-7 cells (obtained from Dr. Michael Green’s lab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref>]) were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 20% FBS (Gibco), and 10% of Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco). To prepare non-stressed cells, MCF-7 cells were seeded in 75 cm² flasks, with the media refreshed every 24 hours and 6 hours before cell collection, for 48 hours. For cells with nutrition stress, the media was not changed within 48 hours. Four flasks of cells were used for lysate preparation with a total of 8 ml of semi-permeabilization buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 110 mM KOAC, 15 mM Mg(OAC)2, 1mM Dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.015% Digitonin, 2x Protease Inhibitor (Roche), 40 U/ml RNase-In (Promega), 1 mM EGTA). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS buffer (Gibco) and then 1 ml of semi-permeabilization buffer was added to each flask. After a 5-minute incubation with the semi-permeabilization buffer, the cytosol-containing mixture was collected. This step was repeated to maximize sample collection (all this procedure was done in the cold room at 4°C). 8 ml of sample were transferred to 30 kDa MWCO Amicon filters and concentrated until the RNA concentration (A<sub>260</sub>; NanoDrop One Spectrophotometer, Thermo Scientific) exceeded 1000 ng/µL. Concentrated cell extract was directly added to the grids and vitrified as described below (Plunge freezing). To skip the concentration step, 200 μl of semi-permeabilization buffer (instead of 1 ml) can be added to each flask and collected for direct application to a grid.</p>
<p>BSC-1 cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% HI-FBS, 2 mM GlutaMAX (Gibco) and 50 ug/mL of Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco). Cells were seeded in a 75 cm² flask and cultured to confluence. After being washed twice with pre-warmed PBS, the cells were detached with Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco) and collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 4 minutes. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μL of semi-permeabilization buffer (25 mM HEPES, 110 mM KOAc, 15 mM Mg (OAc)<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 0.015% digitonin, 2× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 40 U/mL RNaseIn (Promega), 1 mM EGTA) at 4°C for 5 minutes.

After PCR, DNA templates were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and dissolved in nucleases-free Milli-Q water. DNA concentrations were measured using a NanoDrop One Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). The presence of a single band as DNA template was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis (1% (w/v) agarose in TAE buffer). <italic>In vitro</italic> transcription reactions were carried out using 4 μg of purified DNA templates and purified recombinant T7 polymerase in transcription buffer (166 mM HEPES–KOH, pH 7.5; 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 40 mM DTT, 2 mM spermidine, 25 mM each of ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP; and 40 U/μl RNase Inhibitor (NEB; M0314S)) in an 80 μl reaction. After incubation at 37°C for 3.5 h, magnesium pyrophosphate precipitate was removed by centrifugation (14,000 x g, 5 min), and mRNA was precipitated from the supernatant by adding LiCl (2.5 M final concentration) and incubating at –80°C overnight. The next day, mRNA was pelleted by centrifugation (21,300 x g, 15 min at 4°C), washed with cold 80% ethanol and pelleted again. This washing step was repeated three times.

<title>Cryo-EM data collection and analysis</title>
<p>All data were collected at the UMass Chan Medical School cryo-EM facility. Data for all samples except for starved MCF-7 cell lysates were acquired using a Krios electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operating at 300 kV, equipped with a Gatan Image Filter (slit width, 20 eV) and a K3 direct electron detector (Gatan). Data from starved MCF-7 lysates were collected on the Talos, 200 kV. Data collection was automated with SerialEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref>] using beam-image shift to collect multiple videos (for example, five videos per hole at four holes) at each stage position, and targeting 0.7 μm to 2 μm underfocus.</p>
<p>The starved MCF-7 cells dataset contained ∼10,000 movies collected with a total exposure of 40 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>−2</sup> and yielded 88,560 particles. For MCF-7 cells with no stress, the dataset comprised ∼10,000 movies with an exposure of 46 e<sup>−</sup> /Å<sup>−2</sup> yielded 89,484 particles. The movie frames were aligned during data collection using IMOD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref>] to decompress frames, apply the gain reference, and correct for image drift and particle damage. 2DTM was performed on parallelized Nvidia GPU processors (RTX A5000 and A6000), with the match_template program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] implemented in <italic>cis</italic>TEM on motion-corrected images (pixel size 0.83 Å for non-starved and 0.87 Å for starved cells), using an in-plane angular step of 2.5° and an out-of-plane step of 3.5°, with the defocus search turned on for micrographs with thicker ice. To generate the template, eIF6 was removed from PDB 7OW7, and the remaining 60S subunit was converted to a density map using EMAN2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref>] with the box size matching the stack, and the B-factor of 80 Å² was applied using bfactor.exe from Frealign.

<p>Four datasets were collected from RRL samples: two datasets from one grid prepared with mRNA, and two datasets from one grid without mRNA. The first two datasets comprised 13,127 and 14,697 movies (26 frames, with an exposure of 1.515 e<sup>−</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> per frame, resulting in a total exposure of 39.39 e<sup>−</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> per sample or exposure of 1.538 e<sup>−</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> per frame, resulting in a total exposure of 39.35 e<sup>−</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> per sample, respectively). The data were combined to comprise 27,924 movies to be processed with 2DTM. The datasets for RRL samples without mRNA contained 29,855 movies (dataset A: 26 frames, with an exposure of 1.5167 e<sup>−</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> per frame, resulting in a total exposure of 39.4338 e<sup>−</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> per sample) and 44,983 movies (dataset B: 22 frames, with an exposure of 1.3745 e<sup>−</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> per frame, resulting in a total exposure of 30.238 e<sup>−</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> per sample).

Automated data collection was conducted using SerialEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref>], employing beam-image shift to acquire multiple movies (5 per hole across 9 holes) at each stage position. Zero-loss peak (ZLP) refinement was performed every 90 minutes at a unique location to avoid dark areas. The dataset from BSC-1 cells consisted of 24,550 movies, each containing 30 frames, with an exposure of 1.02 e<sup>−</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> per frame, resulting in a total exposure of 30.5 e<sup>−</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> per sample.</p>
<p>MotionCor2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref>] was used for drift correction, gain reference application, exposure weighting, and binning of super-resolution pixels by factors of 2 and 4 to yield final pixel sizes of 0.83 Å and 1.66 Å, respectively.

To speed up the processing, binned image stacks (e.g. 8×, 4× or 2×) were prepared using resample.exe part of the Frealign v9.11 distribution. Focused 3D maximum-likelihood classification into 24 classes (using the high-resolution limit of 16 Å and the 8× binned stack, 100-150 rounds) with an 80-Å focus mask covering the A site and the GTPase-activating center of the ribosome (x, y, z = 261.73, 312.71, 208.96) resolved ribosomes with different occupancies of translation factors (Figs.

<title>RRL</title>
<p>The box size for RRL datasets was set to 800 x 800 x 800 pixels. To speed up processing, binned image stacks (e.g. 8×, 4× or 2×) were prepared using resample.exe, part of the Frealign v9.11 distribution. Focused 3D maximum-likelihood classification into 40 classes (using the high-resolution limit of 16 Å and the 8× binned stack, 100 rounds) with an 80-Å focus mask covering the A site and the GTPase-activating center of the ribosome (x, y, z = 309.98, 345.63, 232.03) resolved different ribosome states (Fig. S7).</p>
<p>For RRL with mRNA, initial classification of 209,874 particles yielded two low-resolution (junk) classes with 13,791 particles (6.6%) that were removed from further classification. Out of 9 classes corresponding to 60S subunits, 2 classes contain eEF2 and the remaining ones represent 60S without additional factors (Table S5). 31 classes were 80S ribosomes: the predominant 19 classes (99,843 particles) contain eIF5A, SERBP1 and eEF2, and 3 classes (15,065 particles) represent the codon sampling states with eEF1A and A/T tRNA. One class with 4036 particles has tRNA in the A and P sites and additional density in the A-site, which improved upon merging this class with particles from RRL without mRNA that featured nearly identical density. The additional A-site density resembles DRG1 or DRG2 (Fig. S5B). Six classes (22,093 particles) featured eEF2, although different density levels at factor-binding sites suggested that the cryo-EM maps are insufficiently separated. These 6 classes were merged (with criteria &gt;50% occupancy and Score &gt;0), resulting in a 17,529-particle stack and then subclassified to 8 different classes with a mask on the P-site. This classification resolved 3 predominant complexes: with eEF2, IFRD2 and LARP1 in the mRNA tunnel, with eEF2 and two tRNAs and with eEF2, E-tRNA with SERBP1. For RRL without mRNA, classification of dataset A was performed with the same mask as in the above classification.</p>
<p>To achieve higher resolution, classes representing the same functional states in different RRL datasets were merged using merge_classes.exe from Frealign, applying a class occupancy threshold of 0.50 and the Score of 0, followed by 3D 1x binned reconstruction of particles using FrealignX or <italic>cis</italic>TEM.

Using a 3D mask for eEF2 (eEF2 from PDB 6MTE was aligned to a 8×-binned map containing eEF2 and then a 3D map was created based on the eEF2 model using molmap in ChimeraX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref>], then masked using vop onesmask #newmap onGrid #oldmap and saved as an mrc file), this stack (binned to match the 8×-binned stack) was classified into two classes, resulting in two maps, both containing IFRD2 and LARP1, and either with or without eEF2. For 80S with eEF2 and CCDC124, particles were extracted with &gt;50% occupancy and score &gt;0, and merged (27,910 particles). This stack was 4× binned and subclassified into 6 classes using a 45 Å mask on the P and E sites. For 60S with eEF2, classes with eEF2 from different datasets were merged in IMOD (38,579 particles) and classified using a 34 Å focus mask on eEF2 domain IV, resulting in 60S with open or compact eEF2.</p>

<p>Subclassification was performed using a focus mask and 4× binned data (Fig. S2), with Frealign v9.11. 3D reconstructions with the unbinned data (physical pixel size of 1.66 Å) were generated using either cisTEM or FrealignX.</p>

<title>Model building and refinement</title>
<p>Cryo-EM structure of (GR)<sub>20</sub>-bound <italic>O. cuniculus</italic> 80S ribosome (PDB: 7TOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref>]), omitting (GR)<sub>20</sub> and P-tRNA, was used as the starting model for structure refinement into all maps (Table S4). 60S, 40S head, 40S body were rigid-body fitted into each cryo-EM map using ChimeraX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref>] based on PDB 6MTD as a reference structure for head swiveled models. For eEF2 (P13639.EF-HUMAN), IFRD2 (Q12894-IFRD2-HUMAN), uL6 (P32969-RL9-HUMAN), ul14 (P62829.RL2 3_HUMAN), eL30 (P62890.RL30_RAT), uS19 (P62841.RS15_HUMAN), and eS28 (P62857.RS28-HUMAN), AlphaFold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] models were fitted into density, using ChimeraX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref>]. The EBP1-ES27L structure was modelled from PDB: 7BHP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>], LARP1 from PDB: 8XP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], CCDC124 from PDB: 6Z6L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], E-tRNA from PDB: 7OSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>], uL1 and eS12 from PDB: 6MTD. To model open and closed conformations of eEF2 in 60S complexes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K, L</xref>), cryo-EM maps from both conformations were softened by applying the B-factor of 100 Å<sup>2</sup> and rigid-body fitted in Chimerax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref>]. After rigid-body fitting and manual modeling, structural models were refined using phenix.real_space_refine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">118</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">119</xref>], yielding structures with good stereochemistry and fits into corresponding cryo-EM maps (Table S4).</p>

<p>In this <bold>important</bold> work, it is demonstrated that certain high-resolution cryo-EM structures can be obtained by using concentrated cell extracts without purification. The <bold>compelling</bold> results with the mammalian ribosomes demonstrate the utility of this approach for this molecule and complexes with elongation factor 2. Moreover, this work also demonstrates the utility of 2D template matching for particle picking for structure determination by single-particle averaging pipelines.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Seraj et al. introduces a transformative structural biology methodology termed &quot;in extracto cryo-EM.&quot; This approach circumvents the traditional, often destructive, purification processes by performing single-particle cryo-EM directly on crude cellular lysates. By utilizing high-resolution 2D template matching (2DTM), the authors localize ribosomal particles within a complex molecular &quot;crowd,&quot; achieving near-atomic resolution (~2.2 Å). The biological centerpiece of the study is the characterization of the mammalian translational apparatus under varying physiological states. The authors identify elongation factor 2 (eEF2) as a nearly universal hibernation factor, remarkably present not only on non-translating 80S ribosomes but also on 60S subunits. The study provides a detailed structural atlas of how eEF2, alongside factors like SERBP1, LARP1, and IFRD2, protects the ribosome's most sensitive functional centers (the PTC, DC, and SRL) during cellular stress.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The &quot;in extracto&quot; approach is a significant leap forward. It offers the high resolution typically reserved for purified samples while maintaining the &quot;molecular context&quot; found in in situ studies. This addresses a major bottleneck in structural biology: the loss of transiently bound or labile factors during biochemical purification.</p>
<p>The finding that eEF2 binds and sequesters 60S subunits is a major biological insight. This suggests a &quot;pre-assembly&quot; hibernation state that allows for rapid mobilization of the translation machinery once stress is relieved, which was previously uncharacterized in mammalian cells.</p>
<p>The authors successfully captured eIF5A and various hibernation factors in states that are traditionally disrupted. The identification of eIF5A across nearly all translating and non-translating states highlights the power of this method to detect ubiquitous but weakly bound regulators.</p>
<p>The manuscript beautifully illustrates the &quot;shielding&quot; mechanism of the ribosome. By mapping the binding sites of eEF2 and its co-factors, the authors provide a clear chemical basis for how the cell prevents nucleolytic cleavage of ribosomal RNA during nutrient deprivation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While 2DTM is a powerful search tool, it inherently relies on a known structural &quot;template.&quot; There is a risk that this methodology may be &quot;blind&quot; to highly divergent or novel macromolecular complexes that do not share sufficient structural similarity with the search model. The authors should discuss the limitations of using a vacant 60S/80S template in identifying highly remodeled stress-induced complexes. For instance, what happens if an empty 40S subunit is used as a template? In the current work, while 60S and 80S particles are picked, none are 40S. The authors should comment on this.</p>
<p>In the GTPase center, the authors identify density for &quot;DRG-like&quot; proteins. However, due to limited local resolution in that specific region, they are unable to definitively distinguish between DRG1 and DRG2. While the structural similarity is high, the functional implications differ, and the identification remains somewhat speculative. The authors should acknowledge this in the text.</p>
<p>While &quot;in extracto&quot; is superior to purified SPA, the act of cell lysis (even rapid permeabilization) still involves a change in the chemical environment (pH, ion concentration, and dilution of metabolites). The authors could strengthen the manuscript by discussing how post-lysis changes might affect the occupancy of factors like GTP vs. GDP states.</p>
<p>The study provides excellent snapshots of stationary states (translating vs. hibernating), but the kinetic transition, specifically how the 60S-eEF2 complex is recruited back into active translation, is not well discussed. On page 13, the authors present eEF2 bound to 60S but do not mention anything regarding which nucleotide is bound to the factor. It only becomes clear that it is GDP after looking at Figure S9. This should be clarified in the text. Similarly, the observations that eEF2 is bound to GDP in the 60S and 80S raise questions as to how the factor dissociates from the ribosome. This could also be discussed.</p>
<p>Overall Assessment:</p>
<p>The work reported in this manuscript likely represents the future of structural proteomics. The combination of high-resolution structural biology with minimal sample perturbation provides a new standard for investigating the cellular machines that govern life. After addressing minor points regarding template bias, protein identification, and transition dynamics, this work may become a landmark in the field of translation.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors describe using &quot;in extracto&quot; cryo-EM to obtain high-resolution structures of mammalian ribosomes from concentrated cell extracts without further purification or reconstitution. This approach aims to solve two related problems. The first is that purified ribosomes often lose cellular cofactors, which are often reconstituted in vitro; this precludes the ability to find novel interactions. The second is that while it is possible to perform cryo-EM on cellular lamella, FIB milling is a slow and laborious process, making it unfeasible to collect datasets sufficiently large to allow for high-resolution structure determination. Extracts should contain all cellular cofactors and allow for grid preparation similar to standard single-particle analysis (SPA) approaches. While cryo-EM of cell extracts is not in itself novel, this manuscript uses 2D template matching (2DTM) for particle picking prior to structure determination using more standard SPA pipelines. This should allow for improved picking over other approaches in order to obtain large datasets for high-resolution SPA.</p>
<p>This manuscript has two main results: novel structures of ribosomes in hibernating states; and a proof-of-principle for in extracto cryo-EM using 2DTM. Overall, I think the results presented here are strong and serve as a proof-of-principle for an approach that may be useful to many others. However, without presenting the logic of how parameters were optimized, this manuscript is limited in its direct utility to readers.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors describe a new structural biology framework termed &quot;in extracto cryo-EM,&quot; which aims to bridge the gap between single-particle cryo-EM of purified complexes and in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). By utilizing high-resolution 2D template matching (2DTM) on mammalian cell lysates, the authors sought to visualize the translational apparatus in a near-native environment while maintaining near-atomic resolution. The study identifies elongation factor 2 (eEF2) as a major hibernation factor bound to both 60S and 80S particles and describes a variety of hibernation scenarios involving factors such as SERBP1, LARP1, and CCDC124.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The use of 2DTM effectively overcomes the signal-to-noise challenges posed by the dense and viscous nature of cellular extracts, yielding maps as high as 2.2 Å.</p>
<p>(2) The discovery of eEF2-GDP as a ubiquitous shield for ribosomal functional centers, particularly its unexpected stabilization on the 60S subunit, provides a compelling model for ribosome preservation during stress.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Representative nature of cell samples and lower detection limit</p>
<p>The cells used in this study (MCF-7, BSC-1, and RRL) are either fast-growing cancer cell lines or specialized protein-synthetic systems. For cells with naturally low ribosomal abundance (such as quiescent primary cells), achieving the target concentration (e.g., A260 &gt; 1000 ng/uL) would require an exponentially larger starting cell population.</p>
<p>Is there a defined lower limit of ribosomal concentration in the raw lysate below which the 2DTM algorithm fails to yield high-resolution classes? In ribosome-sparse lysates, A260 becomes an unreliable proxy for ribosome density due to the high background of other RNA species and proteins. How do the authors estimate specific ribosome abundance in such heterogeneous fields?</p>
<p>(2) Quantitation in heterogeneous lysates and crowding effects</p>
<p>The authors utilize A260 as a key quality control measure before grid preparation. However, if extreme physical concentration is required to see enough particles, the background concentration of other cytoplasmic components also increases. This may lead to molecular crowding or sample viscosity that interferes with the formation of optimal thin ice. How do the authors calculate or estimate the specific abundance of ribosomes in the cryo-EM field of view when they represent a much smaller percentage of the total cellular content?</p>
<p>(3) Optimization of sample preparation</p>
<p>The authors describe lysates as dense and viscous, requiring multiple blotting steps (2-3 times) for 3-8 seconds. Have the authors tested whether a larger molecular weight cutoff (e.g., 100 kDa) during concentration could improve the ribosome-to-background ratio without losing small factors like eIF5A (approx. 17 kDa)? Could repeated blotting of a concentrated, viscous lysate introduce shearing forces or increased exposure to the air-water interface that perturbs the native conformation of the complexes?</p>
<p>(4) The regulatory switch and mechanism of eEF2</p>
<p>The finding that eEF2-GDP occupies dormant ribosomes is striking. What drives eEF2 from its canonical role in translocation to this hibernation state? Is this transition purely driven by stoichiometry (lack of mRNA/tRNA) and the GDP/GTP ratio, or is there a role for post-translational modifications? How do these eEF2-bound dormant ribosomes rapidly re-enter the translation pool upon stress relief?</p>
<p>(5) Hibernation diversity and LARP1 contextualization</p>
<p>The study reveals that hibernation strategies vary across cell types. Does the high hibernation rate in RRL reflect a physiological state, or does it hint at &quot;preparation-induced stress&quot; due to resource exhaustion or mRNA degradation in the cell-free system? How do the authors reconcile their discovery of LARP1 on 80S particles with recent 2024 reports that primarily describe LARP1 as an SSU-bound repressor?</p>
