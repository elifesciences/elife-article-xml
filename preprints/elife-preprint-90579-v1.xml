<title>Abstract</title><p>Partial reprogramming by cyclic short-term expression of Yamanaka factors holds promise for shifting cells to younger states and consequently delaying the onset of many diseases of aging. However, the delivery of transgenes and potential risk of teratoma formation present challenges for <italic>in vivo</italic> applications. Recent advances include the use of cocktails of compounds to reprogram somatic cells, but the characteristics and mechanisms of partial cellular reprogramming by chemicals remain unclear. Here, we report a multi-omics characterization of partial chemical reprogramming in fibroblasts from young and aged mice. We measured the effects of partial chemical reprogramming on the epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, phosphoproteome, and metabolome. At the transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome levels, we saw widescale changes induced by this treatment, with the most notable signature being an upregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, at the metabolome level, we observed a reduction in the accumulation of aging-related metabolites. Using both transcriptomic and epigenetic clock-based analyses, we show that partial chemical reprogramming reduces the biological age of mouse fibroblasts. We demonstrate that these changes have functional impacts, as evidenced by changes in cellular respiration and mitochondrial membrane potential. Taken together, these results illuminate the potential for chemical reprogramming reagents to rejuvenate aged biological systems, and warrant further investigation into adapting these approaches for <italic>in vivo</italic> age reversal.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cellular aging is accompanied by various features, such as epigenetic changes, upregulation of inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, decreased proteostatic clearance, and increased DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, while all these hallmarks consistently show changes during aging, there are only limited insights into their potential causative roles. Additionally, many therapies that have targeted single ‘hallmarks’ of aging have failed to increase lifespan or improve biological functions <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. An alternative way to discover therapies for targeting biological age is to develop tools to quantify it, and then screen interventions for their effect on biological age reduction. Several methods currently exist for quantifying cell aging, such as epigenetic clocks that use mean methylation levels of CpG sites that change during aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, transcriptomic clocks that rely on age-associated changes in gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, telomere clocks that rely on age-dependent attrition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, and various proteomic, metabolomic, and glycomic clocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Most notably, 2<sup>nd</sup> generation epigenetic clocks trained to predict phenotypic measures and mortality instead of chronological age have been shown to outperform many of these aforementioned clocks in their ability to predict lifespan and healthspan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Using various methods for biological age prediction, several intervention strategies have been recently shown to slow and/or reverse biological aging. These include pharmacological interventions such as rapamycin and metformin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, genetic interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, heterochronic parabiosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, and partial reprogramming by doxycycline-induced expression of Yamanaka factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. A natural rejuvenation process during early development has also been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. While partial reprogramming of somatic cells has been shown to lead to improvements in biological function lost during aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, the effective <italic>in vivo</italic> delivery of the transgenic cassettes and precise control of the expression of Yamanaka factors present challenges. To date, no peer-reviewed studies have demonstrated lifespan increase of wild type animals upon the treatment.</p>
<p>Recently, administration of cocktails of small-molecule compounds have been shown to reprogram somatic cells back to pluripotency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>; moreover, short-term administration of two chemical cocktails (7c and 2c) have demonstrated efficacy at ameliorating several hallmarks of aging in human fibroblasts, while simultaneously preserving cellular identity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Thus, partial reprogramming by short-term administration of chemicals could represent a more feasible, controllable, and adaptable method for inducing rejuvenation <italic>in vivo.</italic> However, the effects of short-term chemical reprogramming on biological age and function are currently unknown, and the mechanisms by which these chemical reprogramming cocktails act are not fully elucidated.</p>
<p>To address this knowledge gap, we have studied the effects of short-term partial cellular reprogramming by chemicals in both young and aged mouse fibroblasts using a multi-tiered approach. In essence, we have systematically evaluated the impact of chemical reprogramming on (i) the epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, phosphoproteome, and metabolome using various omics-based approaches, (ii) biological age with epigenetic and transcriptomic clocks, and (iii) cellular function using gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) and measurements of cellular respiration. We demonstrate that partial chemical reprogramming induces widespread molecular changes that occur irrespective of the age of the cells. Moreover, we find significant upregulation of mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes in all treatment conditions at the transcriptome and proteome levels. Importantly, mitochondrial OXPHOS is downregulated in aging, and conversely upregulated by many lifespan-increasing interventions. Using both epigenetic and transcriptomic clocks, we show that 7c, but not 2c, reduces biological age in both young and old fibroblasts. Finally, we show that upregulation of mitochondrial OXPHOS by short-term 7c treatment strongly increases spare respiratory capacity and basal mitochondrial transmembrane potential levels. Taken together, these results imply that partial chemical reprogramming by 7c can rejuvenate several aspects of cellular aging, and that regulation of mitochondrial OXPHOS may play an important role in aging and rejuvenation.</p>

<title>Materials and animals</title>
<p>Young (4-month-old) and old (20-month-old) male C57BL/6 mice were acquired from the NIA aged rodent colonies (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) and were fed standard 5053 chow. HEK293T cells were acquired from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were verified by PCR to be free of mycoplasma contamination. Cell culture reagents were acquired from ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA), reagents for isolating DNA and RNA were from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) and Zymo Research (Irvine, CA), respectively, and general preparatory chemicals and reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Chemical reprogramming reagents were obtained from the following suppliers: Sigma-Aldrich (repsox, trans-2-Phenylcyclopropylamine, DZNep), Cayman Chemical Company (TTNPB, CHIR99021), Tocris Bioscience (forskolin), and STEMCELL Technologies (valproic acid). Tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester perchlorate (TMRM) was obtained from MedChem Express (Monmouth Junction, NJ). Antibodies were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom).

<title>Isolation of mouse fibroblasts</title>
<p>Fibroblasts were isolated from the ears and tails of male C57BL/6 mice according to a published procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. In brief, mice were euthanized by exposure to CO<sub>2</sub> and cervical dislocation, after which ears and 5 cm of tail were sterilized in 70% ethanol for 5 minutes. After air drying, tissues were cut into small, ∼3 mm pieces and digested with a mixture of collagenase and pronase for 90 minutes at 37°C with gentle shaking. Following enzymatic digestion, the tissues were ground in 70 µm cell strainers using a 10 ml syringe plunger, and the resulting cell suspension was centrifuged at 500xg for 5 minutes at room temperature. The cell pellet was resuspended in fresh fibroblast culture media (DMEM/F12, 10% FBS, 1X antibiotic-antimycotic, 50 µM β-mercaptoethanol, 1X non-essential amino acids), spun once more at 500xg, resuspended in 10 ml fibroblast culture media, plated in 10 cm tissue culture dishes, and incubated for 3 days at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 3% O<sub>2</sub>. Following 3 days of incubation, media was replaced to get rid of cellular debris, and the cells were then incubated further until reaching ∼80% confluency. Upon reaching the desired confluency, ear and tail fibroblasts were trypsinized and frozen at 1 million cells per cryovial in fibroblast freezing media (fibroblast culture media with 50% FBS and 10% DMSO).</p>

<title>Production of lentivirus</title>
<p>HEK293T cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM plus sodium pyruvate, GlutaMAX, 10% FBS, and 1X antibiotic-antimycotic, and were grown to ∼70% confluency at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Viral vectors VSVG and gag/pol 8.91, along with either the polycistronic OSKM cassette<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> (Addgene #20328) or the reverse tetracycline transactivator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> (Addgene #20342), were encapsulated in PureFection nanoparticles (System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) and added drop-by-drop to the culturing cells. After 48 and 72 hours, the cell culture media was collected through a 0.45 um filter, spun at 3,000 RPM for 15 minutes at room temperature, and the resulting supernatant was aliquoted and stored at -80°C.</p>

<title>OSKM reprogramming of fibroblasts</title>
<p>Fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates at a cell density of 100,000 cells per well in fibroblast culture media and were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 3% O<sub>2</sub>. Fibroblasts were subsequently co-transfected with 1 ml of each lentivirus (OSKM and reverse tetracycline transactivator), 8 µg/ml polybrene, and 1 ml fresh fibroblast culture media for 3-4 days. Following 3-4 days of transfection, cells were trypsinized and plated on Geltrex® (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) coated dishes and incubated for 48 hours. Then, the media was aspirated and replaced with ES media (fibroblast culture media with 20% FBS, 1000 U/ml mouse Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), and 2 µg/ml doxycycline) and the cells were cultured for 1-2 weeks until colonies appeared (media replaced every 3 days). Colonies were then manually picked, trypsinized, and plated in Geltrex® coated 24-well plates in N2B27 (1:1 mixture of DMEM/F12: 1X N2 supplement, 7.5% BSA, 1X non-essential amino acids, 100 µM β-mercaptoethanol, 1X antibiotic-antimycotic, and Neurobasal: 1X B27 supplement, 7.5% BSA, 1X non-essential amino acids, 1X GlutaMAX, 100 µM β-mercaptoethanol, 1X antibiotic-antimycotic) media, plus 1 µM PD0325901, 3 µM CHIR99021, 0.5 µM Stemolecule™ A83-01, 1000 U/ml LIF, and 2 µg/ml doxycycline. Colonies that survived in this media were deemed to be fully reprogrammed iPSCs and were further propagated into Geltrex® coated 10 cm dishes and cryofrozen in 50% N2B27 media (without inhibitors or doxycycline), 40% FBS, and 10% DMSO at a cell density of 2 million cells per vial.</p>

<title>Membrane potential staining</title>
<p>Fibroblasts were stained with 250 nM TMRM and 10 µg/ml Hoescht 33342 in fibroblast culture media for 20 minutes at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 3% O<sub>2</sub>. Then, the media was aspirated, and fibroblasts were washed three times with PBS before imaging in the dark on an AXIO Observer.Z1 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany). As a positive control, cells were pre-treated with 50 µM of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) for 15 minutes prior to incubation with TMRM. Images taken from random fields (4-5 images per treatment condition per biological replicate) were background-subtracted in ImageJ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, and mean fluorescence was normalized to the number of nuclei per field.</p>

<title>Immunocytochemistry</title>
<p>Cells in 24-well plates were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature, and rinsed twice more with PBS. Then, cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 minutes, followed by blocking with 3% BSA for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle shaking. After this, cells were incubated with the indicated primary antibody overnight at 4°C, rinsed in the morning with PBS for 2 cycles (10 minutes each), and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark.

<title>DNA methylation</title>
<p>DNA was isolated from cells using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Concentration of DNA samples was measured using the Qubit dsDNA BR kit (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA). DNAmAge (using various epigenetic clocks) was assessed using DNA methylation data obtained on the Horvath mammal 320k array<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> through the Epigenetic Clock Development Foundation (Torrance, CA).</p>

<title>RNA-seq</title>
<p>Fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates at a cell density of 100,000 cells per well in fibroblast culture media and were incubated for 6 days at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 3% O<sub>2</sub> with their respective chemical treatments (media replaced once after 3 days). On the 6<sup>th</sup> day, media was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. Then, the cells were directly lysed with 700 µl of Trizol, diluted 1:1 with 200 proof ethanol, and total RNA was isolated using a direct-zol mini prep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). RNA concentration was measured by Qubit using the RNA HS assay kit (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). Libraries were prepared with TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit according to TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Guide, Part # 15031047 Rev. E. Libraries were quantified using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and sequenced with Illumina NovaSeq6000 S4 (2×150bp) (reads trimmed to 2×100bp) to get 20M read depth coverage per sample. The BCL (binary base calls) files were converted into FASTQ using the Illumina package bcl2fastq. Fastq files were mapped to the mm10 (GRCm38.p6) mouse genome, and gene counts were obtained with STAR v2.7.2b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Statistical analyses for gene expression were performed with custom models from <italic>DEseq2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> 3.13 and <italic>edgeR</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> 3.34.1 in R. We filtered out genes with low number of reads, keeping only the genes with at least 5 reads in at least 20% of the samples, which resulted in 16,728 detected genes according to Entrez annotation. Filtered data was then passed to RLE normalization. Differential expression of genes perturbed by compounds was analyzed using <italic>edgeR</italic>. Obtained p-values were adjusted for multiple comparison with the Benjamini-Hochberg method.</p>

<title>Association with gene expression signatures of aging and OSKM reprogramming</title>
<p>Association of gene expression log-fold changes induced by chemical reprogramming cocktails with established transcriptomic signatures of aging and OSKM reprogramming was examined with GSEA-based method as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. The utilized signatures of aging included tissue-specific liver, kidney, and brain signatures as well as multi-tissue signatures of the mouse, rat, and human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Signatures of OSKM reprogramming included genes differentially expressed during cellular reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts (Mouse), and shared transcriptomic changes during OSKM-induced reprogramming of mouse and human fibroblasts (Mouse &amp; Human)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Association between logFC induced by 2c or 7c cocktails and signatures of aging and OSKM reprogramming was examined with GSEA-based methods using top 500 statistically significant genes (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05) with the highest absolute logFC from the corresponding signature. Pairwise Spearman correlation for gene expression and protein abundance changes induced by chemical reprogramming as well as transcriptomic signatures of aging and OSKM reprogramming was calculated based on the union of top 650 genes with the lowest p-value for each pair of signatures.</p>
<p>For the identification of enriched functions affected by 2c or 7c treatment, we performed functional GSEA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> on a pre-ranked list of genes or proteins based on log<sub>10</sub>(p-value) corrected by the sign of regulation, calculated as:

Gene ontology: biological process (GObp), HALLMARK, KEGG and REACTOME ontologies from the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) were used as gene sets for GSEA. The GSEA algorithm was performed separately for each cocktail and age group via the <italic>fgsea</italic> package in R with 5000 permutations. p-values were adjusted with Benjamini-Hochberg method. An adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.1 was used to select statistically significant functions. A similar analysis was performed for gene expression signatures of aging and OSKM reprogramming.</p>

<p>The RNA sequencing reads were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using STAR with the parameters “--chimSegmentMin 2 --outFilterMismatchNmax 3 --alignEndsType EndToEnd”, and PSI values were calculated using rMATS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. To identify the alternative splicing changes after compounds treatment, we compared the alternative splicing events between 7c treatment and paired control sample, and selected the events with significant differences (with the cutoff of |ΔPSIavg| &gt; 0.1, and FDR &lt; 0.05). To quantify the overall damage caused by splicing changes, we also counted the proportion of the events that may disrupt protein function. In detail, we predicted the functional consequence for each alternative splicing event, and counted the following three categories for each sample: (1) Introduction of a premature stop codon; (2) Production of frameshifted proteins; and (3) Loss of a peptide in a protein domain region.</p>

<title>Sample processing for quantitative TMT-proteomic analysis</title>
<p>For TMT18-plex proteomics, a slightly-modified form of published procedures was utilized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. In brief, fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 1 million cells per 10 cm dish and were treated with the specified compounds for 6 days (media replaced once after 3 days) at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 3% O<sub>2</sub>. Following completion of the incubation period, cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS and scraped and collected in 0.4 ml of modified RIPA buffer (50 mM KPO<sub>4</sub> (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% SDS, and 1X protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Samples were then vortexed for 30 seconds, placed on ice for 10 minutes, and pelleted at 21,000 x g for 10 minutes (4°C). The supernatants were transferred to fresh microfuge tubes, and protein concentration was measured by BCA assay (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). Then, 200 µg of each protein sample was reduced with 5 mM TCEP, alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide, quenched with 10 mM DTT, and chloroform-methanol precipitated. The protein pellets were briefly dried in a speed-vac and resuspended in 100 µl of 200 mM EPPS, pH 8.5. Protein samples were digested with 1:100 Lys-C:protein overnight at room temperature, followed by 1:100 trypsin:protein for 6 hours at 37°C.</p>
<p>The samples were then labeled with tandem mass tag (TMTpro) reagents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Acetonitrile was added to a final volume of 30% prior to adding the TMTpro labeling reagent. For protein level analysis, ∼50 µg of peptides were labeled with 100 µg of TMT. For phosphopeptide analysis, we estimated the phosphopeptide enrichment to be ∼1.5:100 and so ∼30 µg of peptides were labeled with 60 µg of TMT. Labeling occurred at room temperature for 1h. ∼2 µg of peptide from each sample was pooled, desalted and analyzed by mass spectrometry to check labeling efficiency.</p>
<p>TMT labeling efficiency was determined using the “label-check” sample, which is a quality control step prior to the final pooling of TMT-labeled samples. Here, we combined a small amount (1-3 µl or ∼2µg) of each sample and analyzed it by mass spectrometry to confirm that peptide digestion was successful, if the degree of labeling was sufficient, and if the labeled samples contained approximately equal amount of peptides. During database searching, the TMTpro label was considered a variable modification at the N-terminus and at lysine residues. We then determined the labeling efficiency for the N-terminus and the lysine residues by dividing labeled N-terminal peptides by total peptides and then labeled lysine-containing peptides by the total lysine-containing peptides. The labeling efficiency should be greater than 95% before proceeding with the analysis. Once labeling efficiency was verified (here, &gt;97%), hydroxylamine was added at a final concentration of ∼0.3% and incubated for 15 min. at room temperature. The remaining samples were pooled at a 1:1 ratio across all channels.</p>
<p>To enrich phosphopeptides, the pooled sample was desalted over a 200 mg SepPak column and phosphopeptides were enriched with the Pierce High-Select Fe-NTA Phosphopeptide enrichment kit following manufacturer’s instructions. The eluate was desalted via StageTip<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> and is ready for MS analysis. The washes and the unbound fraction of this enrichment were desalted and used for proteome-level analysis.</p>
<p>For proteome-level analysis, the pooled sample was fractionated using basic-pH reversed-phase (BPRP) Liquid Chromatography using an Agilent 1200 pump with an Agilent 300Extend C18 column (2.1 mm ID, 3.5 μm particles, and 250 mm in length). The flow rate over the column was 0.25 mL/min and we used 50-min linear gradient with 5% to 35% acetonitrile in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8. Ninety-six fractions were collected and concatenated into 24 superfractions prior to desalting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. These 24 superfractions were sub-divided into two groups, each consisting of 12 non-adjacent superfractions. These superfractions were subsequently acidified with 1% formic acid and vacuum centrifuged to near dryness. Each superfraction was desalted via StageTip<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Once dried by vacuum centrifugation, the sample was reconstituted using 5% formic acid and 5% acetonitrile prior to acquisition of LC-MS/MS data.</p>

<title>Mass spectrometry data collection and processing</title>
<p>Mass spectrometric data were collected on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer, both which are coupled to a Proxeon NanoLC-1200 UHPLC and a FAIMSpro interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. The 100 μm capillary column was packed with 35 cm of Accucore 150 resin (2.6 μm, 150 Å; ThermoFisher Scientific).</p>
<p>Data for the protein superfractions were acquired on an Orbitrap Lumos with a CV set of -40/-60/-80V over a 90 min gradient using Realtime search (RTS)-MS3. The scan sequence began with an MS1 spectrum (Orbitrap analysis, resolution 60,000, 350−1350 Th, automatic gain control (AGC) target 5 x10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, maximum injection time 100 ms). MS2 analysis consisted of collision-induced dissociation (CID), quadrupole ion trap analysis, automatic gain control (AGC) 2 x10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, NCE (normalized collision energy) 35, q-value 0.25, maximum injection time 120 ms), and isolation window at 0.5 Th. RTS was enabled and quantitative SPS-MS3 scans (resolution of 50,000; AGC target 2.5x10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>; max injection time of 250 ms) with a real-time false discovery rate filter implementing a modified linear discriminant analysis. For FAIMS, the dispersion voltage (DV) was set at 5000V, the compensation voltages (CVs) used were -40V, -60V, and -80V, and the TopSpeed parameter was set at 1 sec.</p>
<p>For phosphopeptide profiling, data were acquired using two injections on an Orbitrap Lumos one with a CV set of -40/-60/-80V and a second injection with a CV set of -30/-40/-50V, both over a 150 min gradient. A 1sec TopSpeed cycle was used for each CV. The scan sequence began with an Orbitrap MS1 spectrum with the following parameters: resolution: 60,000, scan range: 350-1350 Th, automatic gain control (AGC): 100%, and maximum injection time: 118 ms. MS2 analysis consisted of higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with the following parameters: resolution: 50,000, AGC: 300%, normalized collision energy (NCE): 36%, maximum injection time: 250 ms, and isolation window: 0.7 Th, and. In addition, unassigned, singly, and &gt; 5+ charged species were excluded from MS2 analysis and dynamic exclusion was set to 60 s.</p>
<p>Once the spectra were converted to mzXML using MSconvert<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, database searching could be performed. Database searching included all mouse entries from UniProt (downloaded March 2022). which was concatenated with a version of the database in which the order of the amino acid residues of each protein was reversed. Database searches used a 50-ppm precursor ion tolerance and a product ion tolerance of 0.03 Da. We have traditionally used the 50ppm mass tolerance for our Sequest, and now Comet, database searches. These wide mass tolerance windows were chosen to maximize sensitivity in conjunction with Comet searches and linear discriminant analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. For static modifications, lysine residues and peptide N-termini were modified with +304.207 Da due to the TMTpro labels. Meanwhile, all cysteine residues were modified with iodoacetamide (carbamidomethylation) that results in a +57.021 Da increase in mass. Also, methionine oxidation (+15.995 Da) was set as a variable modification. Likewise, deamidation (+0.984 Da) at glutamine and asparagine residues and phosphorylation (+79.966 Da) at serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues were also set as variable modifications for phosphopeptide enrichment. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set at 1% at the peptide level with filtering a linear discriminant analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. The protein lists were assembled further to a final protein-level FDR of 1%. The intensities of reporter ions were corrected for the isotopic impurities of the different TMT reagents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. For each protein, the peptide summed signal-to-noise (S/N) measurements were summed and normalized to account for equal protein loading by equating the sum of the signal for all proteins in each channel.</p>
<p>For further processing, normalized Uniprot ID-level intensities were summed and log<sub>2</sub> transformed to obtain unique intensities at the level of gene symbol identifiers. Differential abundance analysis was performed with msqrob2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/statOmics/msqrob2">https://github.com/statOmics/msqrob2</ext-link>), where we included treatment (control, 2c, or 7c), age group (4 months, or 20 months), and the treatment:age group interaction as covariates.

We performed GSEA to obtain protein-level enrichments from the phosphopeptides.

<title>Partial chemical reprogramming increases pluripotency and mitochondrial OXPHOS activity</title>
<p>For this study, we freshly isolated tail and ear fibroblasts from young (4-month-old, or ‘4 month’) and old (20-month-old, or ‘20 month’) male C57BL/6 mice (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>).

While neither 7c nor 2c treatment appeared to affect fibroblast morphology, 2c treatment dramatically increased the number of cells positive for AP activity in both young and old fibroblasts, an indication of increased pluripotency.

<p>Next, we assessed the effect of partial chemical reprogramming (6 days treatment with 2c or 7c) on resting mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial mass using TMRM fluorescence. Previous studies have established a decline of mitochondrial membrane potential with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, that caloric restriction (a well-characterized longevity intervention) acts by increasing mitochondrial membrane potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, and that artificially increasing the mitochondrial membrane potential of <italic>C.</italic> elegans extends their lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Thus, characterizing the effect of partial chemical reprogramming on basal mitochondrial membrane potential may be a reporter of its efficacy. We observed a strong increase in normalized TMRM fluorescence upon 2c and 7c treatment, and this effect was mirrored across young and old fibroblasts (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>). As a control, we pre-treated fibroblasts with the mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP and observed the expected decrease in TMRM signal relative to fibroblasts treated with vehicle. Thus, we concluded that partial chemical reprogramming strongly impacts mitochondrial bioenergetics during basal conditions.</p>
<p>Given these results, we further wanted to establish the effect of partial chemical reprogramming on mitochondrial function. To this end, we performed Seahorse experiments on fibroblasts treated with 7c and 2c (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>) using the Mito Stress Test protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. In order to account for the effects of these cocktails on cell proliferation, we stained and counted the cells with LCS1 immediately after the run finished, and normalized the oxygen consumption rates (OCR) to OCR per 10,000 cells. From the raw traces, we observed similar responses between young and old fibroblasts. While 2c and 7c treatment only had minor effects on basal oxygen consumption rates, 7c dramatically increased both proton leak (mitochondrial oxygen consumption with inhibited ATP synthase minus non-mitochondrial respiration) and spare respiratory capacity (uncoupled minus basal respiration). Furthermore, these results were corroborated by the observed increase in mitochondrial mass and magnitude of the mitochondrial membrane potential in response to 7c treatment. Taken together, we concluded that partial chemical reprogramming, particularly with 7c, strongly increases the activity and/or abundance of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes.</p>

<title>Partial chemical reprogramming ameliorates aging-related changes in gene expression and reduces splicing damage</title>
<p>To investigate the effects of partial chemical reprogramming on gene expression, and in particular on the expression of mitochondrial OXPHOS genes, we performed bulk RNA-seq (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>) on young and old fibroblasts treated for 6 days with 7c and 2c. By principal component analysis (PCA) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>), we observed that fibroblasts treated with 7c are strongly separated from control and 2c treatment by principal component 1, whereas control and 2c treated fibroblasts are separated by principal component 2. Furthermore, RNA-seq samples clustered by age, were separated by principal components 3 and 4 (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 1A</bold>), and demonstrated age-related changes in gene expression (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 1B</bold>). However, the number of differentially expressed genes with 2c and 7c treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>) far exceeded the number of differentially expressed genes modified by age. Accordingly, changes induced by 2c or 7c were highly correlated across tested age groups (Spearman correlation coefficient &gt; 0.8) (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 1C</bold>). We first quantified the effect of partial chemical reprogramming on the expression of pluripotency markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> and the transcription factors Klf4 and c-Myc (Myc) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). Bend4, Esrrb, and Klf4 were all upregulated following partial chemical reprogramming, and this occurred irrespective of the age of the fibroblasts. However, 2c treatment also upregulated expression of Myc and Sox2, whereas 7c treatment did not. Furthermore, 7c somewhat paradoxically reduced expression of Nanog and Myc. Thus, 2c treatment appeared to have a more pronounced effect on cellular pluripotency, which was supported by the increase in AP-positive cells following partial chemical reprogramming. Moreover, 7c had differing effects on pluripotency despite 2c being a subset of this cocktail. Thus, short-term partial chemical reprogramming with 7c appeared to show a different mechanism than normal OSKM cellular reprogramming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, whereas 2c in contrast appeared more similar to OSKM reprogramming.</p>

<p>Since the accumulation of numerous types of cellular damage is thought to be causal to the aging process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, we next wanted to see if partial chemical reprogramming could reverse the accumulation of damaged splice variants. To this end, we characterized the alternative splicing events as a function of age (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2A</bold>) and quantified the proportion of splicing events that may affect protein function (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>). For 7c-treated fibroblasts, we observed a significant lowering of splicing-related protein damage. Furthermore, we noticed a marginally-significant elevation of splicing-related damage with age, whereas the relative proportions of alternative splicing events remained unchanged. To further characterize the effect of 7c treatment on alternative splicing, we assessed the distribution of ΔPSI values of differentially spliced (|ΔPSI| &gt; 0.1 &amp; p-value &lt; 0.05) genes for old (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2B</bold>) and young (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2C</bold>) fibroblasts, separated by the type of alternative splicing. While the number of differentially-spliced events with positive and negative ΔPSI values for exon skipping was roughly equivalent, there was an excess of events with negative ΔPSI values for intron retention across both age groups. Thus, 7c treatment appeared to reduce splicing damage by decreasing the number of retained introns with functional consequences.</p>
<p>To further characterize gene expression changes induced by 2c and 7c, we assessed their association with previously established signatures of OSKM reprogramming and aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Consistent with previous results, we observed significant positive association between signatures of OSKM reprogramming, both in mice and humans, and gene expression changes induced by 2c treatment in fibroblasts from both age groups (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>). In contrast, transcriptomic profiles of fibroblasts treated with 7c didn’t exhibit consistent positive association with markers of OSKM-induced iPSCs. Besides, gene expression changes induced by both 2c and 7c were negatively associated with signatures of aging corresponding to different tissues and mammalian species, suggesting that partial chemical reprogramming may indeed counteract molecular features of aging.</p>
<p><italic>Partial chemical reprogramming increases the abundance of mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes</italic> To elucidate the effects of partial chemical reprogramming on cellular function, we performed multi-plexed proteomics (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>) using isobaric tandem mass tags<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. PCA based on the normalized protein abundances (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>) showed strong separation of 7c (principal component 1) and 2c (principal component 2) treatments from control. This effect was further visualized by heatmap (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>), which demonstrated that 7c treatment had a much more profound effect than 2c. Protein abundances and gene expression changes induced by 2c or 7c treatments were well correlated with each other (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 3A</bold>), with Spearman correlation coefficients &gt; 0.7. Furthermore, genes differentially expressed at both the mRNA and proteins levels (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 3A</bold>) following partial chemical reprogramming were generally conserved across the age groups and treatments (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 3B</bold>). Finally, by Pearson correlation analyses of proteomics samples (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 3C</bold>), we observed clustering by both treatment type and age group. Thus, we concluded that 7c treatment had a profound effect on the cellular proteome, and that our proteomics and RNA-seq analyses were in general agreement with each other.</p>

<p>To gain insight into the functional processes associated with the observed anti-aging effect of partial chemical reprogramming, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the gene expression and protein abundance changes produced by 2c and 7c, along with signatures of aging and OSKM reprogramming (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>). During aging, we observed a significant upregulation of pathways involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and p53 signaling, accompanied by a downregulation of genes related to energy metabolism and DNA repair. In contrast, OSKM reprogramming in both human and mouse models counteracted most of these changes. Interestingly, treatment with 2c and 7c also produced multiple anti-aging effects, particularly at the protein level, including upregulation of OXPHOS, TCA cycle, fatty acid metabolism, and mitochondrial translation, and downregulation of interferon signaling. Surprisingly, genes and proteins associated with p53 pathway were upregulated by both cocktails. Partial chemical reprogramming also affected the abundance of proteins involved in cellular differentiation and extracellular matrix organization, resembling the effect of OSKM-induced iPSCs. Finally, 7c treatment resulted in a significantly lower concentration of proteins associated with the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, suggesting that this intervention may induce pro-longevity mechanisms, extending both the healthspan and lifespan of an organism. Thus, partial chemical reprogramming ameliorated multiple molecular features of aging at the level of individual genes, proteins and cellular pathways, and reproduced several effects of OSKM reprogramming.</p>
<p>Since the anti-aging effects of partial chemical reprogramming on the proteome were more pronounced than their effects on the transcriptome, we then used GSEA on the proteomics data to find pathways affected by 7c and 2c treatments (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 4A</bold>). Many mitochondrial-related processes were upregulated by partial chemical reprogramming, whereas only functions related to cell proliferation and cell cycle were downregulated. In particular, all mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes (I-V, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref></bold>) were upregulated for both treatments in both age groups. Proteins essential for mRNA splicing were downregulated by both age and partial chemical reprogramming, although 7c downregulated more splicing-involved proteins than 2c (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 4B</bold>). Additionally, proteins essential for RNA methylation were upregulated in both 2c and 7c-treated fibroblasts, with more pronounced effects observed with 7c. This observation could be relevant for the reduced splicing damage after 7c treatment, as RNA methylation is known to affect mRNA splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Finally, we studied the effects of partial chemical reprogramming on other proteins relevant for aging, such as chaperones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, collagens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>, and proteins implicated in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> (UPR<sup>mt</sup>, <bold>Supplementary Fig. 4B</bold>). Whereas UPR<sup>mt</sup> was upregulated by both 7c and 2c, chaperones were significantly upregulated only by 7c treatment, and collagen proteins were down in 7c and up in 2c. Taken together, these results suggested that partial chemical reprogramming strongly upregulated mitochondrial function, with 7c treatment having a more profound effect.</p>
<p>Finally, we examined Spearman correlation of changes in both mRNA and protein abundance induced by 2c and 7c with gene expression signatures of OSKM reprogramming and aging (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>). Consistent with our previous findings, we observed a significant positive association between OSKM reprogramming features and the effects of 2c, both at the gene expression and protein abundance levels. Furthermore, the transcriptomic and proteomic changes induced by 2c and 7c were negatively correlated with multiple signatures of mammalian aging. Therefore, partial chemical reprogramming demonstrated the ability to reduce molecular signatures of aging at both the protein and mRNA levels.</p>

<title>Partial chemical reprogramming phosphorylates mitochondrial proteins and activates Prkaca signaling</title>
<p>In addition to using multi-plexed proteomics to quantitatively ascertain overall effects on protein expression, we also evaluated the effects of partial chemical reprogramming on protein phosphorylation and kinase signaling by using TMT-based phosphoproteomics (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref></bold>). First, we performed GSEA on the normalized relative phosphopeptide intensities. Across all treatments and age groups, we observed decreased phosphorylation of proteins involved in cell migration and proliferation, and conversely increased phosphorylation of proteins essential to fatty acid metabolism, signaling and transport of ions, and muscle development and contraction (particularly in 2c-treated fibroblasts) (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 5</bold>). More generally, shared across 2c and 7c treatments was an upregulation in the phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>). In addition, for 2c-treated fibroblasts, proteins involved in lipolysis and constructing muscle were also increasingly phosphorylated. Although 7c treatment reduced splicing damage (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>), we observed no statistically-significant changes in the phosphorylation of proteins required for mRNA splicing. Overall, we determined that 2c and 7c treatment share a common mechanism in upregulating OXPHOS activity by phosphorylating mitochondrial proteins, with 7c having a stronger effect relative to 2c. We also observed that 2c treatment activated additional pathways (lipolysis and muscle contraction) compared to 7c.</p>

<p>To dive deeper into the mechanisms of partial chemical reprogramming, we analyzed kinase signaling pathways affected by 2c and 7c treatments (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>). For all treatments and age-groups, only Prkaca signaling was significantly (FDR &lt; 0.05) and consistently upregulated. Notably, Prkaca, the catalytic alpha subunit of the cAMP-activated protein kinase A, is crucial for regulating glucose metabolism, and upon activation, for increasing lipolysis and energy expenditure in white adipose tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Thus, it is interesting that this kinase was activated by 7c treatment when no statistically-significant effect on lipolysis was observed with this treatment. In contrast, in young fibroblasts, Akt1 and Mapk1 signaling was significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively upon 2c treatment. Both pathways were also strongly affected by 2c treatment in old fibroblasts, but did not reach statistical significance (FDR &lt; 0.05). Mapk1 and Akt1 have opposing effects on regulating the expression of structural constituents of muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>; thus, this observed influence is entirely consistent with upregulation of proteins involved in muscle contraction by 2c treatment. Therefore, we concluded that 2c and 7c share similar mechanisms of partial chemical reprogramming via activation of Prkaca signaling and mitochondrial phosphorylation. However, activation of Prkaca by 7c treatment had different downstream effects than by 2c treatment.</p>

<p>As the levels of endogenous cellular metabolites can have both activating and inhibitory effects on various signaling pathways, we performed an untargeted mass spectrometry-based analysis of metabolites following partial chemical reprogramming (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>).

<p>We visualized the metabolites altered by partial chemical reprogramming by heatmap (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref></bold>), which confirmed that 7c treatment had a much more pronounced effect on the metabolome than 2c, in agreement with the gene expression and proteomics data. Analysis of the top 50 significantly altered metabolites (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref></bold>) revealed a cluster of 6 metabolites strongly upregulated by 7c treatment (guanidoacetic acid, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), tyramine, tributylamine, trimethylamine N-oxide, and atenolol). Interestingly, SAH is known as an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases, both by product build-up and by competitive inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. Thus, the increased abundance of SAH upon 7c treatment could stem from changes in epigenetic regulation through the activity of DNA methyltransferases, especially since protein levels of Mat2a were decreased by 7c treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref></bold>, top). Guanidoacetic acid, on the other hand, is the biosynthetic precursor of creatine and accepts a donor methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> (SAM). Therefore, the effects of 7c treatment on guanidoacetic acid and SAH levels were intertwined. Conversely, many metabolites were strongly downregulated by 7c treatment, including 3’,5’ cyclic AMP (an activator of protein kinase A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>), xanthine (an inhibitor of phosphodiesterases that increase cyclic AMP levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>), and various other purines, nucleosides, and nucleotides (hypoxanthine, inosine, pseudouridine, uridine, uracil, adenosine, and guanosine). In agreement with this observation, proteins involved in xanthine metabolism (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref></bold>, bottom) were upregulated by partial chemical reprogramming with 7c. Moreover, several purine degradation metabolites have been shown to be positively associated with aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>, suggesting that 7c treatment may reverse the accumulation of aging-related metabolites.</p>
<p>In the case of 2c treatment, two upregulated and related metabolites stood out: serotonin, and its biosynthetic precursor 5-hydroxy-tryptophan (5-HTP), which is decarboxylated to form serotonin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. Besides being an important neurotransmitter, serotonin and its precursor 5-HTP are formed downstream from tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase and 5-HTP decarboxylase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup> While the abundance of tryptophan itself was not altered by partial reprogramming, the abundance of niacinamide, which is also synthesized from tryptophan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>, was slightly reduced following 2c treatment. Lastly, for 2c, two byproducts of lysine metabolism (Glu-Lys and aminoadipic acid) were downregulated, whereas lysine levels were not statistically altered. Since lysine is crucial for the cross-linking of collagen fibrils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>, and since 2c strongly upregulated the expression of collagen proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref></bold>), 2c treatment could be downregulating lysine catabolism. Therefore, we observed strong effects of partial reprogramming on the cellular metabolome, and these effects were generally consistent with the analyses of protein and gene expression. Additionally, partial chemical reprogramming with 7c appeared to reduce the levels of several purine derivatives, which could be important for reducing aging-related accumulation of damaging metabolites.</p>

<title>Partial chemical reprogramming rejuvenates both young and aged cells</title>
<p>To assess the rejuvenation potential of partial chemical reprogramming, we analyzed the effect of 7c and 2c treatment on fibroblast age (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref></bold>) using mouse transcriptomic clocks (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref></bold>). As tools to measure age, transcriptomic clocks have successfully reported the effects of interventions known to affect lifespan and rate of biological aging, and appear to be sensitive to transient changes in gene expression that may occur upon short-term treatment with drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and OSKM reprogramming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Application of transcriptomic clocks developed in our lab to the bulk RNA-seq dataset (presented in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>) revealed a significant lowering of both chronological and biological age with short-term 7c treatment; however, there appeared to be only a minor effect on of biological tAge in young fibroblasts treated with 2c.

As a positive control, we also measured the epigenetic age (DNAmAge) of young and old fibroblasts reprogrammed by OSKM expression (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 7</bold>). We found a consistent lowering of DNAmAge in response to 7c treatment, whereas the effect of 2c treatment was weaker and more variable, depending on the clock used. As expected, fibroblasts isolated from old mice were epigenetically older than fibroblasts taken from young mice, which further confirmed that the fibroblasts maintained their aged phenotype in cell culture. Finally, fully-reprogrammed fibroblasts (iPSCs) demonstrated an epigenetic age of approximately 0, which was consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, we concluded that partial chemical reprogramming, particularly by 7c treatment, can rejuvenate both young and aged cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The goal of our study was to characterize the effects of partial chemical reprogramming of cells at the level of the epigenome, transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome, and metabolome. To do this, we used low-passage fibroblasts isolated from young (4-month-old) and old (20-month-old) C57BL/6 male mice and treated the fibroblasts with two chemical reprogramming cocktails (2c and 7c). We then analyzed the effects of partial chemical reprogramming and its relationship to aging using a suite of omics-based approaches. Finally, we combined these multi-omics assays with measures of biological age (by using aging clocks) and cellular function (by utilizing respirometry and fluorescence microscopy to determine the effects of partial chemical reprogramming on mitochondrial bioenergetics). Together, these studies evaluated the potential for partial chemical reprogramming to ameliorate aging features, and uncovered its associated mechanisms for further optimization and development of treatments that could slow and/or reverse aging <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Based on measurements of biological age using epigenetic and transcriptomic clocks, we concluded that partial chemical reprogramming with 7c is able to rejuvenate fibroblasts taken from both young and old mice. Additionally, from measures of mRNA, protein, and phosphoprotein abundances, we determined that partial chemical reprogramming causes wide scale changes to fibroblast gene expression that are larger in magnitude than the changes that occur due to aging. Based on GSEA analyses of these multi-omics data, we uncovered that the most prominent mechanistic signature of partial chemical reprogramming is the upregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which further manifested as a functional increase in spare respiratory capacity and increased mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Notably, the data suggested that the activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A by partial chemical reprogramming may be crucial for mediating the upregulation of mitochondrial OXPHOS. Finally, we showed that partial chemical reprogramming can reverse molecular damage positively associated with aging, including the accumulation of aging-related metabolites and mispliced mRNA.</p>
<p>The downregulation of mitochondrial OXPHOS and translation is a known signature of aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>; furthermore, several recent studies have highlighted that augmenting the mitochondrial transmembrane potential can increase longevity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. In this light, we suggest that partial chemical reprogramming of fibroblasts induces rejuvenation, at least in part, by upregulating mitochondrial OXPHOS. Importantly, this differs significantly from OSKM reprogramming, which shows a strong glycolytic shift in response to the induction of OSKM expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our results are consistent with the activation of different transcription factors by partial chemical reprogramming with 7c, which showed negligible expression of the Yamanaka factors, increased expression of two pluripotency markers (Esrrb and Bend4), and decreased expression of Nanog.</p>
<p>The results of several recent studies have illustrated the changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure that occur during aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>, which may result from several interdependent mechanisms such as disrupted OPA1-,Drp1-, and MICOS-mediated fission and fusion dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>, decreased cardiolipin content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup>, destabilized ATP synthase dimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup>, and uncontrolled opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref></sup>. Importantly, mitochondrial ultrastructure determines bioenergetic function and thus, detrimental changes to mitochondrial ultrastructure (such as loss of tight cristae junctions and cristae curvature) can lead to bioenergetic declines during aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref></sup>. These declines include increased proton leak and reactive oxygen species production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>, decreased respiratory supercomplex assembly and associated spare respiratory capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup>, and impaired proteostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref></sup>. Thus, the activation of factors that reinforce proper mitochondrial ultrastructure could reverse many aging-related elements of mitochondrial dysfunction.</p>
<p>Downstream from the activation of distinct transcription factors by partial chemical reprogramming is the activation (by phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit alpha) of protein kinase A, which functions as a master regulator of energy storage, metabolism, and G-protein-coupled-receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup>. In fact, protein kinase A can become anchored to both the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, where it goes on to phosphorylate mitochondrial proteins such as Complex I (to upregulate OXPHOS), Drp1 (to regulate mitochondrial fission and fusion dynamics), and the pro-apoptotic protein BAD (to increase cell survival)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref></sup>. This tethering of protein kinase A to mitochondrial membranes is dependent on the activity of several A-kinase anchoring proteins, which additionally can recruit phosphatases to counteract excessive protein kinase A activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref></sup>. Thus, the upregulation of OXPHOS by partial chemical reprogramming may primarily stem from the sustained activation of protein kinase A and its subsequent localization to mitochondria. Moreover, the rejuvenating effects of partial chemical reprogramming via protein kinase A activation are further validated by studies showing that knock-out of the regulatory subunit RIIβ extends mouse lifespan and ameliorates aging-related declines in health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have shown that partial chemical reprogramming is able to reverse many signs of aging in a mouse fibroblast model. We thus posit that partial reprogramming by chemicals may represent a viable alternative to the cyclically-induced, ectopic expression of Yamanaka factors for rejuvenating aged cells. Further testing however, particularly in animal models of aging, is needed to fully elucidate the effectiveness of partial chemical reprogramming <italic>in vivo</italic>, and to establish what advantages, if any, it may have over OSK/OSKM partial reprogramming. In addition, a more thorough characterization of the effect of partial chemical reprogramming on mitochondrial dynamics and function, such as OXPHOS supercomplex assembly, cristae ultrastructure, and protein import, could shed greater light on the importance of various mitochondrial processes in the aging process. Finally, elucidating the molecular targets of chemical reprogramming compounds, whether they may be transcription factors, regulators of the epigenome, and/or various kinases and cellular receptors, could further contribute to our understanding of aging and how to best reverse it.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study reports comprehensive multi-omic data on the changes induced in young and aged male mouse tail fibroblasts after treatment with chemical reprogramming factors. The authors claim that chemical reprogramming factors induce changes consistent with a reduction of cellular 'biological' age (e.g., correlations with established aging markers in whole tissues). However, the study relies on previously identified aging markers (instead of aging in the tail fibroblast system itself), and thus, at this stage, the evidence in support of the observed molecular changes truly reflecting changes in biological age in the study system is still <bold>incomplete</bold>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The investigators employed multi-omics approach to show the functional impact of partial chemical reprogramming in fibroblasts from young and aged mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Multi-omics data was collected, including epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, phosphoproteome, and metabolome. Different analyses were conducted accordingly, including differential expression analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, transcriptomic and epigenetic clock-based analyses. The impact of partial chemical reprogramming on aging was supported by these multi-source results.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
More experimental data may be needed to further validate current findings.</p>

<p>The short-term administration of reprogramming factors to partially reprogram cells has gained traction in recent years as a potential strategy to reverse aging in cells and organisms. Early studies used Yamanaka factors in transgenic mice to reverse aging phenotypes, but chemical cocktails could present a more feasible approach for in vivo delivery. In this study, Mitchell et al sought to determine the effects that short-term administration of chemical reprogramming cocktails have on biological age and function. To address this question, they treated young and old mouse fibroblasts with chemical reprogramming cocktails and performed transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and DNA methylation profiling pre- and post-treatment. For each of these datasets, they identified changes associated with treatment, showing downregulation of some previously identified molecular signatures of aging in both young and old cells. From these data, the authors conclude that partial chemical reprogramming can rejuvenate both young and old fibroblasts.</p>
<p>The main strength of this study is the comprehensive profiling of cells pre- and post-treatment with the reprogramming cocktails, which will be a valuable resource for better understanding the molecular changes induced by chemical reprogramming. The authors highlighted consistent changes across the different datasets that are thought to be associated with aging phenotypes, showing reduction of age-associated signatures previously identified in various tissues. However, from the findings, it remains unclear which changes are functionally relevant in the specific fibroblast system being used. Specifically:</p>
<p>1. The 4 month and 20 month mouse fibroblasts are designated &quot;young&quot; vs &quot;old&quot; in this study. An important analysis that was not shown for each of the profiled modalities was a comparison of untreated young vs old fibroblasts to determine age-associated molecular changes in this specific model of aging. Then, rather than using aging signatures defined in other tissues, it would be more appropriate to determine whether the chemical cocktails reverted old fibroblasts to a younger state based on the age-associated changes identified in this comparison.</p>
<p>2. Across all datasets, it appears that the global profiles of young vs old mouse fibroblasts are fairly similar compared to treated fibroblasts, suggesting that the chemical cocktails are not reverting the fibroblasts to a younger state but instead driving them to a different cell state. Similarly, in most cases where specific age-related processes/genes are being compared across untreated and treated samples, no significant differences are observed between young and old fibroblasts.</p>
<p>3. Functional validation experiments to confirm that specific changes observed after partial reprogramming are indeed reducing biological age is limited.</p>
<p>4. Partial reprogramming appears to substantially reduce biological age of the young (4 month) fibroblasts based on the aging signatures used. It is unclear how this result should be interpreted.</p>
