<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The Xerces Blue (<italic>Glaucopsyche xerces</italic>) is considered to be the first butterfly to become extinct at global scale in historical times. It was notable for its chalky lavender wings with conspicuous white spots on the ventral wings. The last individuals were collected in their restricted habitat, in the dunes near the Presidio military base in San Francisco, in 1941. We sequenced the genomes of four 80 to 100-year-old Xerces Blue, and seven historical and one modern specimens of its closest relative, the Silvery Blue (<italic>G. lygdamus</italic>). We compared these to a novel annotated genome of the Green-Underside Blue (<italic>G. alexis</italic>). Phylogenetic relationships inferred from complete mitochondrial genomes indicate that Xerces Blue was a distinct species that diverged from the Silvery Blue lineage at least 850,000 years ago. Using nuclear genomes, both species experienced population growth during the Eemian interglacial period, but the Xerces Blue decreased to a very low effective population size subsequently, a trend opposite to that observed in the Silvery Blue. Runs of homozygosity and deleterious load in the Xerces Blue were significantly greater than in the Silvery Blue, suggesting a higher incidence of inbreeding. These signals of population decline observed in Xerces Blue could be used to identify and monitor other insects threatened by human activities, whose extinction patterns are still not well known.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Xerces Blue butterfly (<italic>Glaucopsyche xerces</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> was native to the coastal sand dunes of San Francisco in association with the common Deerwood (<italic>Acmispon glaber</italic>), which was the preferred food source for larval stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. It was notable for its iridescent blue colouration on the dorsal (upper) wing surface, and conspicuous, variable white spots on the ventral surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. With the growth of San Francisco and the destruction of sand dune habitats, the Xerces Blue became restricted to a few sites in what is now Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The last specimens were reportedly collected by entomologist W. Harry Lange on March 23, 1941<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. It is considered the first butterfly to have been driven to global extinction by human activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The Xerces Blue and the closely related Silvery Blue (<italic>Glaucopsyche lygdamus</italic>) were recently proposed to be distinct species based on mtDNA data from a single Xerces Blue specimen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. However, two nuclear genes analysed (ribosomal 28S and histone H3) were invariable and genome-wide data were unavailable for the Xerces Blue, hampered by the inherent difficulties of retrieving genome-wide data from historical insect specimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and the absence of a suitable reference genome. The genus <italic>Glaucopsyche</italic> consists of 18 extant species distributed across the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. To provide a relevant reference, we generated an annotated genome from the Palearctic Green-Underside Blue butterfly <italic>Glaucopsyche alexis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup></italic>. Using DNA extracted from five Xerces Blue and seven Silvery Blue (<italic>Glaucopsyche lygdamus</italic>) historical specimens from the vicinity of San Francisco, and also from a modern Silvery Blue male from Canada, we generated whole genome resequencing data for both species and investigated their relationships and historical population genetics.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Historic and modern butterfly genomes</title>
<p>We extracted DNA from 12 historical specimens (5 <italic>G. xerces</italic>, 7 <italic>G. lygdamus</italic>) (Table S1). One Xerces Blue sample did not yield detectable DNA in two independent extractions. For each of the successful extracts we prepared a single library which was shotgun sequenced on the HiseqX Illumina platform. We mapped 124,101,622 and 184,084,237 unique DNA reads of Xerces Blue and Silvery Blue, respectively, against the <italic>G. alexis</italic> reference genome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and Table S2). The DNA reads exhibited typical ancient DNA features, such as short mean read length (ranging from 47.55 to 67.41 bases on average, depending on the specimen (Fig. S1)) and post-mortem deamination patterns at the 5’ and 3’ ends (Fig. S2 and S3). As listed in the original museum records, we found one Silvery Blue and two Xerces Blue females (Table S2). Inter-individual comparisons suggested no close kinship link among the studied individuals.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The historical genomes covered 49.3% (Xerces Blue) and 55.2% (Silvery Blue) of the <italic>G. alexis</italic> reference genome, largely because repetitive chromosomal regions cannot be confidently assessed with short, ancient DNA sequence reads (Fig. S4 – S7). To estimate the mappable fraction of the reference <italic>G. alexis</italic> genome, we randomly fragmented it to 50 to 70 nucleotides and mapped the generated fragments back to the complete genome. An average of 57.8% of the <italic>G. alexis</italic> genome was covered with these read lengths (Table S2). We suggest that reduced coverage from the historical specimens may be due to genomic divergence of <italic>G. xerces</italic> and <italic>G. lygdamus</italic> from the <italic>G. alexis</italic> reference (Fig. S8). The annotation of genes located in those unrecoverable regions provided a putative list of 14 nuclear genes with diverse functions obtained from BLAST, that should be further explored to understand the uniqueness of the extinct species (Table S4).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Phylogenetic relationships</title>
<p>Maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference using whole mitochondrial genomes showed that the Xerces Blue specimens form a monophyletic clade, as do the Silvery Blue specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We inferred a time-calibrated Bayesian phylogenetic tree from protein-coding genes Analysis and 12 related butterflies in Polyommatinae subfamily, revealing high support for the sister group relationship (posterior probability=1). We found the specie <italic>Shijimiaeoides (Sinia) divina</italic> inside the <italic>Glaucopsyche</italic> clade, in agreement with previous phylogenetic studies, and we subsequently labelled it as <italic>G. divina</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Because there are no known fossils to calibrate the time since divergence, we first used a molecular clock that spanned the range of rates frequently used for arthropod mitochondrial genes (1.5-2.3% divergence/Ma). Our dated analysis yielded an origin of this subgroup of Polyommatinae at 12.4 Ma (8.82-16.27 Ma 95% HPD interval) and divergence of the Xerces Blue from the Silvery Blue at 900,000 years ago (0.61-1.19 Ma 95% HPD interval, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). A second estimate based on larger-scale fossil-based calibrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> fixed the origin of the subgroup to ca. 33 Ma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, inferred the subsequent divergence of the Xerces Blue and Silvery Blue to 2.40 Ma (1.95-2.73 Ma 95% HPD interval, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). The recent speciation of Xerces and Silvery blue is not obviously due to infection with the Wolbachia, as no evidence of infection of the sampled specimens with this alpha-proteobacterium is detected in the raw read data.</p>

We used MN974526 as a proxy for P. argus; however, after detecting a high sequence identity (&gt;99%) with a previously published P. melissa mitogenome, we have decided to label it as <italic>Plebejus</italic> sp. in the tree.</p></caption>

<p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using PCAngsd<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> and nuclear genome polymorphisms for the three Glaucopsyche species supports the relationships among them; the historical specimens are equally distant to G. alexis in the first PC, explaining 52.81% of the variance (Fig. S9). The second PC separates the Xerces Blue from the Silvery Blue specimens.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Demographic history and diversity</title>
<p>We used the Pairwise Sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> to evaluate the demographic histories of both butterfly species, first exploring the two specimens with highest coverage (L05 and L13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). We found an increase in effective population size in both species that is roughly coincident with the interglacial Marine Isotopic Stage 7 (approximately from 240,000 to 190,000 years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>). After this timepoint the trends differ. We estimated a continuous decrease in Xerces Blue population size in parallel to the Wisconsin Glacial Episode, which started about 75,000 years ago. However, both the modern and the historical Silvery Blue do not appear to have been negatively affected by this event (Fig. S10), suggesting different adaptive strategies to cope with cooling temperatures and/or food plant availability.</p>

<caption><title>PSMC plot of one Xerces Blue (<italic>Glaucopsyche xerces</italic>) (L05) specimen and one Silvery Blue specimen (<italic>Glaucopsyche lygdamus</italic>).</title>
<p>The two historical samples are those with higher average coverage. Individual PSMC plots were bootstrapped 100 times each (lighter lines). One year of generation time and a mutation rate of μ=1.9×10<sup>-9</sup> were used. The peak of the Marine Isotopic Stage 7 interglacial is marked in yellow.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="467457v3_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Second, we generated PSMC curves from the remaining lower-coverage individuals and down-sampled data from specimen L05 to 50% and 75% of the total coverage to explore the effects of coverage on estimation of heterozygous sites. Although there was a reduction in the effective population size estimates, as expected, the temporal trajectories in lower-coverage individuals were similar to their respective, higher-coverage Xerces Blue and Silvery Blue references (Fig. S10).</p>
<p>We subsequently explored the heterozygosity of each individual and found that Xerces Blue had 22% less heterozygosity on average than the Silvery Blue historical samples, a difference that is statistically significant (T-test; p=0.0072) (Fig. S8, Table S2). We searched for runs of homozygosity (RoH) that can indicate the existence of inbreeding in a dwindling population. The total fraction of the genome presenting RoH, although limited, is much higher in Xerces Blue (up to 6% of the genome) than in Silvery Blue, especially in short RoH of size between 100 and 500 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref> and Fig. S11), consistent with background inbreeding. The limited presence of long RoH discards consanguinity as a common scenario in Xerces Blue.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have used a modern reference genome and ancient DNA genome sequence data from museum specimens to explore the relationships and historical population genetic history of an extinct butterfly, the Xerces Blue; to our knowledge, this is the first ancient genome ever generated from an extinct insect. Based upon a near-complete mtDNA genome from a Xerces Blue specimen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Grewe et al. (2021)</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> proposed that the Xerces Blue and the Silvery Blue were distinct species. We confirm this finding using full mitochondrial genomes and extensive nuclear genomic data from multiple specimens. Given the lack of evidence for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection, the recent speciation of Xerces Blue and Silvery Blue seems unrelated to cytoplasmic incompatibility cause by this endosymbiont<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>; a detailed analysis of genomic architectures could help identify barriers to introgression between these species.</p>
<p>Our analyses indicate that the Xerces Blue had experienced a severe demographic decline for tens of thousands of years, likely associated with changing climatic factors. Thus, the destruction of the Xerces Blue habitat by humans was likely the final blow in the extinction process. We provide evidence for low population size in Xerces Blue, correlated with low genetic variation, a higher proportion of runs of homozygosity and increased frequency of deleterious, amino acid-changing alleles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, there was no genetic evidence of recent inbreeding.</p>
<p>Inbreeding genetic signals in the form of long chromosomal sections with no variation sometimes occur in critically endangered species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and in extinct species such as the last Mammoths from Wrangel Island<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> or the Altai Neanderthal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The PSMC shows a continuous low effective population size for Xerces Blue; demographic declines are also seen in some extinct species, including Wrangel Mammoths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> but not in others such as the Woolly Rhino that showed a pre-extinction demographic stability and relatively low inbreeding signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In many endangered species there is little concordance between genome diversity, population sizes and conservation status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>; this decoupling was also observed in the genomes of the extinct passenger pigeon that despite being one of the world’s most numerous vertebrates, showed a surprisingly low genetic diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Despite being notoriously abundant, insects, and in particular butterflies, are very sensitive to climate fluctuations; therefore, we suggest that insects with observations of demographic traits indicative of long-term low effective population size such as those found in Xerces Blue should be considered to be especially vulnerable to extinction events.</p>
<p>Our study further demonstrates the value of museum insect specimens for estimating temporal changes in genetic diversity at a population scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Despite being notoriously abundant, insects, and in particular butterflies, are very sensitive to climate fluctuations. We suggest that insects with genetic observations of long-term low effective population size such as those found in Xerces Blue should be considered to be especially vulnerable to extinction events. However, being the insect numbers usually very high, it is likely that their genomic signals of extinction could be different to those described in vertebrates in many cases. Therefore, this is a subject that should be further explored with genomic data from other declining insects.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Historical butterfly specimens</title>
<p>The Xerces Blue specimens analysed belong to the Barnes collection deposited at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Two of them were collected on April 26th, 1923. The Silvery Blue specimens were mostly collected between 1927 and 1948, in Haywood City, Santa Cruz, Oakland, San José, Fairfax and Marin County (these locations surround San Francisco Bay) (Table S1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<title>DNA extraction and sequencing of Xerces Blue and Silvery Blue specimens</title>
<p>All DNA extraction and initial library preparation steps (prior to amplification) were performed in a dedicated clean lab, physically-isolated from the laboratory used for post-PCR analyses. Strict protocols were followed to minimize the amount of human DNA in the ancient DNA laboratory, including the wearing a full body suit, sleeves, shoe covers, clean shoes, facemask, hair net and double gloving, as well as frequent bleach cleaning of benches and instruments. DNA extraction was performed from 12 abdominal samples of historical Xerces Blue and Silvery Blue, as well as a modern Silvery Blue specimen from Canada. Experimental procedures are described in detail in the Supplementary Material.</p>

<title><italic>Glaucopsyche alexis</italic> genome sequencing and annotation</title>
<p><italic>Glaucopsyche alexis</italic> was chosen as a congeneric reference to compare the demographic histories of both the Xerces Blue and the Silvery Blue. We generated a <italic>G. alexis</italic> reference genome from a male specimen collected in Alcalá de la Selva in Teruel (Spain). Its genome has a sequence length of 619,543,730 bp on 24 chromosomes – including the Z sex chromosome – and the mitochondrial genome. The genome sequence is biologically complete (BUSCO Lepidoptera completeness 97.1%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The <italic>G. alexis</italic> genome was sequenced at the Sanger Institute as part of the Darwin Tree of Life Project following the extraction, sequencing and assembly protocols developed for Lepidoptera<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Xerces Blue and Silvery Blue mapping and variant calling</title>
<p>The ancient DNA reads were clipped using AdapterRemoval2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, and only reads longer than 25bp were kept. Filtered reads were mapped against the <italic>G. alexis</italic> assembly with Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, with parameters optimised for the analysis of aDNA (Supplementary Materials). Basic mapping statistics were generated using Qualimap2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (Table S2). We used bedtools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> to assess genome coverage across the reference using windows of 1mbp for the nuclear fraction of the genome (Fig. S4 – S6), as well as depth of coverage (Fig. S7), read length (Fig. S1) and edit distance distribution (Fig. S8). Authenticity of the sequences was assessed by characterising aDNA damage patterns with pmdtools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and MapDamage2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> (Fig S2 and S3).</p>
<p>We used snpAD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, a program for genotype calling in ancient specimens. The mapped sequences were transformed from bam-format into snpAD-format files, priors for base composition estimated, and genotypes were called using standard settings. The VCFs were combined and concatenated with CombineVariants and GatherVcfs from GATK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> and filtered with vcftools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> to keep only sites within the mappable fraction of the genome previously obtained with minimum read depth of 2, max read depth of 30, genotype quality &gt; 30, maximum missingness of 0.6, minor allele frequency of 5% and excluding indels and multiallelic sites.</p>
<p>Genotype likelihoods were obtained with ANGSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> using the GATK model with the following parameters for all the samples: -uniqueOnly 1 -remove_bads 1 - only_proper_pairs 1 -trim 10 -C 50 -baq 1 -minInd 5 -skipTriallelic 1 -GL 2 -minMapQ 30 -doGlf 2 -doMajorMinor 1 -doMaf 2 -minMaf 0.05 -SNP_pval 1e-6.</p>

<sec id="s4f">
<title>Mitochondrial phylogenetic tree and divergence dating</title>
<p>Haploid variants were called using bcftools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> with a ploidy of 1, filtering low quality indels and variants, after which a consensus sequence was exported. We downloaded 14 complete mitochondrial genomes for Polyommatinae from NCBI (Table S3).</p>
<p>All mitochondrial genomes were annotated with MitoFinder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> using <italic>Shijimiaeoides divina</italic> as the reference. The 11 protein-coding genes were aligned with the codon-aware aligner MACSE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> and the ribosomal rRNAs were aligned with MAFFT l-ins-i<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. We first investigated phylogenetic relationships among five <italic>G. xerces</italic> and eight <italic>G. lygdamus</italic> individuals, with <italic>G. alexis</italic> as the outgroup. We used IQ-TREE2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> to select the best fitting nucleotide substitution model for each partition and merge similar partitions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, built a maximum likelihood tree and assessed support with 1000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To infer a time-calibrated phylogenetic hypothesis, we selected one individual of Xerces Blue (L003) and Silvery Blue (RVcoll10-B005) and analysed with 13 other Polyommatinae species. We used BEAST2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> with the bModelTest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> package to perform phylogenetic site model averaging for each of the merged partitions. Because there is no accepted molecular clock rate for butterflies and no fossils to apply in this part of the phylogeny, we used two strategies to apply time constraints to the analysis. First, we used two published molecular clock rates for the mitochondrial COX1 gene (1.5% divergence/Ma estimated for various invertebrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, and the ‘standard’ insect mitochondrial clock 2.3% divergence/Ma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>). We applied a strict clock with a normal prior set up to span 1.5-2.3% with the 95% HPD interval (mean=1.9%, sigma=0.00119). Second, we borrowed the age of the most recent common ancestor of our sampled taxa from fossil-calibrated analyses across butterflies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. We fixed the root age to 33 Ma and allowed the remaining node ages to be estimated using a strict clock. Analyses were run twice from different starting seeds for 10 million MCMC generations and trees were sampled every 1000 generations. Runs were checked for convergence with Tracer and all effective sample size (ESS) values were &gt;200. Runs were combined with the BEAST2 package LogCombiner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, after removing the first 10% of topologies as burn-in, and a maximum credibility tree was generated with TreeAnnotator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on the National Life Science Supercomputing Center - Computerome 2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.computerome.dk">www.computerome.dk</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Xerces Blue and Silvery Blue population histories</title>
<p>We used the Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC) model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> to explore the demographic history of both butterfly species. We obtained a consensus fastq sequence of the mappable fraction of the genome for each autosomal chromosome (total of 22 chromosomes of <italic>G. alexis</italic> assembly). Only positions with a depth of coverage above 4X and below 15X were kept. Posteriorly a PSMC was built using the following parameters: -N25 -t15 -r5 -p “28*2+3+5”. We used 1 year for the generation time and a mutation rate of 1.9×10<sup>-9</sup>, estimated in <italic>Heliconius melpomene</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Considering that calling consensus sequences from low coverage samples (&lt;10x) can underestimate heterozygous sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, and given the different coverage between samples, we corrected by False Negative Rate the samples with coverage lower than the coverage of L005 (for Xerces Blue) and L013 (for Silvery Blue), as recommended by the developers of the software, so that all samples are comparable with each other. However, since in our dataset we do not reach a coverage &gt;20x, we acknowledge that we are not capturing the whole diversity and thus our PSMC might infer lower historical effective population sizes.</p>

<p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed using PCAngsd<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> after obtaining genotype likelihoods with ANGSD including all individuals. To assess global levels of heterozygosity, the unfolded SFS was calculated for each sample separately using ANGSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and realSFS with the following quality filter parameters: -uniqueOnly 1 - remove_bads 1 -only_proper_pairs 1 -trim 10 -C 50 -baq 1 -minMapQ 30 -minQ 30 - setMaxDepth 200 - doCounts 1 -GL 2 -doSaf 1.</p>

We divided the RoH into different size bins: very short RoH (&lt;100 kb), short RoH (100-500 kb), intermediate RoH (500 kb-1Mb) and long (1-5 Mb or &gt; 5Mb). Short RoH reflect LD patterns, intermediate size RoH describe background inbreeding due to genetic drift and long RoH appear in the case of recent inbreeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>.</p>

We used bedtools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and some in-home bash scripting to calculate the mean coverage per gene of the <italic>G. alexis</italic> genome for Xerces Blue sequencing DNA reads.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study illustrates the value of museum samples for understanding past genetic variability in the genomes of populations and species, including those that no longer exist. The authors present genomic sequencing data for the extinct Xerces Blue butterfly and report <bold>convincing</bold> evidence of declining population sizes and increases in inbreeding beginning 75,000 years ago, which strongly contrasts to the patterns observed in similar data from its closest relative, the extant Silvery Blue butterfly. Such long-term population health indicators may be used to highlight still extant but especially vulnerable-to-extinction insect species – irrespective of their current census population size abundance.</p>

<p>The authors report a study, where they have sequenced whole genomes of four individuals of an extinct species of butterfly from western North America (Glaucopsyche xerces), along with seven genomes of a closely related species (Glaucopsyche lygdamus), mainly from museum specimens, several to many decades old. They then compare these fragmented genomes to a high-quality, chromosome-level assembly of a genome of a European species in the same genus (Glaucopsyche alexis). They find that the extinct species shows clear signs of declining population sizes since the last glacial period and an increase in inbreeding, perhaps exacerbating the low viability of the populations and contributing to the extinction of the species.</p>
<p>The study really highlights how museum specimens can be used to understand the genetic variability of populations and species in the past, up to a century or more ago. This is an incredibly valuable tool, and can potentially help us to quickly identify whether current populations of rare and declining species are in danger due to inbreeding, or whether at least their genetic integrity is in good condition and other factors need to be prioritised in their conservation. In the case of extinct species, sequencing museum specimens is really our only window into the dynamics of genomic variability prior to extinction, and such information can help us understand how genetic variation is related to extinction.</p>
<p>I think the authors have achieved their goal admirably, they have used a careful approach to mapping their genomic reads to a related species with a high-quality genome assembly. They might miss out on some interesting genetic information in the unmapped reads, but by and large, they have captured the essential information on genetic variability within their mapped reads. Their conclusions on the lower genetic variability in the extinct species are sound, and they convincingly show that Glaucopyche xerces is a separate species to Glaucopsyche lygdamus (this has been debated in the past).</p>

<p>The Xerces Blue is an iconic species, now extinct, that is a symbol for invertebrate conservation. Using genomic sequencing of century-old specimens of the Xerces Blue and its closest living relatives, the authors hypothesize about possible genetic indicators of the species' demise. Although the limited range and habitat destruction are the most likely culprits, it is possible that some natural reasons have been brewing to bring this species closer to extinction.</p>
<p>The importance of this study is in its generality and applicability to any other invertebrate species. The authors find that low effective population size, high inbreeding (for tens of thousands of years), and higher fraction of deleterious alleles characterize the Xerces colonies prior to extinction. These signatures can be captured from comparative genomic analysis of any target species to evaluate its population health.</p>
<p>It should be noted that it remains unclear if these genomic signatures are indeed predictive of extinction, or populations can bounce back given certain conditions and increase their genetic diversity somehow.</p>
<p>Methods are detailed and explained well, and the study could be replicated. I think this is a solid piece of work. Interested researchers can apply these methods to their chosen species and eventually, we will assemble datasets to study extinction process in many species to learn some general rules.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for his/her observations and suggestions for improvement and we agree that endangered species show conflicting signals sometimes associated to decreasing genetic diversity (some species are very low in numbers and yet they keep reasonably high diversity levels as compare to others); however, this aspect remains to be explored in detail in insects that have demographic dynamics to a large extent impossible to compare to those observed in vertebrates. We agree there is a full range of cases and circumstances in declining insects to be explored in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Several small questions/suggestions:</p>
<p>1. The authors reference a study concluding that Shĳimiaeoides is Glaucopsyche. Their tree shows the same, confirming previous publications. And yet they still use Shĳimiaeoides, which is confusing. Why not use Glaucopsyche for all these blues?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have decided, for the sake of clarity, to change it to Glaucopsyche divina in Figure 1, as suggested by the reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Plebejus argus is a species much more distant from P. melissa than Plebejus anna (anna and melissa are really very close to each other), and yet their tree shows the opposite. What is the problem? Misidentification? Errors in phylogenetic analyses?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is right and we think there is a mixture of potential problems here that deserve a more in depth analysis of this genus. We used MN974526 as a proxy for P. argus and we suspect now this is probably a case of misidentification (but we cannot verify it without a morphological examination of the original specimen and likely additional genomic data). MN974526 shows a 99.33% identity to the sequence by Vila et al. (2011) code NGK02C411, defined as P. melissa; as the true status of this mitogenome cannot be totally clarified (it is likely that it is in fact P. idas), we have decided to attribute it to “Plebejus sp” in the Figure 1 and explained this in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Wouldn't it be nicer to show the underside of butterfly pictures that reveals the differences between xerces and others? Now, they all look blue and like one species, no real difference.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a good suggestion, and we have now included the underside of different species, including Xerces Blue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors stated that one of five xerces specimens failed to sequence, and yet they show 5 specimens in the tree. Was the extra specimen taken from GenBank?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, the extra specimen is the one reported in Grewe et al. 2021; we have marked in Figure 1 with an * this specific mitogenome (and mentioned in the legend), which clusters nicely within the set of Xerces Blue mtDNA diversity we have generated.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I am curious why the authors did not attempt to do a de novo assembly of the extinct species' genomes. In our work on museum specimen genomes, we have successfully used a de novo approach to extract protein coding genes from such highly fragmented genomes. We used SPAdes to assemble the museum genomes and then assessed BUSCO completeness, finding anything from 50% to 90% BUSCO completeness. The genome assemblies themselves are pretty poor with N50s around a few thousand bp at best, but the information we can extract from such highly fragmented genomes is very useful, especially with regard to protein coding gene exons. Perhaps worth trying?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the comment. In our approach, and considering the expected low quality from some museum specimens in the lower part of the conservation spectrum, we used the standard approach based on the variant calling of short read data mapped to a close assembly. This method has been shown to be precise enough in cross species mapping (Kuderna et al. Science 2023). Local assemblies of exons and genes, while potentially informative, particularly for structural preservation, was not the priority in our objectives where only the base pair mutations were explored. Nevertheless, we are planning to generate in the near future an assembly for the closest living relative of Xerces, Glaucopsyche lygdamus, and once we get it, we will consider the possibility of undertaking the suggested approach with this new reference to explore the genomic architecture of Xerces Blue in more detail.</p>
