<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Adults and children with the 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome demonstrate cognitive, social and emotional impairments and high risk for schizophrenia. Work in mouse model of the 22q11.2 deletion provided compelling evidence for abnormal expression and processing of microRNAs. A major transcriptional effect of the microRNA dysregulation is up-regulation of <italic>Emc10,</italic> a component of the ER membrane complex, which promotes membrane insertion of a subset of polytopic and tail-anchored membrane proteins. We previously uncovered a key contribution of EMC10 in mediating the behavioral phenotypes observed in 22q11.2 deletion mouse models. Here we show that expression and processing of miRNAs is abnormal and <italic>EMC10</italic> expression is elevated in neurons derived from 22q11.2 deletion carriers. Reduction of <italic>EMC10 levels</italic> restores defects in neurite outgrowth and calcium signaling in patient neurons. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotide administration and normalization of <italic>Emc10</italic> in the adult mouse brain not only alleviates cognitive deficits in social and spatial memory but remarkably sustains these improvements for over two months post injection, indicating its therapeutic potential. Broadly, our study integrates findings from both animal models and human neurons to elucidate the translational potential of modulating <italic>EMC10</italic> levels and downstream targets as a specific venue to ameliorate disease progression in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>The revised manuscript incorporates valuable feedback from eLife reviewers (see Reviewed Preprint v1), resulting in an improved presentation of our translational study. Key updates include an expanded transcriptional analysis of our human neuronal EMC10 loss-of-function (LoF) models with a new figure panel (Figure 3L) showing a statistically significant overlap in rescued genes across heterozygous and homozygous EMC10 LoF lines derived from the Q6 22q11.2 deletion patient. Additionally, we included new data from the open field test (Figure S10J), demonstrating that Emc10 reduction in Df(16)A+/− mice does not affect anxiety-related behavior while effectively rescuing cognitive deficits. We also improved the presentation of ASO uptake and distribution in different mouse brain regions, by adding higher magnification images in Figure S14A, providing clear visual confirmation of robust ASO uptake in NeuN expressing cells (&gt;97%) following intraventricular delivery. Other refinements include enlarging Figure 1A, added descriptive titles to panels in Figure 2C-E, Figures 5B-D and Figure S11C-D, and clarifying text throughout the manuscript. These updates collectively strengthen our findings and emphasize the translational potential of safely modulating EMC10 and its downstream targets as a novel therapeutic strategy for ameliorating cognitive dysfunction in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adults and children with the 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS) demonstrate cognitive, social and emotional impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). 22q11.2 deletions are also one of the strongest genetic risk factors for schizophrenia (SCZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). There are currently no targeted therapies that address the underlying molecular mechanisms of 22q11.2DS. Previous work in a model of the 22q11.2 deletion, carrying a hemizygous 1.3-Mb deficiency on mouse chromosome 16 [<italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A</italic>], which is syntenic to the 1.5Mb 22q11.2 deletion [<italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic>mice] revealed a distinct behavioral and cognitive profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Molecular analysis of the <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> strain provided compelling evidence for abnormal processing of brain enriched microRNAs (miRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> related miRNA dysregulation is due to (i) hemizygosity of <italic>Dgcr8</italic>, a component of the “microprocessor” complex that is essential for miRNA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) and (ii) hemizygosity of miRNA genes residing within the deletion, including <italic>mir185</italic>. Reduction of miR-185 levels and to a lesser degree of miRNAs residing outside the deletion {such as miR-485 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>)} result in a de-repression of <italic>Mirta22/Emc10</italic> gene (herein after referred to as <italic>Emc10</italic>), whose expression is under the repressive control of <italic>miRNAs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Indeed, comprehensive RNA profiling of <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice found that postnatal elevation in the expression of <italic>Emc10</italic> gene represents a key transcriptional effect of the 22q11.2 deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Increased brain expression of <italic>Emc10</italic> is recapitulated in <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/−</sup></italic> primary neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) as well as in mouse models of the more common 3Mb 22q11.2 deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Other miRNA targets are dysregulated, but their levels of change are subtler and more variable. <italic>Emc10</italic> encodes for a component of the ER membrane complex (EMC), which promotes membrane insertion and maturation of a subset of polytopic and tail-anchored membrane proteins including neurotransmitter receptors, channels, and transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). <italic>Emc10</italic> is a prenatally biased gene with high expression in embryonic life that gradually subsides after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), a developmental pattern of expression conserved between mice, humans and nonhuman primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). <italic>Emc10</italic> Loss-of-Function (LoF) mutation that leads to reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels rescues key cellular, cognitive and behavioral alterations in the <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). However, whether similar beneficial effects could be achieved in human neurons and whether Emc10 normalization in the adult brain could reverse established cognitive deficits remained unknown.</p>
<p>Here we show that 22q11.2 deletion results in abnormal processing of miRNAs in human neurons and in turn drives misexpression of <italic>EMC10</italic> as previously described in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Human <italic>EMC10</italic> expression is elevated in neurons derived from 22q11.2 deletion carriers and reversal of <italic>EMC10</italic> expression leads to restoration of key morphological and functional alterations linked to 22q11.2 deletions, supporting normalization of <italic>EMC10</italic> expression as a disease-modifying intervention. Toward this end, we also show that antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated <italic>Emc10</italic> normalization in the adult mouse brain is effective at reversing cognitive alterations. Improvements in cognition are sustained for over two months post ASO administration, underscoring the potential of this approach for providing durable therapeutic benefits. The observations that ASO-mediated Emc10 reduction in adult mouse brain rescues cognitive deficits linked to 22q11.2 deletion strongly support a key contribution of Emc10 and Emc10-dependent membrane protein trafficking in mediating the effects of 22q11.2 deletions on cognitive function and pave the way towards translating these observations into potential disease-modifying therapeutic interventions.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To investigate whether miRNA dysregulation and upregulation of <italic>EMC10</italic> is also prominent in cortical neurons from patients carrying 22q11.2 deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>), we used hiPSC lines obtained from three independent 22q11.2DS/SCZ donors carrying a 3Mb deletion and diagnosed with SCZ, along with matched healthy controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) to ensure the robustness and generalizability of our findings across different genetic backgrounds. The first patient/control pair is derived from dizygotic twins discordant for the 22q11.2DS and SCZ [Q6 (22q11.2) and Q5 (Ctrl)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1A-D</xref>). The second patient/control pair is derived from siblings [Q1 (22q11.2) and Q2 (Ctrl)] while the third patient/control pair is a case and age/sex matched unrelated control pair from the NIMH Repository and Genomic Resource [QR27 (22q11.2) and QR20 (Ctrl)].</p>

<p>We examined whether 22q11.2 deletion results in abnormal processing of miRNAs in human neurons as we have previously described in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). We performed parallel small RNA/miRNA sequencing on DIV8 differentiated human cortical neurons from the sibling (Q5/Q6) pair derived using an approach that combines small-molecule inhibitors to repress SMAD and WNT signaling pathways to promote CNS fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). This protocol has been extensively validated and is known to robustly generate cortical neurons while actively suppressing glial differentiation. We confirmed the efficiency of differentiation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene expression assays, which indicated the anticipated increase of TUJ1/TBR1 positive derived neurons and downregulation of embryonic stem cell marker <italic>OCT4</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1E-G</xref>). We identified a number of mature miRNAs dysregulated in response to the 22q11.2 deletion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2A, B</xref>, Supplementary Table S2). As a validation of our approach, we observed the expected downregulation of miRNAs miR-185, miR-1286 and miR-1306 that reside in the 22q11.2 locus (three other predicted 22q11.2 miRNAs, miR-649, miR-3618 and miR-4761 were not detected in DIV8 neurons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2A</xref>). Among miRNAs located outside the 22q11.2 region, we note downregulation of miRNAs such as miR-137, as well as miR-134 and several other members form the largest placental mammal-specific miRNA gene cluster miR379-410 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2B</xref>) that have been previously implicated in neuronal development, differentiation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We used the miRNA-target interaction network tool miRNet 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) to perform target enrichment and network analysis for the dysregulated miRNAs and performed GO term enrichment analysis on this target interaction network. Affected biological processes were prominently centered on cell division and intracellular protein transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3A</xref>) whereas cellular components were associated with the nucleus and the perinuclear region (endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus) of the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3B</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to 22q11.2 deletion region miRNAs, lower abundance of miRNAs in cases is likely due to haploinsufficiency of the <italic>DGCR8</italic> gene and is expected to result in upregulation of target genes. To identify candidate miRNA target genes we performed an unbiased evaluation of the transcriptional responses using bulk RNA sequencing on RNA collected from DIV8 differentiated cortical neurons derived from the patient (Q6) and the corresponding healthy dizygotic twin (Q5) line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4A</xref>). We observed the expected downregulation of genes within the 22q11.2 locus in patient neurons (Supplementary Table 3). Further, RNA and protein expression characterization confirmed the reductions in the abundance of the 22q11.2 locus residing genes <italic>DGCR8</italic> and <italic>RANBP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4B, C</xref>). Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 2094 were downregulated and 1937 were upregulated. As expected EMC10 expression was elevated in patient neurons while expression of other EMC subunits (<italic>EMC1-4, EMC6-9</italic>) detected in our DIV8 sequencing data did not show significant differences. GO term enrichment analysis on downregulated DEGs identified significantly altered biological processes centered on neurogenesis, neuronal development, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4D</xref>). Among the upregulated DEGs, the GO terms enriched were related to neuronal development as well as neuronal cilia assembly and structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4E</xref>).</p>
<p>Intersection of predicted targets of downregulated miRNAs and up-regulated DEGs identified 774 predicted targets of downregulated miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4F</xref>, Supplementary Table 4) including <italic>EMC10</italic>. Notably, functional annotation revealed that predicted targets of downregulated miRNAs include genes that modulate neuronal development and are associated with GO terms such as endoplasmic reticulum and endomembrane system of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4G, H</xref>).</p>
<p>qRT-PCR assays confirmed a robust and significant upregulation of <italic>EMC10</italic> levels in RNA extracted from cortical neurons derived from hiPSCs of the Q5/Q6 pair through SMAD/WNT signaling inhibition, at three distinct stages of in vitro maturation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-F</xref>). Additionally, this upregulation was confirmed in protein extracts from cortical neurons at day 8 of differentiation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). To examine whether transcriptional <italic>EMC10</italic> upregulation is independent of the neuronal derivation method, we generated neurons via inducible expression of Neurogenin-2 (NGN2), a widely used protocol that generates a robust population of excitatory neurons (NGN2-iNs) within 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). MAP2 staining was used to demonstrate the successful neuronal differentiation of the hiPSC lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). qRT-PCR assay of <italic>EMC10</italic> mRNA expression level in NGN2-iNs at DIV21 confirmed transcriptional <italic>EMC10</italic> upregulation in three independent pairs of patient and sex-/age matched healthy control lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I-K</xref>). Taken together our results highlight a reproducible and robust upregulation of <italic>EMC10</italic> in neurons derived from patients with 22q11.2 deletions, which is independent of the derivation method. It is noteworthy that in addition to monolayer cultures, <italic>EMC10</italic> shows significant upregulation along the excitatory neuron lineage (radial glia, intermediate progenitors and excitatory neurons) but not in astrocytes, choroid or interneuron lineage cells, in patient forebrain organoids generated by the same hiPSCs lines used in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>).</p>
<p>We have previously shown that upregulation of the murine orthologue of <italic>Emc10</italic> is primarily due to downregulation of miR-185 and to a lesser degree of miR-485 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Both conserved and non-conserved binding sites at the 3’UTR of human <italic>EMC10</italic> are predicted in silico for both miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5A</xref>). Consistently, the observed upregulation in the levels of <italic>EMC10</italic> gene is accompanied by a robust reciprocal decrease in the levels of the miRNA precursor of miR-185 at DIV8 as indicated both by our miRNA sequencing analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, Supplementary Table 2) and follow up qRT-PCR assays (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The miRNA precursor of miR-485 exhibited a modest but non-significant reduction in abundance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), consistent with our miRNA sequencing profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2B</xref>). This may be attributed to the early developmental stage of the neurons, as miR-485 expression increase during neuronal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate a strong inverse correlation between EMC10 upregulation and miR-185 downregulation, while suggesting that miR-485 may play a less prominent role at this early stage of neuronal development. Notably, overexpression of miR-185 and miR-485 using miRNA mimics in human cortical neurons at DIV10 resulted in reduction of <italic>EMC10</italic> expression levels in both the healthy control (Q5, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and patient line (Q6, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of endogenous miR-185 and miR-485 in the control line by using specific miRNA inhibitors increased <italic>EMC10</italic> expression level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) confirming the predicted conserved functionality of miR-185 and miR-485 miRNA binding sites in <italic>EMC10</italic>. It is worth noting that in addition to miR-185, non-conserved binding sites at the 3’UTR of human <italic>EMC10</italic> are predicted <italic>in silico</italic> for two additional downregulated miRNAs residing within the 22q11.2 locus, miR-1286 and miR-1306 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). The functionality of these miRNA binding sites in <italic>EMC10</italic> and whether they contribute to the observed elevation of its expression in human neurons remains to be determined. Taken together our results confirm that miRNA dysregulation emerges in human neurons as a result of the 22q11.2 deletion and in turn drives misexpression of genes primarily involved in intracellular membrane and protein trafficking-related processes required for neuronal development and maturation. Among them, <italic>EMC10</italic> represents a major downstream effector of the 22q11.2-linked miRNA dysregulation.</p>

<p>To investigate the relevance of <italic>EMC10</italic> de-repression in the development and function of patient neurons, we generated derivatives of the Q6 patient hiPSC line carrying either heterozygous (Q6/EMC10<sup>HET</sup>) or homozygous (Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup>) <italic>EMC10</italic> LoF mutations using standard CRISPR/Cas9 editing approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6A</xref>).

It is noteworthy that we did not observe an upregulation of <italic>EMC10</italic> mRNA levels in the Q6 hiPSC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6F</xref>), a finding likely attributed to the general low expression level of miR-185 and miR-485 in hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>).

<p><italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice show impaired formation of dendrites in deep layer cortical neurons, which are faithfully recapitulated in primary neuronal cultures and are partially reversed by reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). We asked whether impaired dendritic formation is also observed in human neuronal cultures from patients with 22q11.2 deletions and whether reduction of <italic>EMC10</italic> levels could prevent such morphological alterations during neuronal maturation. We employed monolayer neuronal cultures of NGN2-iNs. Neuronal cells were fixed at DIV21 of differentiation, immuno-stained, traced and key indices of dendritic architecture were quantified (see Materials and Methods). Our analysis confirmed a reduced dendritic complexity in mutant neurons as reflected in total neuronal length, the number of branch points and the total number of dendrites per cell (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-F</xref>). The number of primary dendrites per cell were unchanged (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>) in accordance with previous findings from the murine 22q11.2 deletion model where only subtle changes were detected in the number of primary neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Importantly, we found that reduction or elimination of <italic>EMC10 expression</italic> restored to WT levels neuronal length and branchpoints. Importantly, we found that reducing or eliminating EMC10 expression restored neuronal length and branch points to WT levels. Notably, the number of branch points in Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup> neurons exceeded those in WT neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>) likely suggesting that reduced (or abolished) <italic>Emc10</italic> expression can alter normal neurite growth, resulting in excessive responses, potentially triggered upon gene restoration by the mutant system’s adaptation to dysfunction, leading to altered receptor sensitivity or signaling dynamics. This highlights the critical importance of precise <italic>Emc10</italic> expression for maintaining proper neuronal development and function.</p>
<p>Our previous evaluation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis perturbations caused by 22q11.2 deletions using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging on primary neurons from <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice revealed a significantly lower amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation following KCl evoked depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). This impairment was replicated in human cortical neurons from patients with 22q11.2 deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) and shown to be partially restored by exogenous expression of <italic>DGCR8</italic>, indicating a potential role of miRNA dysregulation. Using the green-fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo-4 and time-lapse microscopy we confirmed a decrease in the amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise following KCl evoked depolarization, in patient (Q6) derived NGN2-iNs at DIV37/38 compared to the healthy twin (Q5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7A, B</xref>). We asked whether reduction of EMC10 levels could reverse such alterations. Notably, the observed defect in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling were reversed in both Q6/EMC10<sup>HET</sup> and Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup> NGN2-iNs as demonstrated by the increased amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise following depolarization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H, I</xref>). Interestingly, the amplitudes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise in Q6/EMC10<sup>HET</sup> and Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup> were slightly elevated compared to the WT control group, consistent with the effects on neurite outgrowth (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). The observation that reduction of <italic>EMC10</italic> levels fully restores the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling deficits observed in patient neurons suggests that miRNA-dependent elevation of <italic>EMC10</italic> may interfere with one or more sources of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and a wide range of calcium-dependent processes.</p>
<p>Differentially expressed genes are often organized into functional groups or pathways based on their known biological roles. We used transcriptional profiling as an indirect measure of cellular pathways affected by the reduction of EMC10 levels by identifying genes differentially expressed between the parental Q6/Q5 lines whose expression differences are abolished or nearly abolished (“rescued”) in either Q6/EMC10<sup>HET</sup> or Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup> NGN2-iNs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J, K</xref>). In the Q6/EMC10<sup>HET</sup> line, 237 DEGs (6%) were rescued (111 downregulated and 126 upregulated), while in the Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup> line, 382 DEGs (11%) were rescued (193 downregulated and 189 upregulated) (Supplementary Table 6). In both cases, functional annotation analysis indicated highest enrichment scores for terms related to nervous system development as well as an enrichment in GO terms relevant to neuronal generation and differentiation. Intersection of “rescued” genes in Q6/EMC10<sup>HET</sup> and Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup> NGN2-iNs identified 103 shared DEGs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L</xref> and Supplementary Table 7). To assess the significance of the overlap between the rescued DEGs in Q6/EMC10<sup>HET</sup> and Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup> NGN2-iNs, we performed a hypergeometric test, which calculates the probability of observing the degree of overlap between two gene groups under the null hypothesis that the overlap occurs by chance. Our analysis revealed a significant overlap (enrichment factor = 1.7; p &lt; 0.0001), indicating that the overlap is much greater than expected by chance. These 103 shared DEGs likely play a key role in pathways influenced by EMC10 levels, particularly those involved in nervous system development, as suggested by our functional annotation analysis. To further investigate the functional relationships among these shared DEGs, we conducted a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. This analysis highlighted a functional cluster including 30 of these genes, such as the SCZ-linked genes <italic>PCDHA2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>)<italic>, RBFOX1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) and <italic>RGS4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig. S8A</xref>), involved in nervous system development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig. S8B</xref>). It should be noted that the beneficial effect of elimination of EMC10 expression is consistent with previous findings that lack of EMC10 does not compromise EMC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) and implying an auxiliary or modulatory role of EMC10 in the EMC function.</p>
<p>Taken together, our analysis of neurons from 22q11.2 deletion carriers indicate that elevation of <italic>EMC10</italic> expression disrupts their development and maturation in a way similar to observations in murine neurons, and support normalization of <italic>EMC10</italic> expression as a disease-modifying intervention. While our previous work has shown that constitutive genetic reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels rescues key cognitive and behavioral alterations in the <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice, translating these observations into therapeutic interventions requires demonstration that it is the sustained elevation of <italic>EMC10</italic> throughout the adult life that interferes with the underlying neural processes rather than an irreversible impact on brain maturation during early development. Toward this end, we first investigated whether restoration of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels in the brain of adult (2– 4-month-old) <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice is effective at reversing cognitive alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Specifically, we examined the effects of <italic>Emc10</italic> reduction in adult brain on social memory (SM), a cognitive domain robustly and reproducibly affected in adult <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic>mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Notably, SM deficits are also present in juvenile <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice as early as postnatal day 22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Fig. S9A, B</xref>), underscoring the severity of this phenotype, which emerges during early adulthood. In humans, SM, a key component of social cognition, involves encoding, storing, and retrieving information about social experiences, such as recognizing familiar individuals and recalling past interactions and emotions. Social cognition, the broader ability to perceive, interpret, and respond to social cues, is essential for forming relationships and understanding others’ behavior. Disruptions in SM can impair social cognition, contributing to the functional deficits commonly observed in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Deficits in social cognition are present in individuals with 22q11.2 deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) and use of rodent tasks that evaluate SM can serve as a useful proxy of the human condition. Impaired SM in <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic>mice is fully restored by constitutive genetic reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>To manipulate the expression of the <italic>Emc10</italic> gene in adult <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice we used a <italic>Emc10</italic> conditional ‘knockout-first’ design by conducting a Flp- and Cre-dependent genetic switch strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig. S10A</xref>). Parental <italic>Emc10<sup>+/-</sup> <sup>tm1a</sup></italic> mice were crossed to a germline Flp mouse line that activates global Flp function and leads to the deletion of the frt-flanked sequence(s) in the offspring. The <italic>Emc10<sup>tm1c</sup></italic> offspring from this cross carry a <italic>loxP</italic> flanked WT <italic>Emc10</italic> allele and are essentially WT. To achieve temporal control of <italic>Emc10</italic> expression we used an inducible UBC-Cre/ERT2 mouse line that activates global Cre function upon tamoxifen (TAM) treatment. This approach enables postnatal normalization of <italic>Emc10</italic> expression at its endogenous locus preserving <italic>Emc10</italic> expression within its physiological levels. We used UBC-Cre/ERT2 mice in crosses to generate compound <italic>Emc10<sup>tm1c+/-</sup></italic>; UBC-cre/ERT2; <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic>mice. These mice have two WT <italic>Emc10</italic> copies upregulated, as expected in the <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A</italic> background, until TAM-induced Cre expression deletes the tagged <italic>Emc10</italic> allele. We used oral gavage to deliver TAM and implement Cre-mediated <italic>Emc10</italic> deletion during adulthood (postnatal day 56-70). Corn oil treatment served as a control. Behavioral analysis was performed on the following four groups: <italic>Emc10<sup>tm1c+/-</sup></italic>; UBC-cre/ERT2; <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice treated with TAM (WT + TAM), <italic>Emc10<sup>tm1c+/-</sup></italic>; UBC-cre/ERT2; <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic>mice treated with TAM (<italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic>+ TAM), <italic>Emc10<sup>tm1c+/-</sup></italic>; UBC-cre/ERT2; <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice treated with corn oil vehicle (WT + oil), and <italic>Emc10<sup>tm1c+/-</sup></italic>; UBC-cre/ERT2; <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice treated with corn oil vehicle (<italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> + oil). Investigation of the efficiency of Cre-mediated deletion in brain lysate preparations from prefrontal cortex (PFC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig. S10B, C</xref>), hippocampus (HPC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig. S10D, E</xref>) and cerebellum (CB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig. S10F</xref>) confirmed that upon TAM treatment, <italic>Emc10</italic> mRNA and protein levels were restored to near WT levels in the adult brain of <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice. As expected, <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> + oil mice showed impaired SM performance compared to WT + oil control littermates, which was fully rescued upon TAM treatment. Specifically, upon reintroduction of a familiar juvenile mouse <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic>+ TAM mice showed a strong reduction in social interaction, indicative of intact SM, comparable to TAM-treated WT littermates and significantly different from <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice treated with corn oil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig. S10G</xref>). The intact SM of the <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> + TAM mice was further evident in analysis of difference score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig. S10H</xref>) compared to the corn oil-treated <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice. Interaction times during the first trial of the SM assay, which measures general social interest, were unaffected by TAM treatment. In contrast to SM, <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic>mice hyperactivity in the open field was not affected upon TAM treatment consistent with our previous results from constitutive genetic reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig. S10I</xref>). Notably, TAM treatment did not alter the time spent in the center area of the open field, indicating an absence of changes in anxiety-related behavior. These findings demonstrate that restoring Emc10 levels in adult <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic>mice can significantly improve cognitive deficits, underscoring a broad therapeutic window and establishing Emc10 as a promising target for postnatal interventions.</p>
<p>We explored the translation potential of this finding by employing transient injection of single stranded ASOs targeting the mouse gene as dictated by their demonstrated efficacy as a therapeutic modality in preclinical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>) and clinical studies of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) or neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Over 300 chimeric 2′-O-methoxyethyl (2’MOE)/DNA gapmer ASOs were generated and screened for <italic>Emc10</italic> mRNA reduction in 4T1 cells via electroporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Fig. S11A</xref>). Lead ASOs were then confirmed in a dose-response assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Fig. S11B</xref>), including the lead ASO (1081815, herein referred to as Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup>), which targets intron 2 of mouse <italic>Emc10</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> was selected for subsequent studies, as it was effective in lowering <italic>Emc10</italic> expression both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, following transient intracerebral ventricular (ICV) injection in the posterior ventricle of 8 weeks old WT mice, Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> effectively suppressed the levels of <italic>Emc10</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Fig. S11C</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Fig. S11D</xref>) in both left and right HPC compared to WT mice treated with a control ASO (Ctrl<sup>ASO1</sup>) without complementarity in the mouse. Analysis of <italic>Gfap</italic> and <italic>Aif1</italic> expression did not reveal any changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Fig. S11E, F</xref>) suggesting lack of astroglial and microglial activation upon Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> injection. Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> injected mice showed normal gait and no signs of behavioral toxicity. IHC analysis using an antibody that selectively recognizes the phosphorothioate backbone verified a robust diffusion primarily in HPC and to a lesser degree in surrounding brain areas. Colocalization with the neuronal marker NeuN and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) confirmed accumulation in hippocampal neurons as well as GFAP-expressing astrocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Analysis of <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic>mice treated by intraventricular injection at 8 weeks of age showed that Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> effectively lowered hippocampal <italic>Emc10</italic> mRNA to nearly WT levels 3 weeks post-injection resulting in normalization of <italic>Emc10</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, left panel). By contrast, consistent with the pattern of ASO distribution, we did not observe a significant reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> expression levels in the PFC of <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>) <italic><sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice treated with Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, right panel). In addition to targeted assays, we performed bulk RNA-sequencing analysis of Ctrl<sup>ASO1</sup> and Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup>-treated <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice and WT littermates to evaluate the effect of Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> treatment on the hippocampal transcriptome profile. In the Ctrl<sup>ASO1</sup> treated group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, left panel), we observe the tripartite differential gene expression signature characteristic of <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic>mice: upregulation of <italic>Emc10</italic> and non-coding RNAs (pri-forms of miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, left panel and inset, Log2Fold Change = 0.5) as well as the expected downregulation of genes included within the <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A</italic> deficiency. In the Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> treated group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, right panel and inset), <italic>Emc10</italic> is no longer upregulated in <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice while non-coding RNAs remain upregulated, and genes included in the deficiency are robustly downregulated. Apart from <italic>Emc10</italic>, seven other genes (<italic>Mir9-3hg</italic>, <italic>Plxnd1</italic>, <italic>Cd68</italic>, <italic>Mir22hg</italic>, <italic>Gm28439</italic>, <italic>Adgre1</italic>, and <italic>Tnn</italic>) are significantly upregulated in <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice in the Ctrl<sup>ASO1</sup> but not in the Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup>-treated group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls8">Supplementary Table S8</xref>). We used the Bowtie mapping tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>) to align short sequencing reads on both genomic and transcript sequence to assess whether these expression changes represent potential off-target effects of the Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> in the mouse transcriptome. Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> exclusively aligned with full complementarity to an intronic region in the <italic>Emc10</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) providing additional support for high target specificity. The observed changes might represent downstream effects of <italic>Emc10</italic> level reduction or reflect expression variability due to low expression levels of the upregulated genes.</p>

<p>Eight-week-old <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice and WT littermates were treated by ICV injection of Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> and Ctrl<sup>ASO1</sup> and tested 3 weeks later in SM assays. <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice treated with Ctrl<sup>ASO1</sup> showed the expected deficits in SM as reflected in the sustained high interaction time with the reintroduced familiar juvenile mouse. By contrast, <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice injected with Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> had significantly improved memory performance to levels indistinguishable from Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup>-treated WT littermates, consistent with improvement of function arising from adult restoration of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, F</xref>). Interaction times during the first trial of the SM assay, which measures general social interest, were unaffected by ASO treatment. Rescue was observed in both sexes and no significant differences were seen in treatment across sexes. In control experiments, we did not observe any effects of genotype or treatment upon reintroduction of a novel juvenile mouse in trial 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs12">Fig. S12A, B</xref>), strongly indicating that SM deficits are not driven by a simple task fatigue. To evaluate the consistency and reproducibility of the ASO-mediated SM rescue we generated additional ASOs targeting different regions within the Emc10 transcript and screened them for <italic>Emc10</italic> mRNA reduction <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs13">Fig. S13A-C</xref>). One of these ASOs (1466182, herein referred to as Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup>), which targets intron 1 of mouse <italic>Emc10</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) was selected as the lead ASO candidate for the replication analysis based on its efficacy in reducing <italic>Emc10</italic> levels, distribution pattern, as well as the lack of any signs of astroglial/microglial activation or behavioral toxicity (see Materials and Methods). IHC analysis showed robust ASO distribution in both the hippocampus (HPC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs14">Fig. S14A</xref>, first and second panel) and prefrontal cortex (PFC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs14">Fig. S14A</xref>, third and fourth panel), as well as diffusion into both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. This was indicated by colocalization with the neuronal marker NeuN and the glial marker GFAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs14">Fig. S14A</xref>, bottom panel). Higher-magnification (40x) analysis revealed extensive overlap between the ASO signal and NeuN staining, demonstrating that the vast majority (&gt;97%) of neurons exhibited ASO uptake. qRT-PCR analysis of <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic>mice treated by intraventricular injection at 8 weeks of age showed that Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup> effectively lowered <italic>Emc10</italic> mRNA to nearly WT levels 3 weeks post-injection resulting in normalization of <italic>Emc10</italic> expression in the HPC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), PFC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>) and somatosensory cortex (SSC) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).

<p>In addition to SM deficits, mouse models of the 22q11.2 deletion show a spectrum of cognitive impairments in episodic and spatial memory as reflected, for example, in impaired performance in an Y-maze-based delayed alternations task that probes short-term spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>) and contextual fear conditioning a form of associative learning test used for studying episodic learning and spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). We investigated the impact of ASO-mediated Emc10 reduction in the adult brain on both of these cognitive tasks. First, we confirmed that adult male <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice exhibit impaired short-term spatial memory during novelty exploration in a two-trial delayed alternation Y-maze task (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>) as previously described for another mouse model of the 22q11.2 deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). The total number of arm entries remained unchanged, indicating no alternations in locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs14">Fig. S14B</xref>). To determine whether reducing Emc10 expression in the brain via ASO treatment could rescue short-term spatial memory deficits, we tested a new cohort of <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic>mice and WT littermates 3-weeks following ASO administration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). ASO-treated <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice exhibited a significant improvement in delayed alternations compared to <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice treated with control ASO (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). Furthermore, no significant differences in total number of arm entries were observed between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs14">Fig. S14C</xref>). We confirmed the reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels in the ASO-treated animals through qRT-PCR assays of the HPC, PFC and SSC brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs14">Fig. S14D-F</xref>). In the contextual fear conditioning task, while ASO treatment was not sufficient to fully rescue the learning deficit in <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice to WT levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>, right panel), there was a modest improvement in fear memory of ASO-treated <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice, since these mice did not differ significantly from the ASO-treated WT littermates. Interestingly, we have previously shown that genetic reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels in <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice resulted in only partial restoration of deficits in contextual fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Thus our finding faithfully recapitulates results from our previous constitutive genetic rescue assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) and likely indicates a more limited role of <italic>Emc10</italic> upregulation in the 22q11.2-linked fear memory deficits rather than requirement for additional treatment time or for earlier onset of <italic>Emc10</italic> normalization.</p>
<p>The application of ASOs as a novel therapeutic strategy has seen a significant rise in recent years, in part due to their versatility in durably modifying RNA transcripts. Therefore, we investigated the longevity of ASO-mediated repression of <italic>Emc10</italic> as an indicator of future therapeutic relevance for the treatment of 22q11.2DS. To this end, we conducted the SM and Y-maze assays on a new cohort of <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice at 3-4 weeks and 8-9 weeks post injection with Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). We observed behavioral rescue in Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup>-treated <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice in the SM assay at three weeks (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, left panel) and in the Y-maze assay at four weeks post ASO-administration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, left panel) in accordance to our previous findings (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F, H</xref>). Remarkably, we replicated these results at 8-9 weeks post injection, demonstrating sustained behavioral rescue of SM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, right panel) and spatial memory deficits (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, right panel). Importantly, locomotor activity remained unchanged in the Y-maze assays at both, four weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs14">Fig. S14G</xref>) and nine weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs14">Fig. S14H</xref>) post injection. Finally, we confirmed the downregulation of <italic>Emc10</italic> in ASO-treated animals via qRT-PCR assays of the HPC, PFC, and SSC brain regions at ten weeks post-treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D-F</xref>). These results suggest that normalizing <italic>Emc10</italic> expression in the brain can ameliorate social and spatial memory deficits in adult <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic> mice in a time period of at least two months.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of 22q11.2DS, especially ones related to abnormal expression and processing of miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), we still do not have a promising therapeutic avenue for the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with the 22q11.2 deletion. By leveraging our recent understanding of the molecular, cellular and behavioral consequences of 22q11.2-linked miRNA dysregulation, the present study represents an advancement towards developing a potential therapeutic strategy in two ways:</p>
<p><italic>First</italic>, we show that 22q11.2 deletion results in abnormal processing of miRNAs in human neurons and in turn drives upregulation of <italic>EMC10</italic> levels as previously described in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Effective reduction to near WT levels or even complete depletion of <italic>EMC10</italic> leads to restoration of key alterations in morphological and functional neuronal maturation emerging due to 22q11.2 deletions. The miRNA regulatory mechanism underlying <italic>EMC10</italic> upregulation and the restoration of cellular deficits are very similar to the ones we previously described in <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, highlighting the robustness of this molecular alteration as well as the translational value of using animal models to probe the link between <italic>Emc10</italic> upregulation and 22q11.2-linked behavioral dysfunction.</p>
<p><italic>Second</italic>, we show that normalization of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels in adult <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mouse brain, by ASO-mediated targeted knockdown, is effective in rescuing SM deficits (which emerge during postnatal development and are present as early as postnatal day 22) as well as short-term spatial memory deficits. Significantly, these improvements in cognition were sustained for over two months post-ASO administration. These findings strongly suggest that at least for a subset of 22q11.2-associated cognitive deficits it is the sustained miRNA dysregulation and elevation of <italic>Emc10</italic> throughout the adult life that interferes with the underlying neural processes rather than an irreversible impact on brain maturation during early development and demonstrate the therapeutic potential for treating a wide range of cognitive symptoms associated with 22q11.2DS.</p>
<p>In vivo delivery of ASOs offers a potential venue for emerging treatments of genetically driven and postnatally reversible symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) focusing in reduction of culprit gene expression via sequence-specific knockdown of mRNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). A common challenge in efforts to employ gene-knockdown therapies for dosage-sensitive genes such as <italic>EMC10</italic> is restricting target gene expression within optimal levels to avoid potential toxicity due to target hyper-knockdown or complete elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). A large number of relatively rare LoF variants or potentially damaging missense variants have been identified in the human <italic>EMC10</italic> gene among likely healthy individuals in gnomAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>) which is depleted of individuals known to be affected by severe NDDs. Taken together with our previous analysis of constitutive heterozygous Emc10 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) that showed no evidence of motor deficits or anxiety-like behavior, these observations strongly suggest that partial reductions in Emc10 levels of approximately 50% are well tolerated at the organismal level and do not result in behavioral abnormalities. The highest dose for both Emc10-specific ASOs used in mutant <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic>mice was limited to ∼300 µg and reduced <italic>Emc10</italic> mRNA to either normal or below normal (30-50% of WT) expression while attaining full behavioral rescue. While higher dose may be required to ameliorate other behavioral deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>), it should be noted that an acute injection of 700µg Emc10<sup>ASO</sup> in WT mice that resulted in ∼50% reduction of Emc10 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs13">Fig. S13</xref>) did not cause secondary cellular and behavioral toxicity. Thus, available evidence indicates that therapeutically effective ASO-mediated normalization of <italic>EMC10</italic> levels can be up- or down-titrated within a well-tolerated range. However, further work is needed to establish a comprehensive safety profile, including the evaluation of non-cognitive phenotypes, to fully validate the therapeutic potential of Emc10-targeting approaches. Additionally, the long-term effects of Emc10 reduction beyond two months post-injection require further investigation to determine the full extent of its therapeutic benefits. Future studies will also explore whether ASO-mediated normalization of adult Emc10 levels can restore additional 22q11.2 behavioral and cognitive alterations and whether earlier postnatal ASO treatment could prevent the onset of behavioral deficits or mitigate those resistant to adult interventions.</p>
<p>In addition to reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> expression our findings have implications for therapeutic interventions aiming to manipulate its downstream targets. In that respect, it is attractive to speculate that different <italic>EMC10</italic> upregulation-linked phenotypes and their developmental requirements may be driven by dysregulation of distinct, individually or in combinations, downstream EMC targets. Such targets are typically multi-transmembrane domain (TMD) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>) that contain low-hydrophobicity TMDs which are hard to insert into ER membrane and thus require the aid of EMC as a membrane insertase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Identification of neurotransmitter receptors, channels, and transporters whose biogenesis, trafficking and membrane insertion are affected by EMC10 upregulation could help establish a link between such targets and 22q11.2-related behavioral dysfunction and guide efforts to develop treatments for specific 22q11.2 deletion symptoms.</p>
<p>Overall, by highlighting the manipulation of EMC10 expression and activity, as well as its downstream targets, as a promising alternative or augmentation to currently available treatments, and emphasizing a broad temporal window for therapeutic and preventive intervention in 22q11.2 deletion-associated cognitive and behavioral symptoms, our results lay the foundation for developing mechanism-based therapeutic strategies. These strategies aim to leverage insights from both human and animal models to improve clinical outcomes in precision medicine for neuropsychiatric disorders. Furthermore, our findings may have broader implications for understanding the role of miRNA dysregulation and ER-mediated membrane protein translocation in other neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders with overlapping genetic or phenotypic features.</p>

This approach enables postnatal manipulation of <italic>Emc10</italic> expression at its endogenous locus keeping Emc10 expression within its physiological levels. <italic>Emc10<sup>tm1a+/</sup></italic> mice (2310044h10rik-Tm1a, MRC Harwell Institute, Oxfordshire, UK) were crossed to a germline Flp mouse line (B6.129S4-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(FLP1)Dym/RainJ_JAX:009086) that activates global <italic>Flp</italic> function and leads to the deletion of the frt-flanked sequence(s) in the offspring. The <italic>Emc10<sup>tm1c</sup></italic> offspring from these cross carries a <italic>loxP</italic> flanked WT <italic>Emc10</italic> allele. We used UBC-Cre/ERT2 mice (B6.Cg-Ndor1 Tg(UBC-cre/ERT2)1Ejb /2J_JAX:008085) in crosses to generate compound <italic>Emc10<sup>tm1c+/-</sup></italic>; UBC-cre/ERT2; <italic>Df</italic>(<italic>16</italic>)<italic>A<sup>+/–</sup></italic>mice.</p>

<title>Q6 and Q5 lines</title>
<p>The Q6 line donor is a 20-year-old female patient with a history of developmental delay and an overall Full-Scale IQ in the low 80s. She was clinically diagnosed with 22q11.2DS by FISH testing. Her psychotic symptoms, including disorganized behavior and command auditory hallucinations, started when she was 17 years old. During the first break episode, due to the severity of her psychotic symptoms, the patient was hospitalized and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The patient also developed depressive symptoms, including frequent suicidal ideation. One year after her schizophrenia diagnosis, in addition to her severe psychotic symptoms, the patient was also diagnosed to be in a catatonic state. The patient has remained severely psychotic since the onset of these symptoms at age 17 and has been on multiple antipsychotics without experiencing any clinically meaningful benefit. Regarding her treatment history includes various first-line antipsychotics (including olanzapine, stelazine, aripiprazole, haloperidol, risperidone and clozapine); several antidepressants (sertraline and fluoxetine); a mood stabilizer (lithium) and benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam). None of these medications reportedly led to any clinically significant improvement in either the psychotic or the depressive symptoms. The patient has also undergone 2 rounds of electroconvulsive treatment (ECT), but with only short-lived improvement. The Q5 line donor is the probands dizygotic twin sister who does not carry a 22q11.2 deletion and her psychiatric evaluation ruled out any history of psychiatric symptoms (Supplementary Table S1). Sibling are of Caucasian Western European descent.</p>

The Q1 line donor is a 32-year-old male patient with a history of developmental and speech delay. He was clinically diagnosed with 22q11.2DS by FISH testing at age 4. His psychotic symptoms, started when he was 12 years old. The patient was hospitalized once at age 10 before he was formally diagnosed with schizophrenia. During that time, he also experienced one seizure. The patient also developed mood lability and has OCD-like symptoms although does not meet full criteria for DSM-IV/V OCD. Regarding his treatment history, it includes various first-line antipsychotics as well as metyrosine (started when he was 15). The Q2 line donor is the proband’s brother, who does not carry a 22q11.2 deletion and his psychiatric evaluation ruled out any history of psychiatric symptoms (Supplementary Table S1).

Cells were fed on any other day and passaged weekly using RelesR (catalog#05872, Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) dissociation reagent in accordance to their manual. Disassociated cells were pre-plated as reported earlier(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) at a density of 200,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 (catalog# 1254, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, United Kingdom) on Matrigel-coated plates and differentiation started when confluent. Differentiation of hiPSC was performed as indicated below: <italic>(i)</italic> hiPSC differentiation into cortical neurons, via a combination of small molecule inhibitors, was performed as described with few modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). This protocol has been shown to robustly generate cortical neurons while actively suppressing glial differentiation, as evidenced by the lack of upregulation of glial markers such as GFAP, AQP4, or OLIG2. In brief, inhibitors used in LSB+X/P/S/D induction included LDN193189 (250 nM; catalog#04-0074, Stemgent, REPROCELL USA Inc., Beltsville, MD, USA), SB431542 (10 μM; catalog#1614, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, United Kingdom), XAV939 (5 μM; catalog#3748, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, United Kingdom), PD0325901 (1 μM; catalog#4192, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, United Kingdom), SU5402 (5 μM; catalog#1645-05, BioVision Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA), DAPT (10 μM; catalog#2634, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, United Kingdom). Until day 4 of differentiation, TeSR E6 medium (catalog#05946, Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) was added in 1/3 increments every other day. Then, neurobasal (NB) plus medium supplemented with N2 (catalog#17502-048, Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and B27 plus supplement (catalog#A35828-01, Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) was added in 1/3 increments every other day from day 4, until reaching 100% neurobasal plus/B27 plus L-glutamine (catalog#35050-061, Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing medium supplemented with BDNF (20 ng/ml; catalog#248-BDB, R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), cAMP (0.5 mM; catalog#A92902, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and ascorbic acid (0.2 mM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) (BCA) at day 8 as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>).

On day 1, the culture medium was completely replaced with fresh basic media and a 48-hour puromycin selection (1 mg/l, catalog#P8833-10MG, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) period was started. On day 3, for calcium imaging and morphology analysis, ca. 25% mouse glia cells (prepared as previously reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>)) were added to the basic media plus Ara-C (2µM, catalog#C1768-100M, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 10% mouse astrocyte conditioned media (catalog#M1811-57, ScienCell, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to promote neuronal health and maturation. On day 5, total medium was changed with basic media plus Ara-C and 10% mouse astrocyte conditioned media. On day 7, total media was removed and replaced with BrainPhys Neuronal media with SM1 supplement (catalog#05792, STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) containing always human BDNF (10 ng/ml), human NT-3 (10 ng/ml), mouse laminin (0.1 µg/ml), N2 supplement, doxycycline (1 mg/ml) and 10% mouse astrocyte conditioned media. From day 9 on, half of the media were removed and replaced with supplemented BrainPhys media every other day. 2.5% FBS (catalog#16141079, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was added to the culture medium on day 11 to those cells which were co-cultured with astrocytes to support astrocyte viability. iN cells were assayed for experiments as indicated.</p>

<title>In vivo screening of ASOs</title>
<p>Candidate <italic>Emc10</italic>-targeting ASOs (700ug) were stereotactically injected into the right lateral ventricle of C57Bl/6 mice (0.3 mm anterior, 1.0 mm dextrolateral, 3.0 mm ventral from bregma). Reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> mRNA in the retrosplenial cortex and thoracic spinal cord was evaluate by qRT-PCR at 2 weeks following a single bolus dose. Three ASOs were selected from the screen based on their pharmacological efficacy: 1466167, 1466171 and 1466182. Animals were injected with these ASOs in the right lateral ventricle as described above (n= 4) and euthanized 8 weeks post injection. Animals were evaluated with an observational functional battery test at 3 hours after dosing and then every two weeks until euthanasia. The retrosplenial cortex and thoracic spinal cord were harvested for qRT-PCR analysis of <italic>Emc10</italic>, <italic>Aif1</italic> (microglia marker), <italic>Cd68</italic> (phagocytic microglia marker) and <italic>Gfap</italic> (reactive astrocyte marker) mRNA.

Tissues were stained for H&amp;E and IBA1 (microglia marker), CD68 (phagocytic microglia marker) GFAP (reactive astrocyte marker) and Calbindin (Purkinje Cell marker). Bolus injections of all three candidate ASOs resulted in similar reductions of the <italic>Emc10</italic> mRNA at both 2 and 8 weeks. Of the three candidate ASOs, ASO1466182 (GCCATATCTTTATTAATTAC, referred to in the manuscript as Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup>) showed no signs of in life toxicity and the tolerability marker gene expression was similar between ASO- and vehicle-treated animals in the tissues evaluated.

Mice were initially put in the isoflurane chamber using 3% isoflurane mixture for 5 minutes, which was lowered to 2-2.5% when fixed to the stereotactic station. We used KOPF Small Animal Stereotaxic Instruments (Model 940). Carprofen (5 mg/kg, Zoetis Inc., Kalamazoo, MI, USA), and Bupivacaine (2 mg/kg, Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, Il, USA) were delivered subcutaneously before the incision was made. Additionally, Dexamethasone (2 mg/kg, Bimeda-MTC Animal Healt Inc., Cambridge, ON, Canada) was delivered intramuscularly. The surgical site was shaved and sterilized with betadine and 70% ethanol three times. A small midline incision was made and a hole was drilled in the skull. Stereotactic bregma coordinates used for the right ventricle were - 0.5 mm posterior, −1.1 lateral, and −2.8 mm dorsoventral. Mice were injected with 4 ul of either the Ctrl<sup>ASO1/ASO2</sup> or <italic>Emc10<sup>ASO1/ASO2</sup></italic> (Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup>: 292 ug, Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup>: 280 ug) at a rate of 0.5ul/minute.

<p>For bulk RNAseq, Poly(A) RNA sequencing library was prepared following Illumina’s TruSeq-stranded-mRNA (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) sample preparation protocol. RNA integrity was checked with Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, CA, USA). Poly(A) tail-containing mRNAs were purified using oligo-(dT) magnetic beads with two rounds of purification. After purification, poly(A) RNA was fragmented using divalent cation buffer in elevated temperature. Quality control analysis and quantification of the sequencing library were performed using Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Chip (Agilent, CA, USA). Paired-ended sequencing was performed on Illumina’s NovaSeq 6000 (LC Sciences, Houston, TX, USA) sequencing system. For miRNAseq, total RNA quality and quantity was analyzed with Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, CA, USA), with RIN number &gt;7.0. Approximately 1 ug of total RNA was then used to prepare small RNA library according to the protocol of TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep Kits (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Then, a single-end sequencing 50bp on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 following the vendor’s recommended protocol was conducted.</p>

<title>Bioinformatics analysis of human neuron miRNA-seq at DIV8</title>
<p>Raw reads were subjected to an in-house program, ACGT101-miR (LC Sciences, Houston, TX, USA) to remove adapter dimers, junk, low complexity, common RNA families (rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA) and repeats. Subsequently, unique sequences with length in 18∼26 nucleotide were mapped to specific species precursors in miRBase (v22.0) by BLAST search to identify known miRNAs and novel 3p- and 5p-derived miRNAs. Length variation at both 3’ and 5’ ends and one mismatch inside of the sequence were allowed in the alignment. The unique sequences mapping to specific species mature miRNAs in hairpin arms were identified as known miRNAs. The unique sequences mapping to the other arm of known specific species precursor hairpin opposite to the annotated mature miRNA-containing arm were considered to be novel 5p- or 3p derived miRNA candidates. The remaining sequences were mapped to other selected species precursors (with the exclusion of specific species) in miRBase 22.0 by BLAST search, and the mapped pre-miRNAs were further BLASTed against the specific species genomes to determine their genomic locations. The above two mentioned mapped 5p and 3p sequences were defined as known miRNAs. The unmapped sequences were BLASTed against the specific genomes, and the hairpin RNA structures containing sequences were predicted from the flank 80 nt sequences using RNAfold (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi">http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi</ext-link>) software. The criteria for secondary structure prediction were: (1.) number of nucleotides in one bulge in stem (≤12) (2.) number of base pairs in the stem region of the predicted hairpin (≥16) (3.) cutoff of free energy (kCal/mol ≤-15) (4.) length of hairpin (up and down stems + terminal loop ≥50) (5.) length of hairpin loop (≤20). (6.) number of nucleotides in one bulge in mature region (≤8) (7.) number of biased errors in one bulge in mature region (≤4) (8.) number of biased bulges in mature region (≤2) (9.) number of errors in mature region (≤7) (10.) number of base pairs in the mature region of the predicted hairpin (≥12) (11.) percent of mature in stem (≥80).

<p>We used poly-A pull-down to enrich mRNAs from total RNA samples, then proceed with library construction using Illumina TruSeq chemistry (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Libraries were then sequenced using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 at Columbia Genome Center. We multiplexed samples in each lane, which yields targeted number of paired-end 100bp reads for each sample. We used RTA (Illumina) for base calling and bcl2fastq2 (version 2.19) for converting BCL to fastq format, coupled with adaptor trimming. We performed a pseudoalignment to a kallisto index created from transcriptomes (Ensembl v96, Human:GRCh38.p12) using kallisto (0.44.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>).

<p>The open field activity assay was performed as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). In brief, mouse activity was monitored in a clear illuminated acrylic chamber (25 cm x 25 cm) equipped with infrared sensors to automatically record horizontal and vertical activity (Coulbourn Instruments, Whitehall, PA, USA). Each mouse was initially placed in the center of the chamber and its activity was recorded and collected in 1-min bins for 1 h using TruScan (v1.012-00) software (Coulbourn Instruments, Whitehall, PA, USA). The floors and walls of the open field were cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials.</p>

<title>Social Memory assay</title>
<p>Assays were performed as described earlier in juvenile (postnatal day 22-24) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) and adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) mice. All experimental mice were single housed, transferred to the testing room one hour prior to testing and returned to their home cages after the completion of the experiment. Both male and female were tested in the juvenile SM assays, in the TAM/corn oil treatment assays as well as in the ASO1 assays. Only males were tested in the ASO2 assays. For the adult SM assays, stimulus mice (C57 BL/6J) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). All stimulus mice were between the ages of 3-4 weeks. Test and stimulus mice were sex matched in the experimental trials. All trials were recorded using a video camera (Webcam Pro 9000, Logitech, Lausanne, Switzerland) and recorder software (Logitech video recording software). Stimulus mice were color marked on the tails to distinguish the stimulus mice from the test mice, during video analysis. The videos were manually scored for total interaction time over the course of the trials for interactions initiated by the test animal including anal sniffing, nose-to-nose touch and close following. For the novel/familiar paradigm, test and stimulus (novel) mice were placed together in a neutral cage and the interaction was recorded (trial 1). One hour after trial 1, the same stimulus (familiar) mouse was placed together with the test mouse and the interaction was recorded again (trial 2). A similar procedure was followed for the control novel/novel paradigm, except that we used different stimulus mice for trial 1 and trial 2 such that at trial 2 the stimulus mice were also novel for the experimental mice. Trials with experimental mice showing highly aggressive behavior towards the stimulus mice or mice that interacted for less than 24s in trial 1 were excluded from the analysis.</p>

<p>Contextual Fear Conditioning assays were performed as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) using a Coulbourn animal shocker (Model H13-15 110V, Coulbourn Instruments, Whitehall, PA, USA). Sound levels were checked with a Digital Sound Level Meter (Model: 407730, Extech Instruments, MA, USA) before beginning the trials. Using a cotton swab, pure lemon extract (McCormick &amp; Co, Hunt Valley, MD, USA) was introduced into the testing chamber adding 9 different but equal distributed spots on a napkin. Test mice were placed in the test chamber and received 2 pairs of a tone (30s, 82db) and a co-terminating shock (2s, 0.7mA). Mice were then carefully picked with forceps and returned to their home cage. After 24 hours, mice were placed in the FC box again with same environment and lemon scent for 6 minutes in the absence of tone and shock to test for contextual memory. The box and grid were cleaned with 70% EtOH before and between every test run on both days.

<p>The Y-maze apparatus was made from white acrylic that consists of three equal-sized arms (38 cm long, 13 cm high, and 8 cm wide) of which each arm of the Y-maze was positioned at an equal angle and was purchased from SD Instruments (cat#7001-0419, San Diego, CA, USA). The Y-maze assay was performed as described previously in more detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>). In brief, adult male mice were tested on delayed alternations. Exploration in all three arms of the Y-maze was performed after a 1 h delay from an initial training phase of 10 min, where one arm of the maze was blocked (delayed alternation). Delayed alternation (%) was calculated as the number of entries in all three arms divided by the total number of entries in the first 5 min of the 10 min test phase whereas the number of entries per arm was used as a measurement of activity and locomotion. The movement of mice was recorded with a camera mounted above the apparatus and the number of arm entries was counted manually.</p>

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> study that establishes how anti-sense oligonucleotides degrading a specific target protein called EMC10 can rescue neuronal function in models of chromosome 22.11.2 deletions. The authors use human iPSC-derived neurons and a mouse model to provide <bold>compelling</bold> data for the rescue of cellular and cognitive features of 22.11.2 phenotypes upon ASO regulation of EMC10. These pre-clinical data are of interest because they support reduction of ECM10 as a promising therapeutic strategy.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an important and very well-presented set of experiments following up on prior work from the lab investigating knock-down (KD) of EMC10 in restoration of neuronal and cognitive deficits in 22q11.2 Del models, including now both human iPSCs and a mouse model in vivo now with ASOs.</p>
<p>The valuable progress in this current manuscript is the development of ASOs, and the proof of efficacy in vivo in mouse of the ASO in knock-down of EMC10 and amelioration of in vivo behavioral phenotypes.</p>
<p>The experiments include: iPSC studies demonstrating elevations of EMC10 in a solid collection of paired iPSC lines. These studies also provide evidence of manipulation of EMC10 by overexpression and inhibition of miRNAs that exist in the 22q11 interval. The iPSC studies also nicely demonstrate rescue of impairments with KD of EMC10 in neuronal arborization as well as KCl induced neuronal activity. The major in vivo contributions reflect impressive demonstration of efficacy of two ASOs in vivo on both KD of EMC10 in vivo and through improvement in behavioral abnormalities in the 22q11 mouse in a range of different behaviors, including social behavior and learning behaviors.</p>
<p>Overall, there are many strengths reflected in this study, including in particular the synergy between in vitro studies in human cell models and in vivo studies in the well characterized mouse model. The experiments are generally rigorously performed and well powered, and nicely presented. The claims with regard to the mechanisms of EMC10 elevations and the importance of restoration of EMC10 expression to neuronal morphology and behavior are well supported by the data. The work may be further supported in future studies, by investigation of rescue by ASOs of circuit dysfunction in vivo or ex vivo through electrophysiology in the mouse model. Also, in future studies, investigation of the mechanism by which EMC10, an ER protein involved in protein processing, may function in the observed neuronal abnormalities; however, these studies are clearly for future investigations.</p>
<p>The potential impact of the work is found in the potential value of the ASO approach to the treatment of 22q11, or the pre-clinical evidence that knock-down of this protein may lead to some amelioration of cognitive symptoms. Overall, a very convincing and complementary set of experiments to support EMC10 KD as a therapeutic strategy.</p>
<p>Review of revision: The authors have addressed the questions from the prior review.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We appreciate that both reviewers found our findings significant and recognized the strength of the presented data in demonstrating the potential value of ASO-mediated Emc10 expression modulation for treating 22q11.2DS. We are grateful for the reviewers' valuable input and constructive suggestions, which we believe have significantly strengthened our manuscript. Below, we address the main points and concerns, followed by our point-by-point responses:</p>
<p><bold>Evaluation</bold> <bold>of</bold> <bold>ASO-Mediated</bold> <bold>Emc10</bold> <bold>Reduction</bold>: We appreciate the feedback and the opportunity to clarify this point. While we agree that ASO-mediated reduction of Emc10 should ideally be evaluated at both the mRNA and protein levels, we would like to emphasize that this was indeed performed in our study. Specifically, we conducted both qRT-PCR and Western Blot (WB) assays on the same animal cohort, focusing on the left and right hippocampus (rather than the PFC) following ASO injection (see Figure S11C and D). We prioritized the hippocampus for the WB assay because our primary behavioral assays and observed phenotypes in this study are strongly hippocampus-centric. This approach reflects our aim to investigate Emc10's role in the brain regions most relevant to the observed phenotypes. We hope this clarification addresses the reviewer’s concerns. While protein-level analysis would ideally complement RNA measurements, the Emc10 antibodies available were suboptimal in specificity and sensitivity, requiring substantial optimization. Additionally, challenges in obtaining sufficient high-quality protein from small regions like the hippocampus limited the use of protein detection as a standalone method. We plan to refine antibody protocols or explore alternative methods in future work. Notably, in all instances where we performed parallel protein and RNA measurements in both, mouse brain tissue and human cell lines, there was excellent concordance between the datasets, strongly suggesting that mRNA levels are a reliable indicator of Emc10 protein levels in our model.</p>
<p><bold>ASO</bold> <bold>Neuronal</bold> <bold>Uptake:</bold> While ASO uptake by neurons in the brain can vary considerably depending on factors such as ASO chemistry, delivery method, target brain region, and cell type, our targeted delivery approach, ASO design optimization, and ASO screening strategy were specifically tailored to achieve uniform and efficient uptake across hippocampal and cortical regions, in both neurons and glia. The figures included in our manuscript at both low and high magnification (see Figure S14A) clearly display the extensive (over 97%) overlap of ASO-positive cells (green signal) with cells expressing the neuronal marker NeuN (red signal). While quantifying ASO-positive cells in different brain regions could add value, the robust diffusion of ASO into neurons and glia is effectively demonstrated in the current figures and indirectly supported by the robust downregulation of Emc10 in ASO-treated animals as shown by qRT-PCR assays of hippocampal and cortical brain regions.</p>
<p><bold>Transcriptomic</bold> <bold>Data</bold> <bold>in</bold> <bold>Mutant</bold> <bold>EMC10</bold> <bold>NGN2-iNs:</bold> Reduction in EMC10 levels is not expected to directly affect transcription or to broadly reorganize the differential gene expression profile of the Q6/Q5 patient/control NGN2-iN lines. Accordingly, our transcriptional profiling was not designed to assess the direct impact of EMC10 deficiency on gene expression but rather to serve as an indirect measure of cellular pathways affected by the reduction in EMC10 levels in the patient Q6 line. We aimed to identify genes and related functional pathways differentially expressed between the Q6/Q5 patient/control lines, where these expression differences are either abolished or significantly attenuated in Q6/EMC10<sup>HET</sup> or Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup> NGN2-iNs.</p>
<p><bold>Statistical</bold> <bold>Analysis</bold>: We have meticulously reviewed all statistical analyses in the manuscript to ensure their appropriateness and adherence to established practices. For Figure S2, we acknowledge that the statistical details were not fully specified in the figure legend, though they are provided for each miRNA in Supplemental Table S2. In the revised manuscript, we ensured that the statistical methods and corresponding values are clearly indicated for each comparison.</p>
<p>We are confident that the revisions outlined above, along with the point-by-point responses provided below, will significantly strengthen our manuscript and address all the concerns raised by the reviewers. We would like to express our sincere thanks to the reviewers for their valuable feedback and constructive suggestions.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer</bold> <bold>#1</bold> <bold>(Recommendations</bold> <bold>For</bold> <bold>The</bold> <bold>Authors):</bold></p>
<p>My comments here are generally limited to minor comments that reflect possible small additions or edits to the manuscript:</p>
<p>(1) Panel 1A is very small. Please consider making that bigger as space permits.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have increased the panel size of Figure 1A in the revised manuscript to improve its visibility and clarity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Are you able to identify the dot that represents EMC10 in panel 1C? I understand that EMC10 is represented in Supplementary Figure 4A.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's observation. In Figure 1C, the volcano plot depicts differentially expressed miRNAs in the Q5/Q6 neuronal samples, as identified through miRNA-sequencing. Since EMC10, as a protein-coding gene and a downstream target of miRNA dysregulation, is not included in this analysis. However, as the reviewer correctly notes, EMC10 gene expression is represented in the volcano plot in Supplementary Figure 4A, which displays differentially expressed genes identified through bulk RNA-seq analysis of the same neuronal samples. To avoid any confusion, we have clarified the title of Figure 1C to emphasize that it represents miRNA expression changes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) With regard to studies using iPSC. Some of the studies are executed across multiple distinct pairs and some are only done in a single pair. Overall, while results are coherent and often complimentary, would it be valuable for the authors to comment on experiments where studies in multiple pairs seemed particularly important, or others wherein it was less important?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful question regarding our use of multiple versus single hiPSC pairs. Our investigation began with the Q5/Q6 sibling (dizygotic twin) pair, which shares the most similar genetic background. This minimized the impact of confounding genetic factors and provided a robust foundation for testing our hypothesis that EMC10 upregulation, driven by miRNA dysregulation, is a key consequence of the 22q11.2 deletion in human neurons, thus validating our previous findings from the <italic>Df(16)A</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mouse model (Stark et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2013). To ensure the generalizability of our findings, we incorporated additional hiPSC lines from another sibling pair as well as a case/control pair, demonstrating that EMC10 upregulation is a consistent feature of 22q11.2DS. Subsequently, we focused on the well-matched Q5/Q6 pair for detailed morphological, functional, and genetic rescue experiments. This approach allowed us to perform in-depth studies while controlling for potential genetic confounders. By using both multiple and single hiPSC pairs, we balanced the need for generalizable findings with the practical considerations of conducting technically complex and resource-intensive experiments. This strategy enabled us to provide both broad and detailed insights into the mechanisms underlying 22q11.2DS. We have modified the introductory paragraph of the Results section to better highlight this issue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) While the majority of the experiments seem sufficiently powered to test the hypothesis in question in the iPSC studies, Figure 2B raises the question if the study replicates here were underpowered, and perhaps the authors might consider mentioning this, although this is a very minor comment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We acknowledge that the statistical power to detect a significant difference in pre-miR-485 levels in Figure 2B may be limited due to the relatively small sample size and the inherent variability in hiPSC-derived neuronal cultures. However, it is important to emphasize that the functional impact of miRNAs is primarily mediated by their mature transcript forms. Our miRNA-seq data (Supplementary Table 2 and Figure S2) did not show significant alterations in the levels of mature miR-485-5p or miR-485-3p. This finding aligns with the reported expression pattern of miR-485 in hiPSC-derived neurons, where relatively low levels are observed in early neuronal development, with increased expression occurring in older, more mature neurons (Soutschek et al. 2023; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ethz-ins.org/igNeuronsTimeCourse/">https://ethz-ins.org/igNeuronsTimeCourse/</ext-link> database from the Institute of Neurogenomics, ETH Zurich). This database provides a valuable resource for examining gene expression dynamics during human neuronal differentiation. Given that our hiPSC-derived neurons were analyzed at a relatively early developmental stage (DIV8 for these experiments), it is likely that miR-485 expression had not yet reached levels sufficient to reveal significant differences. While we acknowledge the potential limitation in statistical power for detecting subtle changes in pre-miR-485 levels, the combined evidence suggests that miR-485 may not be a significant contributor to the observed phenotypes at this developmental stage.</p>
<p>A paragraph has been added in the corresponding Results section to address this issue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) There are a few situations where the authors could help out the reader a little bit by providing more labels on the figures directly. For example: in Figure 2, there are expression levels, over-expression, and inhibition of miRNA but the X-axis is named with similar labels for the miRNAs in question for each of these distinct experiments. If the authors want to help the reader, they may consider labeling these panels with a descriptive title to reflect the experiment being done or use more descriptive terms in the X-axis panels. Again, this is minor. Similarly, in Figure 5, it might be helpful for the authors to help out the reader again with more labels on the panels, such as in Figures 5B, 5C, and 5D. Would they consider labeling these panels, HPC, PFC, SSC with the brain location as they did in Figure 4?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these helpful suggestions to improve the clarity of our figures. We have implemented the proposed changes. In Figure 2C-E, we have added specific titles to the panels to clearly distinguish between the different experimental conditions such as miRNA overexpression and inhibition. Similarly, in Figure 5, we labeled panels 5B, 5C, and 5D with the brain regions analyzed (HPC, PFC, SSC) to match the labeling used in Figure 4. We believe these revisions enhance the readability and overall interpretability of the figures, making it easier for readers to follow the experiments and results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Figure 3: There is some overshoot of the data in EMC10 homozygous null, in panel 3E, and also, overshoot of the het in panel 3H. Would there be value in the authors commenting on the potential basis for this in the discussion? Some issues are minor, such as the lack of electrophysiological analysis of circuits in vivo or in ex vivo slices that may further support the proposed rescue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer correctly highlights the observation in Figures 3E and 3H, where the number of branch points in the Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup> line exceeds wildtype levels and the calcium response in the Q6/EMC10<sup>HET</sup> and Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup> lines surpasses that of the control. This overshoot is indeed intriguing and warrants discussion. EMC10 is part of the ER Membrane Complex (EMC), which plays a critical role in the proper folding and localization of various membrane proteins, including neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels such as voltage-gated calcium channels (Chitwood et al., 2018; Shurtleff et al., 2018; Chitwood and Hegde, 2019). In the context of the 22q11.2 deletion, EMC10 dysregulation may disrupt the proper localization of these proteins at the synapse, affecting both dendritic morphology and calcium signaling. The precise basis of this overshoot remains unclear. The overshoot may result from a dosage-sensitive inhibitory effect of Emc10, where both reduced and increased expression alter normal neuronal processes, with excessive responses potentially triggered upon gene restoration by the mutant system’s adaptation to dysfunction, leading to altered receptor sensitivity or signaling dynamics. This underscores the critical importance of precise Emc10 expression for proper neuronal development and function, in line with previous findings suggesting that EMC10 plays an auxiliary or modulatory role in EMC function. A short comment on the potential basis for this overshoot has been added in the corresponding Results section of the manuscript. Regardless of the underlying mechanisms, these findings emphasize the importance of precise titration of ASO constructs, rigorous gene dosage controls, and thorough analysis of context-specific responses to ensure both efficacy and safety in clinical applications.</p>
<p>We also agree with the reviewer that electrophysiological studies, particularly in the 22q11.2 deletion mouse model, would provide valuable insights into the impact of EMC10 modulation by ASOs on neuronal activity and circuit function at the in vivo and ex vivo levels. Incorporating such experiments into future studies will allow us to assess synaptic transmission and plasticity, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the therapeutic potential of ASO-mediated EMC10 modulation in 22q11.2DS.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Did the authors take out the behavior studies further than 9 weeks? Would the authors consider commenting on what they speculate might be the duration of the treatment effect? For both mice and definitely humans.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising the important question regarding the duration of the ASO treatment effect, which is crucial for translating our findings into clinically relevant therapies. While behavioral studies beyond 9 weeks were not conducted in this study, our in vivo experiments and findings from prior publications (detailed below) enable an informed speculative assessment.</p>
<p>We utilized 2'-O-methoxyethyl (2'-MOE) modified ASOs, known for their enhanced binding affinity, nuclease resistance, and increased metabolic stability. In our in vivo post-injection screening of ASOs (Figure S13C), we predicted that Emc10 expression levels return to normal WT levels (~T100%) approximately 26 weeks post-treatment in Emc10<sup>ASO</sup> (#1466182) treated mice. This prediction is supported by our Emc10 expression profiles across various brain regions, which demonstrate robust repression of Emc10 lasting up to 10 weeks post-administration (Figure 6D-F). While these findings suggest that the treatment effect in our model could extend significantly beyond 10 weeks following a single ASO injection, further empirical validation is required through extended follow-up studies. Encouragingly, long-term effects of 2'-MOE ASOs have been observed in other neurological disorders (Kordasiewicz et al., 2012; Scoles et al., 2017; Finkel et al., 2017; Darras et al., 2019). However, factors such as ASO distribution, target cell turnover, and disease-specific pathophysiology could influence the duration of the effect. To address these uncertainties, we have added a paragraph in the Discussion section emphasizing the need for additional studies, including extended follow-up periods and eventual clinical trials, to determine the specific duration of effect for our Emc10<sup>ASO</sup> constructs in treating 22q11.2DS.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer</bold> <bold>#2</bold> <bold>(Recommendations</bold> <bold>For</bold> <bold>The</bold> <bold>Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) It is acknowledged that the iPSC-derived cells in Figure 1 are no longer progenitors, but differentiation markers for astrocytes and glia are also needed in Figure 1b to establish that equal rates of differentiation have occurred across genotypes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point about ensuring equal rates of differentiation across genotypes. As the reviewer notes, we employed a well-established protocol for directed differentiation of hiPSCs into cortical neurons using a combination of small molecule inhibitors, as previously described by Qi et al. (2017). This protocol has been extensively validated and is known to robustly generate cortical neurons while actively suppressing glial differentiation, as evidenced by the lack of upregulation of glial markers such as GFAP, AQP4, or OLIG2 in the original study. Given the established neuronal specificity of this protocol and our focus on neuronal phenotypes, we prioritized the confirmation of successful neuronal differentiation using the established neuronal markers TUJ1 and TBR1. Therefore, additional markers for astrocytes and glia are not included in this figure, as we did not expect significant glial differentiation under these conditions. A sentence has been added in the corresponding Results section to address this issue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) For the RNA-seq experiments outlined in Figures 3J and K, a more comprehensive analysis is needed of the genes disrupted in the parental Q6 line relative to the het and homo lines. What percent are rescued, unaffected, vs uniquely disrupted?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reduction in EMC10 levels is not expected to directly affect transcription or broadly reorganize the gene expression profile of the Q6/Q5 NGN2-iN lines. Our transcriptional profiling was not designed to assess the direct impact of EMC10 deficiency on gene expression but rather to measure the cellular pathways affected by reduced EMC10 in the patient Q6 line. We identified genes differentially expressed between the Q6 (patient) and Q5 (control) lines, whose expression differences were either abolished or significantly attenuated (&quot;rescued&quot;) in the Q6/EMC10<sup>HET</sup> or Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup> lines. In the Q6/EMC10<sup>HET</sup> line, 237 DEGs (6%) were rescued, while in the Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup> line, 382 DEGs (11%) were rescued. Importantly, further analysis revealed 103 shared rescued DEGs in these lines, which was statistically significant (enrichment factor = 1.7; p &lt; 0.0001, based on a hypergeometric test). We added a new figure panel (Figure 3L) to visualize the significant overlap of rescued DEGs from the Q6/EMC10<sup>HET</sup> and Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup> lines. This overlap suggests these genes play a critical role in biological pathways impacted by EMC10 levels, particularly in nervous system development, as indicated by our functional annotation analysis. We also performed protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis to explore the functional relationships among these 103 shared DEGs (Figure S8). Future studies will further investigate these gene sets to gain deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying 22q11.2DS and the role of EMC10.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors claim that 50% EMC10 loss in adult mice is safe and should be toned down. EMC10 knockout mice have motor, anxiety, and social phenotypes. It would be unique amongst highly dosage-sensitive genes (MeCP2, CDKL5, TCF4, FMR1, etc.) for there to only be a neurodevelopmental component. In all those cases, and others, the effects of over and under-expression are reversible into adulthood. Establishing the range in adults is critical to establishing therapeutic utility. Absent a detailed examination of non-cognitive phenotypes, this claim cannot be made.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises an important point about the potential effects of EMC10 reduction in adult mice and the need to establish a safe therapeutic window by evaluating both cognitive and non-cognitive phenotypes. We agree that such a comprehensive evaluation is critical for assessing the safety and translational potential of Emc10-targeting therapies. While the International Mouse Genotyping Consortium reported motor and anxiety phenotypes in homozygous Emc10 knockout mice, these data are unpublished and based on a relatively small number of animals. Furthermore, in our previous work (Diamantopoulou et al., 2017), we demonstrated that complete Emc10 loss does not impair cognition or social behavior, as assessed by prepulse inhibition (PPI), working memory (WM), and social memory (SM) assays (see Figure 3A-D; Diamantopoulou et al., 2017). Additionally, heterozygous Emc10 mice, which exhibit a ~50% reduction in Emc10 expression similar to that achieved with our ASO treatment, showed no evidence of motor deficits or anxiety-like behavior. Specifically, <italic>Emc10<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice displayed locomotor activity comparable to WT mice in the open field (OF) test (Figure S4A, Diamantopoulou et al., 2017). Moreover, genetic normalization of Emc10 expression in <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice demonstrated no signs of anxiety-like behavior, as assessed by the OF test (Figure S4A) and elevated plus maze (EPM) (Figure S4B; Diamantopoulou et al., 2017). To further support these findings, we have added new data to the current manuscript (see Figure S10J) showing that TAM treatment-mediated restoration of Emc10 levels in the brain of adult <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice did not affect the time that mutant mice spent in the center area of the OF (Fig. S10J), suggesting that Emc10 reduction does not influence anxiety-related behavior. These results suggest that a 50% reduction in EMC10 expression is unlikely to result in motor or anxiety-like phenotypes in adult mice. Finally, as noted in the manuscript, in addition to prior findings from animal models, a substantial number of relatively rare LoF variants or potentially damaging missense variants have been identified in the human EMC10 gene among likely healthy individuals in gnomAD, a database largely devoid of individuals known to be affected by severe neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Discussion has been revised to underscore the importance of establishing a more detailed safety profile, including non-cognitive phenotypes, to fully validate the therapeutic potential of Emc10-targeting approaches. It also highlights the need for future studies to expand on these evaluations, addressing this critical aspect and laying a stronger foundation for advancing these findings into clinical drug development</p>

<p>(4) Supplemental Figure 10: The protein validation of Emc10 knockout following tamoxifen injection needs to be validated in all brain regions, not just the PFC. This is particularly important as the rest of the paper focuses on HPC-mediated phenotypes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>First, we want to emphasize that we conducted both qRT-PCR and WB assays on the same animal cohort, specifically examining the left and right hippocampus following ASO injection (see Figure S11C and D). This approach is crucial, given the central role of hippocampus in the phenotypes investigated in our ASO-mediated Emc10 knockdown experiments.</p>
<p>The reviewer raises an important point regarding the validation of EMC10 reduction at the protein level across all relevant brain regions using the Emc10 conditional knockout strain. We agree that such validation would ideally confirm the efficacy of our tamoxifen-induced knockout model comprehensively. However, we hope the reviewer appreciates that obtaining sufficient high-quality protein for WB analysis from smaller brain regions like the hippocampus poses a significant technical challenge. This difficulty is further compounded by the need to reserve the same samples for qRT-PCR to ensure consistency between mRNA and protein measurements. Importantly, our data from ASO-mediated Emc10 knockdown experiments (Figures S11C-D) demonstrate a clear and consistent correlation between reductions in Emc10 mRNA and protein levels in both the left and right hippocampus. Furthermore, in our constitutive Emc10-knockout mouse model (Diamantopoulou et al., 2017; see Figure S1A-B), we observed a strong agreement between mRNA and protein levels, supporting the reliability of mRNA data as a proxy for EMC10 protein levels in our experiments. Importantly, in all instances where we performed parallel protein and RNA measurements in human cell lines, there was excellent concordance between the datasets. Thus, while we acknowledge the limitations of relying primarily on mRNA data, we are confident that the Emc10 mRNA expression data in Figure S10 accurately reflect protein-level changes across brain regions in our conditional knockout model. To address this concern more fully in the future, we are working to refine antibody detection and optimize our protein extraction protocols to enable more routine and precise protein-level validation across smaller brain regions. We appreciate the reviewer’s feedback and will continue to refine our methodologies to strengthen the robustness of our findings.</p>

<p>(5) Figure 3: 1 way ANOVA would be more appropriate to analyze the data in B-G than t-tests.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the suggestion of the reviewer. As mentioned above, we carefully selected statistical tests appropriate for each analysis. For Figure 3B-G, we chose to use pairwise t-tests to address specific hypotheses regarding the disease phenotype and rescue effects. This approach is consistent with prior experimental studies in the field, including our own (e.g., Xu et al., 2013; Figure 7H-I). Importantly, most of our t-tests yielded highly significant results (p &lt; 0.001 or p &lt; 0.01), reinforcing the robustness of our findings.</p>

<p>(6) Figure 5-6: Protein data is needed to complement the mRNA knockdown data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer on the importance of protein-level validation to complement the mRNA knockdown data. As mentioned in our response to Reviewer’s Comment (4), in all instances where we performed parallel protein and RNA measurements, either in mouse brain or human cell lines, we observed excellent concordance between the datasets. This supports the reliability of our mRNA data as a proxy for protein changes. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the value of including protein validation in future experiments and will consider incorporating it to further strengthen our findings.</p>

<p>(7) The use of additional phenotypic measures is applauded in Figure 6, however, to appropriately interpret the data more is needed. Shao et al 2021 (Figure S9) show data from the International Mouse Genotyping Consortium claiming EMC10 KO mice have gait, activity, and anxiety phenotypes. All of these parameters could impact the SM assay and the y-maze assay. Changes in SM interaction time could be linked to anxiety or motor impairments, but interpreted as cognitive deficits because these symptoms were not assessed. At a minimum, discussion is needed about this limitation, as well as the inclusion of distance explored in the SM and Y-maze assays.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful comment regarding the potential influence of locomotor, gait, or anxiety phenotypes on the observed deficits in the SM and Y-maze assays. The behavioral phenotypes reported for Emc10 knockout mice by the International Mouse Genotyping Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mousephenotype.org/data/genes/MGI:1916933">https://www.mousephenotype.org/data/genes/MGI:1916933</ext-link>) were limited to homozygous female mice and based on a small sample size (4–6 females) compared to a larger WT control group. Moreover, these data are unpublished and thus challenging to evaluate fully. Importantly, no abnormal behaviors were reported for Emc10 heterozygous knockout mice in these datasets. Additionally, the claim by Shao et al. (2021) regarding cognitive impairments in Emc10 knockout mice based on our previous work (Diamantopoulou et al., 2017) is inaccurate.</p>
<p>Our analysis of both the constitutive Emc10 knockout model (Diamantopoulou et al., 2017) and the current conditional Emc10 heterozygous knockout model consistently demonstrates that Emc10 reduction does not affect locomotor activity or anxiety-like behavior. In our earlier characterization of constitutive heterozygous Emc10 knockout mice (<italic>Emc10<sup>+/-</sup></italic>), we observed no signs of anxiety-like behavior or motor impairments in OF assays (see Figure 2A-B and Figure S4A, Diamantopoulou et al., 2017). Similarly, results from <italic>Df(16)A</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice with genetically normalized Emc10 expression [<italic>Df(16)A</italic><sup>+/-</sup>; <italic>Emc10<sup>+/-</sup></italic>] also showed no indications of anxiety-like behavior or locomotor changes in the OF and EPM assays (see Figure S4A-B, Diamantopoulou et al., 2017). Consistent with these findings, our current data from <italic>Df(16)A</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice with conditional Emc10 reduction in the brain show no significant differences in locomotor activity and anxiety-related measures as assessed by OF assays (Figure S10J). Furthermore, total arm entries in Y-maze assays conducted in <italic>Df(16)A</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice treated with Emc10 ASOs were comparable to controls (Figures S14C and G-H), providing additional support for the conclusion that locomotor activity remains unaffected in these models.</p>
<p>We further appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion that changes in social interaction time during the SM assay could be influenced by anxiety or motor impairments. However, we consider this scenario unlikely in our model. Interaction times during the first trial of the SM assay, which measures general social interest, are comparable between <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice with reduced Emc10 expression (either genetically or through ASO treatment) and WT controls (see Figures 4E, 5E, and S10G). These findings indicate that our mouse models do not exhibit inherent difficulties in initiating social interaction, as might be expected if motor impairments or heightened anxiety were present. Reduced social interaction is commonly used as a behavioral marker for anxiety in rodent studies (reviewed by Bailey and Crawley, Anxiety-Related Behaviors in Mice, 2009). “Anxious” mice typically exhibit decreased social interaction, spending less time engaging with other mice compared to non-anxious counterparts. However, the specific deficit we observe in the second trial of the SM assay—when mice are reintroduced to a familiar juvenile—is indicative of impaired social recognition memory, as previously documented for <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (Piskorowski et al., 2016; Donegan et al., 2020). This deficit is distinct from the general social avoidance typically associated with heightened anxiety.</p>
<p>Based on our comprehensive assessment of locomotor activity, anxiety-related behaviors, and social interaction, we conclude that the observed rescue of social memory and spatial memory deficits in mice with reduced Emc10 expression is most likely due to improved cognitive function rather than alterations in motor or anxiety-related domains.</p>

<p>(8) For ASO optimization experiments, it is not sufficient to claim robust uptake. A quantitative measure is needed using the PO antibody showing what percentage of cells were positive for the ASO. Since the contention is that only Emc10 in excitatory neurons is important, it would be helpful if this also included a breakdown of ASO uptake in excitatory and inhibitory neurons and astrocytes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the importance of quantifying ASO uptake and assessing cell-type specificity. To address this, we have added new data to the panel, as shown in the high-magnification images in Figure S14A. These images provide evidence that a large majority of NeuN-positive neurons exhibit a strong ASO signal. Specifically, we observed widespread ASO uptake (green) that extensively colocalized with the neuronal marker NeuN (red) in both the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Quantitative analysis of this overlap indicates that over 97% of NeuN-positive neurons were ASO-positive, demonstrating efficient neuronal uptake. This robust neuronal uptake aligns with the significant normalization of Emc10 levels and the behavioral improvements observed in ASO-treated <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, further supporting the functional efficacy of our approach in modulating Emc10 expression within the relevant neuronal populations. Overall, the observed ASO uptake in neurons, as demonstrated by IHC, combined with RNA assays and the behavioral improvements in treated mice, strongly supports the efficacy of our approach in targeting Emc10 expression in the intended neuronal populations.</p>

<p>(9) An interpretation is needed in Figure S3 as to why ~50% of the pathways increased are also present on the decreased list. Ie. G1/transition, viral reproductive process, pos regulator of cell stress, etc. 4/10 GO terms are present in both increased and decreased groups in A and 7/10 in B.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the overlap between pathways enriched in both the upregulated and downregulated miRNA groups in Figure S3. This overlap likely reflects the complex nature of miRNA regulation, where individual miRNAs can target multiple genes within a pathway, and single genes can be regulated by multiple miRNAs, sometimes with opposing effects (reviewed in Bartel, 2009; Bartel, 2018). For example, in the “G1/S transition” pathway, upregulated miRNAs such as miR-92a-3p, miR-92b-3p, and miR-34a-5p may promote the transition by targeting cell cycle regulators like FBXW7, CDKN1C, and CDK6 (Zhou et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2021; Oda et al., 2024). Conversely, downregulated miRNAs such as miR-143-3p and miR-200b are known to suppress the transition by targeting genes such as HK2 and GATA-4 (Zhou et al., 2015; Yao et al., 2013). Our analysis identified overlapping predicted target genes for both upregulated and downregulated miRNAs, supporting the notion that many genes are subject to complex regulation by multiple miRNAs with potentially synergistic or antagonistic effects. Thus, the enrichment of certain GO terms in both groups likely reflects this intricate interplay of miRNA-mediated gene regulation. Future investigations focusing on specific miRNA-target interactions within these pathways will be critical to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms and better understand the functional consequences of these opposing regulatory effects.</p>

<p>(3) The switch from ASO1 to ASO2 between Figures 5 and 6 needs more discussion. Why were new ASOs generated when ASO1 worked?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their question regarding the transition from Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> to Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup> between Figure 4 and Figures 5-6. Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> served as our initial proof-of-concept ASO construct, successfully demonstrating the feasibility of inhibiting Emc10 mRNA expression and providing evidence for behavioral rescue in our mouse model. As outlined in the manuscript, Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup> targets a different region of the Emc10 transcript (intron 1, Figure 5A) compared to Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> (intron 2, Figure 4A). This distinction provides an additional layer of validation for our targeting strategy and ensures specificity in modulating <italic>Emc10</italic> expression. In addition, Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> exhibited limited distribution in the brain, primarily targeting the hippocampus with weaker inhibition of Emc10 in other regions such as the cortex (Figure 4C, right panel). Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup> overcame this limitation and achieve broader brain distribution, as demonstrated by the qRT-PCR data in Figure 5C. Given that 22q11.2DS can affect multiple brain regions and cognitive domains beyond the hippocampus, achieving broader distribution of the ASO is critical for a more comprehensive assessment of therapeutic potential.</p>
