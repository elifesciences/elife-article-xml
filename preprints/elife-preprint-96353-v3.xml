<title>Abstract</title><p>The spatiotemporal transition of small GTPase Rab5 to Rab7 is crucial for early-to-late endosome maturation, yet the precise mechanism governing Rab5-to-Rab7 switching remains elusive. USP8, a ubiquitin-specific protease, plays a prominent role in the endosomal sorting of a wide range of transmembrane receptors and is a promising target in cancer therapy. Here, we identified that USP8 is recruited to Rab5-positive carriers by Rabex5, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab5. The recruitment of USP8 dissociates Rabex5 from early endosomes (EEs) and meanwhile promotes the recruitment of the Rab7 GEF SAND-1/Mon1. In USP8-deficient cells, the level of active Rab5 is increased, while the Rab7 signal is decreased. As a result, enlarged EEs with abundant intraluminal vesicles accumulate and digestive lysosomes are rudimentary. Together, our results reveal an important and unexpected role of a deubiquitinating enzyme in endosome maturation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Endosomes are dynamic and heterogeneous organelles that act as hubs for endocytic trafficking, recycling and degradation. During endocytosis, membrane proteins marked by ubiquitination are incorporated into endocytic vesicles and then transported to early endosomes (EEs). At EEs, membrane proteins are either brought to the recycling endosomes (REs) or incorporated into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) with the help of ESCRT (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sardana and Emr, 2021</xref>). The ILV-containing compartments, often referred to multivesicular bodies (MVBs), are more acidified and upon fusion with lysosomes, can deliver both transmembrane cargos for degradation, as well as fresh supplies of lysosomal hydrolase enzymes required for the turnover of proteins, lipids and other cellular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sardana and Emr, 2021</xref>). The EE-to-MVB endosome maturation process is mainly controlled by endosome-specific Rab GTPases and phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Borchers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">KÃ¼mmel et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Stenmark, 2009</xref>). Rab GTPases are guanine nucleotide binding proteins that switch between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound state. Within the cytosol, the GDP-bound Rab proteins are kept soluble by binding to the GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI). The GTP-bound Rabs, activated by their corresponding GEF, can associate with cellular membranes and recruit effector proteins.</p>
<p>Rab5, the Rab GTPase critical for early endosome formation and function, can be activated and recruited to EEs by its GEF, Rabex5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mattera and Bonifacino, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>). The GTP-bound active Rab5 recruits its effectors, for instance, Rabaptin-5. Rabaptin-5 in turn binds to Rabex5 via a coiled-coil region, resulting in a positive feedback loop of Rab5 activation on endosomal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>). Isolated Rabex5 appears to have relatively low GEF activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Delprato and Lambright, 2007</xref>) and binding of Rabaptin-5 to Rabex5 causes a rearrangement in the Rabex5 C-terminus and subsequently enhances nucleotide exchange of Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Horiuchi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lauer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">LippÃ© et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>). Thus, autoinhibition likely serves as a key regulatory mechanism in controlling GEF activity. Other effectors of Rab5 include the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) kinase complex II (VPS34/VPS15/Beclin 1/UVRAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tremel et al., 2021</xref>), which promotes the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) on endosomes, and the class C core vacuole/endosome tethering (CORVET) complex, which promotes membrane homotypic fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abenza et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Balderhaar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Peplowska et al., 2007</xref>). Rab5 also recruits the early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1), a tethering protein required for fusion of endocytic vesicles with EEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Christoforidis et al., 1999</xref>). The phosphorylated head group of PI3P binds to specific domains, such as the FYVE domain in EEA1, allowing for the organelle-specific association of proteins containing this domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lawe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Stenmark et al., 1996</xref>). The fusion of vesicles with organelles depends on tethering complexes as well as soluble <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs). Reconstitution of early endosome fusion revealed that EEA1 functions in the context of multiple additional components, including endosomal SNAREs, during fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ohya et al., 2009</xref>). Rab5 effectors also include the Rab7 GEF Mon1âCcz1 complex. Rab7 activation by Mon1-Ccz1 complex is essential for the biogenesis and positioning of late endosomes (LEs) and lysosomes, and for the fusion of endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes. The Mon1âCcz1 complex is a heterodimer in yeast, and a heterotrimer in metazoan cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dehnen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Vaites et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">van den Boomen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). The activation of Mon1-Ccz1 is depended on Rab5 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Borchers et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Langemeyer et al., 2020</xref>) and Mon1 also coordinates endosome maturation together with the Rab5 GAP TBC1D18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hiragi et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, the Mon1-Ccz1 complex is able to interact with Rabex5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>), causing dissociation of Rabex5 from the membrane, which probably terminates the positive feedback loop of Rab5 activation and then promotes the recruitment and activation of Rab7 on endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nordmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>). All in all, the hierarchy of protein recruitment and their reciprocal regulation ensures the rapid transition from Rab5- to Rab7-positive vesicles which is critical for endosome maturation.</p>
<p>The conserved ESCRT machinery drives endosomal membrane deformation and scission leading to the formation of ILVs within MVBs. On the surface of endosomes, ESCRT-0, -I and -II bind to ubiquitinated membrane proteins, while ESCRT-III and Vps4 bud ILVs into the lumen of the endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wollert and Hurley, 2010</xref>). The deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) USP8 belongs to the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family and plays a prominent role in the regulation of endosomal sorting of a wide range of transmembrane receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dufner and Knobeloch, 2019</xref>). In addition to direct deubiquitination, USP8 also regulates protein stability through its interactions with various ESCRT components. By binding to STAM and Hrs, USP8 stabilizes the ESCRT-0 complex, which is the crucial element directing ubiquitinated substrates towards MVB/lysosome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mizuno et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Row et al., 2006</xref>). The N-terminal microtubule interacting and transport (MIT) domain of USP8 interacts with ESCRT-III proteins, which are thought to be the driving force of several membrane scission events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Row et al., 2007</xref>). In the absence of USP8, EGFR is abnormally accumulated in EEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alwan and van Leeuwen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Row et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, the endocytic trafficking of the Frizzled receptor, Smooth, as well as key components of the Wnt and Hedgehog pathways is also affected by <italic>usp8</italic> deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berlin et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berlin et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Crespo-YÃ Ã±ez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jacomin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">MacDonald et al., 2014</xref>). Noticeably, however, the impact of USP8 on protein stability is highly variable and sometimes controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berlin et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mizuno et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Niendorf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Row et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, utilizing both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and cultured mammalian cells as models, we identified that USP8 is recruited to Rab5-positive vesicles through Rabex5 and functions through both the endosomal dissociation of Rabex5 and recruitment of SAND-1/Mon1 to promote endosome maturation. USP8 has recently arisen as a promising therapeutic target in at least two distinct pathological contexts associated with USP8 overexpression or gain-of-function variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dufner and Knobeloch, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Li et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Reincke et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, our data reveal an important and direct role of USP8 in endosome maturation and have clear implications for the therapeutic treatment of USP8-related human diseases.</p>

<title>Enlarged EEs in <italic>usp-50/usp8</italic> mutant cells</title>
<p>Lysosomes receive and digest materials generated by endocytic pathways. Using YFP-tagged 2xFYVE (YFP::2xFYVE), which specifically labels PI3P, we examined the size and morphology of EEs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that the size of individual EEs is significantly increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Meanwhile, the total volume of EEs in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants remains similar to wild type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), implying that the homotypic fusion of EEs is probably increased.

Indeed, when we knocked out the expression of USP8 (USP8-KO) in human breast cancer SUM159 cells (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1C</xref>), the transient expression of EGFP-2xFYVE confirmed that USP8 depletion caused early endosome enlargement (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>).</p>

About 58.7% of the abnormal vesicles belong to this category. The second class (26.8%) includes vesicles filled with threadlike membrane structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2Q</xref>). Vesicles of the third type (22.4%) are loaded with threadlike membrane structures and electron-dense material (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2P</xref>). The fourth class, which accounts for a relatively small proportion of mutant vesicles (4.9%), contains various cellular organelles, for instance mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2Q</xref>). Given the significantly reduced LAAT-1-coated structures and the increased size of FYVE-positive vesicles observed in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants, it is plausible that these enlarged vesicles represent abnormally expanded early endosomes (EEs).</p>

<title>USP8 is dynamically recruited to Rab5-positive vesicles</title>
<p>How does USP-50/USP8 control the size of EEs? To address this question, we firstly analyzed the subcellular localization of USP-50/USP8. In worm epidermal cells, the GFP-tagged USP-50 protein is co-localized with mCherry::RAB-5 (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</xref>) but not with mCherry::RAB-7 (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B</xref>), consistent with the early endosomal localization of USP-50/USP8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mizuno et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Row et al., 2006</xref>).

Thus, the EE localization of USP-50 is not dependent on its deubiquitination activity. Meanwhile, the mCherry::RAB-5 signal is strongly enhanced by the overexpression of USP-50(C492A) (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that the C492A mutation may have a dominant-negative effect on USP-50 function.</p>

<p>To reveal the subcellular localization of USP8 in mammalian cells, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 approach to generate a SUM159 cell line in which the endogenous USP8 was tagged with mEGFP (USP8-mEGFP<sup>+/+</sup>) (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, USP8-mEGFP co-localizes well with the EE marker mScarlet-I-EEA1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, LE or lysosome markers, including mScarlet-I-Rab7a and Lamp1-mScarlet-I, have little overlap with the USP8-mEGFP signal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Constitutively activated Rab5 GTPase (Rab5c-Q80L) causes enlarged EEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Stenmark et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wegner et al., 2010</xref>). Instead of being evenly distributed, USP8-mEGFP formed individual spots located on one side of the enlarged endosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). We further analyzed the sub-organelle distribution of USP8 using structured illumination microscopy (SIM). Consistent with what we observed in enlarged EEs caused by Rab5c-Q80L overexpression, the USP8-mEGFP dots indeed located at subdomains of EEs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). The uneven distribution of USP8 implies that USP8 may associate dynamically with EEs. To further investigate the dynamic association of USP8 with EEs, we transiently expressed mScarlet-I-Rab5c in the genome-edited USP8-mEGFP<sup>+/+</sup> cells and tracked the recruitment dynamics of USP8-mEGFP to EEs by spinning-disk confocal microscopy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). We previously reported that Rab5 was recruited to nascent endocytic carriers following the un-coating of clathrin-coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">He et al., 2017</xref>). This recruitment resulted in the creation of Rab5-positive endocytic carriers, which could subsequently fuse with other Rab5-positive endocytic carriers or EEA1-positive EEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">He et al., 2017</xref>). We found that USP8-mEGFP was recruited to these nascent mScarlet-I-Rab5c-positive vesicles which appeared around the bottom surface of the cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Additionally, we observed the dynamic appearance and disappearance of single USP8-mEGFP spots on these large Rab5c-positive endosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G-H</xref>).</p>

<title>USP-50/USP8 recruitment dissociates RABX-5 from endosomes</title>
<p>How is the endosomal recruitment of USP8 related to its function in endolysosomal trafficking process? By searching the putative USP-50 binding partners, we found that USP-50 can bind to RABX-5, the worm homolog of Rabex5 protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A and B</xref>). To determine which domain of RABX-5 is required for the interaction with USP-50, we constructed a panel of FLAG-tagged RABX-5 truncation mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) and performed a series of immunoprecipitation tests (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). In general, the C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) and the C-terminal proline-rich (PR) domains are sufficient for RABX-5 to interact with USP-50. Meanwhile, the N-terminal region, including an A20-zinc finger domain (ZF), a motif interacting with ubiquitin (U), the membrane-binding motif (MB) and the downstream helical bundle domain (HB) of RABX-5 could also mediate USP-50 binding. Further including Vps9 domain enhances the molecular interaction between RABX-5 and USP-50 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C and D</xref>).</p>

Thus, <italic>rabx-5</italic> is require for the endosomal localization of USP-50. Does USP-50 regulate endosome maturation via RABX-5? In <italic>rabx-5(null)</italic> mutant animals, early endosomes labeled with 2xFYVE are indistinguishable from those in wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H and I</xref>).

These findings suggest that USP-50 likely exerts its regulatory effects on early endosome size through RABX-5.</p>
<p>In wild-type animals, the fluorescence signal of RABX-5::GFP in hyp7 is rather dim (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). When <italic>usp-50</italic> is mutated, the RABX-5::GFP KI signal is greatly enhanced (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). USP8-KO also caused a significant increase in the number of enlarged endosomes in Rabex5-mEGFP<sup>+/+</sup> SUM159 cells (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A-C</xref> and E). Rabex5-mEGFP signals were enriched and co-localized well with the mScarlet-I-Rab5c signal on the enlarged endosomes (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Antibody staining of endogenous EEA1 further showed that the enlarged EEs in USP8-KO cells were coated with both Rabex5 and EEA1 (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1D</xref>). The increased endosomal RABX-5/Rabex5 may lead to Rab5 signal enhancement. Indeed, in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants, the GFP::RAB-5 KI-labeled vesicles are significantly enlarged (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2A-C</xref>) and the proportion of membrane-associated GFP::RAB-5 KI is also increased (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2D</xref>). The GTP-bound activated RAB-5 protein binds to its downstream effector EEA1 via the N-terminal domain of EEA1 (EEA1-NT). We utilized EEA1-NT (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2E</xref>) to show that loss of <italic>usp-50</italic> indeed led to more activated RAB-5 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2F</xref>).

To explore the relationship between Rab5 and USP8 in SUM159 cells, we knocked down the expression of USP8 by siRNA (USP8-KD) in the clonal genome-edited EGFP-Rab5c<sup>+/+</sup> cells. We found that EEs, labeled by Rab5, are significantly enlarged (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2I</xref> and J).

<title>USP-50 acts on K323 de-ubiquitination to regulate RABX-5 localization</title>
<p>The enzyme-inactive USP-50(C492A) cannot rescue the enhanced endosomal RABX-5 signal in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutant animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C and D</xref>). This suggests that USP-50 acts through its de-ubiquitination activity to dissociate RABX-5 from endosomes. To further dissect how the USP-50-mediated de-ubiquitination might contribute to RABX-5 localization, we precipitated the FLAG-tagged RABX-5 from overexpressed 293T cells and performed ubiquitination proteomics analysis. We found that the K88 and K323 residues of RABX-5 are modified by ubiquitin <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig5s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 3A</xref> and B). K88 is located in the membrane-binding motif, while K323 resides in the conserved Vps9 domain of RABX-5 (<xref rid="fig5s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 3B</xref>). To understand whether and how these two ubiquitin modification sites are involved in USP-50-mediated deubiquitination, we generated non-ubiquitinated mutations at K88 and K323 (K88R and K323R, respectively). In wild-type animals, the RABX-5::GFP KI intensity is rather dim (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). When <italic>usp-50</italic> is mutated, the RABX-5::GFP KI intensity is strongly enhanced and displays the typical punctate pattern (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B and I</xref>). On a wild-type background, both RABX-5(K88R)::GFP KI and RABX-5(K323R)::GFP KI display weak signals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E and G</xref>) similar to wild-type RABX-5::GFP KI (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). When <italic>usp-50</italic> is mutated, the RABX-5(K88R)::GFP KI signal is greatly enhanced and displays an apparent punctate pattern (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F and I</xref>), which is similar to what we observed with the wild-type RABX-5::GFP KI line. In contrast, when K323 is mutated, the signal from RABX-5(K323A)::GFP KI remains dim in both wild-type and <italic>usp-50</italic> mutant animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G-I</xref>). These observations suggest that USP-50 cannot regulate the endosomal localization of RABX-5 when K323 is mutated. Furthermore, the <italic>rabx-5(K323R)</italic> mutation successfully suppressed both the enlarged early endosome and diminished late endosome phenotypes of <italic>usp-50</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J-M</xref>). Taken together, USP-50 recruitment to EEs relies on RABX-5, and through its deubiquitination action on the Vps9 domain of RABX-5, USP-50 dissociates RABX-5 from EEs, thereby terminating Rab5 signaling to promote endosome maturation.</p>

<title>USP-50/USP8 is required for SAND-1/Mon1 recruitment</title>
<p>SAND-1/Mon1-Ccz1 binds to RABX-5, and by displacing RABX-5 from the endosomal membrane, functions as a GEF of Rab7 to recruit and activate Rab7 GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nordmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>). In the absence of RABX-5 <italic>(rabx-5 null</italic>), the GFP::SAND-1 puncta are diminished (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, B and D) and the LAAT-1::GFP-labeled lysosome structures are also reduced (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E and F</xref>; and <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1A</xref>). In <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants, the RABX-5 signal is enhanced, while the lysosome structures are reduced. Intriguingly, when we introduced the GFP::SAND-1 marker into <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants, we found that the punctate distribution of GFP::SAND-1 is lost (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, C and D). Mon1a and Mon1b are mammalian homologs of worm SAND-1. In SUM159 cells, mEGFP-tagged endogenous Mon1a (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1B</xref>) is localized on both Rab5-positive EEs and Rab7-positive late endosomes (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1C</xref> and D). In contrast, endogenous Mon1b (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1E</xref>) is more localized on late endosomes (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1F</xref> and G). When the expression of USP8 in the mEGFP-Mon1a<sup>+/+</sup> or mEGFP-Mon1b<sup>+/+</sup> cells was knocked down by siRNA, we found that the number of vesicles positive for mEGFP-Mon1a or mEGFP-Mon1b was greatly reduced (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1H</xref> and I). Taken together, these results indicate that the function of USP8/USP-50 in endosomal localization of SAND-1/Mon1-Ccz1 is evolutionarily conserved. We noticed that when <italic>sand-1</italic> is mutated, the EEs are enlarged (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J-L</xref> and <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1H</xref>) and late endosomes/lysosomes become smaller (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6M-O</xref> and <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1I</xref>), which is highly similar to <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants. Furthermore, co-IP experiments indicated that the USP-50 protein is able to bind to SAND-1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6P</xref>), which is consistent with the role of USP-50 in endosomal localization of SAND-1.</p>

<p>SAND-1/Mon1 is a GEF for Rab7, and therefore a reduced level of SAND-1/Mon1 may decrease the endosomal distribution of Rab7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hiragi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nordmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yong et al., 2023</xref>). Indeed, with the GFP::RAB-7 KI line, we found that the punctate RAB-7 signal was greatly reduced by loss of function of <italic>sand-1</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6Q and R</xref>). In <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants, the punctate GFP::RAB-7 KI signal is also reduced (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6S and T</xref>). Given the coupled phenotype of enlarged EEs and smaller late endosomes/lysosomes in both <italic>usp-50</italic> and <italic>sand-1</italic> mutants, we wondered whether increasing Rab7 would enhance the endosome maturation process, thus overriding the early endosome enlargement defect in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants. Therefore, we overexpressed the wild-type <italic>rab-7</italic> gene and found that the early endosome enlargement phenotype of <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants was greatly suppressed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6U-X</xref>). In conclusion, we propose that the recruitment of USP-50/USP8, dependent on Rabex5, dissociates Rabex5 from EEs. Concurrently, this recruitment promotes the enrollment of SAND-1/Mon1-Ccz1, thereby facilitating the maturation of endosomes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6Y</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we identified that the recruitment of ubiquitin-specific protease USP-50/USP8 to EEs requires Rabex5. Instead of stabilizing Rabex5, the USP-50/USP8 recruitment dissociates Rabex5 from endosomes and meanwhile enrolls the Rab7 GEF SAND-1/Mon1. In <italic>usp-50/usp8</italic> loss-of-function cells, the RABX-5/Rabex5 signal is enhanced and the SAND-1/Mon1 protein fails to be localized onto endosomes. As a result, abnormal enlarged EEs are accumulated and the lysosomal structures become rudimentary.</p>
<p>Most studies of USP8 focus on endosomal trafficking of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in cultured vertebrate cells. In some cases, reduced USP8 activity results in accumulation of ubiquitinated cargos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alwan and van Leeuwen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bowers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mizuno et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Row et al., 2006</xref>). USP8 can also promote RTK stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berlin et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mizuno et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Niendorf et al., 2007</xref>). It is thought that USP8 promotes the recycling of cell surface receptors back to the plasma membrane or enhances their degradation depending on when and where it deubiquitinates its substrate along the recycling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mizuno et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Niendorf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wright et al., 2011</xref>). Besides EGFR, USP8 regulates the endocytic trafficking and/or stability of many other transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">MartÃ­n-RodrÃ­guez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Peng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Xie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Xiong et al., 2022</xref>), but conclusions about the impact of USP8 on protein stability are highly diverse. The conflicting results may be caused by massive global ubiquitination and proteolytic stress triggered by depletion of USP8 or overexpression of a catalytically inactive enzyme.</p>
<p>Endosome maturation controls the sorting, processing, recycling, and degradation of incoming substances and receptors, and is thus responsible for regulation and fine-tuning of numerous pathways in cells. The Rab5 GEF Rabex5 can be recruited to EEs through an early endosomal targeting (EET) domain or by binding with ubiquitinated cargoes through its UBD region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mattera and Bonifacino, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>). Notably, complex intramolecular interactions are extensively involved in Rabex5 function and dynamic localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lauer et al., 2019</xref>). Here, RABX-5 associates with USP-50 through multiple domains. Thus, in the context of <italic>usp8/usp-50</italic> deletion, the enhanced endosomal localization of Rabex5/RABX-5 may be caused by alterations in multiple inter- and intramolecular interactions. The GTP-bound active Rab5 recruits Rabaptin-5 resulting in a positive feedback loop of Rab5 activation on endosomal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>). How is this positive feedback loop terminated? The role of Rabex5 in recruiting Rab7 GEF SAND-1/Mon1-Ccz1 is well established. Here, we further showed that the endosomal localization of USP-50 is also dependent on RABX-5. Thus, Rabex5 may recruit multifaceted negative regulators, which work subsequently or collaboratively to regulate endosome maturation. Late endosomes transport new lysosomal hydrolases and membrane proteins to lysosomes for the maintenance and amplification of the degradative compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Yang and Wang, 2021</xref>). Loss of worm <italic>usp-50</italic> results in reduced lysosome size. Previous studies also observed lysosome formation deficiency in fly <italic>ubpy/usp8</italic> knock-down fat cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jacomin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jacomin et al., 2016</xref>). Removal of Rab5 and its replacement with Rab7 is an essential step in late endosome formation and in the transport of cargo to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Borchers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zeigerer et al., 2012</xref>). In the absence of USP8/USP-50, the RABX-5/Rabex5 signal is enhanced, but the endosomal localization of SAND-1/Mon1 is reduced, suggesting that in addition to Rabex5, USP8 is further needed to engage Rab7 GEF. The Mon1-Ccz1 complex can be recruited to various organelles through a variety of binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, recruited by Rabex5, USP8 may serve a linker specifically bridging endosomes to the Rab7 GEF. <italic>sand-1</italic> mutants display an almost identical phenotype to <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants, including enlarged EEs and much smaller late endosomes/lysosomes, implying that USP8/USP-50 functions similarly to SAND-1/Mon1-Ccz1. In <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants, the great reduction of RAB-7 signal is accompanied by a dramatically increased RAB-5 signal. Therefore, we suspect that the extended Rab5 activation in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants actually prevents the Rab5-to-Rab7 conversion from occurring. Of course, we cannot rule out the possibility that the remaining SAND-1 is able to convert some of the Rab5 to Rab7, thus forming late endosomes to some degree. However, due to the quick conversion of late endosomes to lysosomes for degradation, most of the EEs remain clearly differentiated from late endosomes/lysosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C and D</xref>; and <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Overexpression of RAB-7 rescued the enlarged early endosome phenotype of <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6U-X</xref>), further supporting the idea that USP-50/USP8 downregulates Rab5 signaling and meanwhile promotes Rab7 activation, thus facilitating the EE-to-LE conversion. Together, we propose a working model, in which Rab5-coated vesicles recruit USP8, possibly through RABX-5-USP-50 interactions. Subsequently, USP8 dissociates Rabex5 from endosomes, meanwhile facilitating the recruitment of SAND-1/Mon1-Ccz1 complex to initiate LE formation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6Y</xref>).</p>
<p>Formation of ILVs is a hallmark of MVBs, which constitute morphologically distinct late endosomal structures that receive cargo in transit to the lysosomes. USP8 is important for the stability and ubiquitination status of various ESCRT components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adoro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Crespo-YÃ Ã±ez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mathieu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mizuno et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Niendorf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zhang et al., 2014a</xref>). Indeed, the punctate distribution of ESCRT-0 components is reduced significantly in <italic>usp-50</italic> worms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G-H</xref>; and <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>). By EM ultrastructural analysis, we found that a large number of abnormal vesicular structures accumulate in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants and a large portion of them contain various intraluminal structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L-Q</xref>). In wild-type animals, MVBs are rarely observed, indicating that once formed, they rapidly fuse with lysosomes and are subsequently degraded. The loss of USP-50 results in the upregulation of Rab5 signaling, which may enhance the homophilic fusion of early endosomes (EEs). Given the substantial reduction in Rab7 levels and the marked diminution in lysosomal structures, it is likely that the aberrantly enlarged vesicles in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants represent excessively enlarged EEs.</p>
<p>USP8 deubiquitinates numerous plasma membrane receptors, making this enzyme a promising target in cancer therapy to overcome chemoresistance associated with RTK stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Byun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Islam et al., 2021</xref>). Gain-of-function mutations of USP8 have been found in microadenomas of patients with Cushingâs disease, a rare disease where the secretion of large amounts of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) by pituitary corticotroph adenomas results in an excess of glucocorticoids and hypercortisolism, putatively due to defective EGFR sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Reincke et al., 2015</xref>). The role of USP8 in directing endosomal trafficking revealed here should shed new light on understanding its contribution to membrane receptor trafficking, resistance to chemotherapy, or EGFR stabilization in Cushingâs disease.</p>

<title>Genome editing of SUM159 cells to generate mEGFP-USP8<sup>+/+</sup>, mEGFP-Mon1a<sup>+/+</sup> or mEGFP-Mon1b<sup>+/+</sup> cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 approach</title>
<p>SUM159 cells were genome-edited to incorporate mEGFP at the N-terminus of USP8, Mon1a, and Mon1b using the CRISPR/Cas9 approach as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ran et al., 2013</xref>). The single-guide RNAs (sgRNA) targeting human USP8 (5â-ATGCAGATTAGATCGTGATG-3â), human Mon1a (5â-GGATGGCTACTGACATGCAG-3â), or human Mon1b (5â-GATGTGCAGATGGAGGTCGG-3â) were cloned into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) (Addgene #48139). The donor constructs used for homologous recombination were generated by cloning into the pUC19 vector with two â¼600-800-nucleotide fragments of genomic DNA upstream and downstream of the start codon of human USP8, Mon1a, and Mon1b, and the open reading frame of mEGFP using the pEASY-Uni Seamless Cloning and Assembly Kit (TransGen Biotech). A flexible (GGS)<sub>3</sub> linker was inserted between the start or stop codon of the gene and the open reading frame of mEGFP. 4-5 days after transfection with the donor plasmid and PX459 plasmid containing sgRNA targeting sequence, SUM159 cells expressing mEGFP were enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACSAria Fusion, BD Biosciences).

<p>The spinning-disk confocal microscope was built on the Nikon TiE microscope as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bi et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, the microscope was equipped with a CFI Apochromat SD 100X objective (1.46 NA, Nikon), a Motorized XY stage (Prior Scientific), a fully enclosed and environmentally controlled cage incubator (Okolab), OBIS 488, 561 and 647 nm lasers (Coherent), a CSU-X1 spinning-disk confocal unit (Yokogawa) and an EMCCD camera (iXon Ultra 897, Andor Technology). Images were acquired using Micro-Manager 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Edelstein et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>SUM159 cells were plated on single-well confocal dishes (Cellvis) approximately 6-8 hours after transfection. Cells expressing relatively low levels of the endosome makers were imaged from the bottom surface (Z = 1) to the middle plane (spaced 0.35 Î¼m) in phenol-free DMEM/F12 (Corning) containing 5% FBS and 20 mM HEPES. Single frames or merge images were generated in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). To quantify the areas and numbers of the fluorescently labeled Rab5c, Rabex5, or EEA1 spots per cell, the cell boundary was firstly manually segmented based on the fluorescence of the cell in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).

Finally, these results were exported from Cellprofiler 4 and further analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism 9.</p>
<p>For live-cell imaging and tracking of USP8 recruitment to Rab5-positive carriers, USP8-mEGFP<sup>+/+</sup> cells were transiently transfected with mScarlet-I-Rab5c, and then imaged at two planes (the bottom plane and the plane 0.5 Î¼m above the bottom plane) every 2 seconds for 60 seconds by spinning-disk confocal microscopy. The maximum fluorescence intensity projection of the two imaging planes was generated using Fiji and was used for further imaging analysis.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript focuses on the role of the deubiquitinating enzyme UPS-50/USP8 in endosome maturation. The authors aimed to clarify how this enzyme drives the conversion of early endosomes into late endosomes. Overall, they did achieve their aims in shedding light on the precise mechanisms by which UPS-50/USP8 regulates endosome maturation. The results support their conclusions that UPS-50 acts by disassociating RABX-5 from early endosomes to deactivate RAB-5 and by recruiting SAND-1/Mon1 to activate RAB-7. This work is commendable and will have a significant impact on the field. The methods and data presented here will be useful to the community in advancing our understanding of endosome maturation and identifying potential therapeutic targets for diseases related to endosomal dysfunction. It is worth noting that further investigation is required to fully understand the complexities of endosome maturation. However, the findings presented in this manuscript provide a solid foundation for future studies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strengths of this work lie in the well-designed experiments used to examine the effects of UPS-50 loss. The authors employed confocal imaging to obtain a picture of the aftermath of USP-50 loss. Their findings indicated enlarged early endosomes and MVB-like structures in cells deficient in USP-50/USP8.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Specifically, there is a need for further investigation to accurately characterize the anomalous structures detected in the ups-50 mutant. Also, the correlation between the presence of these abnormal structures and ESCRT-0 is yet to be addressed, and the current working model needs to be revised to prevent any confusion between enlarged early endosomes and MVBs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors study how the deubiquitinase USP8 regulates endosome maturation in C. elegans and mammalian cells. The authors have isolated USP8 mutant alleles in C. elegans and used multiple in vivo reporter lines to demonstrate the impact of USP8 loss-of-function on endosome morphology and maturation. They show that in USP8 mutant cells, the early endosomes and MVB-like structures are enlarged while the late endosomes and lysosomal compartments are reduced. They elucidate that USP8 interacts with Rabx5, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab5, and show that USP8 likely targets specific lysine residue of Rabx5 to dissociate it from early endosomes. They also find that localization of USP8 to early endosomes are disrupted in Rabx5 mutant cells. They observe that in both Rabx5 and USP8 mutant cells, the Rab7 GEF SAND-1 puncta which likely represents late endosomes are diminished, although that Rabex5 are accumulated in USP8 mutant cells. The authors provide evidence that USP8 regulates endosomal maturation in a similar fashion in mammalian cells. Based on their observations they propose that USP8 dissociates Rabex5 from early endosomes and enhances the recruitment of SAND-1 to promote endosome maturation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major highlights of this study include the direct visualization of endosome dynamics in a living multi-cellular organism, C. elegans. The high-quality images provide clear in vivo evidences to support the main conclusions. The authors have generated valuable resources to study mechanisms involved in endosome dynamics regulation in both the worm and mammalian cells, which would benefit many members in the cell biology community. The work identifies a fascinating link between USP8 and the Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor Rabx5, which expands the targets and modes of action of USP8. The findings make a solid contribution toward the understanding of how endosomal trafficking is controlled.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The authors utilized multiple fluorescent protein reporters, including those generated by themselves, to label endosomal vesicles. Although these are routine and powerful tools for studying endosomal trafficking, these results cannot tell that whether the endogenous proteins (Rab5, Rabex5, Rab7, etc.) are affected in the same fashion. Note that the authors have provided convincing evidence about the effects on Rab proteins in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>
- The authors clearly demonstrated a link between USP8 and Rabx5, and they showed that cells deficient of both factors displayed similar defects in late endosomes/lysosomes. But the authors didn't confirm whether and/or to which extent that USP8 regulates endosome maturation through Rabx5. Additional genetic and molecular evidence might be required to better support their working model. Note that the authors have provided convincing evidence about the role of USP8-Rabx5 axis in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors elucidated the role of USP8 in the endocytic pathway. Using C. elegans epithelial cells as a model, they observed that when USP8 function is lost, the cells have a decreased number and size in lysosomes. Since USP8 was already known to be a protein linked to ESCRT components, they looked into what role USP8 might play in connecting lysosomes and multivesicular bodies (MVB). They observed fewer ESCRT-associated vesicles but an increased number of abnormal enlarged vesicles (aberrant early endosomes) when USP8 function was lost. They showed that USP8 interacts with Rabx5 to dissociate it from early endosomes promoting the recruitment of the Rab7 GEF SAND-1/Mon1 and the maturation of the endosomes. The authors provided evidence that USP8 regulates endosomal maturation in a similar fashion in mammalian cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of two models, C. elegans and a mammalian cell line to describe a similar mechanism.</p>

<p>Excellent suggestions. USP8 has been identified as a protein associated with ESCRT components, which are crucial for endosomal membrane deformation and scission, leading to the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) within multivesicular bodies (MVBs). In <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants, we observed a significant reduction in the punctate signals of HGRS-1::GFP and STAM-1 (Figure 1G and H; and Figure1-figure supplement 1B), indicating a disruption in ESCRT-0 complex localization (Author response image 1). Additionally, lysosomal structures are markedly reduced in these mutants. In contrast, we found that early endosomes, as marked by FYVE, RAB-5, RABEX5, and EEA1, are significantly enlarged in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants. Electron microscopy (EM) imaging further revealed an increase in large cellular vesicles containing various intraluminal structures. Given the reduction in lysosomal structures and the enlargement of early endosomes in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants, these enlarged vesicles are likely aberrant early endosomes rather than late endosomal or lysosomal structures. To address potential confusion, we have revised the manuscript according to the reviewer's comments and updated the model to accurately reflect these observations.</p>

The authors have generated valuable resources to study mechanisms involved in endosome dynamics regulation in both the worm and mammalian cells, which would benefit many members of the cell biology community. The work identifies a fascinating link between USP8 and the Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor Rabx5, which expands the targets and modes of action of USP8. The findings make a solid contribution toward the understanding of how endosomal trafficking is controlled.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The authors utilized multiple fluorescent protein reporters, including those generated by themselves, to label endosomal vesicles. Although these are routine and powerful tools for studying endosomal trafficking, these results cannot tell whether the endogenous proteins (Rab5, Rabex5, Rab7, etc.) are affected in the same fashion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Good suggestion. Indeed, to test whether the endogenous proteins (Rab5, Rabex5, Rab7, etc.) are affected in the same fashion as fluorescent protein reporters, we supplemented our approach with the utilization of endogenous markers. These markers, including Rab5, RAB-5, Rabex5, RABX-5, and EEA1 for early endosomes, as well as RAB-7, Mon1a, and Mon1b for late endosomes, were instrumental in our investigations (refer to Figure 3, Figure 6, Figure 5-figure supplement 1, Figure 5-figure supplement 2, and Figure 6-figure supplement 1). Our comprehensive analysis, employing various methodologies such as tissue-specific fused proteins, CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in, and antibody staining, consistently highlights the critical role of USP8 in early-to-late endosome conversion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The authors clearly demonstrated a link between USP8 and Rabx5, and they showed that cells deficient in both factors displayed similar defects in late endosomes/lysosomes. However, the authors didn't confirm whether and/or to which extent USP8 regulates endosome maturation through Rabx5. Additional genetic and molecular evidence might be required to better support their working model.</p>

<p>Excellent point. To test whether USP-50 regulates endosome maturation through RABX-5, we performed additional genetic analyses. In <italic>rabx-5(null)</italic> mutant animals, the morphology of 2xFYVE-labeled early endosomes is comparable to that of wild-type controls (Figure 4H and I). Introducing the <italic>rabx-5(null)</italic> mutation into <italic>usp-50(xd413)</italic> backgrounds resulted in a significant suppression of the enlarged early endosome phenotype characteristic of <italic>usp-50(xd413)</italic> mutants (Figure 4H and I). These findings suggest that USP-50 may modulate the size of early endosomes through its interaction with RABX-5.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors were trying to elucidate the role of USP8 in the endocytic pathway. Using C. elegans epithelial cells as a model, they observed that when USP8 function is lost, the cells have a decreased number and size in lysosomes. Since USP8 was already known to be a protein linked to ESCRT components, they looked into what role USP8 might play in connecting lysosomes and multivesicular bodies (MVB). They observed fewer ESCRT-associated vesicles but an increased number of &quot;abnormal&quot; enlarged vesicles when USP8 function was lost. At this specific point, it's not clear what the objective of the authors was. What would have been their hypothesis addressing whether the reduced lysosomal structures in USP8 (-) animals were linked to MVB formation? Then they observed that the abnormally enlarged vesicles, marked by the PI3P biosensor YFP-2xFYVE, are bigger but in the same number in USP8 (-) compared to wild-type animals, suggesting homotypic fusion. They confirmed this result by knocking down USP8 in a human cell line, and they observed enlarged vesicles marked by YFP-2xFYVE as well. At this point, there is quite an important issue. The use of YFP-2xFYVE to detect early endosomes requires the transfection of the cells, which has already been demonstrated to produce differences in the distribution, number, and size of PI3P-positive vesicles (doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2017.1341465). The enlarged vesicles marked by YFP-2xFYVE would not necessarily be due to the loss of UPS8. In any case, it appears relatively clear that USP8 localizes to early endosomes, and the authors claim that this localization is mediated by Rabex-5 (or Rabx-5). They finally propose that USP8 dissociates Rabx-5 from early endosomes facilitating endosome maturation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The weaknesses of this study are, on one side, that the results are almost exclusively dependent on the overexpression of fusion proteins. While useful in the field, this strategy does not represent the optimal way to dissect a cell biology issue. On the other side, the way the authors construct the rationale for each approximation is somehow difficult to follow. Finally, the use of two models, C. elegans and a mammalian cell line, which would strengthen the observations, contributes to the difficulty in reading the manuscript.</p>
<p>The findings are useful but do not clearly support the idea that USP8 mediates Rab5-Rab7 exchange and endosome maturation, In contrast, they appear to be incomplete and open new questions regarding the complexity of this process and the precise role of USP8 within it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank this reviewer for the insightful comments. Fluorescence-fused proteins serve as potent tools for visualizing subcellular organelles both in vivo and in live settings. Specifically, in epidermal cells of worms, the tissue-specific expression of these fused proteins is indispensable for studying organelle dynamics within living organisms. This approach is necessitated by the inherent limitations of endogenously tagged proteins, whose fluorescence signals are often weak and unsuitable for live imaging or genetic screening purposes. Acknowledging concerns raised by the reviewer regarding potential alterations in organelle morphology due to overexpression of certain fused proteins, we supplemented our approach with the utilization of endogenous markers. These markers, including Rab5, RAB-5, Rabex5, RABX-5, and EEA1 for early endosomes, as well as RAB-7, Mon1a, and Mon1b for late endosomes, were instrumental in our investigations (refer to Figure 3, Figure 6, Figure 5-figure supplement 1, Figure 5-figure supplement 2, and Figure 6-figure supplement 1). Our comprehensive analysis, employing various methodologies such as tissue-specific fused proteins, CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in, and antibody staining, consistently highlights the critical role of USP8 in early-to-late endosome conversion. Specifically, we discovered that the recruitment of USP-50/USP8 to early endosomes is depending on Rabex5. However, instead of stabilizing Rabex5, the recruitment of USP-50/USP8 leads to its dissociation from endosomes, concomitantly facilitating the recruitment of the Rab7 GEF SAND-1/Mon1. In cells with loss-of-function mutations in <italic>usp-50/usp8</italic>, we observed enhanced RABX-5/Rabex5 signaling and mis-localization of SAND-1/Mon1 proteins from endosomes. Consequently, this disruption impairs endolysosomal trafficking, resulting in the accumulation of enlarged vesicles containing various intraluminal contents and rudimentary lysosomal structures.</p>
<p>Through an unbiased genetic screen, verified by cultured mammalian cell studies, we observed that loss-of-function mutations in <italic>usp-50</italic>/<italic>usp8</italic> result in diminished lysosome/late endosomes. Electron microscopy (EM) analysis indicated that <italic>usp-50</italic> mutation leads to abnormally enlarged vesicles containing various intraluminal structures in worm epidermal cells. USP8 is known to regulate the endocytic trafficking and stability of numerous transmembrane proteins. Given that lysosomes receive and degrade materials generated by endocytic pathways, we hypothesized that the abnormally enlarged vesicular structures observed in <italic>usp-50</italic> or <italic>usp8</italic> mutant cells correspond to the enlarged vesicles coated by early endosome markers. Indeed, in the absence of <italic>usp8/usp-50</italic>, the endosomal Rab5 signal is enhanced, while early endosomes are significantly enlarged. Given that Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), Rabex5, is essential for Rab5 activation, we further investigated its dynamics. Additional analyses conducted in both worm hypodermal cells and cultured mammalian cells revealed an increase of endosomal Rabex5 in response to <italic>usp8/usp-50</italic> loss-of-function. Live imaging studies further demonstrated active recruitment of USP8 to newly formed Rab5-positive vesicles, aligning spatiotemporally with Rabex5 regulation. Through systematic exploration of putative USP-50 binding partners on early endosomes, we identified its interaction with Rabex5. Comprehensive genetics and biochemistry experiments demonstrated that USP8 acts through K323 site de-ubiquitination to dissociate Rabex5 from early endosomes and promotes the recruitment of the Rab7 GEF SAND-1/Mon1. In summary, our study began with an unbiased genetic screen and subsequent examination of established theories, leading to the formulation of our own hypothesis. Through multifaceted approaches, we unveiled a novel function of USP8 in early-to-late endosome conversion.</p>

<p>(1) Within Figures 1K-N, diverse anomalous structures were detected in the <italic>usp-50</italic> mutant. Further scrutiny is needed to definitively characterize these structures, particularly as the images in Figures 1M and 1L exhibit notable similarities to lamellar bodies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful question regarding the resemblance between the vesicles observed in our study and lamellar bodies (LBs). Lamellar bodies are specialized organelles involved in lipid storage and secretion1, prominently studied in keratinocytes of the skin and alveolar type II (ATII) epithelial cells in the lung2. These organelles contain not only lipids but also cell-type specific proteins and lytic enzymes. Due to their acidic pH and functional similarities, LBs are classified as lysosome-related organelles (LROs) or secretory lysosomes3,4. In <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants, we observed a considerable number of abnormal vesicles, some of which contain threadlike membrane structures and exhibit morphological similarities to LBs (Figure 2O). However, further analysis with a comprehensive panel of lysosome-related markers demonstrated a significant reduction in lysosomal structures within these mutants. In contrast, vesicles marked by early endosome markers, such as FYVE, RAB-5, RABX-5, and EEA1, were notably enlarged. These results suggest that the enlarged vesicles observed in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants are more likely aberrant early endosomes rather than true lamellar bodies. We have revised the manuscript to reflect these findings and to clearly differentiate between these structures and lysosome-related organelles.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The correlation between the presence of these abnormal structures and ESCRT-0 remains unaddressed, thus the assertion that UPS-50 regulates endolysosome trafficking in conjunction with ESCRT-0 lacks empirical support.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestions. We apologize for any confusion and appreciate the opportunity to clarify our findings. The ESCRT machinery is essential for driving endosomal membrane deformation and scission, which leads to the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) within multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Recent research has shown that the absence of ESCRT components results in a reduction of ILVs in worm gut cells5. In wild type animals, the ESCRT-0 components HGRS-1 and STAM-1 display a distinct punctate distribution (Figure 1G and H). However, in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants, the punctate signals of HGRS-1::GFP and STAM-1::GFP are significantly reduced (Figure 1G and H; and Figure 1-figure supplement 1B), indicating a role for USP-50 in stabilizing the ESCRT-0 complex. Our TEM analysis revealed an accumulation of abnormally enlarged vesicles containing intraluminal structures in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants. When we examined a panel of early endosome and late endosome/lysosome markers, we found that early endosomes are significantly enlarged, while late endosomal/lysosomal structures are markedly reduced in these mutants. This suggests that the abnormal structures observed in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants are likely enlarged early endosomes rather than classical MVBs. To further investigate whether the reduction in ESCRT components contributes to the late endosome/lysosome defects, we analyzed <italic>stam-1</italic> mutants. In these mutants, the size of RAB-7-coated vesicles was reduced (Author response image 1C), and the lysosomal marker LAAT-1 indicated a reduction in lysosomal structures (Author response image 1B). These results highlight the importance of the ESCRT complex in late endosome/lysosome formation. However, the morphology of early endosomes, as marked by 2xFYVE, remained similar to that of wild type in <italic>stam-1</italic> mutants (Author response image 1A). Therefore, while reduced ESCRT-0 components may contribute to the late endosome/lysosome defects observed in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants, the enlargement of early endosomes in these mutants may involve additional mechanisms. We have revised the manuscript to incorporate these insights and to address the reviewer's comments more comprehensively.</p>

<p>Good suggestions. We have conducted a double-labeling analysis to examine the distribution of RAB-5 and RAB-7 in conjunction with HGRS-1. In wild type animals, HGRS-1 exhibits a punctate distribution that is partially co-localized with both RAB-5 and RAB-7. In contrast, in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants, the punctate signal of HGRS-1 is significantly reduced, along with its co-localization with RAB-5 and RAB-7 (Author response image 2).

<p>(4) The authors observed enlarged early endosomes in cells depleted of <italic>usp-50</italic>/usp8, along with enlarged MVB-like structures identified through TEM. The potential identity of these structures as the same organelle could be determined using CLEM.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestion. Our TEM analysis identified a large number of abnormally enlarged vesicles with various intraluminal structures accumulated in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants. As the reviewer correctly noted, CLEM (correlative light and electron microscopy) would be an ideal approach to further characterize these structures. We have been attempting to implement CLEM in <italic>C. elegans</italic> for a few years. Given that CLEM relies on fluorescence markers, in this study we focused on two tagged proteins, RAB-5 and RABX-5, which show enlargement in their vesicles in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants. Unfortunately, we encountered significant challenges with this approach, as the GFP-tagged RAB-5 and RABX-5 signals did not survive the electron microscopy procedure. Attempts to align EM sections with residual GFP signaling yielded results that were not convincing. Consequently, we concentrated our analysis on a panel of molecular markers, including 2xFYVE, RAB-5, RABX-5, RAB-7, and LAAT-1. These markers consistently indicated that early endosomes are specifically enlarged in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants, while late endosomal/lysosomal structures are notably reduced. Thus, the abnormal structures identified in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants via TEM are likely to be enlarged early endosomes rather than the classical view of MVBs. We have revised the manuscript to reflect these findings and to clarify this point.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Good question. In the absence of <italic>usp-50/usp8</italic>, we indeed observed a noticeable increase in the signal of Rabex5 on endosomes. To determine whether <italic>usp-50/usp8</italic> affects the protein level of Rabex5, we investigated the endogenous levels of RABX-5 using the RABX-5::GFP knock-in line. Compared to wild-type controls, we found an elevated protein level of RABX-5::GFP in the knock-in line (Author response image 3).

<p>(2) It is interesting that &quot;The <italic>rabx-5(null)</italic> animals are healthy and fertile and do not display obvious morphological or behavioral defects.&quot;, which seems contrary to its role in regulating USP8 localization and endosome maturation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It has been previously documented that <italic>rabx-5</italic> functions redundantly with <italic>rme-6</italic>, another RAB-5 GEF in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, to regulate RAB-5 localization in oocytes6. RNA interference (RNAi) targeting <italic>rabx-5</italic> in a <italic>rme-6</italic> mutant background results in synthetic lethality, whereas neither <italic>rabx-5</italic> nor <italic>rme-6</italic> single mutants are essential for worm viability. RME-6 co-localizes with clathrin-coated pits, while Rabex-5 is localized to early endosomes. Rabex-5 forms a stable complex with Rabaptin-5 and is part of a large EEA1-positive complex on early endosomes, whereas RME-6 does not interact with Rabaptin-5 (RABN-5) or EEA-1. These findings suggest that while RME-6 and RABX-5 may function redundantly, they likely play distinct roles in regulating intracellular trafficking processes. In the absence of RABX-5, USP-50 appears to lose its endosomal localization, although the size of the early endosome remains comparable to that of wild type. This observation contrasts with the phenotype associated with USP-50 loss-of-function, in which the early endosome is notably enlarged. These results suggest that residual USP-50 present in the endosomes is sufficient to maintain its role in the endocytic pathway. Conversely, the complete absence of USP-50 likely disrupts the transition of early endosomes to late endosomes, indicating a crucial role of USP-50 in this conversion process. It is also noteworthy that, although loss-of-function of <italic>rabx-5</italic> does not result in obvious changes to early endosomes, increasing the gene expression level of <italic>rabx-5/Rabex-5</italic> alone is sufficient to cause enlargement of early endosomes (Author response image 4) . Indeed, we observed that loss-of-function mutations in u_sp-50/usp_8 lead to abnormally enlarged early endosomes, accompanied by an enhanced signal of endosomal RABX-5. When the <italic>rabx-5(null)</italic> mutation was introduced into <italic>usp-50</italic> mutant animals, the enlarged early endosome phenotype seen in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants was significantly suppressed (Figure 4H and I). This implies that maintaining a lower level of Rab5 GEF may be crucial for endolysosomal trafficking.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Does Rabx5 mutation has any impact on early endosomes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address the question, we utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 technique to create a molecular null for <italic>rabx</italic>-5 (Figure 4E). In the <italic>rabx-5(null)</italic> mutant animals, we found that the 2xFYVE-labeled early endosomes are indistinguishable from wild type (Figure 4H and 4I). Given that r_abx-5_ functions redundantly with <italic>rme-6</italic>, another RAB-5 GEF in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, it is likely that the regulation of early endosome size involves a cooperative interaction between RABX-5 and RME-6.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors observed a reduction of ESCRT-0 components in USP8 mutant cells, could this contribute to the late endosome/lysosome defects?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Good suggestion. In wild-type animals, the two ESCRT-0 components, HGRS-1 and STAM-1, exhibit a distinct punctate distribution (Figure 1G and H). However, in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants, the punctate signals of HGRS-1::GFP and STAM-1::GFP are significantly diminished (Figure 1G and H; and Figure 1-figure supplement 1B), which aligns with the role of USP-50 in stabilizing the ESCRT-0 complex. To investigate whether the reduction in ESCRT components might contribute to defects in late endosome/lysosome formation, we examined <italic>stam-1</italic> mutants. In <italic>stam-1</italic> mutants, we observed a reduction in the size of RAB-7-coated vesicles (Author response image 1). Further, when we introduced the lysosomal marker LAAT-1::GFP into <italic>stam-1</italic> mutants, we found a substantial decrease in lysosomal structures compared to wild-type animals (Author response image 1). This suggests that the ESCRT complex is essential for proper late endosome/lysosome formation. In contrast, the morphology of early endosomes, as indicated by the 2xFYVE marker, appeared normal in <italic>stam-1</italic> mutants, similar to wild-type animals (Author response image 1). This implies that while a reduction in ESCRT-0 components may contribute to the late endosome/lysosome defects observed in <italic>usp-50</italic> mutants, the early endosome enlargement phenotype in _usp-5_0 mutants may involve additional mechanisms.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Rabx5 is accumulated in USP8 mutant cells, I am very curious about the phenotype of USP8-Rabx5 double mutants. Could over-expression of Rabx5 (wild type or mutant forms) cause any defects?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Excellent suggestions. To address the question, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 technique to create a molecular null for <italic>rabx-5</italic> (Figure 4E). In the <italic>rabx-5(null)</italic> mutant animals, we observed that the punctate USP-50::GFP signal became diffusely distributed (Figure 4F and G). This suggests that <italic>rabx-5</italic> is necessary for the endosomal localization of USP-50. Interestingly, in <italic>rabx-5(null)</italic> mutant animals, the 2xFYVE-labeled early endosomes appeared similar to those in wild-type animals (Figure 4H and I). When <italic>rabx-5(null)</italic> was introduced into <italic>usp-50</italic> mutant animals, the enlarged early endosome phenotype observed in <italic>usp-50</italic> was significantly suppressed (Figure 4H and I). This finding indicates that <italic>usp-50</italic> indeed functions through <italic>rabx-5</italic> to regulate early endosome size. Additionally, we constructed strains overexpressing either wild-type or K323R mutant RABX-5. Our results showed that overexpression of wild-type RABX-5 led to early endosome enlargement (as indicated by YFP::2xFYVE labeling) (Author response image 4A, B and D). In contrast, overexpression of the K323R mutant RABX-5 did not result in noticeable early endosome enlargement (Author response image 4A, C and D). Together, these data are in consistent with our model that USP-50 may regulate RABX-5 by deubiquitinating the K323 site.</p>

<p>(6) Rabx5 could be ubiquitinated at K88 and K323, and Rabx5-K323R showed different activity when compared with the wild-type protein in USP8 mutant cells. Could the authors provide evidence that USP8 could remove the ubiquitin modification from K323 in Rabx5 protein?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's insightful suggestions. To explore the potential of USP-50 in removing ubiquitin modifications from lysine 323 on the RABX-5 protein, we undertook a series of experiments. Initially, we sought to determine whether USP-50 influences the ubiquitination level of RABX-5 <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, due to the low expression levels of USP-50, we encountered challenges in obtaining adequate amounts of USP-50 protein from worm lysates. To overcome this, we expressed USP-50::4xFLAG in HEK293 cells for subsequent affinity purification. Concurrently, we utilized anti-GFP agarose beads to purify RABX-5::GFP from worms expressing the <italic>rabx-5::gfp</italic> construct. We then incubated RABX-5::GFP with USP-50::4xFLAG for varying durations and performed immunoblotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody. As shown in Author response image 5A, our results revealed a decrease in the ubiquitination level of RABX-5 in the presence of USP-50, suggesting that USP-50 directly deubiquitinates RABX-5. Previous studies have indicated that only a minor fraction of recombinant RABX-5 undergoes ubiquitination in HeLa cells, which is believed to have functional significance7. Our findings are consistent with this observation, as only a small fraction of RABX-5 in worms is ubiquitinated. Rabex-5 is known to interact with both K63- and K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains. To further elucidate whether USP-50 specifically targets K48 or K63-linked ubiquitination at the K323 site of RABX-5, we incubated various HA-tagged ubiquitin mutants with either wild-type or K323R mutant RABX-5 protein. Our results indicated that the K323R mutation reduces K63-linked ubiquitination of RABX-5 (Author response image 5). This experiment was repeated multiple times with consistent results. Additionally, while overexpression of wild-type RABX-5 led to an enlargement of early endosomes, as evidenced by YFP::2xFYVE labeling, overexpression of the K323R mutant did not produce a noticeable effect on endosome size (Author response image 4). Collectively, this finding indicates that RABX-5 is subject to ubiquitin modification <italic>in vivo</italic> and that USP-50 plays a significant role in regulating this modification at the K323 site.</p>

<p>(7) The authors described &quot;the almost identical phenotype of usp-50/usp8 and sand-1/Mon1 mutants&quot;, found protein-protein interaction between USP8 and sand-1, and showed that sand1-GFP signal is diminished in USP8 mutant cells. These observations fit with the possibility that USP8 regulates the stability of sand-1 to promote endosomal maturation. Could this be tested and integrated into the current model?</p>

<p>are grateful for the insightful comments provided by the reviewer. Rab5, known to be activated by Rabex-5, plays a crucial role in the homotypic fusion of early endosomes. Rab5 effectors also include the Rab7 GEF SAND-1/Mon1âCcz1 complex. Rab7 activation by SAND-1/Mon1-Ccz1 complex is essential for the biogenesis and positioning of late endosomes (LEs) and lysosomes, and for the fusion of endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes. The Mon1-Ccz1 complex is able to interact with Rabex5, causing dissociation of Rabex5 from the membrane, which probably terminates the positive feedback loop of Rab5 activation and then promotes the recruitment and activation of Rab7 on endosomes. In our study, we identified an interaction between USP-50 and the Rab5 GEF, RABX-5. In the absence of USP-50, we observed an increased endosomal localization of RABX-5 and the formation of abnormally enlarged early endosomes. This phenotype is reminiscent of that seen in <italic>sand-1</italic> loss-of-function mutants, which also exhibit enlarged early endosomes and a concomitant reduction in late endosomes/lysosomes. Notably, USP-50 also interacts with SAND-1, suggesting a potential role in regulating its localization. We could propose several models to elucidate how USP-50 might influence SAND-1 localization, including:</p>
<p>(1) USP-50 may stabilize SAND-1 through direct de-ubiquitination.</p>
<p>(2) In the absence of USP-50, the sustained presence of RABX-5 could lead to continuous Rab5 activation, which might hinder or delay the recruitment of SAND-1.</p>
<p>(3) USP-50 could facilitate SAND-1 recruitment by promoting the dissociation of RABX-5.</p>
<p>We are actively investigating these models in our laboratory. Due to space constraints, a more detailed exploration of how USP-50 regulates SAND-1 stability will be presented in a separate publication.</p>
