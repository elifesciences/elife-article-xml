<title>Abstract</title><p>Regenerative medicine relies on deep understanding of the mechanisms of organ repair and regeneration. The liver, an organ with critical metabolic functions carried out by hepatocytes located in zones 1-3 of liver lobules, has the capacity to fully regenerate itself, which is mainly attributable to midzone hepatocytes. Yet, how differentiated midzone hepatocytes execute transzone regeneration and quickly recover most of the liver mass remains a myth. Here, we uncover a mesenchymal-hepatocyte population (13.7% of total hepatocytes) that are derived from Twist2-lineage EpCAM<sup>+</sup> progenitors, midzone-located, highly polyploidy, and equipped with great mitogenic and migratory capabilities to the detriment of metabolism. They regenerate about 50% of new hepatocytes and repopulate zones 1 and 3 in liver regeneration. Mechanistically, expansion of these cells is negatively controlled by Notch1 signaling. This study has thus uncovered a hepatocyte subpopulation with great proliferation potential and important mechanisms of liver regeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hepatocytes originate from bipotential hepatoblast progenitor cells during embryonic development under the control of signaling molecules including Wnt, Notch, HGF, and BMP(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pepe-Mooney et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Russell &amp; Monga, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Segal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Siebel &amp; Lendahl, 2017</xref>). They undergo zonation along the porto-central axis of the liver lobules, with different zones executing distinct metabolic functions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aizarani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Halpern et al., 2017</xref>). For example, zone 1 (periportal) hepatocytes carry out mainly β-oxidation and gluconeogenesis; zone 3 (pericentral) hepatocytes carry out mainly glycolysis, lipogenesis, and drug detoxification; and zone 2 (midzone) hepatocytes show mixed activities(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ben-Moshe et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The liver is constantly exposed to viruses, bacteria, alcohol, and toxic agents brought in by nutrient-carrying blood from the gastrointestinal tracts, which damage the liver and increase the risk of hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Banales et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ramachandran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Romeo, 2019</xref>). In spite of slow hepatocyte turnover, mammalian livers have enormous regeneration capacities, for example, human liver can be fully regenerated within 4 months after 3/4 of the liver is removed(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bangru &amp; Kalsotra, 2020</xref>). While stem/progenitor cells marked by Axin, Sox9, or Tert or generated from dedifferentiation of hepatocytes or cholangiocytes were initially suggested to drive liver homeostasis and regeneration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Font-Burgada et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Miyajima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Raven et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sato et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), later studies showed that all hepatocytes undergo hypertrophic growth and hyperplasia, generating regenerative patches that help repair the liver stochastically and locally(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Matsumoto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). If all the hepatocytes are participating, they would need to divide only 2 times to recover the full liver mass in partial (2/3) hepatectomy (PHx) mouse models(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Monga, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>However, recent genetic studies show that liver homeostasis and regeneration are mainly executed by midzone hepatocytes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">He et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wei et al., 2021</xref>). Most of the liver injuries occur to zone 1 or 3 and it is likely that zone 2 hepatocytes are protected from the damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andersson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Forbes &amp; Newsome, 2016</xref>). However, to accomplish the regeneration task, midzone hepatocytes need not only to undergo massive expansion but also to repopulate zones 1 and 3. This presents a challenge as hepatocytes, the differentiated epithelial cells, in general have limited proliferation and migration capacities.</p>
<p>The liver also contains hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and fibroblasts (designated mesenchymal cells (MCs) here)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lua et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ramachandran et al., 2019</xref>), whose main function is secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, our lineage tracing experiments using 5 Cre lines driven by mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) markers identified a mesenchymal-hepatocyte hybrid population (13.7% of total hepatocytes) that express signature genes of both lineages. They appear to be derived from Twist2-expressing hepatomesenchyme of early embryos and are mainly located in the midzone and highly polyploidy and display great proliferative and migratory abilities at the sacrifice of metabolism. During liver regeneration, these cells display proliferation rate 2-3 times greater than conventional hepatocytes and replenish zones 1 and 3, accompanied by conversion from polyploids to diploids. Overall, this small population of cells could regenerate about 50% of the new hepatocytes. Our gene ablation and pharmacological studies also elucidated an important mechanism by which expansion of these hybrid cells is controlled. Collectively, these findings identify a midzone-located mesenchymal-hepatocyte population as a major driving force of liver regeneration.</p>

<title>Mesenchymal marker Twist2 labels a hepatocyte subpopulation</title>
<p>To understand the ontology of liver mesenchymal cells (MCs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lua et al., 2014</xref>), we crossed several Cre mouse lines, which are used to study bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs), to <italic>Rosa-tdTomato</italic> reporter mice to fate map these lineages in the liver. We found that Col1α2, αSMA. Gli1, and Vimentin marked MCs, while surprisingly, Twist2 marked both MCs and a small portion of hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Twist2 is a helix-loop-helix transcription factor and <italic>Twist2-Cre</italic> mice are widely used to study skeletal development(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Yu et al., 2003</xref>). Immunostaining showed that liver Tomato<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>Tomato<sup>Twist2</sup></italic> mice were negative for CD31 (a blood vessel marker), CD45 (a Kupffer cell marker), and K19 (a bile duct cell marker) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). However, Tomato<sup>+</sup> cells with hepatocyte morphology expressed hepatocyte marker Hnf4α; and 99% of Tomato<sup>+</sup> non-hepatocyte cells expressed mesenchymal marker Vimentin and 26% expressed PDGFRα (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). On average, 36.4% of the liver MCs were Tomato<sup>+</sup> in <italic>Tomato<sup>Twist2</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). These results suggest that Twist2 genetically marks subpopulations of hepatocytes and MCs in mouse liver.</p>

<title>Ablation of one <italic>Twist2</italic> allele in <italic>Twist2-Cre</italic> mice does not affect liver development or regeneration</title>
<p>In <italic>Twist2-Cre</italic> mice, one allele of <italic>Twist2</italic> is disrupted due to insertion of the <italic>Cre</italic> cassette into the coding region(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Yu et al., 2003</xref>). However, <italic>Twist2-Cre</italic> mice showed a normal liver weight-to-body weight (LW/BW) ratio and liver structure (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B,C</xref>).

Moreover, the mice showed normal regeneration processes upon CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver injury or partial (2/3) hepatectomy (PHx) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1E</xref>). Although Twist2 has been shown to promote or inhibit cell proliferation in different contexts(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), we show here that deletion of one allele of <italic>Twist2</italic> does not affect liver development, growth, or regeneration, suggesting that the <italic>Twist2-Cre</italic> mouse line can be safely used to study liver development or regeneration.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Twist2-lineage hepatocytes are derived from EpCAM<sup>+</sup> progenitors postnatally</title>
<p>Analysis of <italic>Tomato<sup>Twist2</sup></italic> mice of various ages revealed that Twist2 mainly marked non-hepatocyte cells in the liver at postnatal day 1 (P1) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), while Tomato<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes started to emerge at P7, peaked at P60, but did not significantly expand further in adult mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and later results). The average of Tomato<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes, based on 10 adult mice, was 13.7%.</p>
<p>To further understand the Twist2-lineage cells, we performed scRNA-seq analysis of Tomato<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from the livers of P1 or P14 <italic>Tomato<sup>Twist2</sup></italic> mice. We sequenced 10000 cells at a depth of 2500 genes per cell in each sample. t-SNE analyses revealed 3 major Tomato<sup>+</sup> subgroups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref>): hepatocytes, MCs, and EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells. The EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells could be further classified into EpCAM<sup>high</sup>, EpCAM<sup>med</sup>, and EpCAM<sup>low</sup> subpopulations, which showed similar gene expression profiles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, a population of Tomato<sup>+</sup> cells expressing proerythroblast genes was detected in P1 but not P14 mice (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A-C</xref>), which might represent transit cells in fetal/neonatal livers and were not further analyzed. In addition, the EpCAM<sup>med</sup> and EpCAM<sup>low</sup> subgroups were not observed in P14 mice, which only contained the EpCAM<sup>high</sup> subgroup (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Surprisingly, Twist2 is only expressed in some MCs but not in the EpCAM<sup>+</sup> subgroups in P1 or P14 mice (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref>), suggesting that EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells are derived from Twist2-expressing cells during early development, which have lost <italic>Twist2</italic> expression later.</p>

<p>While in P1 pups, few of Tomato<sup>+</sup> cells were hepatocytes, approximately 40% of the Tomato<sup>+</sup> cells were hepatocytes in P14 mice (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>). Trajectory analysis revealed that cells in the EpCAM<sup>med</sup> subgroup might first convert to EpCAM<sup>high</sup> cells and then to hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Comparison of lineage signature gene expression revealed that EpCAM<sup>med</sup> and EpCAM<sup>low</sup> cells also expressed mesenchymal markers but not immune or endothelial cell markers (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2E-G</xref>). Moreover, EpCAM<sup>low</sup> cells showed a gene expression pattern close to MCs, compared to EpCAM<sup>high</sup> or EpCAM<sup>med</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2G</xref>). These findings suggest that EpCAM<sup>low</sup> progenitor cells give rise to hepatocytes and MCs.</p>
<p>Gene ontology (GO) analysis confirmed that Twist2 lineage hepatocytes were enriched in metabolism genes whereas MCs were enriched in ECM genes (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A, B</xref>). Interestingly, EpCAM<sup>med</sup> cells showed enriched expression of genes related to proliferation and macromolecule synthesis, EpCAM<sup>high</sup> cells were enriched in genes related to proliferation and epithelial development, and EpCAM<sup>low</sup> cells expressed some ECM genes (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3C-E</xref>), consistent with the trajectory analysis results that the EpCAM<sup>med</sup> subgroup might first convert to EpCAM<sup>high</sup> cells and then to hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>

<title>Detection of Twist2-expressing progenitors in E10.5 liver</title>
<p>Our scRNA-seq data suggest that <italic>Twist2</italic> is expressed in MCs but not EpCAM<sup>+</sup> progenitors in P1 or P14 livers (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref>). Analysis of scRNA-seq data from public datasets (GSE125688 and GSE137720)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dobie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pepe-Mooney et al., 2019</xref>) also revealed that Twist2 is expressed in a small population of MCs but not hepatocytes (clustered based on <italic>Albumin</italic> expression levels) in adult mice and that Twist2 expression is not altered during liver regeneration (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A,B</xref>). These results suggest there might exist a Twist2-expressing progenitors in early embryonic liver, which give rise to EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells in newborn mice and then Twist2 lineage hepatocytes in adult mice.</p>
<p>Indeed, a recent scRNA-seq study has uncovered a <italic>Twist2-</italic>expressing hybrid hepatomesenchymal cell type at E10.5(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lotto et al., 2020</xref>), whose daughter cells and function have not been investigated. We re-analyzed the scRNA-seq data and found that 8.62% of hepatocytes expressed Twist2, a portion of which also expressed EpCAM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). GO analyses revealed that the <italic>Twist2-</italic>expressing hepatomesenchymal cells expressed both stromal and hepatocyte signature genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, H).</p>
<p>To confirm the above finding, we immunostained liver sections of <italic>Tomato<sup>Twist2</sup></italic>mice of various ages for Twist2 expression. Although Twist2 is a transcription factor, it is also detected in the cytoplasm(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). We found that Twist2 was detectable in Tomato<sup>+</sup> MCs but not Tomato<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes in P14 or P90 mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>), consistent with scRNA-seq results. However, in E10.5 embryos, some of the Hnf4α<sup>+</sup> cells were positive for Twist2 in the liver anlage region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). Both the scRNA-seq and immunostaining data suggest that Twist2 lineage hepatocytes are derived from Twist2<sup>+</sup> progenitors during early embryonic development via Twist2<sup>-</sup>EpCAM<sup>+</sup> intermediates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>).</p>

<title>Midzone location and polyploidy of Twist2-lineage hepatocytes</title>
<p>Most Tomato<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes were located in the midzone, with some at the periportal region but few at the pericentral region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).

<p>To exclude the possibility that disruption of one allele of <italic>Twist2</italic> in <italic>Twist2-Cre</italic> mice affects hepatocytes in the midzone, we analyzed midzone hepatocytes using an established marker, Cyclin D1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wei et al., 2021</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The liver is the only organ that can be fully regenerated in mouse and human. Rapid recovery 2/3 of the mouse liver mass requires not only massive expansion of remaining hepatocytes but also cell migration and structure rebuilding. Although adult stem cells play critical roles in regeneration of many tissues including the gut, skin, and skeletal muscles, cumulative evidence suggests that the differentiated hepatocytes, especially midzone hepatocytes, play a dominant role in liver regeneration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andersson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Monga, 2020</xref>). However, these cells are terminally differentiated epithelial cells and in general have limited proliferation and migratory potentials. So how liver is rapidly regenerated remains not fully resolved.</p>
<p>Our current study uncovered a small mesenchymal-hepatocyte hybrid population, which possess the features required for rapid liver regeneration. These cells are likely derived from Twist2-expressing cells in embryonic livers via the intermediate EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells in p7 and P14 pups(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lotto et al., 2020</xref>). scRNA-seq analysis suggest that such hepatocytes exist in adult mice. Certainly, the ontology of this lineage warrants further investigation. The Twist2 lineage hepatocytes express higher levels of mesenchymal-related genes and lower levels of metabolic genes compared to conventional hepatocytes, are mainly located in the midzone, highly polyploidy, and display increased proliferation and migration capacities. A recent study also uncover these features for midzone hepatocytes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). During liver regeneration, these cells showed 2-3 times greater proliferation capacity than conventional hepatocytes and the percentages of these cells almost tripled after repair. Moreover, they replenished not only the midzone but also zones 1 and 3. Overall, these findings suggest that the mesenchymal-hepatocytes represent an important regenerative force and form about half of the new liver mass (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>).</p>
<p>The mesenchymal-hepatocytes appear to play a role in liver growth but not much in liver homeostasis. During postnatal liver growth, these cells undergo proliferation at a rate greater than that of conventional hepatocytes. Moreover, deletion of <italic>Notch1</italic> in these cells led to expansion of the mesenchymal-hepatocytes by 3 folds, which repopulate zone 1 and 3, accompanied by an increase in the LW/BW ratio, suggesting that these cells participate in liver postnatal growth, which is under the control of Notch1 signaling. However, in adult mice, the size of the mesenchymal-hepatocyte population did not change up to 20 months of age. Despite that, we observed a modest loss of polyploid hepatocytes, suggesting that they may undergo slow turnover.</p>
<p>An intriguing finding is that most of the highly mitogenic and migratory mesenchymal-hepatocytes are polyploidy and moreover, they show a conversion from polyploid to diploid with age or during regeneration, which may contribute to rapid expansion of Twist2-lineage hepatocytes as polyploid cells do not need to duplicate the genome before division, consistent with previous studies showing that polyploid hepatocytes turn into diploids during regeneration and they undergo little DNA synthesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Duncan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wilkinson et al., 2019</xref>). Certainly, the function of diploid conversion warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>Although our findings confirm the important role played by midzone hepatocytes in liver regeneration, they also suggest that not all hepatocytes are equal in the midzone. Hamp2 is specifically expressed in some midzone hepatocyte. Twist2-lineage hepatocytes do not express Hamp2 and differ from Hamp2<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes, as the latter undergoes constant turnover in adult mice and expands much less during regeneration (from 10% to 13% in the CCl<sub>4</sub> injury model and from 10 to 17.5% in the diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine-induced model)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wei et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, our study of the PHx model suggests that conventional hepatocytes also participate in liver regeneration, although at a slow pace, consistent with previous findings(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Monga, 2020</xref>). Cooperation of mesenchymal-hepatocytes and conventional hepatocytes are thus needed for rapid liver regeneration.</p>
<p>We also show that Notch1 activation is increased in Twist2-lineage hepatocytes compared to conventional hepatocytes and that this activation is suppressed during liver regeneration. Deletion of <italic>Nocth1</italic> led to the expansion of these hepatocytes into zones 1 and 3 and an increase in the liver weight-to-body weight ratio. This is in contrast to mice in which <italic>Nocth1</italic> was ablated from Alb<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes, which did not develop obvious liver phenotypes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Geisler et al., 2008</xref>). This can be explained by late and weak <italic>Alb</italic> expression in Twist2-lineage hepatocytes, restriction of the function of Notch1 to progenitor cells, and/or weak Notch1 activation in conventional hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Our pharmacological studies suggest that Nocth1 may negatively regulates the expression of <italic>Vegfa</italic> and <italic>Vegfb</italic> in Twist2-lineage cells, which promote cell proliferation via VEGFR-mTOR signaling in autocrine and/or paracrine manners.</p>
<p>One complication in using knock-in Cre or CreERT mice is that ablation one allele of the marker gene may affect the behavior of the labelled cells. Here we show that ablation one Twist2 allele did not affect liver development, growth, or regeneration, nor does it affect the midzone hepatocytes. Moreover, we show that expression of Twist2 or MET related genes is not affected during liver regeneration, and that deletion of one <italic>Twist2</italic> allele does not affect the expression of MET genes. These results indicate that it is safe to use the <italic>Twist2-Cre</italic> to study liver development and regeneration.</p>
<p>In summary, the findings of this study suggest that in response to injury-induced cues, midzone-located mesenchymal-hepatocytes undergo great expansion and migration and regenerate zones 1 and 3, which form half of the new liver mass. Moreover, the highly regenerative and mesenchymal nature of this hepatocyte subpopulation implies that they may constitute a cell basis for liver cancer, fat liver, and liver cirrhosis, thus opening up a new direction in the study of liver diseases.</p>

<p>For the CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver injury model, mice were intraperitoneally injected with CCl<sub>4</sub> (diluted 1:4 in corn oil) at a final volume of 5 ml/kg body weight. For the PHx liver injury model, 2/3 PHx injury was performed according to established protocols. Briefly, mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of 40 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital and transferred onto an electric blanket. Following removal of the abdominal fur and skin disinfection with iodine, a midline abdominal skin and muscle incision was made to expose the liver. The base of the left lateral lobe and the median lobe were ligated with a 4-0 silk thread, and the lobes were resected just above the knots. The peritoneum and skin were then closed with 6-0 sutures, and the mice were supplied with pure oxygen for 4-5 minutes until they achieved normal breathing. Then, the mice were placed in individual cages under a warming lamp for recovery. The right and caudate lobes were used for analysis.</p>

<title>Liver cell isolation</title>
<p>Primary mouse cells (including parenchymal and mesenchymal cells) were isolated by the two-step liver perfusion method with modifications. Briefly, mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of 40 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital. The abdomen was then cut open to expose the liver, inferior vena cava and portal vein. The portal vein was cut, and the liver was first perfused with 1x PBS (containing 0.5 mM EDTA) for 5 minutes and then perfused with digestion buffer containing collagenase type IV (Sigma) and DNase I for 7-10 minutes. The livers were then clipped, removed and transferred to a Petri dish filled with 1x PBS at 4°C. The liver tissues were gently torn to help the hepatocytes dissociate, and the cell suspension was filtered through a 70-μm cell filter (BD Falcon), followed by centrifugation at 4°C and 50 x g and 500 x g for hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells, respectively. We then resuspended the cells in 50% and 25% Percoll mixtures and centrifuged them at 300 x g for 20 min at 4°C. Purified hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells were collected for ploidy analysis or washed with PBS and resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS for cell culture.</p>

<title>Bulk RNA sequencing analysis</title>
<p>DNase I was used to digest double-stranded and single-stranded DNA in total RNA, and magnetic beads were then used to recover the reaction products. RNase H or the Ribo-Zero method (human, mouse, plants) (Illumina, USA) was used to remove rRNA. Purified mRNA from previous steps was fragmented into small pieces with fragment buffer at the appropriate temperature. Then, first-strand cDNA was generated in the First Strand Reaction System by PCR, and second-strand cDNA was generated as well. The reaction product was purified by magnetic beads, after which A-tailing mix and RNA index adapters were added to carry out end repair. The cDNA fragments with adapters were amplified by PCR, and the products were purified with Ampure XP beads. The library was validated on an Agilent Technologies 2100 bioanalyzer for quality control. The double-stranded PCR products were then heat-denatured and circularized by the splint oligo sequence. Single stranded circular DNA (ssCir DNA) was formatted as the final library. The final library was amplified with phi29 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) to prepare DNA nanoballs (DNBs) containing more than 300 copies of one molecule. The DNBs were loaded into the patterned nanoarray, and single-end 50-base reads were generated on the BGISEQ-500 platform (BGI-Shenzhen, China).</p>

<p>Raw reads were demultiplexed and mapped to the mouse reference genome with the Cell Ranger version 3.0.1 (10X Genomics) pipeline using the default parameters. The generated gene-cell expression matrix was used for subsequent analysis in R version 3.6.1 using Seurat version 3.1.5(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Butler et al., 2018</xref>). “Cells” with any of the following criteria were excluded: &lt;500 expressed genes; &gt;25% unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) mapped to mitochondria; or nUMI &gt;99% events, with the number of UMIs (nUMI) used to exclude doublet cells. Clusters with very few cells were filtered before downstream analysis. Filtered cells from P1 and P14 samples were merged using the “merge” function in Seurat, and the merged data were used for downstream graph-based clustering and t-SNE visualization. DEGs in each cluster were identified with the function “FindAllMarkers” in Seurat. The “DoHeatmap” function in Seurat was used to obtain heatmap figures. The “FeaturePlot” and “VlnPlot” functions in Seurat were used to visualize specific gene expression.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This valuable study by Gui Yu and colleagues aims to investigate the function of a subtype of hepatocyte, which expressed Twist2 at some point in its lineage. First, using reporter mice, they show that hepatocytes can be labelled using Twist2-cre mice. Importantly, Twist2-cre also labels liver mesenchymal cells. Using scRNA seq of P1 and P14 Twist2-Cre tomato-labelled cells, they identify both mesenchymal cells and hepatocytes, and (using trajectory analyses) propose that Twist-traced hepatocytes and mesenchymal cells are derived from Epcam+ progenitors. The authors propose that the Twist2-traced hepatocytes occupy the midzone, and are polyploid. Using partial hepatectomy and Ccl4 as models for regeneration, the authors show that, after insult, there is an increase in Twist2-Tomato+ cells, which are more proliferative. Next, the authors propose that Notch signaling is suppressed during regeneration (based on the downregulation of HES1 protein in midzone hepatocytes during regeneration). They therefore knock out Notch1 in Twist2-expressing cells and show that this leads to hepatocyte proliferation (but fewer liver lobes) in homeostatic conditions. Finally, the authors also interfere with mTor and VEGF signaling and show that both interventions suppresses the excess hepatocyte proliferation in Twist2-conditional Notch1-knockout mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the data show that Twist2 is expressed at some point during hepatocyte development or homeostasis, and that Notch1 in hepatocytes or mesenchymal cells plays a role in limiting homeostatic hepatocyte proliferation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study relies heavily on the use of Twist2-Cre mice, which labels both mesenchymal cells and hepatocytes. Several experiments on hepatocytes (such as scRNA seq or bulk RNA seq) could be confounded by doublets or contamination with mesenchymal cells.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>There are two potential contributions made by this study, both of which are not fully supported by the data presented. First, that Twist-positive hepatocytes in the midlobular zone are derived from Twist2-expressing cells in embryonic livers via intermediate EpCAM-expressing cells. Second, that there is a population of hepatocytes with mesenchymal features that drive regeneration after various injuries. The concept that mid-lobular hepatocytes are more regenerative in adult injury settings has already been established and this paper further supports that body of knowledge.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>There are copious scRNA-seq data that are supportive of the claims, but these analyses were not definitive.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. There is not sufficient evidence to support the following assertion: &quot;markers identified a mesenchymal-hepatocyte hybrid population (13.7% of total hepatocytes) that express signature genes of both lineages.&quot; Twist-Cre reporter mice mark hepatocytes and mesenchymal populations, but it is not clear whether or not this means that the hepatocyte population labeled by Twist is mesenchymal. It is very possible for hepatocytes to express mesenchymal genes without being a true hybrid population. There is not much evidence that zone 2 cells are a mix of hepatocyte and mesenchymal. The idea of a hybrid population needs to be defined. The definition probably needs to involve the concept that hybrid cells must have morphologic or functional features of mesenchymal cells, rather than just expressing some genes from each cell type.</p>
<p>Related to this, the authors claim that co-expression of Twist and EpCAM in E10.5 liver cells might support the existence of a hepatomesenchymal cell type. This is possible, but one should note that adult hepatocytes can express EpCAM, especially during ductular reactions, so it is not necessarily a mesenchymal marker per se.</p>
<p>2. The authors assert several times that Twist-Cre mice appear to have no effect on overall liver regeneration phenotypes. They use this to suggest a lack of an effect for heterozygous deletion of Twist by the Cre allele. It is still possible for these mice to have altered lineage tracing results. It is very difficult to rule this out. For example, Axin2-CreER mice did not have any overt liver function or regeneration phenotypes, but the lineage tracing results from these mice differed from other CreER mice.</p>
<p>3. The central problem with this study is that the authors use a Cre strain and not a CreER strain. With a Cre strain, there could be new labeling of Twist-positive cells at multiple later time points. Thus, it is very difficult to assert that the Tomato-positive population at later time points are really descendants of the originally labeled population. It is very difficult to interpret the results of Cre-based lineage tracing experiments.</p>
<p>With this technical limitation in mind, I do not think that there is enough evidence to support the assertion made on page 6: &quot;These findings suggest that EpCAMlow progenitor cells give rise to hepatocytes and MCs.&quot; The authors use scRNA-seq trajectory analysis to come to the conclusion that mesenchymal cells give rise to hepatocytes between p1 and p14. Much more evidence is needed before the authors can arrive at this conclusion. It is much more likely that midlobular hepatocytes arise from other hepatocytes. To support their arguments, the authors would have to use a CreER line that exclusively labels mesenchymal cells in the liver, then lineage traces them until p14 to determine if they become hepatocytes. Without such an experiment, I do not think the current experiments are interpretable.</p>
<p>4. The injury experiments are again limited in their interpretability because they do not use CreER. It is very possible that Twist is turned on after CCl4 or surgical injury, and thus new hepatocytes might activate Tomato. It is unclear if previously Tomato-positive midzone hepatocytes were proliferating to increase the Tomato positive population. The authors use expression-based studies to argue against ectopic activation of Twist, but it is very difficult to exclude Cre activation using these types of studies.</p>
