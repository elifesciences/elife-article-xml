<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Understanding how a single genome creates distinct phenotypes remains a fundamental challenge for biologists. Social insects provide a striking example of polyphenism, with queen and worker castes exhibiting morphological, behavioural, and reproductive differences. Here we show that trophic eggs, which do not contain an embryo and are primarily regarded as a source of food, play a role in the process of caste determination in the harvester ant <italic>Pogonomyrmex rugosus</italic>. When first instar larvae were given access to trophic eggs, they mostly developed into workers. By contrast, larvae without access to trophic eggs developed into queens. We found that trophic eggs differ in many ways from viable eggs, including texture, morphology and their contents of protein, triglycerides, glycogen, sugar and small RNAs. Moreover, comparison of miRNA fragment size distributions suggests differences in the composition of miRNAs between the two egg types. This is the first demonstration of trophic eggs playing a role in caste determination in social insects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many species of insects, spiders, amphibians, marine invertebrates and sharks produce trophic eggs, a special type of eggs that do not contain an embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Levin and Bridges 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Blake and Arnofsky 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Collin 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kudo and Nakahira 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Perry and Roitberg 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Strathmann and Strathmann 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gibson et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">López-Ortega and Williams 2018</xref>). It is generally assumed that these non-developing eggs are either a by-product of failed reproduction or that they serve as nutrition for offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Perry and Roitberg 2006</xref>). However, the suggestion that trophic eggs solely provide a nutritional function is based on surprisingly little evidence. We here report a direct function of trophic eggs in the determination of alternative phenotypes in ants.</p>
<p>Trophic eggs have been reported in many ant species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary Table 1) and are generally thought to mostly or only serve as food for offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Crespi 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hölldobler and Wilson 1990</xref>). Trophic eggs play an important role during the time of colony founding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hölldobler and Wilson 1990</xref>). Because in most ant species queens do not forage after the mating flight, they metabolize the alary muscles and fat bodies and convert them into eggs, which serve as food to rear the first batch of larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Huber 1905</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Keller and Passera 1989</xref>). Except for a few species such as <italic>Crematogaster smithi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Heinze et al. 1995</xref>) and <italic>Acanthomyrmex ferox</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gobin and Ito 2000</xref>), the queens generally stop producing trophic eggs after the eclosion of the first workers (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). So far the absence of trophic eggs has been reported in only one species (Supplementary Table 1).</p>

<p>The number of species with documented trophic egg production by queens, workers or both castes is indicated for each subfamily. The question mark indicates that it is unclear whether trophic eggs can be produced by queens (in <italic>Lasius niger</italic> trophic eggs are produced by workers and possibly queens, see supplementary Table 1). Details on the species and related references can be found in Supplementary Table 1.</p></caption>

<p>In many ant species, workers are capable of producing haploid males but lack a spermatheca and the ability to produce diploid female offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hölldobler and Wilson 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bourke 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hammond and Keller 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Wenseleers and Ratnieks 2006</xref>). In some species, workers further lay trophic eggs (see supplementary Table 1). These eggs have a trophic function, in particular in genera such as <italic>Pogonomyrmex</italic> where there is no or only little trophallaxis (regurgitative food sharing) among workers. In such species it is has been suggested that trophic eggs may play an important role in food distribution within the colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gobin and Ito 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies suggested that the presence of trophic eggs may affect the developmental trajectory of larvae. A study in the Argentine ant <italic>Linepithema humile</italic> showed that the presence of queens in colonies was associated with a drastic decrease in the number of worker-laid trophic eggs as well as a decrease in the proportion of larvae developing into queens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bartels 1988</xref>). Bartels thus proposed that trophic eggs may increase the probability of larvae to develop into queens, which are much larger than workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bartels 1988</xref>). In some lineages of <italic>Pogonomyrmex barbatus</italic>, queens laid a higher proportion of trophic eggs upon the experimental increase of maternal juvenile hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Helms Cahan et al. 2011</xref>). Because the treatment also strongly reduced the number of workers produced but triggered a 50% increase in worker body size, trophic eggs were suggested to affect worker size. An increase in the proportion of trophic eggs has also been suggested to be associated with an increase in the proportion of larvae developing into queens (<italic>L. humile</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bartels 1988</xref>; <italic>P. barbatus</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Helms Cahan et al. 2011</xref>). Finally, because they observed an increase in nitrogen content with increasing female caste size in the ant <italic>Pogonomyrmex badius</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Smith and Suarez (2010)</xref> suggested that the larger castes may consume more trophic (nutritional) eggs than the smaller caste which would feed more on foraged insects. In summary, in at least three species of ants, trophic eggs may play a role in the developmental trajectories of female larvae.</p>
<p>While conducting egg cross fostering experiments in the ant <italic>P. rugosus</italic> to study worker size variation, we observed a sudden increase in the frequency of females developing into queens. During these experiments, we discarded trophic eggs and only cross fostered eggs that would eventually hatch (hereafter viable eggs). This raises the possibility that the absence of trophic eggs influenced the process of caste determination. These observations prompted us to investigate whether trophic eggs play a role in caste determination in <italic>P. rugosus</italic>. Our experiments revealed that the presence of trophic eggs reduces the probability that female larvae develop into reproductive individuals. Metabolomic analyses also revealed profound differences between viable and trophic eggs, including in the composition of miRNAs and content of protein, triglycerides, glycogen, and sugar.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>Some populations of <italic>Pogonomyrmex rugosus</italic> are characterized by a genetic caste determination system whereby development into queens or workers is determined by whether the eggs are fertilized by males of the same genetic lineage or a different genetic lineage than the queen producing the eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Helms Cahan et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Julian et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Volny and Gordon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Helms Cahan and Keller 2003</xref>). We collected queens from two populations (Bowie and Florence, Arizona, USA) known to harbor only colonies with non-genetic caste determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schwander et al. 2007</xref>). The queens were collected after mating flights in 2008 (Bowie) and 2023 (Bowie and Florence) to initiate colonies in the laboratory. The colonies were maintained in plastic boxes containing water tubes (glass tubes filled with water and sealed with a cotton plug) at 28°C and 60% humidity, with a 12-h/12-h light:dark cycle. They were fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> once a week with grass seeds, flies and 20% honey water. Eggs were collected in October 2020 for the experiment investigating the effect of trophic eggs on larval caste fate, in November 2021 for estimating the percentage of trophic eggs and from February to December 2021 for the egg content analyses.</p>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed with Rstudio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">RStudio Team 2015</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Trophic and viable egg production</title>
<p>To verify that workers do not lay trophic eggs, as previously shown for other <italic>Pogonomyrmex</italic> species (Supplementary Table 1), we created 12 queenless colonies (by removing the queen) and waited approximately three weeks until workers started laying eggs. From each of these colonies, we isolated two groups of five workers for 12 hours every two days for two weeks in November 2020 to obtain eggs. Collected eggs were then placed for 10 days in a petri dish containing a water reservoir to study their development and distinguish whether they were trophic or viable.</p>
<p>To determine whether queens laid variable percentages of trophic eggs over time, we isolated each of 43 <italic>P. rugosus</italic> queens for 8 hours every day for 2 weeks, before and after hibernation, and counted the number of trophic and viable eggs laid (see results for how to discriminate the two types of eggs). We hibernated the queens because we previously showed that hibernation is important to trigger the production of gynes in <italic>P. rugosus</italic> colonies in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Schwander et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Libbrecht et al. 2013</xref>). Hibernation conditions were as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Libbrecht et al. (2013)</xref>. The percentage of trophic eggs was compared using a linear mixed effect model with before vs after hibernation as the explanatory variable and colony as a random factor.</p>
<p>To assess whether viable and trophic eggs were laid in a random order, or whether eggs of a given type were laid in clusters, we isolated 11 queens for 10 hours, eight times over three weeks, and collected every hour the eggs laid. To determine whether viable and trophic eggs were laid in a random order, we performed a Wald–Wolfowitz runs test for each queen’s egg laying sequence (package <italic>snpar</italic> v.1.0; this non-parametric test calculates the likelihood that a binomial data sequence is random).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Trophic egg influence on the larval caste fate</title>
<p>To determine whether trophic eggs influence the process of caste determination, we compared the development of freshly hatched (first instar) larvae placed in small recipient colonies with and without trophic eggs. From each of 22 donor colonies, we obtained approximately 30 freshly hatched larvae by isolating the queens for 16 hours (from 2pm to 6am) every day for three weeks (in October 2020), with a 24-hour break every three days. Eggs were collected every eight hours and placed during 10 days in a petri-dish with a water reservoir ensuring a high humidity until they hatched. After hatching, for each colony, half of the larvae (i.e., 15 larvae) were then transferred into a recipient colony containing 20 workers, while the other half were placed in identical recipient colonies, which received in addition 45 0-4 hours-old trophic eggs (i.e., there were 3 trophic eggs per larva). There was no cross-fostering between colonies, so that larvae were always placed in recipient colonies containing workers from the same donor colony. The recipient colonies were maintained at 28°C and 60% humidity, with a 12-h/12-h light:dark cycle and fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> twice a week with grass seeds, flies and 20% honey water. The caste of each newly-produced individual was recorded at the pupal stage. To compare the proportion of queen pupae produced between recipient colonies with and without trophic eggs, we used the package <italic>lme4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bates et al. 2015</xref>) to perform a binomial generalized linear mixed effects analysis (GLMM/link=“logit”) fit by maximum likelihood, with caste as response variable (binary categorical factor) and presence/absence of trophic eggs as an explanatory variable. Donor colony was included as a random effect. To test whether the presence of trophic eggs affects survival, we performed a linear mixed effect analysis with mortality as a response variable, presence/absence of trophic eggs as explanatory variable, and colonies as random effects. As we found a significantly higher survival of larvae in recipient colonies with trophic eggs than recipient colonies without trophic eggs (see results), we tested whether the percentage of larvae developing into queens was correlated with survival by performing a linear mixed effects analysis with the percentage of queen pupae as response variable, the survival as an explanatory variable and colonies as a random factor.</p>

<title>Volume and content of trophic and viable eggs</title>
<p>The volumes of trophic (n=11) and viable eggs (n=14) were estimated by using the volume of an ellipse<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="525977v3_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, with egg length and width estimated on images under 10x magnification using ZEN Microscopy Software (v. 1.1.2.0).</p>
<p>To determine the nutritional content of viable and trophic eggs, we quantified the proteins, triglycerides, glycogen, and glucose in both types of eggs. We also quantified long and small RNAs (including miRNAs) as these compounds have been shown to be involved in caste determination in other eusocial species. To obtain the two types of eggs, we isolated 12 queens for 10 hours (7am to 5pm; from March to October 2021) in a dark petri-dish with three workers and a water supply. Eggs were collected every hour (so all eggs were a maximum of one hour old), and trophic and viable eggs were flash-frozen separately in liquid nitrogen. Twenty eggs were pooled for triglycerides-sugar-protein analyses and six eggs for RNA analyses. They were kept at -80°C until the extractions were performed. After the 10 hours of isolation, queens and workers were returned to their colony until the next isolation session. For each of the 12 colonies, we obtained two replicates of viable and trophic egg pools (i.e., 24 replicates in total).</p>
<p>Triglycerides, glycogen and glucose were quantified as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Tennessen et al. (2014)</xref>, and protein levels were measured using a Bradford assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bradford 1976</xref>). The 20 one-hour old eggs per sample were homogenized with beads in 200μl of PBS buffer in a Precellys Evolution tissue homogenizer coupled with a Cryolys Evolution (Bertin Technologies SAS).</p>
<p>For the Bradford assay, 10µl of the homogenate were put in a clear-bottom 96-well plate with 300µl of Coomassie Plus Reagent (Thermo Scientific: 23200) and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. Protein standard (Sigma: P5369) was used as standard (ranging from 0-0.5mg/ml) and protein absorbance was read at 595nm on a Hidex Sense Microplate Reader.</p>
<p>For the triglycerides assay, 90µl of homogenate were heat treated at 70°C for 10 minutes, then 40µl were mixed with 40µl of Triglyceride Reagent (Sigma: T2449) for digestion and 40µl were mixed with PBS buffer for free glycerol measurement. After 30 minutes incubation at 37°C, 30µl of each sample and standards were transferred to clear-bottom 96-well plate. 100µl of Free Glycerol Reagent (Sigma: F6428) was added to each sample, mixed well by pipetting, and incubated five minutes at 37°C. Glycerol standard solution (Sigma: G7793) was used as standard (ranging from 0-1.0mg/ml TAG) and absorbance was read at 540nm on a Hidex Sense Microplate Reader. The triglycerides concentration in each sample was determined by subtracting the absorbance of free glycerol in the corresponding sample.</p>
<p>Glucose and glycogen were quantified as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Tennessen et al. (2014)</xref>. A 90µl aliquot was heat treated at 70°C for 10min and then diluted 1:2 with PBS. The standard curves for glucose (Sigma, G6918) and glycogen (Sigma: G0885) were made by diluting stocks to 160µg/ml, making 1:1 serial dilution for 160, 80, 40, 20 and 10µg/ml. 40µl of each sample was pipetted in duplicates of a clear microplate, and 30µl of each glucose or glycogen standard was pipetted in duplicates. Amyloglucosidase enzyme (Sigma, A1602) was diluted 3µl into 2000µl of PBS, and 40µl diluted enzyme was pipetted to the glycogen standards and to one well of the sample (for total glucose determination), 40µl PBS was pipetted to the glucose standards and to the other sample well (for free glucose determination). The plate was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes. 30µl of each standard and samples (in duplicates) were transferred to a UV 96-well plate and 100µl Glucose Assay Reagent (G3293) was pipetted to each well. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes and the absorbance was read at 340nm on a Hidex Sense Microplate Reader. The glycogen concentration was quantified by subtracting the free glucose absorbance from the total glycogen + glucose absorbance.</p>
<p>Concentrations of each compound (protein, triglycerides, glycogen, and glucose) were compared between viable and trophic eggs using a linear mixed effects analysis (LMER; package <italic>lme4</italic>), with the concentration as response variable and egg type as explanatory variable. Colony and extraction batch were added as random effects in the model.</p>

<p>RNA (&gt;200 nt) and small RNA were isolated using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, cat. no. 217004) and RNeasy® MinElute® Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, cat. no. 74204), respectively, following manufacturer instructions. RNA (&gt;200 nt) and small RNA concentrations were measured with a QuantiFluor® RNA System (Promega). RNA (&gt;200 nt) integrity was examined with an Agilent Fragment Analyzer (at the Lausanne Genomic Technologies Facility) using a High Sensitivity Assay and small RNA were examined using the small RNA kit (at the Gene Expression Core Facility at EPFL).</p>
<p>The miRNA and RNA (&gt;200 nt) concentrations were compared between viable and trophic eggs with paired-t-tests (for each type of eggs we used the average of the two replicates per colony). We also compared the fragment size distributions from 18 to 24 nucleotides for miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sohel 2016</xref>) with a PCA and a Mantel test.</p>
<p>DNA was extracted from pools of six eggs using TRIzol (Life Technologies). DNA concentration was measured with a Nanodrop 3300 (ThermoFisher), and DNA integrity was examined with an Agilent Fragment Analyzer (at the Lausanne Genomic Technologies Facility) using a High Sensitivity Assay. DNA concentrations were compared between viable and trophic eggs using paired-t-tests (sample size is 5 for both types of eggs, each sample being a pool of 6 eggs).</p>

<p><italic>P. rugosus</italic> queens lay two types of eggs that are morphologically different. Viable eggs are white with a bright surface and have a distinct oval shape, a homogenous content as well as a solid chorion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), while trophic eggs are rounder, have a smooth surface and a granular looking content as well as a fragile chorion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Trophic eggs had a significantly larger volume (94.3±4.3nL; n=11) than viable eggs (n=14; 63.3±1.6nL; two-sample t-test, t(23) = -9.54, p = 1.8×10<sup>−09</sup>). While viable eggs showed embryonic development at 25 and 65 hours (Fig 12B, C) there was no such development for trophic eggs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E, F</xref>). <italic>P. rugosus</italic> workers only laid viable eggs. They started to lay eggs approximately three weeks after queen removal (n=12 queenless recipient colonies) and approximately 90% of the eggs successfully hatched. However, only approximately 5% successfully developed into pupae which were all males.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study reveals that <italic>P. rugosus</italic> queens lay a very high proportion (0.6) of trophic eggs. These eggs differ in many ways from viable eggs. First, trophic eggs are larger, rounder, have a smoother surface, a more granular looking content as well as a more fragile chorion than viable eggs. Similar differences between trophic and viable eggs have been reported in other ant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Wilson 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Wardlaw and Elmes 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gobin et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dietemann and Peeters 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dietemann et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Perry and Roitberg 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lee et al. 2017</xref>). Our analyses also showed that trophic eggs are solely laid by queens; <italic>P. rugosus</italic> workers are able to produce viable eggs which occasionally develop into males, but they do not lay trophic eggs. Moreover, trophic eggs have a reduced DNA content.</p>
<p>Importantly, our experiments showed that the presence of trophic eggs influences the process of caste determination. First instar female larvae fed with trophic eggs were significantly more likely to develop into workers than larvae without access to trophic eggs. This was somewhat surprising because trophic eggs are generally thought to be an important source of nutrients to the colony and, everything else being equal, one would think that eating such eggs should increase the likelihood of females to develop into queens (which are usually larger than workers). Indeed, two earlier studies suggested that an increase in the proportion of trophic eggs might be associated with an increase in the proportion of larvae developing into queens (<italic>L. humile</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bartels 1988</xref>; <italic>P. barbatus</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Helms Cahan et al. 2011</xref>). However, in these two studies variation in the availability of trophic eggs was associated with other differences (number of queens in the colony, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bartels 1988</xref>; Administration of a JH analogue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Helms Cahan et al. 2011</xref>) making it difficult to determine what factor had a causal effect. It would be interesting to experimentally manipulate the quantity of trophic eggs in <italic>L. humile</italic> and <italic>P. barbatus</italic> to determine whether they have a positive or inhibitory effect on the likelihood of larvae to develop into queens.</p>
<p>Our analyses revealed that trophic eggs have a lower content of protein, triglycerides, glycogen, and glucose than viable eggs. A reduced protein content of trophic as compared to viable eggs has also been documented in <italic>Pheidole pallidula</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lorber and Passera 1981</xref>). These findings are in line with the view that trophic eggs do not simply have a nutritional function as it might then be expected that they should at least contain as much nutrients as viable eggs. Interestingly, our analyses also revealed important differences in RNA and miRNA content between the two egg types. miRNAs have already been suggested to influence larval caste determination in the honeybee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Guo et al. 2013</xref>) with worker jelly being enriched in miRNAs compared to royal jelly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Guo et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Zhu et al. 2017</xref>). These studies suggest that it is not the royal jelly that stimulates larval determination into queen, but rather the worker jelly which stimulates the development of larvae into workers. Similarly, our study reveals that compounds found in trophic eggs, perhaps miRNAs, influence larval development towards the worker phenotype. Interestingly, it has also been recently shown that trophallactic fluid in the ant <italic>Camponotus floridanus</italic> contains non-digestive related proteins, microRNAs and juvenile hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">LeBoeuf et al. 2016</xref>). Moreover, comparison of trophallactic fluid proteins across social insect species revealed that many are regulators of growth, development and behavioral maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Meurville and LeBoeuf 2021</xref>). Finally, a recent study showed that pupae of several ant species produce secretions that play an important role for early larval nutrition with young larvae exhibiting stunted growth and decreased survival without access to the fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Snir et al. 2022</xref>). This raises the possibility that chemicals delivered in trophic eggs, trophallactic fluids and pupae secretions play previously unsuspected roles in communication and caste development. Given that some ants do not perform trophallaxis, it would be interesting to determine whether there are differences in the content of trophic eggs of species performing trophallaxis and species which do not.</p>
<p>Maternal effects on the process of caste determination have been demonstrated in several social insect species, including <italic>P. rugosus</italic>, either by queen behaviour or content of the eggs being produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">De Menten et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Linksvayer 2006</xref>; Schwander et al. 2008b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Libbrecht et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Wei et al. 2019</xref>). This is, to our knowledge the first experimental demonstrations that provisioning of trophic eggs influences caste fate. Since only queens produce trophic eggs in <italic>P. rugosus</italic>, trophic egg provisioning could be the main mechanism underlying the previously documented maternal effects on the process of caste determination. In species where workers produce trophic eggs (Supplementary Table 1), the same mechanism could allow workers to influence colony level caste ratios if their eggs do also affect the process of caste determination. The presence of trophic eggs has been documented in only relatively few ant species (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, their presence has been investigated in only few species and it is likely that trophic eggs are produced in most ant species, particularly in those with an independent mode of colony founding,</p>
<p>Finally, our analyses also revealed seasonal differences in the proportion of viable and trophic eggs, with a higher ratio of trophic eggs before hibernation than after. In <italic>Pogonomyrmex</italic> the production of new queens occurs after hibernation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Smith and Tschinkel 2006</xref>) or when the queen dies or is removed from the colony (pers. obs). Thus, new queens are typically produced when there are fewer trophic eggs. Our results predict that under natural conditions, a decrease in the proportion of trophic eggs should lead to an increase in the proportion of larvae developing into queens. The same logic applies to species where trophic eggs are laid only by the workers in queenright colonies (Supplementary Table 1). After the queen’s death, workers start producing their own male offspring and lay mostly (if not only) viable eggs (<italic>Temnothorax recedens</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dejean and Passera 1974</xref>; <italic>Plagiolepis pygmaea</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Passera 1980</xref>; <italic>Myrmecia gulosa</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dietemann et al. 2002</xref>), which again leads to a decrease, or cessation, in trophic egg production. A decrease in trophic egg production and the development of queens were observed simultaneously in freshly orphaned colonies of <italic>Temnothorax recedens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dejean and Passera 1974</xref>), <italic>Plagiolepis pygmaea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Passera 1980</xref>) and <italic>Myrmecia gulosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dietemann et al. 2002</xref>). These examples are consistent with the view that trophic eggs may also play a role in the process of caste determination in other ant species.</p>
<p>In addition to the seasonal differences reported in this study, previous studies in ants have also revealed that young queens produce more trophic eggs than older queens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hölldobler &amp; Wilson 1990</xref>). Interestingly, the production of new queens in ant colonies start only when colonies are several years old and have reached a relatively large size. Thus, this raises the possibility that the decrease of the proportion of trophic eggs laid by queens when they age may contribute to the production of new queens being restricted to colonies having reached a relatively large size.</p>
<p>Egg cannibalism has been reported in a many ant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Wilson 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Sorensen et al. 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bourke 1991</xref>; Crespi 1991; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Peeters and Tsuji 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aron et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Heinze et al.1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Schultner et al. 2013</xref>) and may serve many purposes, including preferential elimination of males, source of energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Sorensen et al. 1983</xref>) and intracolony conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Schultner et al. 2014</xref>). Our study indicates a new potential role of egg cannibalism as a mechanism to regulate the allocation of energy into the production of new queens versus workers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study provides a new striking example of how females can influence the developmental fate of their offspring. Because many ants produce trophic eggs, it is possible that this mechanism of parental manipulation is widespread and plays an important role in the general process of caste determination. It would be interesting to conduct manipulative experiments similar to those of this study in additional species, to determine whether trophic eggs broadly play a role in the process of caste determination. Of interest would also be to determine what chemicals in the egg are responsible for influencing the development of larvae.</p>

Prior to this study, trophic eggs were widely assumed to play a nutritional role in the colony, but this study shows that trophic eggs can suppress queen development, and therefore, can play a role in regulating caste determination in specific social contexts. In this revised version of the manuscript, the authors have addressed many of the concerns raised in the first version regarding the lack of sufficient information and context in the Introduction and Discussion.</p>

<p>This manuscript describes a series of experiments documenting trophic egg production in a species of harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex rugosus. In brief, queens are the primary trophic egg producers, there is seasonality and periodicity to trophic egg production, trophic eggs differ in many basic dimensions and contents relative to reproductive eggs, and diets supplemented with trophic eggs had an effect on the queen/worker ratio produced (increasing worker production).</p>
<p>The manuscript is very well prepared and the methods are sufficient. The outcomes are interesting and help fill gaps in knowledge, both on ants as well as insects, more generally. More context could enrich the study and flow could be improved.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. We agree that the paper would benefit from more context. We have therefore greatly extended the introduction.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript by Genzoni et al. provides evidence that trophic eggs laid by the queen in the ant Pogonomyrmex rugosis have an inhibitory effect on queen development. The authors also compare a number of features of trophic eggs, including protein, DNA, RNA, and miRNA content, to reproductive eggs. To support their argument that trophic eggs have an inhibitory effect on queen development, the authors show that trophic eggs have a lower content of protein, triglycerides, glycogen, and glucose than reproductive eggs, and that their miRNA distributions are different relative to reproductive eggs. Although the finding of an inhibitory influence of trophic eggs on queen development is indeed arresting, the egg cross-fostering experiment that supports this finding can be effectively boiled down to a single figure (Figure 6). The rest of the data are supplementary and correlative in nature (and can be combined), especially the miRNA differences shown between trophic and reproductive eggs. This means that the authors have not yet identified the mechanism through which the inhibitory effect on queen development is occurring. To this reviewer, this finding is more appropriate as a short report and not a research article. A full research article would be warranted if the authors had identified the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect on queen development. Furthermore, the article is written poorly and lacks much background information necessary for the general reader to properly evaluate the robustness of the conclusions and to appreciate the significance of the findings.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. We agree that the paper would benefit by having more background information and more discussion. We have followed this advice in the revision.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In &quot;Trophic eggs affect caste determination in the ant Pogonomyrmex rugosus&quot; Genzoni et al. probe a fundamental question in sociobiology, what are the molecular and developmental processes governing caste determination? In many social insect lineages, caste determination is a major ontogenetic milestone that establishes the discrete queen and worker life histories that make up the fundamental units of their colonies. Over the last century, mechanisms of caste determination, particularly regulators of caste during development, have remained relatively elusive. Here, Genzoni et al. discovered an unexpected role for trophic eggs in suppressing queen development - where bi-potential larvae fed trophic eggs become significantly more likely to develop into workers instead of gynes (new queens). These results are unexpected, and potentially paradigm-shifting, given that previously trophic eggs have been hypothesized to evolve to act as an additional intracolony resource for colonies in potentially competitive environments or during specific times in colony ontogeny (colony foundation), where additional food sources independent of foraging would be beneficial. While the evidence and methods used are compelling (e.g., the sequence of reproductive vs. trophic egg deposition by single queens, which highlights that the production of trophic eggs is tightly regulated), the connective tissue linking many experiments is missing and the downstream mechanism is speculative (e.g., whether miRNA, proteins, triglycerides, glycogen levels in trophic eggs is what suppresses queen development). Overall, this research elevates the importance of trophic eggs in regulating queen and worker development but how this is achieved remains unknown.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for these comments and agree that future work should focus on identifying the substances in trophic eggs that are responsible for caste determination.</p>

<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>The context for this study is insufficiently developed in the introduction - it would be nice to have a more detailed survey of what is known about trophic eggs in insects, especially social insects. The end of the introduction nicely sets up the hypothesis through the prior work described by Helms Cahan et al. (2011) where they found JH supplementation increased trophic egg production and also increased worker size. I think that the introduction could give more context about egg production in Pogonomyrmex and other ants, including what is known about worker reproduction. For example, Suni et al. 2007 and Smith et al. 2007 both describe the absence of male production by workers in two different harvester ants. Workers tend to have underdeveloped ovaries when in the presence of the queen. Other species of ants are known to have worker reproduction seemingly for the purpose of nutrition (see Heinze and Hölldober 1995 and subsequent studies on Crematogaster smithi). Because some ants, including Pogonomyrmex, lack trophallaxis, it has been hypothesized that they distribute nutrients throughout the nest via trophic eggs as is seen in at least one other ant (Gobin and Ito 2000). Interestingly, Smith and Suarez (2009) speculated that the difference in nutrition of developing sexual versus worker larvae (as seen in their pupal stable isotope values) was due to trophic egg provisioning - they predicted the opposite as was found in this study, but their prediction was in line with that of Helms Cahan et al. (2011). This is all to say that there is a lot of context that could go into developing the ideas tested in this paper that is completely overlooked. The inclusion of more of what is known already would greatly enrich the introduction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that it would be useful to provide a larger context to the study. We now provide more information on the life-history of ants and explained under what situations queens and workers may produce trophic eggs. We also mentioned that some ants such as <italic>Crematogaster smithi</italic> have a special caste of “large workers” which are morphologically intermediate between winged queens and small workers and appear to be specialized in the production of unfertilized eggs. We now also mention the study of Goby and Ito (200) where the authors show that trophic eggs may play an important role in food distribution withing the colony, in particular in species where trophallaxis is rare or absent.</p>

<p>Methods:</p>
<p>L49: What lineage is represented in the colonies used? The collection location is near where both dependent-lineage (genetic caste determining) P. rugosus and &quot;H&quot; lineage exist. This is important to know. Further, depending on what these are, the authors should note whether this has relevance to the study. Not mentioning genetic caste determination in a paper that examines caste determination is problematic.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a good point. We have now provided information at the very beginning of the material and method section that the queens had been collected in populations known not to have dependentlineage (genetic caste determining) mechanisms of caste determination.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Comments on introduction:</p>
<p>The introduction is missing information about caste determination in ants generally and Pogonomyrmex rugosis specifically. This is important because some colonies of Pogonomyrmex rugosis have been shown to undergo genetic caste determination, in which case the main result would be rendered insignificant. What is the evidence that caste determination in the lineages/colonies used is largely environmentally influenced and in what contexts/environmental factors? All of this should be made clear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a good point. We have expanded the introduction to discuss previous work on caste determination in <italic>Pogonomyrmex</italic> species with environmental caste determination and now also provide evidence at the beginning of the Material and Method section that the two populations studied do not have a system of genetic caste determination.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 32 and throughout the paper: What is meant exactly by 'reproductive eggs'? Are these eggs that develop specifically into reproductives (i.e., queens/males) or all eggs that are non-trophic? If the latter, then it is best to refer to these eggs as 'viable' in order to prevent confusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and have updated the manuscript accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 1/Supp Table 1: It is surprising how few species are known to lay trophic eggs. Do the authors think this is an informative representation of the distribution of trophic egg production across subfamilies, or due to lack of study? Furthermore, the branches show ant subfamilies, not families. What does the question mark indicate? Also, the information in the table next to the phylogeny is not easy to understand. Having in the branches that information, in categories, shown in color for example, could be better and more informative. Finally, having the 'none' column with only one entry is confusing - discuss that only one species has been shown to definitely not lay trophic eggs in the text, but it does not add much to the figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Trophic eggs are probably very common in ants, but this has not been very well studied. We added a sentence in the manuscript to make this clear.</p>
<p>Thanks for noticing the error family/subfamily error. This has been corrected in Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1.</p>
<p>The question mark indicates uncertainty about whether queens also contribute to the production of trophic eggs in one species (<italic>Lasius niger</italic>). We have now added information on that in the Figure legend.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be easier to have the information on whether queens and workers produce trophic on the branches of the Tree. However, having the information on the branches would suggest that the “trait” evolved on this part of the tree. As we do not know when worker or queen production of trophic eggs exactly evolved, we prefer to keep the figure as it is.</p>
<p>Finally, we have also removed the none in the figure as suggested by the reviewer and discussed in the manuscript the fact that the absence of trophic eggs has been reported in only one ant species (<italic>Amblyopone silvestrii</italic>: Masuko 2003_)._</p>

<p>Comments on materials and methods:</p>
<p>Why did they settle on three trophic eggs per larva for their experimental setup?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used three trophic eggs because under natural conditions 50-65% of the eggs are trophic. The ratio of trophic eggs to viable eggs (larvae) was thus similar natural condition.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 50: In what kind of setup were the ants kept? Plaster nests? Plastic boxes? Tubes? Was the setup dry or moist? I think this information is important to know in the context of trophic eggs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now explain that colonies were maintained in plastic boxes with water tubes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 60: Were all the 43 queens isolated only once, or multiple times?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Each of the 43 queens were isolated for 8 hours every day for 2 weeks, once before and once after hibernation (so they were isolated multiple times). We have changed the text to make clear that this was done for each of the 43 queens.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Could isolating the queen away from workers/brood have had an effect on the type of eggs laid?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This cannot be completely ruled out. However, it is possible to reliably determine the proportion of viable and trophic eggs only by isolating queens. And importantly the main aim of these experiments was not to precisely determine the proportion viable and trophic eggs, but to show that this proportion changes before and after hibernation and that queens do not lay viable and trophic eggs in a random sequence.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Since it was established that only queens lay trophic eggs why was the isolation necessary?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes this was necessary because eggs are fragile and very difficult to collect in colonies with workers (as soon as eggs are laid they are piled up and as soon as we disturb the nest, a worker takes them all and runs away with them). Moreover, it is possible that workers preferentially eat one type of eggs thus requiring to remove eggs as soon as queens would have laid them. This would have been a huge disturbance for the colonies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 61: Is this hibernation natural or lab induced? What is the purpose of it? How long was the hibernation and at what temperature? Where are the references for the requirement of a diapause and its length?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The hibernation was lab induced. We hibernated the queens because we previously showed that hibernation is important to trigger the production of gynes in <italic>P. rugosus</italic> colonies in the laboratory (Schwander et al 2008; Libbrecht et al 2013). Hibernation conditions were as described in Libbrecht et al (2013).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 73: If the queen is disturbed several times for three weeks, which effect does it have on its egg-laying rate and on the eggs laid? Were the eggs equally distributed in time in the recipient colonies with and without trophic eggs to avoid possible effects?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is difficult to respond what was the effect of disturbance on the number and type of eggs laid. But again our aim was not to precisely determine these values but determine whether there was an effect of hibernation on the proportion of trophic eggs. The recipient colonies with and without trophic eggs were formed in exactly the same way. No viable eggs were introduced in these colonies, but all first instar larvae have been introduced in the same way, at the same time, and with random assignment. We have clarified this in the Material and Method section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 77: Before placing the freshly hatched larvae in recipient colonies, how long were the recipient colonies kept without eggs and how long were they fed before giving the eggs? Were they kept long enough without the queen to avoid possible effects of trophic eggs, or too long so that their behavior changed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The recipient colonies were created 7 to 10 days before receiving the first larvae and were fed ad libitum with grass seeds, flies and honey water from the beginning. Trophic eggs that would have been left over from the source colony should have been eaten within the first few days after creating the recipient colonies. However, even if some trophic eggs would have remained, this would not influence our conclusion that trophic eggs influence caste fate, given the fully randomized nature of our treatments and the considerable number of independent replicates. The same applies to potential changes in worker behavior following their isolation from the queen.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 77: Is it known at what stage caste determination occurs in this species? Here first instar larvae were given trophic eggs or not. Does caste-determination occur at the first instar stage? If not, what effect could providing trophic eggs at other stages have on caste-determination?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A previous study showed that there is a maternal effect on caste determination in the focal species (Schwander et al 2008). The mechanism underlying this maternal effect was hypothesized to be differential maternal provisioning of viable eggs. However, as we detail in the discussion, the new data presented in our study suggests that the mechanism is in fact a different abundance of trophic eggs laid by queens. There is currently no information when exactly caste determination occurs during development</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comments on results:</p>
<p>Line 65: How does investigating the order of eggs laid help to &quot;inform on the mechanisms of oogenesis&quot;?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the aim was not to study the mechanism of oogenesis. We have changed this sentence accordingly: “To assess whether viable and trophic eggs were laid in a random order, or whether eggs of a given type were laid in clusters, we isolated 11 queens for 10 hours, eight times over three weeks, and collected every hour the eggs laid”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 2: There is no description/discussion of data shown in panels B, C, E, and F in the main text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added information in the main text that while viable eggs showed embryonic development at 25 and 65 hours (Fig 12 B, C) there was no such development for trophic eggs (Fig. 2 E,F).</p>

<p>The survival is given for the larvae without considering caste. We have changed the de X axis of panel B and reworded the Figure legend to clarify this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Is reduced DNA content just an outcome of reduced cell number within trophic eggs, i.e., was this a difference in cell type or cell number? Or is it some other adaptive reason?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is likely to be due to a reduction in cell number (trophic eggs have maternal DNA in the chorion, while viable eggs have in addition the cells from the developing zygote) but we do not have data to make this point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Is there a logical sequence to the sequence of egg production? The authors showed that the sequence is non-random, but can they identify in what way? What would the biological significance be?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We could not identify a logical sequence. Plausibly, the production of the two types of eggs implies some changes in the metabolic processes during egg production resulting in queens producing batches of either viable or trophic eggs. This would be an interesting question to study, but this is beyond the scope of this paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 6b is difficult to follow, and more generally, legends for all figures can be made clearer and more easy to follow.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. We have now improved the legends of Fig 6B and the other figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lines 172-174: &quot;The percentage of eggs that were trophic was higher before hibernation...than after. This higher percentage was due to a reduced number of reproductive eggs, the number of trophic eggs laid remained stable&quot; - are these data shown? It would be nice to see how the total egglaying rate changes after hibernation. Also, is the proportion of trophic eggs laid similar between individual queens?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>No the data were not shown and we do not have excellent data to make this point. We have therefore removed the sentence “This higher percentage was due to a reduced number of reproductive eggs, the number of trophic eggs laid remained stable” from the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 6B: Do several colonies produce 100% gynes despite receiving trophic eggs? It would be interesting if the authors discussed why this might occur (e.g., the larvae are already fully determined to be queens and not responsive to whatever signal is in the trophic eggs).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct that 4 colonies produced 100% gynes despite receiving trophic eggs. However, the number of individuals produced in these four colonies was small (2,1,2,1, see supplementary Table 2). So, it is likely that it is just by chance that these colonies produced only gynes.</p>

<p>In the two mentioned studies there were other factors that co-varied with variation in the quantity of trophic eggs.

<p>I would like to commend the authors on their study. The main findings of the paper are individually solid and provide novel insight into caste determination and the nature of trophic eggs. However, the inferences made from much of the data and connections between independent lines of evidence often extend too far and are unsubstantiated.</p>
