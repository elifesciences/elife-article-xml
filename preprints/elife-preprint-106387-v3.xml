<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by heightened plasticity. Yet, how ongoing development affects sensory processing and cognitive function is unclear. We investigated how adolescent (postnatal day 20-42) and adult (postnatal day 60-82) mice differ in performance on a pure tone Go/No-Go auditory discrimination task of varying difficulty. Using dense electrophysiological recordings, we measured spiking activity at single neuron resolution in the auditory cortex while mice were engaged in the task. As compared to adults, adolescent mice showed lower auditory discrimination performance in a difficult task. This difference in performance was due to higher response variability and weaker cognitive control expressed as higher lick bias. Adolescent and adult neuronal responses differed only slightly in representations of pure tones when measured outside the context of learning and the task. However, cortical representations after learning within the context of the task were markedly different. We found differences in stimulus- and choice-related activity at the single neuron level representations, as well as lower population-level decoding of the difficult task in adolescents. Overall, cortical decoding in adolescents was lower and slower, especially for difficult sound discrimination, reflecting immature cortical representations of sounds and choices. Notably, we found age-related differences, which were more pronounced after learning, reflecting the combined impact of age and learning. Our findings highlight distinct neurophysiological and behavioral profiles in adolescence, underscoring the ongoing development of cognitive control mechanisms and cortical plasticity during this sensitive developmental period.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adolescence is a developmental stage characterized by the continued refinement of perception and cognition. During this period, the brain is highly sensitive to environmental influences, making it particularly vulnerable to both negative experiences, such as substance abuse, and positive influences, such as supportive relationships[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. While the adolescent brain exhibits greater plasticity compared to adults[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], the extent to which specific sensory and cognitive traits are fully developed versus those that remain malleable is still debated. For instance, some studies on sensory perception have demonstrated that adolescent learning is slower and more variable[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], while others have found that adolescents learn faster in novel contexts, such as reversal learning[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Certain traits, such as cognitive flexibility, are more pronounced in adolescents compared to adults, whereas other behaviors such as impulsive control, are still immature[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, results across studies that target sensory or cognitive traits are often inconsistent[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the degree to which sensory and cognitive functions have matured, and the underlying brain mechanisms that support them, remain an ongoing challenge.</p>
<p>A key concept in brain development is that of critical periods (CPs), which are specific time windows during which the brainâs neural circuits are highly plastic and particularly sensitive to external experiences[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. The early postnatal development of sensory cortices provides classical examples of this phenomenon. In mice, neurons in the visual cortex undergo several CPs such as those for orientation selectivity, direction selectivity and ocular dominance. During the CP, which occurs in different developmental time windows for different functional attributes, visual experience shapes the specific neuronal attribute to a long-term state (e.g., ocular dominance reaches its adult form)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. The CPs for simple neuronal features in primary sensory cortices are typically complete by the onset of puberty. In the auditory cortex (ACx) of mice, the CP for pure tone processing begins as early as postnatal day 12 (P12), shortly after the ear canals open, and closes by â¼P15[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Thus, the closure of the auditory CP to pure tones occurs before adolescence begins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Yet, while some studies have found that simple neuronal properties in the ACx (like response properties to pure tones) are nearly mature by adolescence, others report continued maturation well beyond this developmental stage[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. For example, previous studies found that auditory learning and behavioral performance in auditory discrimination tasks involving amplitude modulation detection, as well as temporal interval discrimination tasks remain highly constrained during adolescence[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. In those tasks, ACx neurons in adolescents exhibit high neuronal variability and lower tone sensitivity as compared to adults[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].</p>
<p>The perspective shift from viewing development as involving a set of discrete CPs to a broader view of continuous development with multiple, overlapping, CPs that affect each other, calls for studies to test the extent of functional modulation in neuronal features after their CP âclosesâ. Thus, although the CP for pure tone representation in the ACx ends by â¼P15, we hypothesized that learning of pure tone discrimination would remain malleable in adolescence, because other perceptual features and particularly other cognitive features are still developing. Further, it remains unclear how these features are expressed when measured in the context of active behavior. We measured cortical activity in the ACx of adolescent mice engaged in an auditory discrimination task involving pure tones. Our findings show that learning, behavior, and sound representations to pure tones in the ACx are not fully mature during adolescence.</p>

<title>Adult mice outperform adolescents on a difficult, but not an easy, auditory discrimination task of pure tones</title>
<p>To study learning and perceptual performance abilities we trained and tested adolescent and adult mice on an auditory pure-tone discrimination Go/No-Go paradigm. For this purpose, we utilized an automated behavioral platform called the âEducageâ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. We trained adolescent (n = 15) and adult (n = 15) mice from post-natal day 20 (P20)-P37 and P60-P77, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Following a tone association period (3-days; exposure to Go tones when mice enter the drinking port), mice learned to discriminate between two pure tones separated by 1 octave (7.07kHz <italic>vs</italic> 14.14kHz; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b-c</xref>, light blue; herein referred to as the âeasy taskâ). After one week of training on the easy task (P23 to P30 in pre-adolescent mice and P63 to P70 in adult mice) mice were introduced to a second pure-tone pair, now separated by 0.25 octave (9.2kHz <italic>vs</italic> 10.9kHz; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b-c</xref>, dark blue; herein referred to as the âhard taskâ). We completed the experiment after 1 week of learning on the easy and hard task simultaneously (i.e., at P37 for adolescents and P77 for adults). During the whole period of training, we also presented mice with low-probability, unrewarded âprobeâ trials of pure-tones spanning the range of learned stimuli (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, grey). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref> shows example learning curves (of dâ) from one adolescent and one adult mouse over the 14-day course of tone discrimination. Adolescents and adults learned the procedure of the task similarly well, as measured by the number of trials it took mice to reach a discriminability threshold of dâ value â¥ 1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p>

<p>We tested for differences in auditory discrimination by comparing the performance of mice at different epochs along training. First, by the end of the first week of training, all mice performed above the discrimination threshold (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Although adolescent mice performed significantly fewer trials during the first week of training (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>; vertical lines: mean # of trials), there was no significant difference between the performance of adult and adolescent mice at the end of the first week (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>; horizontal lines: mean dâ; dâ calculated from the last 100 trials). Following one week of training on the easy task, we introduced the second pair of pure tones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>; âEasy + Hardâ). Immediately after introducing the hard pair, the performance of adolescent mice on the easy task dropped, while those of adults remained unaffected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). During the second week of training, adolescents regained their high dâ values on the easy task, such that by the end of the experiment both groups had similarly high performance on the easy task (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>).</p>
<p>We then compared how mice learned the hard task during the second week while training on both the easy and hard task simultaneously. While both groups now performed a similar number of trials (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref>, vertical lines: mean # of trials), adult mice outperformed adolescent mice on the hard task (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref>, horizontal lines: mean dâ), suggesting that adolescents struggled with this harder level of discrimination. Indeed, on average, adolescent mice did not improve on the hard task during the second week of training (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>, âadolescentâ). Adults, on the other hand, improved their performance on the hard task during the second week (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>, âadultâ). Notably, neither group could learn the hard task if it was not preceded by the easy task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-1">Fig. S1-1a, b</xref>).</p>
<p>Each mouse performed a unique number of trials, as these were initiated by the mice spontaneously. As noted above, pre-adolescent mice performed fewer trials/day as compared to adults but, notably, only during the first week of training (mean Â± STE: adolescents, 8317 Â± 712 trials, adults 13229 Â± 514 trials, t-stat = â5.6314, df = 28, p = 4.9566e-06, two-sample independent t-test). Still, this difference raises the question whether the different number of trials affected our conclusions from the first week of training. Thus, to evaluate the possible connection between the number of trials and performance in our data, we carried out several analyses. First, we found that the number of trials and dâ were not correlated in either age-group during the first week of discrimination on the easy task (Pearson-r; adolescent: r = 0.1880, p = 0.5023; adult: r = â0.0730, p = 0.7959), nor on the second week of discrimination on both the easy and the hard task (Pearson-r; adolescent: r = 0. 2264, p = 0. 4171; adult: r = 0. 0194, p = 0. 9454). Second, we compared performance at three time points along the task with reference to times with shared number of trials: 1) evaluating dâ after the minimal number of trials performed by all mice during the first week of training, and 2) evaluating dâ at the mean number of trials of each group as a reference. We found no significant differences between adolescents and adults in all comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-1">Fig. S1-1c-e</xref>). Additionally, we found no significant differences between males and females, nor among experiments that had different numbers of co-housed mice in the Educage (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Taken together, despite the different absolute number of trials during the first week, we conclude that adolescents and adults learned the easy task equally quickly and effectively. The central difference between the age groups was in their ability to learn the hard task during the second week, when adults outperformed adolescents.</p>

<title>Adolescents have higher lick bias and higher behavioral variability</title>
<p>We next asked what perceptual and/or cognitive aspect of behavior is different among the age groups. We plotted psychometric curves based on both learned and probe trials from the last 2000 trials of the experiment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). The false alarm rate but not the hit rate of adolescent mice was significantly higher as compared to adults (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). To calculate the decision boundary of mice and their perceptual sensitivity we normalized the psychometric curves of each mouse using a unity-based normalization and sigmoid fitting (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). We found no differences in the decision boundary or slopes of the curves, suggesting that perceptual sensitivity is not different between the groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). To test whether the differences arise from a cognitive effect (e.g., lick bias), we calculated the decision threshold as the maximal lick bias, also known as the criterion bias (C-bias). C-bias reflects the tendency to respond in a liberal (i.e., negative C-bias) or a conservative (i.e., positive C-bias) manner to the sounds during the task. C-bias was negative for both groups, yet significantly lower in adolescents, suggesting that their cognitive ability to withhold licking is inferior to that of adults (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Given that adolescents and adults show different dynamics in their performance along the task (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), we tested whether the differences we found in the lick bias are consistent at different times along the task. To normalize for different numbers of trials in each mouse, we divided their training episodes into the first and last tertiles during the first week and second week of training separately (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). The maximal lick bias was significantly higher in adolescents in all but the very first training episode, when mice learned the procedure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). These data highlight the general cognitive difficulty of adolescents to withhold licking during the task.</p>
<p>The cognitive sensitivity of adolescents was further evident when their performance dropped right after the task was switched from âeasy onlyâ to âeasy + hardâ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). The lick bias of adolescent mice became significantly stronger after the introduction of the hard task (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>). In contrast, the lick bias of adult mice remained stable (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>). These data further suggest that this cognitive trait (i.e., to withhold licking) has not yet matured in the young mice. To test if the lick bias was stimulus-related or a result of general impulsivity, we also compared the inter-trial interval (ITI) after different trial outcomes, and observed similar ITIs across groups, except for false alarm trials, where adolescents initiated the trials significantly faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2-1">Fig. S2-1</xref>). This, too, suggests that adolescent mice exhibit more impulsive responses following punishments (or alternatively are less impacted by punishments), contributing to their immature lick bias.</p>
<p>Prior studies have shown that a dominant feature of adolescent behavior is that it is more variable compared to adults[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. To examine behavioral variability in our data, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) of the discriminability (dâ) for each mouse across training. While there was no significant difference in dâ variability when training on the easy task during the first week of training (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>), adult mice showed significantly lower variability during the second week of training while training on the âeasy + hardâ versions of the task (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i,j</xref>). Thus, adolescent learning and behavior are characterized by both lower response inhibition and higher variability, particularly during the second week when the task involved more challenging discrimination for the younger mice.</p>

<title>Adult mice outperform adolescent mice on a head-fixed discrimination task</title>
<p>To enable electrophysiological recordings during expert task performance, we trained adolescent (n = 5) and adult (n = 6) mice on a head-fixed learning paradigm, using a similar protocol as in the Educage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). In the head-fixed protocol, water access was limited to training sessions. Head-fixed mice were trained to lick after a 100ms tone and were rewarded (with water) or punished (by a 2 sec white noise) only after a 600ms delay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Each session was concluded after the mice became satiated and stopped licking. Water supply was limited to 0.0125 ml per day per gram of body weight, and mice that did not consume this amount were compensated after training (see Methods; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref> shows an example session from one mouse). The number of trials per training session was significantly lower in adolescents (mean Â± STE: adolescents: 410 Â± 35, adults: 580 Â± 37 t-statistic = â27.9855, p = 0.0012, independent two-sample t-test). However, the number of sessions to reach the behavioral threshold (dâ &gt;= 1 in the easy task) was not significantly different between adolescents and adults (mean Â± STE: adolescents: 3.7 Â± 0.8, adults: 3.8 Â± 0.7; t-statistic = - 0.8531, p = 0.1971, independent two-sample t-test, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref> shows all learning curves). Similar to learning in the Educage, adolescent performance (but not that of adults) decreased after we introduced the hard task (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Another similarity between the head-fixed and Educage versions of the task was that we found no significant differences between adolescents and adults in the performance of the easy task (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>), and that adults outperformed adolescents on the hard discrimination (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). Also similar to the behavior in the Educage, lick responses of adolescent mice were generally higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3-1">Fig. S3-1a</xref>), and adolescents exhibited a stronger lick bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3-1">Fig. S3-1b</xref>). In line with this result, in the head-fixed task we found higher impulsiveness in the proportion and the number of licks during the inter-trial intervals after FA trials in adolescents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3-1">Fig. S3-1c, d</xref>).</p>

<p>To test whether ACx was necessary for expert discrimination in this task, we performed a causal experiment in adult mice. Adult mice (n=3) were injected bilaterally with AAV5-CAMKII-GtACR2-FRED_kv_2.1 into the ACx, and optical fibers were implanted over the injection sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3-2">Fig. S3-2a, c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3-3">Fig. S3-3</xref>). This viral construct enables optogenetic silencing of excitatory neurons via GtACR2 (<italic>Guillardia theta</italic> Anion Channelrhodopsin 2), under the control of the CaMKII promoter. It includes a red fluorescent protein for expression verification (FRED) and a soma-targeting motif derived from the Kv2.1 potassium channel to enhance membrane localization.</p>
<p>Mice were trained identically on the head-fixed Go/No-Go paradigm as described above. At the end of training, we attached a light source to the implanted fibers to allow optogenetic suppression during several sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3-2">Fig. S3-2a</xref>). In these sessions, light was applied in 50% of trials in a pseudo-random fashion, with light-on trials starting from â50ms prior to tone onset up to 50ms after tone offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3-2">Fig. S3-2b</xref>). A control group of mice (n= 3) were injected with AAV9-CaMKII-dTomato and went through the exact same procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3-2">Fig. S3-2a, c</xref>). We compared the lick responses for both Go and No-Go stimuli under light-on and light-off conditions. We found that lick responses were strongly affected in the GtACR2-injected mice (n = 13 sessions), but not in controls (n = 8 sessions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3-2">Fig. S3-2d</xref>). Light-on conditions only affected the lick responses of the inhibited trial and not the light-off trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3-2">Fig. S3-2e</xref>). Discriminability (dâ) decreased significantly with optogenetic suppression for both easy and hard tasks, although all mice still performed better in the easy task under both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3-2">Fig. S3-2f</xref>). These results confirm findings by others in similar (though not identical) tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], suggesting that the ACx is necessary for executing the behavior during the expert stage of this task (but see Discussion for limitations of this experiment).</p>
<p>To measure neural responses during behavioral performance, head-fixed expert mice underwent multiple recording sessions targeting the ACx (adults, n = 14 recording sessions from 6 mice, age: P77-P82; adolescents, n = 13 recordings from 5 mice, age: P37-P42). During the recordings, the performance of all mice on the easy task was at least dâ&gt;1, and the dâ on the hard task was smaller for both groups (often smaller than 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3-4">Fig. S3-4a</xref>). Performance was not significantly different across the multiple recording sessions in each mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3-4">Fig. S3-4b</xref>). Behavioral performance during recordings was not significantly different to performance in the Educage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3-4">Fig. S3-4c</xref>). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h</xref> shows the evolution of behavioral discriminability (dâ) during all recordings for adolescents and adults. The performance was heterogeneous across mice as well as within recording-sessions. However, the total number of trials performed was not significantly different between age groups (trials per recording: adolescent: 340.5 Â± 45; adult: 431.1 Â± 30.3; independent t-test, t-statistic = â203.7581, p = 0.1116).</p>
<p>We found additional differences between the behavior of adults and adolescents in the head restrained configuration. The average adolescent discriminability was lower at the beginning of the session (initial 78 trials) but then rapidly leveled out (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref>). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3j</xref> shows the cumulative lick curves of adults and adolescents. Adolescent mice had shorter lick latencies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3k</xref>), and higher lick counts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3l</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). While the lick latencies were independent of the discriminability (dâ), we found a significant interaction effect between lick count and the dâ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Together, these behavioral differences suggest that the weaker response inhibition (here, expressed as lick latency) and higher reward anticipation (here, expressed as lick count) may contribute to the weaker performance of adolescents during the beginning of the recording session.</p>

<p>To compare the activity of neurons in adolescent and adult mice, we recorded spiking activity from the ACx using the high-density Neuropixels-1 probes in expert mice engaged in the task.

<p>We limited our single neuron analysis to well-isolated single units from infragranular layer 5 and layer 6 (recordings were largely restricted to these layers due to the probe angle), as two main projection layers of the cortex, which are key nodes for assessing cortical outputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Recorded neurons from other layers and areas were excluded from the analysis. Together, we collected data from 1145 single neurons in 13 recordings of 5 adolescent mice and 1267 single neurons in 14 recordings of 6 adult mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>; an overview of every dataset per figure is detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls9">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). We further restricted our analysis to single neurons excited by sounds during the first 150ms after tone onset. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref> shows the normalized firing rate (FR) compared to the normalized lick rate (LR) from â200ms to 600ms after the tone onset, before the end of the reinforcement delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4-1">Fig. S4-1e</xref> shows the FR in Hz per auditory sub-region). FR-PSTHs and LR-PSTHs were not correlated during the first 150ms (adolescents r = â0.1515, p = 0.9878; adults r = â0.0638, p = 0.9942). In total, we analyzed n = 463 neurons from adolescent mice and n = 599 from adults.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>, we present the number of neurons in our dataset, categorized by region. A detailed overview of the differences in firing properties per auditory region is also provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls3">Supplementary Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>.</p>
<p>The differences in firing properties between adolescent and adult neurons varied across auditory subregions. AUDp showed differences in all firing properties that we analyzed. In AUDd, adolescent neurons had greater latency to peak, full-width half-maximum, minimal latency, and lower trial-responsiveness. AUDv also showed greater minimal latency and lower lifetime sparseness. TEa neurons of adolescents exhibited greater minimal latency and higher spontaneous FR. While these differences may partially reflect the varying number of neurons recorded per subregion and different functional attributes of each region, we observed similar trends in Cohenâs D values (effect sizes) across all four areas, supporting a generally consistent group differences in activity patterns (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Consistent with previous work, we also found that firing properties such as minimal latency differed between auditory regions in both age groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].</p>
<p>To study how adolescents and adults encode task performance we divided neuronal responses by trial outcome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref> shows one example). Specifically, we assessed neuronal discriminability between stimulus-related and choice-related activity by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) from a receiver operating curve (ROC). Specifically, stimulus-related activity was calculated as the difference between hit and false alarm trials in the easy and the hard task separately (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>, left<bold>)</bold>. Choice-related activity was calculated as the average difference between false-alarm and correct reject trials (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>, left<bold>).</bold> Miss trials were excluded since we had insufficient trial numbers of this outcome. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref> (right) shows the average AUC values over time from an example neuron (same neuron shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4f</xref> shows the average calculated from all neurons. The vast majority of neurons successfully discriminated (AUC above shuffled data) either or both stimulus- and choice-related activity (adolescent: easy stimuli = 93%, hard stimuli = 93%, choice= 95%; adult: easy stimuli = 97%, hard stimuli = 97%, choice= 95%). The onset-latency of discriminability was significantly slower, maximal discriminability significantly weaker, and the duration of discriminability significantly shorter in adolescent neurons compared to adult neurons (discriminability traces are plotted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>, and all values from individual neurons and the 3 metrics are plotted together in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>; see <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for statistics). The four auditory subregions were not significantly different in all 3 measured metrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4-2">Fig. S4-2</xref>).

<title>Adults exhibit better population decoding of the difficult task compared to adolescents</title>
<p>While individual neurons exhibited weaker discriminability in adolescents than in adults, at a population level these effects could saturate out. We therefore tested the ability of recorded populations to decode trial outcomes. We used a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) decoder to quantify hit versus correct reject trial outcomes. We applied stringent inclusion criteria for the number of simultaneously recorded neurons (see Methods), which restricted our analysis to hit versus correct rejection trials with sufficient trial counts for statistical reliability. We note that this comparison extracts information of the combination of stimulus and choice information indiscriminately (i.e. collectively it includes the full âtask-relatedâ differences). We decoded separately in easy trials and hard trials, based on population activity during the first 200 milliseconds. For the easy task there was no significant difference between decoding accuracy in adolescents and adults (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). However, decoding accuracy was significantly higher in adults compared to adolescents in hard trials (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). For both adults and adolescents, decoding accuracy was significantly lower in hard trials compared to easy trials (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). We performed finer timescale decoding to quantify the onset latency of differences between the activity for hit vs. correct reject trials, defined as the time in which the decoding accuracy first crosses three times the standard deviation away from the baseline (see Methods). We found that the latency was shorter in adults in both the easy and hard trials (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). In adolescent animals the latency was larger in hard trials (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>) but not in adult animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). We then extended this analysis over a temporal window from â0.5s to10s relative to tone onset (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). In the 200ms window after the response period (2.0-2.2 s), there is no longer a significant difference in decoding accuracy between adult and adolescent mice as well as between the two task difficulties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5-1">Fig. S5-1</xref>).</p>

<p>To further quantify the different decoding performance between two tasks difficulties, we plotted the fisher separation metric (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="636101v3_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, see Methods) for each level of difficulty. While decoding accuracy reflects how well a classifier can distinguish between trial types, the Fisher separation metric specifically quantifies the ratio of between-category variance to within-category variance. The separation ratio of hard over easy tasks was significantly higher in adult mice than in adolescent mice (robust linear regression, see Methods). Separation could have changed due to alterations in the mean or the dispersion around the mean. Testing the dispersion, we found that the variance around the means was not equal across easy and hard trials but rather significantly increased for the hard trials (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d-f</xref>).

<p>To reveal learning-related differences, we compared neuronal responses in novice versus expert mice in both age-groups. We computed single-neuron AUCs for Go and No-Go trials (here we did not distinguish between stimulus and choice and computed AUCs for all trial outcomes, since expert mice mostly performed CR and novice mice mostly performed FA to No-Go tones), in both easy and hard task (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d-g</xref>). The onset-latency for AUC discrimination was significantly different between adolescents and adults (shorter in adults), but not between novice and expert mice, nor between the easy and the hard task (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The maximal AUC discriminability was higher in adults compared to adolescents. It was also higher in experts than in novice, and in the easy compared to the hard task (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Similarly, the duration of discriminability was longer in adults and after learning (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). There was a significant interaction between age and learning, as well learning and task difficulty in the maximal discriminability (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).

<p>We characterized the response profile of ACx neurons using a âfrequency-response areaâ protocol composed of twenty pure tones (4-40 kHz, spaced at 0.1661 octaves steps), each played for 100ms at five different attenuations (72-32 dB SPL). We limited our analysis to significant excitatory units only, determined as being auditory responsive in a window from tone onset to 50ms after tone offset at 62 dB SPL. We then focused our tuning analysis on responses to 62 dB SPL because this sound level was close to the intensity used during the behavioral task (72 dB SPL), while still avoiding potential ceiling effects observed at higher SPLs in recordings of mice not engaged in the task.</p>
<p>Our dataset included four groups. The two adolescent groups were: 1) adolescent novices, and 2) adolescent experts, with 92 and 80 neurons, respectively. The two adult groups were: 3) adult novices, and 4) adult experts, with 123 and 84 neurons, respectively. Neurons in all groups responded to pure tone as expected from previous studies in adult mice, including classical V-shaped frequency response areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. A representative example from a responsive neuron of an adolescent expert and one from an adult expert are shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b,c</xref>. To assess differences in pure-tone responses between auditory subregions, we quantified the firing properties of AUDp versus AUDv (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls8">Supplementary Table 8</xref>; TEa and AUDd were excluded since fewer than 20 units responded to the FRA protocol after task engagement, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls7">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). We found that the latency to peak was slower in adolescent AUDp. The FWHM and minimal latency were slower in the adolescents in both AUDp and AUDv. In the adolescent AUDv, additional parameters (like spontaneous- &amp; evoked-FR, trial-responsiveness, life time sparseness), were different than those in adults. There were no significant differences between AUDp and AUDv within age-groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls8">Supplementary Table 8</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we tested the learning-related effects among the different groups. The peak of frequency tuning was heterogeneous across the frequency range with no clear trends of learning or age (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>). To quantify these responses, we calculated tuning width (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>), population sparseness (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref>), the distance between the best frequency of the neurons and the Go frequency of the easy task (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7g</xref>), and single neuron discriminability (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7h</xref>). As expected from previous work, learning significantly changed (3 out of 4) neuronal tuning properties in adults (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e-h</xref>, âAdultsâ). Surprisingly, however, learning had no significant effects on any of these single neuron parameters in the adolescent group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e-h</xref>). To test this at specific brain regions we analyzed AUDp and AUDv separately, which revealed specificity in learning-induced changes. Learning significantly affected 3 out of the 4 parameters in AUDp of adolescents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7-1">Fig. S7-1a-d</xref>). However, neurons from AUDv of adolescents showed no learning-induced changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7-1">Fig. S7-1e-h</xref>). Notably, adult learning-induced plasticity was stronger than that in adolescence in all parameters besides the âBF to Goâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7-1">Fig. S7-1</xref>). Thus, despite the notion that adolescentsâ brains may be more plastic than adults, we found generally stronger learning-induced plasticity in basic tuning properties in adults. These results underscore that learning-induced plasticity manifests differently in adolescents and adults.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The term âstormy adolescenceâ aptly captures what we know from psychology, neuroscience, and biologyâthat adolescence is a period of turbulent development, which shapes the individualâs future behavior and health[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. While numerous behavioral phenomena of adolescence have been studied, particularly in humans, the neural underpinnings of these remain largely unknown[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. In this study, we focused on (auditory) cortical neurons of the adolescent brain of mice while they were engaged in an auditory discrimination task. We found numerous differences in behavior, single neuron activity, and population encoding between adolescents and adults.</p>

<title>Adolescence behavior â perceptual and cognitive differences</title>
<p>We utilized the Educage platform to compare between adolescents and adults[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. The Educage provides an optimal environment for training young mice; its automated nature minimizes human handling, which increases efficiency and reduces to a minimum any interference during the training process. Using the Educage, we found that procedural learning was intact in pre-adolescent mice (P23-P30), and behavioral differences were found only after the mice learned the task during the hard discrimination phase (P30-37). Compared to adults, adolescent mice scored lower on the hard versions of the task (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i-j</xref>). Interestingly, our data suggests that the lower performance in the hard task in adolescents was not due to a deficiency in perceptual sensitivity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), but rather to a cognitive deficit â namely, lick bias (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). This result is perhaps not surprising since higher lick bias is a cognitive phenomenon that has been well documented in adolescence as a maturation period of inhibitory control[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Indeed, additional cognitive control mechanisms are still developing during this age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>].</p>
<p>Another manifestation of weaker cognitive control mechanisms is the noisy behavioral performance of adolescents (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h-j</xref>). While this noise may reflect higher plasticity and potentially serve cognitive flexibility[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], it poses a disadvantage for the precision and consistency required in our task. This noise may also arise from changes in pubertal hormones, which we did not manipulate[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Notably, few studies have explicitly characterized auditory discrimination of adolescents in rodents; the majority of these have been carried out in gerbils using an amplitude modulation (AM) detection task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Despite the different task, many of our age-related findings are aligned with the findings in gerbils, including lower performance in adolescents, and greater variance in adolescent behavior[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. However, some findings differ. For example, the lick bias which was different in our data, was similar between young and adult gerbils in an AM modulation detection task. This difference may arise from differences in task design, as well as the severity of the punishment used in the task (here, we used a milder punishment). Here, our data support a view that cognitive factors, and to a lesser extent perception of pure tones <italic>per se</italic>, are the primary contributors to the poorer performance observed in adolescent mice when performing a pure-tone sound discrimination task.</p>

<title>Representation of stimulus and choice in ACx still undergoes maturation in adolescence</title>
<p>Motivated by the abovementioned behavioral differences, we tested how single neurons in ACx represented sounds (by comparing Hits vs FA) and choices (by comparing FA to CR). While cortical representations of sounds in ACx could be the basis of perceptual constraints, distinct processing of choices would reflect that more cognitive mechanisms are involved. We found that cortical representations of sounds and choices in mice engaged in the task were still immature as compared to adults, e.g., responses in adolescents were more delayed and less informative (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These differences can be a result of age-related differences, and/or the result of a combined âage x learningâ effect.</p>
<p>We found only modest age-related differences in spiking activity of layer 5/6 neurons between adolescents and adults (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). This limited difference is perhaps not surprising because the CP for tonal organization in ACx is already complete by the age at which we tested the animals (i.e., on P37-P42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]). In contrast, more pronounced differences emerged from the interaction of âage x learningâ, specifically in mice that learned the task and were actively engaged in the behavior (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d-g</xref>). This interaction is evident in the lower single-neuron discriminability (AUC) during the hard task in expert adolescent mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref><bold> vs. </bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>).</p>
<p>While this may seem counterintuitive, it is compatible with the idea that learning can drive complex reorganization in sensory representations. For example, we recently showed that learning leads to distinct and sometimes opposing effects on single-neuron responses with respect to whether the task is perceptually easy or difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. It is also important to note that our recordings were restricted to infragranular layers (5/6) and did not sample supragranular (layers 2/3) neurons, which may exhibit distinct learning related plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. As such, the developmental differences we report may reflect layer-specific properties of the deep output layers.</p>
<p>We speculate that immature feedback to ACx may underlie these differences for several reasons. First, feedback from higher cortical regions to more primary cortices has been proposed as a neural substrate for difficult perceptual discriminations[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Second, feedback activity (often referred to as âtop downâ) is thought to be the key neural pathway involved in cognitive control mechanisms[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Feedback is typically expressed in the late (&gt;100ms) phase of single neurons activity, which was significantly different between adults and adolescents across our measured parameters (onset-latency, duration of discriminability and maximal discriminability; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The precise source of feedback that contributes to perceptual or cognitive differences remains to be determined, but likely candidates include regions that project to ACx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], such as medial prefrontal cortex[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>], orbitofrontal cortex[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>], or anterior cingulate[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. Testing the causal role of these regions during adolescence will be an important direction for future research.</p>
<p>Cortical coding is performed by populations of neurons, which can efficiently encode stimuli on a trial-by-trial basis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Population coding, as measured here by decoding accuracy, largely recapitulated the results of the single neuron data. Specifically, cortical populations in adults encoded the different tones better and faster; particularly in the hard task (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a-c</xref>). Interestingly, by testing the quality (i.e., separation) of the decoding performance, we revealed a correlation between decoding in the easy and hard tasks in adult (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). While this result reflects the collapsed information of stimulus and choice, it suggests that the cortical network uses shared representation for decoding the easy and hard tasks, possibly by the same neurons. This is consistent with our recent work showing that indeed the same neurons in ACx respond to the same stimulus differently, depending on if the mouse is engaged in discriminating an easy sound pair or a hard sound pair[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. The shallower slopes in adolescence suggest a less efficient decoding scheme that may arise from different populations of neurons encoding task-related information.</p>
<p>Our optogenetic silencing of ACx in expert adult mice resulted in a marked suppression of licking behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3-2">Fig. S3-2</xref>), consistent with the idea that ACx contributes to task performance. However, the strength of the observed effect raises the possibility that the manipulation may have impacted broader aspects of behaviorâsuch as arousal, motivation, or motor readinessârather than selectively disrupting auditory discrimination. Recent work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>] suggests that ACx plays a critical role during learning by supporting higher-order computations but may become less essential for task execution once mice reach expert performance. These findings, together with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], indicate that the necessity of ACx for auditory-guided behavior may depend on task structure, training stage, and the exact nature of the manipulation. The robust decrease in lick rate and performance observed in our experiment may reflect the intensity, specificity, and timing of the silencing. The use of GtACR2, a highly potent silencer, may have further amplified the effect. We cannot rule out the possibility that silencing the output from ACx also disrupted the flow of information to downstream areas, thereby exerting a stronger influence on perception and behavior. Although the injection was targeted to the ACx, off-target effects are also likely to have contributed. Future experiments using graded or temporally specific perturbations will be useful to more define more precisely the contribution of ACx across learning and development.</p>

<title>Learning in the adolescent brain</title>
<p>Cortical representations of pure tones have a critical period (CP) between P12-P15[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Indeed, we chose to study animals at P37-P42 on a pure tone discrimination task precisely to avoid the hypersensitivity associated with this CP. But this may be unavoidable, as recent work has shown that ACx also has a later CP for more complex sounds features[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Those late CPâs overlap with our training schedule and the underlying biological manifestation of this CP is expected to affect learning related plasticity in general. The underlying mechanism of the late CP to complex sounds has been associated with dynamic changes of inhibitory circuits[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. Thus, immature inhibitory circuits remain sensitive in adolescents, and could affect how pure tones are represented, despite the closure of the classic tonal CP. Notably, sound discrimination learning changes tonal representations even in adult mice, well after the closure of CPâs for both simple and complex sounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. We hypothesize, therefore, that the differences in performance on more difficult discriminations between adolescents and adults are shaped primarily by age-specific learning-related plasticity, rather than by differences in pure tone representation per se.</p>
<p>Taken together, our findings show that cortical responses in adolescents differ from those in adults, despite both groups learning the same pure tone discrimination task under identical training protocols. Although the CPs for pure tones are considered closed by this age, learning to discriminate between tones still varies across developmental stages. It remains unclear how later CPs, such as those shaping responses to amplitude modulation or frequency-modulated sweeps through inhibitory circuits, contribute to these differences. Likewise, the role of ongoing maturation in cognitive control, including the development of feedback pathways, warrants further investigation. Nevertheless, it is evident that developmental processes in the adolescent brain continue to influence how even simple sounds are encoded through learning. The adolescent-specific plasticity observed here directly reflects on how perceptual and cognitive features are integrated within the auditory cortex.</p>

<p>A total of 47 (37 female and 10 male) C57BL/6 mice were used in this study. Adolescent mice were weaned at postnatal (P) day 20. Adult mice were trained starting from P60. All mice were housed on a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle with food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>, unless used for behavioral training (see below). All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel (Permit Number: NS-21-16448-4, NS-21-16694-4, NS-22-16966-4).</p>

The relevant procedures are briefly described below.</p>
<sec id="s8b1">
<title>RFID Implantation</title>
<p>24h before the start of behavioral training in the automated home-cage, mice were implanted with a radio frequency identification (RFID) chip (Trovan, EX<sup>TM</sup>). Animals were anesthetized with 2% Isoflurane with pure O2 as carrier. RFID chips were implanted under the scruff. After implantation, mice were injected with 0.04mg/g of 10% Meloxicam solution to prevent infection and alleviate any possible pain from the implantation.</p>

<title>Head-bar Implantation &amp; Craniotomy</title>
<p>48h before the start behavioral training on the head-fixed recording setup, mice were anesthetized with 2% Isoflurane, the body temperature maintained at 37 Â° C and the eyes were covered with 5% Chloramphenicol ointment to prevent from drying. Before removal of the scalp, we applied 4% Lidocaine above the skin and skull area. Afterwards, we glued a custom-made titanium bar at the back of the mouse skull using dental cement (Meta-bond). To enable acute recordings in ACx, we performed a craniotomy on the left-hemisphere at 2.5 mm posterior and 4.0 lateral to the bregma. The craniotomy was protected by a pool of dental cement and covered with a silicon elastomer (WPI; Kwik-Cast catalog #KWIK CAST). After the craniotomy, mice were injected with 0.04mg/g of 10% Meloxicam solution and 0.2 ml Saline. During the 48 hours of recovery, mice received two further doses of 0.04mg/g of 10% Meloxicam solution. 24h before recordings, mice were again anesthetized to remove regrowth of the dura-mater during training. The area around the craniotomy was cleaned with Hydrogen-peroxide (3%), the silicon elastomer was replaced, and another dose of 10% Meloxicam was injected.</p>

<p>The surgical procedure was similar to the <italic>head-bar implantation &amp; craniotomy</italic>. The differences in the procedure are outlined below. Bilateral craniotomies were performed at 2.5 mm posterior and 4.3 mm lateral to the bregma. We injected 200nl AAV5-CAMKII-GtACR2-FRED_kv_2.1, or 200nl AAV9-CAMKII-dTomato. Both viruses were produced at the ELSC virus-core facility. We injected the virus at a depth of 1.1 mm at 0Â°. Afterwards, we inserted a 0.2 mm diameter optical fiber with an attached cannula (CFML1202; Thorlabs) at a depth of 0.9 mm at 0Â°, bilaterally. We chronically fixed the fiber position on the skull using dental cement (Meta bond).</p>

<title>Auditory Stimuli</title>
<p>Sound stimuli were delivered from a calibrated free-field speaker (ES1 SN:4568) using a multifunction processor (ED1; Tucker-Davis Technologies). The speakers were calibrated with a free-field microphone (Type 4939, Bruel and Kjaer). The stimuli were comprised of pure tones, sampled at 500 kHz, between 7.07 to 14 kHz for behavioral training and 4-40 kHz for passive listening. All stimuli were played at sound pressure levels of 72 dB SPL for behavioral training, and 72-, 62-, 52-, 42-, and 32-dB SPLs for passive listening. All tones were played in randomized order.</p>

<title>Automated home-cage training (the âEducageâ)</title>
<p>For a detailed description of the EduCage behavioral platform, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. After RFID-implantation, groups of 5 mice were placed in their home-cage that was connected to a behavioral chamber called the Educage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Mice were provided with food <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Water access was restricted to the Educage chamber. Mice could access the Educage freely to retrieve water mixed with 5% sucrose. The behavioral training was controlled by a custom LabView 2019 (National Instruments) program running on BNC-2110 (National Instruments) and FPGA (MyRIO â National Instruments) to register licks, RFIDs numbers, and deliver stimuli and reinforcements. Every time a mouse entered the water port its RFID was automatically recognized, a trial initiated, and an auditory stimulus played from a speaker vertically positioned above the behavioral chamber. We trained mice gradually for three weeks on a Go/No-Go paradigm of pure tones, spaced around a category boundary of 10 kHz. This paradigm enabled us to efficiently compare between adolescent and adult behavior, since learning was restricted from post-weaning (P20) to adolescence (P37) (correspondingly adults were trained from P60-P77). Mice were trained in four separate training phases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). For the first 24h (P20-P21 in the adolescent group of mice and P60-P61 in adult mice) mice were habituated to the behavioral chamber and could approach the port freely to retrieve water after licking the waterspout (0.0015 ml per trial). During the following 48h (P21-P23 in the adolescent group of mice and P61-P63 in adult mice) mice underwent a tone-association phase. All tones played were 300ms long (sampled at 500 kHz). Tone association was restricted to the lowest Go tone (7.07 kHz at 100% probability). Mice received a water-reward in response to licking during the first 2 seconds after tone-offset. This was followed by the first tone-discrimination stage, which contained a No-Go tone (14.14 kHz at 45% probability) at 1 octave away from the Go tone. We analyzed four response outcomesâHits, Misses, Correct Rejections, False Alarmsâ in the 2 seconds response window after the tone-offset. âHitsâ were counted after 5 successful licks to the Go-tone and followed by a water-reward. âMissesâ were counted when licks to the Go-tone trials did not pass the lick threshold. Correspondingly, âCorrect Rejectâ (CR) trials, were all No-Go trials below the lick threshold. CR trials were not reinforced. âFalse Alarmsâ (FA) were counted when 5 or more licks were registered after the No-Go. FA trials were followed by a white-noise punishment (5-20 kHz at 72 dB SPLs, 2 seconds) and an inter trial delay of 5 seconds. In addition, mice were exposed to 5 probe trials (tones whose trial outcome that were neither rewarded nor punished at 8.49 kHz, 9.567 kHz, 10 kHz, 10.44 kHz, and 11.89 kHz; played at 2% per tone). Mice trained on the 1 octave tone discrimination for 1 week (P23-P30 in adolescent mice and P63-P70 in adult mice). Next, we added a second pair of tone - a Go/No-Go tone pair spaced 0.25 octaves apart (9.17 kHz and 10.95 kHz) for another week of training. All tones were played in randomized order and trial difficulties of the easy and the hard task were intermingled. The experiment was terminated at age P37 for adolescent and P77 for adult mice.</p>

<sec id="s8d2">
<title>Head-fixed training</title>
<p>We used a head-fixed paradigm that enabled us to efficiently train adolescent and adult mice on the same task and record from engaged mice after learning. We trained mice on the same Go/No-Go stimulus setup of the Educage described above with few differences which are outlined below.</p>
<p>The head-fixed behavioral training was controlled by a custom MATLAB 2023B (Mathworks) program running on BNC-2110 (National Instruments) to register licks and deliver stimuli and reinforcements. Mice were water-restricted for 24h prior to training, and their weight monitored daily. While training on the setup, mice received water supplemented with 5% sucrose, depending on their weight (0.125 ml per g of body weight). Additional water, in the form of Hydrogel (ClearH2O) was given after daily training if mice did not consume the required amount during training, or their body weight dropped below 85% of the pre-restriction weight. Mice were gradually habituated to the setup by head-fixation and received free water after licking, during the first training day (P23 in adolescent mice and P63in adult mice). Licking was measured with an optical lick-meter (Sanworks). During the second training day mice were associated with a tone. All tones of the task were 100ms long (sampled at 500 kHz). Mice received a water reward in response to licking in the first 2 seconds after tone offset. Reward-reinforcement was delayed to 0.5 seconds after the tone offset. To break the regularity of the trial sequences, we applied a dynamic inter-trial interval of 6-8 seconds. New trials were initiated if mice did not lick the spout at least 2 seconds prior to the upcoming trial. Mice were familiarized with the tone for at least two training days (P24-26 in adolescent mice and P64-66 in adult mice). Then, and when the lick rate was above 80%, mice proceeded to the first tone discrimination stage. We gradually increased the probability of No-Go trials, depending on the lick rate of the mouse. We added the 0.25 octave Go/No-Go tone pair, after a maximal of seven training days on the 1 octave tone pair (P26-33 in adolescent mice and P66-73 in adult mice), or if the behavioral performance exceeded a threshold of dâ = 1, as calculated using the signal detection metric. Similar to the Educage, all tones were played in randomized order and trial difficulties of the easy and the hard task were intermingled. Mice were trained until P37 in the adolescent group and P77 in the adult group.</p>

<title>Optogenetic Manipulation</title>
<p>Adult mice (P60) were injected with AAV5-CAMKII-GtACR2-FRED_kv_2.1 (n = 3) and implanted with cannulas prior to training as described above. Mice underwent optogenetic stimulation after training on the head-fixed task by attaching a ferrule patch cable (M79L01; Thorlabs) to the implanted cannula using a mating sleeve (ADAF1; Thorlabs). The ferrule cable end (SMA connector) was connected to an LED driver setup (LEDD1B; Thorlabs) that enabled us to send precise outputs at 476 nm (blue light; 5mW) bilaterally. To test the effect of ACx inhibition on task performance, we timed the LED output to 50ms before tone onset until 50ms after tone-offset. The LED consisted of pulses given at 10 Hz for 200ms Behavioral sessions of optogenetic manipulation were identical to the Go/No-Go paradigm of previous training sessions. We inhibited ACx in 50% of the trials in randomized order. Optogenetic manipulations were repeated throughout multiple sessions of expert performance. As a control, we repeated the same experiment in mice injected with AAV9-CAMKII-dTomato (n = 3). After completion of the experiment, animals were deeply anesthetized with Ketamine-and medetomidine (0.008 g/kg, and 0.65 mg/kg, respectively) and then perfused with 4% Paraformaldehyde. After the perfusion, the brain was extracted and preserved. We then sectioned the ACx using a cryostat (Leica) into 0.05 mm thick coronal slices. Afterwards brain slices were washed one time under 1% Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and a second time with 1% PBS plus 0.4% Triton. Finally, slides were mounted and stained with DAPI (4%) and imaged using a wide-field fluorescent microscope (Olympus Life Science, Olympus IX83), to reconstruct the probe position offline.</p>

<title>Recording setup</title>
<p>Before the onset of the recording session, we removed the silicon elastomer and placed an external reference electrode (Ag/AgCl wire) on the skull of the right hemisphere. All recordings were performed using Neuropixels 1.0 (Npx; IMEC, phase 3A), together with a base-station connected to a chassis (IMEC; NI PXIe â1071, National Instruments). Probes were mounted to a custom-made steel rod and connected to the ground. Before penetration, probes were covered with a fluorescent dye (Dil (Invitrogen catalog #V22885-red, or Dio (Invitrogen catalog #V22886 â yellow), to reconstruct penetration sites after the recording.</p>
<p>Then, Npx probes were inserted into the left ACx at 30Â° to a depth of 3.85 mm (this approach limited our recording to deep layers of the ACx). The skull surface was submerged in saline and the probe allowed to settle for 10 min. We sampled recordings at 20 kHz, with action potential band filtered to contain 0.3-to 10kHz frequencies. Action potential band gain was set to 500. Out of the 960 available sites on the 1 cm shank of the Npx probe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>], we acquired the 384 lowest recording shanks in a staggered configuration. We used common-average referencing to process the voltage-traces.</p>

<title>Recording Schedule</title>
<p>We performed recordings of both novice and expert adolescent and adult mice. Novice recordings were performed after tone-association (see <italic>head-fixed training;</italic> adolescent n=3; adult n = 3). Expert recordings were performed after learning (adolescent n= 5; adult n = 6). Both novice and expert recording include the easy (1 octave) and hard (0.25 octave) tone pair. Both recordings were performed after P37 for adolescent mice and after P77 for adult mice. Tone probabilities and protocol parameters were identical to the <italic>head-fixed training</italic>. Each mouse was recorded multiple times (novice recordings adolescents n = 6; novice recording adults n =6; expert recordings in adolescents n = 13; expert recordings in adults n = 14). In some mice, after the recording in the engaged configuration, we recorded neural activity under passive listening conditions to a pure tone protocol (novice recordings adolescents n = 6; novice recording adults n = 6; expert recordings in adolescents n = 4; expert recordings in adults n = 4). The pure tone protocol was comprised of 20 different frequencies, logarithmically spaced between 4 and 40 kHz, presented at 5 sound pressure levels (see <italic>Auditory stimuli</italic>). Each frequency and attenuation combination were presented 16 times. The tone interval was set to 1 second. After completion of the recording schedule, animals were deeply anesthetized with Ketamine and medetomidine (0.008 g/kg, and 0.65 mg/kg, respectively) and perfused with 4% Paraformaldehyde. After the perfusion, we performed histological analysis and sectioned coronal brain slices as described above (see <italic>Optogenetic Manipulation</italic>) to reconstruct the exact probe position.</p>

The following parameters were set to determine SUs: physiologically plausible waveform shape (1â2 ms, biphasic/triphasic), high spike-amplitude (&gt; 50 ÂµV, SNR &gt; 3), physiologically plausible refractory period (ISI &gt; 4ms), sufficient inter-spike-interval (ISI peak 5â10 ms), sufficient firing-rate across the recording (&gt;0.1 spikes/sec), and principal-component cluster density (high density and low overlap). In addition, SUs were compared to neighboring units, based on waveform, firing rate, drift-pattern and cross-correlograms to determine merging of two SUs into a single cluster (Pearson Correlation Coefficient &gt;0.8).

<title>Behavioral analysis</title>
<p>We categorized behavioral responses of the task into hit, miss, false alarm, and correct reject responses. To compare behavioral performance, we calculated the dâ value based on the signal detection metric (dâ = the inverse normal distribution of the z-scored hit rate) â the z-scored (false alarm rate)). Z-scored values of 1 were rounded to 0.99, to avoid dâ approaching infinity. Unless, defined differently dâ was defined for the last 100 trials. Next, we calculated psychometric curves based on the lick rate (above the lick threshold) to learned and probe trials (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b, c, e</xref>). Psychometric curves were normalized and fitted to a sigmoidal function, defined as follows:

Where <italic>a</italic> denotes the lick rate, <italic>b</italic> = the time of the inflection point, and <italic>c</italic> = the steepness of the curve. Based on the normalized psychometric curve, we extracted two inflection points (random lick rate at 0.5 and category boundary at 10 kHz). To compare the heterogeneity of adolescent and adult behavior, we calculated the criterion bias (the inverse normal distribution of the (â0.5*(z-scored (hit rate) + z-scored (false alarm rate))) and analyzed the coefficient of variation (CV) of behavior across the learning. We applied similar behavioral measurements to the Educage training and head-fixed training, as well as recordings and optogenetic manipulation during task performance. During expert-performance in the head-fixed task, we analyzed the running dâ as the average performance of bins of 25 trials (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In addition, we also calculated the average lick trace during the reinforcement delay.

<title>Neuronal analysis</title>
<p>Probe trajectories and location of SUs were reconstructed using Allen CCF tools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cortex-lab/allenCCF">https://github.com/cortex-lab/allenCCF</ext-link>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]). For further analysis we only considered SUs that were recorded from infragranular layers 5 and layer 6. SUs from the dorsal-auditory cortex (AUDd), primary auditory cortex (AUDp), ventral auditory cortex (AUDv) and temporal association cortex (TEa) were pooled together as auditory cortex (ACx), and in some analyses presented separately[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Neurons were considered excitatory auditory responsive if the average spontaneous firing rate (FR) of the baseline activity preceding the tone (200ms to 50ms before stimulus onset) was significantly lower than the average tone-related activity (from stimulus onset until 50ms after stimulus offset) across all trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. The difference was tested with a right-sided Wilcoxon sign rank test (p &lt; 0.05). Suppressed auditory responsive units and non-auditory responsive units were excluded from the analysis. Peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) were smoothed with a gaussian smoothing filter of 5ms. To test the difference between adolescent and adult auditory firing properties in expert mice, we calculated the difference in average spontaneous FR (â200ms preceding the tone onset until tone-onset, average evoked FR (tone onset until 50ms after tone offset) and fraction of responsive trials. We also compared the coefficient of variance of the evoked FR (mean FR divided by standard deviation of the FR across trials). Temporal differences in firing properties were compared by calculating the latency to peak (latency of the highest FR), minimal latency (first spike after tone-onset), full-width-half-maximum (FWHM; time from peak FR to baseline FR), and the lifetime sparseness, which was calculated as follows:

<title>Single neuron analysis during task performance</title>
<p>We investigated the FR of excitatory auditory responses per trial from 200ms preceding the stimulus up to 600ms after the tone onset. To test how well single neurons discriminate between trial outcomes, as well as task difficulty, we calculated task-related activity per trial using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and calculated the area under the curve (AUC) across a running window of 25ms in bins of 50ms (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Stimulus-related activity was defined as the hit compared to the false alarm trials, separately for the 1 octave and 0.25 octave tone pair. Stimulus-related activity of miss compared to correct trials were not analyzed due to the lack of miss trials in expert performance. In addition, we also tested the average (mean of 1 octave and 0.25 octave tone pair) choice discrimination, defined as the difference between false alarm and correct reject trials (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). We sampled 20 trials per trial outcome and repeated the ROC encoding 100 times. Afterwards, we adjusted the average AUC values of all iterations of each neuron to its baseline AUC before the tone onset ((AUC â baseline AUC) + 0.5). AUC values close to 0.5 indicate a low neuronal discriminability, and values up to 1 indicate high neuronal discriminability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. To test significant discrimination, we repeated the ROC encoding with shuffled trial identities (20 randomly shuffled trials per trial outcomes across 100 iterations). Significant discriminability of a neuron was defined as the AUC time bins that exceed the mean Â±3 std of the shuffled distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. Adolescent and adult neuronal discriminability were compared using the onset-latency of discrimination of a neuron (first timepoint &gt; mean Â±3 std of the shuffled distribution), the maximal AUC of the running window and the duration of discriminability (time duration &gt; mean Â±3 std of the shuffled distribution;). To compare novice and expert performance we repeated the AUC encoding and compared the general discrimination of 1 octave and 0.25 octave Go and No-Go discrimination of all trial outcomes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). To evaluate the correlation of behavioral performance and neuronal discriminability, we compared dâ per recording to the average of the maximal AUC of all neurons per recording. The AUC and dâ values were compared via pairwise Pearson correlation.</p>

<title>Auditory cortex population analysis during task performance</title>
<p>We analyzed the population activity in the ACx of adolescent and adult mice on a trial-by-trial basis. Population activity was segregated by hit and correct-reject trials for both easy and hard tasks in each age group. We excluded recordings that contained fewer than 20 auditory-responsive neurons, fewer than 20 hit or correct-reject trials in either task. This resulted in a total of 8 adolescent sessions and 10 adult sessions. To decode the stimulus from neural activity, we applied linear-discriminant analysis (LDA) to the first 200ms following stimulus onset. Decoding accuracy was calculated on held-out trials (10 trials per stimulus; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). To examine changes in decoding accuracy over time, we used a 50ms bin width and fitted separate LDA models at each time point, covering a period from â0.5s to 10s after stimulus onset (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>).

<graphic xlink:href="636101v3_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
We used robust linear regression without intercept (Huber loss) to fit the relationship between separations in easy and hard tasks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). To quantify when the decoding accuracy is significantly different from the baseline, we used the bin width with a sample frequency of 100 Hz. Baseline decoding accuracy was calculated as the mean and variance of decoding accuracy during a 500ms window before stimulus onset, up to 50ms before onset. Decoding latency was defined as the time from stimulus onset to the first time point where decoding accuracy exceeded three standard deviations from the baseline mean (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). One adolescent session, in which behavioral dâ is less than 1, has decoding accuracy that does not exceed three standard deviations from the baseline mean within the first 200 ms. Therefore, this session was excluded from the latency analysis. Finally, we assessed the single-trial variance across both age groups and tasks. Data were standardized per neuron before computing variance per stimulus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). To visualize the results, we projected the population representations to the space spanned by the two LDA decoding dimensions for the easy and hard tasks. We averaged the mean and covariance matrix across sessions for each stimulus and age group, representing the distributions with corresponding ellipses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>).</p>

<title>Single neuron analysis during passive listening</title>
<p>We extracted the frequency-response areas (FRAs) based on the pure-tone responses (from tone onset up to 50ms after tone-offset) of auditory responsive neurons. The bandwidth of excited units was computed for significant excitatory responses of adjacent frequencies at 62 dB SPL and subtracted by the number of expected false-positive responses. Afterwards the sum of significant frequency responses per neuron was multiplied by the octave distance between every frequency to receive an octave-based bandwidth measure. We then calculated the population sparseness as the fraction of significant excited responses in adolescent and adult novice and expert mice. To test the neuronal discriminability to pure tone responses, we calculated the pairwise dâ based on the FR per trial in all frequencies at 62 dB SPL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. For two given frequencies p and q, dâ values were calculated in the following way:
<disp-formula id="eqn4">

</disp-formula>
Where d represents the distance between the mean FR (<italic>Î¼</italic>) of frequency p and q, as vectors with n entries representing the mean signal (averaged over individual trials) in n-dimensional space for frequency p/q. The average distance (d) is then divided by the mean of the inner Euclidian distance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="636101v3_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> between each single trial (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7h</xref>).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical comparisons were performed in custom-written codes in MATLAB 2023b (MathWorks) and Python 3.12. We assessed if the data was normally distributed using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Normally distributed data was tested using a paired (within group comparison) or independent (between group comparison) t-test and presented with mean Â± STE. Non-normally distributed data was tested using a Wilcoxon sign rank (within group comparison), or rank-sum (between group comparison) test. Multiple-samples were tested with ANOVA (parametric data) and Kruskal-Wallis tests (non-parametric data). All tests corrected after multiple comparisons (Bonferroni-correction for two-samples and Tukey-Kramer for multiple samples). In addition, we applied linear-mixed-effect models (LME) to account for hierarchical data structures and variability within groups of co-housed mice, as well as repeated measurements of mice and recordings, as random effects. Fixed effects, and pairwise interaction effects were adjusted with post-hoc tests and multiple comparisons. For all statistical tests significant differences were defined as p-values below 0.05.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study suggests that adolescent mice exhibit less accuracy than adult mice in a sound discrimination task when the sound frequencies are very similar. The evidence supporting this observation is <bold>solid</bold> and suggests that it arises from cognitive control differences between adolescent and adult mice. The adolescent period is largely understudied, despite its contribution to shaping the adult brain, which makes this study interesting for a broad range of neuroscientists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Praegel et al. explore the differences in learning an auditory discrimination task between adolescent and adult mice. Using freely-moving (Educage) and head-fixed paradigms, they compare behavioral performance and neuronal responses over the course of learning. The mice were initially trained for seven days on an easy pure frequency tone Go/No-go task (frequency difference of one octave), followed by seven days of a harder version (frequency difference of 0.25 octave). While adolescents and adults showed similar performance on the easy task, adults performed significantly better on the harder task. Quantifying the lick bias of both groups, the authors then argue that the difference in performance is not due to a difference in perception, but rather to a difference in cognitive control. The authors then used neuropixel recordings across 4 auditory cortical regions to quantify the neuronal activity related to the behavior. At the single cell level, the data shows earlier stimulus-related discrimination for adults compared to adolescents in both the easy and hard tasks. At the neuronal population level, adults displayed a higher decoding accuracy and lower onset latency in the hard task as compared to adolescents. Such differences were not only due to learning, but also to age as concluded from recordings in novice mice. After learning, neuronal tuning properties had changed in adults but not in adolescent. Overall, the differences between adolescent and adult neuronal data correlates with the behavior results in showing that learning a difficult task is more challenging for younger mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The behavioral task is well designed, with the comparison of easy and difficult tasks allowing for a refined conclusion regarding learning across age. The experiments with optogenetics and novice mice are completing the research question in a convincing way.</p>
<p>The analysis, including the systematic comparison of task performance across the two age groups, is most interesting and reveals differences in learning (or learning strategies?) that are compelling.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Praegel et al. explore the differences in learning an auditory discrimination task between adolescent and adult mice. Using freely-moving (Educage) and head-fixed paradigms, they compare behavioral performance and neuronal responses over the course of learning. The mice were initially trained for seven days on an easy pure frequency tone Go/No-go task (frequency difference of one octave), followed by seven days of a harder version (frequency difference of 0.25 octave). While adolescents and adults showed similar performance on the easy task, adults performed significantly better on the harder task. Quantifying the lick bias of both groups, the authors then argue that the difference in performance is not due to a difference in perception, but rather to a difference in cognitive control. The authors then used neuropixel recordings across 4 auditory cortical regions to quantify the neuronal activity related to the behavior. At the single cell level, the data shows earlier stimulus-related discrimination for adults compared to adolescents in both the easy and hard tasks. At the neuronal population level, adults displayed a higher decoding accuracy and lower onset latency in the hard task as compared to adolescents. Such differences were not only due to learning, but also to age as concluded from recordings in novice mice. After learning, neuronal tuning properties had changed in adults but not in adolescent. Overall, the differences between adolescent and adult neuronal data correlates with the behavior results in showing that learning a difficult task is more challenging for younger mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The behavioral task is well designed, with the comparison of easy and difficult tasks allowing for a refined conclusion regarding learning across age. The experiments with optogenetics and novice mice are completing the research question in a convincing way.</p>
<p>The analysis, including the systematic comparison of task performance across the two age groups, is most interesting, and reveals differences in learning (or learning strategies?) that are compelling.</p>
<p>Neuronal recording during both behavioral training and passive sound exposure is particularly powerful, and allows interesting conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The presentation of the paper must be strengthened. Inconsistencies, missing information or confusing descriptions should be fixed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have carefully re-read the manuscript and reviewed it for inconsistencies. We made several corrections in the figures. For example, we removed redundant lines from violin plots and statistics, applied consistent labels, matched y- and x-limits of graphics, and adjusted labels. We also clarified descriptions of some experiment by adding explanations to the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The recording electrodes cover regions in the primary and secondary cortices. It is well known that these two regions process sounds quite differently (for example, one has tonotopy, the other not), and separating recordings from both regions is important to conclude anything about sound representations. The authors show that the conclusions are the same across regions for Figure 4, but is it also the case for the subsequent analysis? Comparing to the original manuscript, the authors have now done the analysis for AuDp and AUDv separately, and say that the differences are similar in both regions. The data however shows that this is not the case (Fig S7). And even if it were the case, how would it compatible with the published literature?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this and previous concerns about regional differences, the manuscript now includes 4 figures (4-1, 4-3, 6-2, 7-1) and 5 supplemental tables (3,4, 5, 6, 8) that explicitly compare results across brain regions.</p>
<p>Following the reviewerâs request for subsequent analysis, we now added a new supplemental figure (Fig. S6-2) and two new supplementary tables (Tables S5, S6). We show that similar to expert mice (supplementary Table 3, and supplementary Table 4), the firing properties of adolescent and adult novice mice differ across auditory subregions (supplementary Table 5). We also show that the different auditory subregions have different firing properties (supplementary Table 6). With respect to task engagement, we show that (similar to Fig. S4-2) the neuronal discriminability in different auditory subregions is similar in both novice and expert mice (Fig. S6-2).</p>
<p>Following the comment on Fig. S7-1, we made three changes to the revised manuscript. First, we now highlight that the differences firing properties between adolescent and adult neurons in AUDp and AUDv were distinct, but not significantly different within age-group comparisons. Second, we clearly state that the learning related changes in the measured parameters are different between AUDp and AUDv. Note, however, the greater changes in adult neurons after learning remains consistent between AUDp and AUDv. Third, we softened our original claim but still highlighted the stronger learning-induced plasticity in adults.</p>
<p>Regarding the concern that different regions should show different patterns due to their known differences (e.g. tonotopy). Of course we agree that different areas differ functionally (as shown in our own previous work and here as well). However, it is still plausible, and biologically reasonable, that developmental changes may proceed in a similar direction across different areas, even if their baseline coding properties differ.</p>

Adolescent mice were found to be worse at sound frequency discrimination than adult mice.

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study combines behavioural testing in freely-moving and head-fixed mice, optogenetic manipulation and high density electrophysiological recordings in behaving mice to address important open questions about age differences in sound-guided behavior and sound representation in the auditory cortex.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>For some of the analyses that the authors conducted it is unclear what the rationale behind them is and, consequently, what conclusion we can draw from them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have carefully re-read the manuscript and reviewed it for analyses that lacked a clear rationale or conclusion. To address this, we have made several changes to clarify the reasoning and strengthen the interpretation of the results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>It would have helped if the authors had highlighted the changes they made to the manuscript compared to the original version - especially since many replies to the reviewers' comments were as vague as &quot;...we fixed some of the wording so it adheres to the data shown&quot;, or &quot;we refined our interpretation&quot;, without further details.</p>
<p>The revised version has improved substantially, and the main claims have been discussed in a more objective way. Important new analyses have been added to allow for a refined interpretation of the results. However, the presentation of the data could still be strengthened significantly (in response to comment A from last review).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the lack of detail in some of our previous responses. Our intention was to keep the replies concise, assuming that the side-by-side version with tracked changes would make the edits sufficiently clear. However, we understand the need for greater transparency. Thus, below we provide the following five lists describing the major changes: (1) List of specific reviewer recommendations, (2) list of corrections in figures, (3) list of clarity issues, (4) list of fixed mistakes, (5) list of new figures. We hope this breakdown makes the revisions clearer and more accessible.</p>
<p>List of specific reviewer recommendations:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>l.108 mentions a significant change in the vertical line of Fig 1F - Could this significance be indicated and quantified in the figure?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We quantified and indicated the significance of the vertical line in Fig. 1f and Fig. 1i.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Fig.1G - the thick and thin lines should be defined, as well as the grey and white dots (same values for adolescents, not for adults).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(a) We removed the thin inner lines from the violin plot. We define the bar (thick line) of the violin plot in an additional sentence in the methods section under data analysis (LL820-823). b) We adjusted the marker outlines in the adult data (Fig. 1G).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>the figure axis legends should be consistent (trails in Fig D vs # trails in Fig 1F)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We adjusted the axis legend to # trials in Fig. 1D.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>l.110: is d' always calculated based on the 100 last trials of a session, or is it just for Figure 1F? -etc...</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>dâ is always calculated based on the last 100 trials. To clarify this, we added a description in the methods section (L830).</p>

<p>(1) We removed the internal lines from violin plots in throughout Fig. 1-7.</p>
<p>(2) We removed the underline of the statistics throughout Fig. 1-7.</p>

<p>(7) We removed the x-label of âExperimental Groupâ from Fig. 1 to enhance consistency with other figures.</p>
<p>(8) We removed misaligned dots from the violin plots in Fig. 1g, Fig. 2f, Fig. 3f,g.</p>
<p>(9) We corrected the plot in Fig. S1-1b.</p>
<p>(10) We adjusted the y-limits of Fig. S1-1c to be consistent with Fig. S1-1d,e.</p>
<p>(11) We adjusted the x-labels and y-labels of Fig, 2, Fig. S3-1, Fig, S3-2 and Fig. 3b to âfreq. (kHz)â.</p>
<p>(12) We added the age of adolescent and adult mice to the schematic timeline in Fig. 2a.</p>
<p>(13) We added a label of the reinforcement delay to the schematic trial structure in Fig. 3b.</p>
<p>(14) We added within-group statistics to Fig. 3e and the figure legend.</p>
<p>(15) We adjusted the x-label of Fig. 3d to â# sessionsâ.</p>
<p>(16) We adjusted the x-label of Fig. 3d and Fig. S3-1b to â# licksâ.</p>
<p>(17) We changed the y-label in Fig. S3-1a, and Fig. S3-2d, e to âlick ratioâ to avoid confusion with the lick rate (Hz) that was calculated in Fig. 4 and Fig. 6.</p>
<p>(18) We replaced the titles âCAMKIIâ with âdTomatoâ in Fig. S3-2 to correctly highlight that both the experimental and control injection were CAMKII injections.</p>
<p>(19) We adjusted the x-labels and y-labels of Fig, 2, Fig. S3-1, Fig, S3-2 and Fig. 3b to âfreq. (kHz)â.</p>
<p>(20) We adjusted the y-label of Fig. S4-1c to â# neuronsâ.</p>
<p>(21) We matched the x-ticks in Fig. 4e,f.</p>
<p>(22) We matched the x-ticks in Fig. 6d-g.</p>
<p>(23) We changed the x-label in Fig. 4g, S4-2 and S6-2 to âduration (ms)â to match the figure label with the manuscript.</p>
<p>(24) We consistently label âHitâ, âMissâ, âFAâ and âCRâ with capital letters in Fig. 4d-e.</p>
<p>(25) We replaced the double figure label âC.â in Fig. S4-2 with âD.â.</p>

<p>(27) We added ticks to the experimental timeline in Fig. 6a.</p>
<p>(28) We corrected the y-label in Fig.7c. Now it correctly reflects 5 attenuations from 72-32 dB SPL.</p>
<p>(29) We matched the y-label of Fig. 7e-h and Fig. S7-1.</p>
<p>List of clarity issues:</p>
<p>(1) We replaced the term âlower response biasâ with âhigher lick biasâ (L24) to accurately describe the more negative (lower) criterion-bias, which highlights a higher tendency to lick.</p>
<p>(2) We replaced the term âresponse biasâ with âlick biasâ to consistently describe the calculated criterion-bias (L24, L149, L164, L455, L456, L468).</p>
<p>(3) We clarify that the age-related differences were âmore pronouncedâ instead of simply âhigherâ to accurately reflect not simply the increase in adolescent lick-bias, but also the decrease in adult lick-bias (L31).</p>
<p>(4) We clarified that adolescent sound representations are not merely âdistinctâ, but ânot fully matureâ in L83.</p>
<p>(5) We clarified in L180 that the impulsive responses we observed in adolescent mice could be related to being âless impacted by punishmentsâ.</p>
<p>(6) We clarified the differences in firing properties of auditory sub-regions analyzed in Supplementary Table 3 (L287-295).</p>
<p>(7) We explained and clarified the reference to Fig. 3j (LL252-253).</p>
<p>(8) We added statistics to Fig.S4-2 to support our claim that there are no differences in the onset-latency, duration of discriminability and maximal discriminability between different sub-regions within age-groups (LL 314-315).</p>
<p>(9) We expanded our explanation of the results in Table 3 (LL370-379).</p>
<p>(10) We separated the reference to Fig. 6b and Fig. 6c to clarify their meaning (LL358-361).</p>
<p>(11) We clarified the differences in basic firing properties during the FRA protocol in Fig. 7 (LL409-418).</p>
<p>(12) We expanded our explanation of the differences of the learning related firing properties in AUDp and AUDv of Fig. S7-1 (LL426-433).</p>
<p>(13) We changed the term âplasticity profilesâ to âlearning related plasticityâ to further clarify our limitation that L5/6 and L2/3 may exhibit distinct learning related changes (L496).</p>
<p>(14) We changed the term âsluggishâ (L481) to âdelayedâ to more precisely explain differences between adolescent and adult tuning properties.</p>
<p>(15) We clarified that the running dâ was calculated in bins of 25 trials, instead of âthe last 25 trialsâ (LL845-846).</p>
<p>List of fixed mistakes:</p>
<p>(1) We corrected and matched the age to more accurately reflect the age mice were recorded (P37-42 and P77-82).</p>
<p>(2) We corrected the attenuation range from 72-42 to 72-32 dB SPL to correctly reflect the 5 attenuations used in the protocol.</p>
<p>(3) We corrected the number of channels shown in the voltage trace from 10 to 11 (Fig. S4-1a)</p>
<p>(4) We corrected the number of neurons recorded in novice adolescent mice in the legend of Fig. 6 from 140 to 130 (Fig. 6b).</p>
<p>(5) We removed redundant, or double brackets, commas, dots, and semi-colons in the figure legends.</p>
<p>(6) We corrected the LME statistics Table 2.</p>
<p>List of new figures and tables:</p>
<p>(1) We added a new supplementary figure to accompany Figure 6. Specifically, Fig. S6-2, shows the interaction of the three measured discriminability properties (onset delay, duration of discriminability, and maximal discriminability) in novice compared to expert mice in the easy and hard task (Go compared to No Go). The figure compares the different auditory sub-regions (similar to Fig. S4-2). We show that the discriminability properties within different groups is not significantly different among the four different sub-regions.</p>
<p>(2) Supplementary Table 5: We compared the firing properties in different auditory subregions in novice mice, and found (similar to expert mice) that the firing properties differ between adult and adolescent mice across the four different sub-regions.</p>
<p>(3) Supplementary Table 6: We compared the firing properties between different subregions, separately for adolescent and adult novice mice. Similar to expert mice, we found that different auditory subregions differ in their auditory firing properties.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors largely addressed my suggestions.</p>
<p>Comparing hit vs correct rejection trials in the population decoding analysis (L313-314): The authors acknowledge that comparing these two trial types conflates choice and stimulus decoding but I am not convinced that the changes to the manuscript text make this clear enough to the reader.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have made additional revisions to clarify this, and other issues more explicitly, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) We have expanded the explanation of how our population decoding analysis conflates stimulus and choice, and we acknowledge the limitations of this approach in the Abstract (L28), the Results section (L324-326, LL367-370) and the Discussion (LL516-519).</p>
<p>(2) We replaced the analysis of impulsivity on the head-fixed task. Instead of analyzing all it is, we focus only on ITIs following FA trials (Fig. S3-1c,d). This is more consistent with the analysis in the Educage (Fig. S2-1), where we show that adolescents exhibit increased impulsivity after FA trials. We found a similar result for ITIs following FA trials in the head-fixed task.</p>
<p>(3) To provide complementary insight, we now further justify our use of the Fisher separation metric alongside decoding accuracy in Figure 5, with a clearer rationale provided in LL343-345</p>
<p>(4) We also clarified our reasoning for focusing on 62 dB SPL in the FRA-based analysis in LL400-403.</p>
