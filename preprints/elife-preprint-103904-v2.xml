<title>Abstract</title><p>Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most malignant cancers, and cisplatin (Cis)-based chemotherapy remains the main clinical treatment for GC. However, Cis resistance often occurs, largely limiting its therapeutic efficacy in tumors. Therefore, a better understanding of the drug resistance mechanism could reveal new approaches for improving GC treatment efficacy. Here, we define the integrative role of nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1 (NOLC1), a molecular chaperone that is significantly upregulated in GC tissues and Cis-resistant GC cells. Knocking down NOLC1 increased GC sensitivity to Cis by regulating ferroptosis. Mechanistically, NOLC1 binds to the p53 DNA binding domain (DBD), decreasing p53 nuclear accumulation stimulated by Cis and suppressing p53 transcriptional functions. Then, the p53-mediated ferroptosis is suppressed. Furthermore, the silence of NOLC1 promoted ferroptosis-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) and reprogrammed the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby increasing sensitivity to anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) therapy plus Cis. The combination of anti-PD-1 plus Cis effectively inhibited GC growth without significant side effects. In summary, our findings reveal that targeting NOLC1 may be a novel therapeutic strategy for GC and may increase the efficacy of chemotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most diagnosed cancer worldwide and the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Since GC is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, it often has a poor prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Cisplatin (Cis)-based chemotherapy remains the primary treatment for advanced GC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Chemotherapy not only has a direct cytotoxic effect but also contributes to the immunogenic cell death (ICD) and improves the efficacy of immunotherapy. Thus, immunotherapy, represented by anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) therapy, plus chemotherapy, has become the standard for first-line treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, the efficacy of chemotherapy is still restricted by chemoresistance, which is caused by gene mutations, gene inactivation, epigenetic modifications, signaling pathway changes, or cell metabolism disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>; thus, the efficacy of immune-chemotherapy is still limited in some patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Therefore, exploring novel targets of chemoresistance in GC to increase combination effectiveness is highly important for improving tumor prognosis and patient survival.</p>
<p>Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of novel regulated cell death (RCD), is regulated by various pathways, such as mitochondrial activity, oxidative stress, iron handling, and metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Recently, studies have shown that activation of ferroptosis in GC is a promising strategy for overcoming GC resistance. For example, increased ATF2 expression can alleviate Cis resistance by regulating ferroptosis in GC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Additionally, GC cells can overexpress many negative ferroptosis regulators, such as miR-522 and ACTL6A, to promote chemoresistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, ferroptotic cells can activate the immune response and reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) via releasing various damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), subsequently increasing the efficacy of immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Thus, ferroptosis may serve as a new strategy for increasing the efficacy of immunotherapy combined with Cis. It is well established that p53, a classic tumor suppressor protein, can regulate ferroptosis via multiple mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. As a traditional transcription factor (TF), p53 transcriptionally regulates several metabolic or ferroptotic targets, such as TIGAR, GLS2, and ALOX12, to mediate ferroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, inactivation of p53 tumor suppressor function is very common and plays an important role in the progression of most cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Among patients with GC, those with activated p53 status have longer overall survival than those with p53 loss of function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Recently, studies have shown that activating p53 can increase chemotherapy efficacy by promoting ferroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Therefore, activating p53 function in GC is a highly desired feature of ferroptosis-based antitumor therapy.</p>
<p>Nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1 (NOLC1), also called NOPP140, was originally identified as a nuclear localization signal binding protein (NLS) and functions as a molecular chaperone that shuttle between the cytoplasm and nuclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. NOLC1 is up-regulated in most cancers and promotes non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resistant to multiple drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Moreover, NOLC1 can interact with the MDM2 promoter at the p53 binding site, and NOLC1 was also identified mediate by p53 via an RNAi-mediated synthetic interaction screen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. However, the specific expression level and functions of NOLC1 in GC remains unclear.</p>
<p>Here, we found that NOLC1 is up-regulated in GC tumors and GC resistant cells. High expression of NOLC1 promotes GC Cis resistance by suppressing ferroptosis. Further studies revealed that NOLC1 interacts with the p53 DNA Binding Domain (DBD) and suppress p53 nuclear accumulation, thus inhibiting p53 transcription-mediated ferroptosis. Eventually, the knockdown of NOLC1 activated the ferroptosis-mediated ICD and significantly improved the efficacy of low-dose anti-PD-1 plus Cis without side effects. Collectively, this study identified a novel network mediated by NOLC1 that regulates p53-mediated ferroptosis in GC and identified a new target for GC immunotherapy in combination with Cis.</p>

<title>High expression of NOLC1 is associated with poor clinical outcomes in GC</title>
<p>Recent studies have demonstrated that NOLC1 is up-regulated in most cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. However, the expression of NOLC1 in GC is still unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we collected GC patients’ tumor and near-tumor tissues to measure NOLC1 expression level. As is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S1 A</xref>, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining demonstrated that NOLC1 protein level was much higher in GC tissues than in near-tumor tissues. Compared with that of normal tissues, the average optical density (AOD) score was notably greater in GC tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Consistently, as is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-D</xref>, western blotting (WB) results also revealed the same trend: NOLC1 was highly expressed in GC tissues. Analysis of the TCGA database also revealed that NOLC1 is up-regulated in GC tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-F</xref>). We next used the Kaplan‒Meier plotter database to assess whether high expression of NOLC1 influenced GC patient outcomes. Higher NOLC1 expression level was related to shorter overall survival (OS), time to first progression (FP), and postprogression survival (PPS) in patients with GC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G-I</xref>). Taken together, all these results suggest that NOLC1 protein levels are increased in GC and that NOLC1 may promote the progression of GC.</p>

<p>Since NOLC1 is highly expressed and promotes resistance to multiple drugs in NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, we further detected whether NOLC1 is associated with GC resistance. To investigate the expression of NOLC1 in Cis-resistant GC, a Cis-resistant MGC-803 (MGC-803-CR) was established. CCK-8, colony formation, and annexin V-APC/7-AAD apoptosis assays revealed that MGC-803-CR cells were less sensitive to Cis than MGC-803 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S2 A-E</xref>). Next, the expression of NOLC1 in MGC-803-CR cells was detected. WB showed that NOLC1 is highly expressed in MGC-803-CR cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S3A</xref>). The cleaved PARP protein level was significantly lower than that in MGC-803 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S3B</xref>), further supporting that MGC-803-CR cells are resistant to Cis. Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that NOLC1 was upregulated in both the cytoplasm and nucleolus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S3C</xref>). These data indicate that NOLC1 is highly expressed in the Cis-resistance cell line. In addition, we used mRNA-seq to analyze the specific biological pathway alterations in MGC-803-CR cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S3 D, E</xref>, the expression level of components of the Hippo signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT pathway, p53 signaling pathway, etc., significantly differed between MGC-803-CR cells and MGC-803 cells.</p>

<title>NOLC1 knockdown increases the sensitivity of GC to Cis in <italic>vitro</italic> and in <italic>vivo</italic></title>
<p>To investigate the functions of NOLC1 in Cis-resistance GC, lentiviral shRNA constructs (shNOLC#1, #2, or #3) used to knock down endogenous NOLC1 gene expression in GC cell lines, MGC-803 and MKN-45 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S4 A-D</xref>). CCK-8 assay revealed that NOLC1 silencing significantly decreased the viability of MGC-803 and MKN-45 cells upon Cis treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Meanwhile, overexpression (OE) of NOLC1 promoted Cis resistance in MGC-803 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A). The colony formation assay results also revealed that knockdown NOLC1 could significantly decreased the numbers of colonies after Cis treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>). Moreover, the annexin V-APC/7-AAD apoptosis assay revealed that Cis induced cell death to a greater degree in the NOLC1 knockdown group than in the control group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-E</xref>), suggesting that NOLC1 enhance the Cis-resistance in GC cells.</p>

<p>Since Cis exerts its cytotoxic effects by binding to DNA to form DNA-platinum adducts and destroy DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The toxic effects of Cis on DNA were further evaluated via immunofluorescence (IF) staining of γ-H2AX (Ser-139) and comet assays. The IF results revealed increased aggregation of γ-H2AX foci in the knockdown group after treatment with Cis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F-G</xref>). Comet assays involving electrophoresis were performed and revealed that negligible DNA fragments migrated out of the nucleus in the negative control (NC) group treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), while DNA tails were observed outside the nucleus after treatment with Cis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). In particularly, a more pronounced tailing shape of DNA strands was found in the knockdown group, especially after treatment with Cis, indicating that NOLC1 knockdown enhances Cis-induced DNA damage. Moreover, the WB results revealed that the protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP were increased after treatment with Cis, especially in the knockdown group, which presented a greater degree of increasing accompanied by decreased expression of PARP and caspase-3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S5B</xref>) suggesting that Cis induced more severe DNA damage in the NOLC1 knockdown group. Taken together, these findings indicate that NOLC1 knockdown enhances Cis cytotoxicity in GC cells.</p>
<p>To determine whether NOLC1 affects GC Cis-resistance <italic>in vivo</italic>, we constructed xenograft GC models in BALB/c-nu mice. Randomly divided the mice into two groups and subcutaneously injected with MGC-803 cells (shNC or shNOLC1). When the tumor volume reached about 100 mm<sup>3</sup>, randomly divided each group into two subgroups (PBS and Cis), for a total of four groups. Cis or PBS was then administered to the mice via intraperitoneal injection twice per week for a total of 6 times (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The results showed that Cis treatment effectively slowed the growth of the xenografts. The NOLC1-knockdown groups were more sensitive to Cis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-E</xref>). Next, we further compare the therapeutic effects used hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and IHC staining to detect the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and Ki-67 in the tumors. H&amp;E staining revealed that the NOLC1-knockdown groups presented a larger necrotic area in the tumor tissues after Cis treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-G</xref>). The IHC results revealed that Cis decreased Ki-67 protein levels, and the NOLC1-knockdown groups presented lower levels than did the NC group. The cleaved caspase-3 level was increased after Cis treatment, and in the knockdown groups, the cleaved caspase-3 level was greater than that in the NC groups. Collectively, all these data indicate that NOLC1 knockdown increased Cis sensitivity in gastric xenografts <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>NOLC1 suppresses Cis-induced ferroptosis</title>
<p>Cis can induce apoptosis to kill cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Also, other functions of Cis, such as inducing ferroptosis, which plays a pivotal role in Cis resistance have also been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. To determine which type of regulated cell death (RCD) is primarily blocked by NOLC1, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to observe specific morphological changes in the MGC-803 and MKN-45 cells. The results revealed that cells with NOLC1 knockdown exhibied shrunken mitochondria and increased membrane density. After Cis treatment, the mitochondrial membrane was severely disrupted, and the mitochondrial cristae disappeared in the knockdown group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S6A</xref>). These are the classic characteristic morphological features of ferroptosis. Moreover, the erastin (a ferroptosis activator) induced cell death was also suppressed by NOLC1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S6B</xref>). Fer-1 (a ferroptosis inhibitor) could rescue the sensitization effect of NOLC1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S6C</xref>). These findings indicate that NOLC1 might strongly inhibit ferroptosis to promote Cis resistance. During ferroptosis, ferroptotic cell lipid membrane structure is disrupted. We further examined specific ferroptotic cell lipid membrane morphological changes in response to Cis after NOLC1 knockdown. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays revealed that after treatment with Cis, higher levels of LDH were detected in the knockdown groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S6D</xref>), indicating more severe destruction of the membrane structure in the knockdown group. Meanwhile, the high level of LDH release could be blocked by Fer-1 in knockdown groups, further reflected that NOLC1 promotes Cis resistance by suppresses ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S6E</xref>). Moreover, the JC-1 probe results indicated that the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased in the NOLC1 knockdown group after Cis treatment, indicating that the mitochondrial membrane was also disrupted (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S6F-G</xref>).

<p>Disruption of the cell lipid membrane during ferroptosis is caused by lipid peroxides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, we further detected the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level after NOLC1 knockdown using 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining and analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and confocal microscopy. Compared with the negligible ROS accumulation of the NC groups, the knockdown groups presented a greater level of ROS accumulation, especially when treated with Cis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S6H-I</xref>). MitoPeDPP, which accumulates in the inner mitochondrial membrane, can be oxidized by lipid peroxides and release strong fluorescence. Using MitoPeDPP probes, we found that, in the NOLC1-knockdown groups, the rate of mitochondrial-specific ROS accumulation was significantly higher than that in the negative control (NC) group at the same Cis treatment time. (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S6J</xref>). Also, a greater level of fluorescence accumulation in the mitochondria was observed after treatment with Cis in the knockdown groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Moreover, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content increased after Cis treatment, and the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content in the knockdown groups was much greater than that in the NC groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). These data indicated that lipid ROS significantly accumulated in the NOLC1 knockdown group. In line with the above data, the key protein involved in ferroptosis, GPX4, were obviously downregulated in the NOLC1 knockdown group both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S7A, B</xref>). Moreover, FSP1 was decreased and ACSL4 was increased in the knockdown group reflecting that NOLC1 could effectively suppress ferroptosis. Taken together, these data show that NOLC1 primarily inhibits Cis induced ferroptosis to promote GC resistance.</p>

<title>NOLC1 binds to p53 and blocks p53 translocation</title>
<p>Next, we further investigated the molecular mechanism of which NOLC1 promotes resistance in GC. Recent research has shown that the function of NOLC1 is associated with p53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In addition, via mRNA-seq, we found that the p53 signal pathway was obviously altered in MGC-803-CR cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S3E</xref>). Thus, we assumed that NOLC1-mediated suppression of ferroptosis promotes GC resistance via regulating p53.</p>
<p>To verify our hypothesis, the p53 protein level was measured, and the results indicated that the p53 protein level increased when the cells were treated with Cis, further confirming that p53 is upregulated in stressed cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S8A</xref>). However, in the knockdown group, the p53 level was lower than that in the NC group and was not associated with cell death trends. BAX is a proapoptotic protein whose transcription is mediated by p53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. BCL-2 is an antiapoptotic protein which is mediated by p53 via protein interaction in cytoplasm. Intersetingly, the increase of BAX level after NOLC1 knockdown was out of line with the p53 protein level trend but in line with the cell death trend, but the BCL-2 level was in line with p53 level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S8B</xref>). Additionally, according to the IHC results, p53 expression was also decreased in the knockdown group <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S8C</xref>). Thus, we assume that after NOLC1 is knocked down, the transcriptional functions of p53 increased, but the protein level decreased. To validate our hypothesis, we detected the transcriptional activity levels of p53 and downstream genes of p53 (CDKN1A, BAX, FAS, and PTEN) expression. Dual luciferase assay shown p53 transcription is activated by Cis, indicating that p53 is activated when cells are stressed. Knocking down NOLC1 significantly increased p53 activity in both MGC-803 and MKN-45 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S8D</xref>). Meanwhile, NOLC1 overexpression in HEK-293T cells obviously decreased p53 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Additionally, the activity of NC reporter and that of the mut p53 reporter did not significantly differ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S8E, F</xref>). Real-Time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results revealed that CDKN1A, BAX, FAS, and PTEN mRNA levels were increased in the knockdown group both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S8G, H</xref>).

<p>Considering that, as a molecular chaperone, NOLC1 can interact with other proteins, such as TRF2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, to regulate their functions, we assume that NOLC1 regulates p53 functions via interacts with p53. Thus, the docking studies were performed. The results showed that NOLC1 can interact with p53 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). The binding energy of NOLC1 to p53 was -236.13 kcal/mol, and the binding sites of p53 are all in the DNA-binding domain (DBD), which is responsible for transcription (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In addition, the surface of the p53 protein matched well with that of the NOLC1 protein, which promoted stable binding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E, F</xref>). To verify the potential interaction between NOLC1 and p53, we carried out coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays in HEK-293T cells. As expected, immunoprecipitation of p53-HA coprecipitated with NOLC1-Flag demonstrated that NOLC1 can interact with p53 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). The IF results also revealed that NOLC1 colocalized with p53 in both HEK-293T and MGC-803 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S9A</xref>). The nuclear accumulation of p53 is crucial for its transcriptional function. To detected whether NOLC1 effect the p53 nuclear accumulation upon Cis treatment, IF was applied to detect the p53 location after Cis treatment in HEK-293T cells. Under normal conditions, NOLC1 and p53 colocalized in the cytoplasm, and p53 accumulated into the nuclear after Cis treatment. After overexpression of NOLC1, the nuclear level of p53 significantly decreased under Cis treatment, and as NOLC1 expression increased, the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of p53 gradually decreased further. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S9B</xref>). In addition, knockdown of NOLC1 significantly increased the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of p53 under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementray Fig. S9C</xref>). The WB results revealed similar trends in the GC cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>). Additionally, IHC staining revealed that the ratio of p53 nuclear positive cells was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S8C</xref>). These data indicate that NOLC1 inhibits p53 nuclear accumulation.</p>

<p>The full-length p53 protein has three conserved functional domains: a transactivation domain (TAD), a DNA binding domain (DBD), and a tetramerization domain (TAE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>). To determine which domain of p53 is responsible for its interaction with NOLC1, three functional domain constructs were generated to perform Co-IP assays. Consistent with the docking results, Co-IP assays revealed that only the DBD can interact with NOLC1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K</xref>). Meanwhile, the DBD-HA could coprecipitated NOLC1-Flag too (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L</xref>). Considering that the interaction between NOLC1 and p53 might block p53 binding to DNA, we performed ChIP-Seq to determine whether this interaction could inhibit p53 binding to specific DNA sequences. We transfected HEK-293T cells with a p53 full-length plasmid or the p53 full-length and NOLC1 plasmid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M</xref>). Then, p53 immunoprecipitation confirmed the binding of p53 to the DNA sequence. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5N</xref>, the p53 group could uniquely bind to DNA-binding transcription activator activity peaks, DNA-binding transcription factor binding peaks, etc. These findings demonstrated that NOLC1 could inhibit p53 binding to transcription-related DNA sequence. Furthermore, the data indicated that NOLC1 binds to the p53 DBD, not only to mediate p53 nuclear translocation but also to block p53 binding to DNA, eventually blocking p53-mediated ferroptosis.</p>
<p>Taken together, the above data showed that NOLC1 inhibits p53 nuclear translocation stimulated by Cis treatment and transcriptional activity by interacting with the p53 DBD.</p>

<title>NOLC1 inhibits p53 degradation via disruption of the MDM2<bold>D</bold>p53 feedback loop</title>
<p>Although we have shown that NOLC1 decreases p53 transcriptional functions, it is still unclear why the p53 protein level decreases after NOLC1 are knocked down (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). RT‒qPCR results shown there was no significant difference of the p53 mRNA level between the NC and knockdown groups (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Thus, we speculated that NOLC1 increases the p53 protein level by inhibiting its degradation. The E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, encoded by a p53-responsive gene, is the master antagonist of p53 by promoting p53 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, forming a feedback loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. On the basis of the above data, we hypothesized that NOLC1 inhibits p53 transcription-mediated MDM2, thereby reducing p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore, we next detected the MDM2 mRNA and protein levels. As is shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-D</xref>, the MDM2 mRNA and protein levels were both increased after Cis treatment, and in the knockdown groups, the levels were greater than those in the NC groups, indicating that NOLC1 knockdown also promoted p53 transcription to MDM2. Similarly, the protein level of MDM2 <italic>in vivo</italic> was also elevated in the knockdown group, as detected by IHC (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E, F</xref>). We next examined the p53 turnover rate. In the OE-NOLC1 group, the p53 turnover rate was much slower than that in the vector group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). Furthermore, ubiquitination assays indicated that NOLC1 inhibits p53 ubiquitination and that Cis treatment induce a marked decrease in the p53 ubiquitination level both in MGC-803 and HEK-293T cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that NOLC1 inhibits p53 degradation by blocking the nuclear entry and transcriptional activity of p53.

<title>p53 knockdown rescued the sensitizing effect of NOLC1 knockdown</title>
<p>Given that NOLC1 can promote GC resistance and interact with p53 to inhibit p53 transcription, whether NOLC1 promotes resistance by inhibiting p53 functions is still unclear. Thus, we next used siRNA to knock down the p53 protein in MGC-803 cells. An Annexin V-APC/7-AAD apoptosis assay revealed that NOLC1 single-knockdown cells were more sensitive to Cis than were NC cells. However, the percentage of death cells in the p53/NOLC1 double-knockdown group was not significantly different from that in the NC group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S10A-B</xref>). Furthermore, CCK-8 assay showed similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S10C</xref>).

<p>To further assess the role of NOLC1 in ferroptosis-mediated immunotherapy, subcutaneous mouse forestomach carcinoma (MFC) tumor-bearing 615 mice model were established for further study. Four-week-old male 615 mice were randomly divided into two groups and were subcutaneously injected with MFC cells (shNC or shNOLC1). When tumor volume reached about 100 mm<sup>3</sup>, each group was randomly divided into four subgroups (PBS, anti-PD-1, Cis, and Cis combined with anti-PD-1), for a total of eight groups. On the 7th, 10th, and 13th days, the mice were intraperitoneal injected drugs (Cis, anti-PD-1 antibody) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B-C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S12A</xref>, anti-PD-1 monotherapy had no significant effect in the presence of the immunosuppressive TME. Cis treatment effectively blocked the growth of tumors. PD-1 combined with Cis had the best efficacy. Importantly, NOLC1 silencing obviously increased the efficacy of Cis alone and anti-PD-1 plus Cis. Accordingly, the tumor weight data showed similar trends (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Subsequently, the therapeutic effect was confirmed by H&amp;E and IHC staining. H&amp;E staining revealed the same trend: the NOLC1 knockdown group treated with Cis+anti-PD-1 presented the most severe necrosis in the tumor tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S12B, C</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary S12D-F</xref>, Cis therapy increased the cleaved caspase-3 level and decreased the Ki-67and GPX4 levels. The Cis plus PD-1 group presented more significant changes than the Cis group did. Compared with those in the NC groups, the NOLC1 knockdown groups had higher cleaved caspase-3 and lower GPX4 and Ki-67 expressions. These findings demonstrated that NOLC1 knockdown increased the efficacy of the Cis monotherapy and combination treatment. Additionally, the knockdown group treated with anti-PD-1 plus Cis presented the highest level of nuclear p53 staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S12G</xref>), indicating that NOLC1 also mediates p53 nuclear accumulation in the MFC tumor model. Liperfluo is specifically oxidized by lipid peroxides and emits strong fluorescence. Liperflou staining revealed that the NOLC1-knockdown groups treated with Cis plus PD-1 presented the most intense fluorescence (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). The HMGB1 level in the serum was also increased in the knockdown group treated with anti-PD-1 plus Cis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S12H</xref>). Indicating NOLC1 suppresses ferroptosis in MFC tumors. Collectively, these data suggest that NOLC1 decreases the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 plus Cis therapy via suppressing Cis-induced ferroptosis.</p>

<title>Silencing NOLC1 promotes reprogramming of the TME by Cis combined with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy</title>
<p>The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in GC progression and therapeutic outcome and is correlated with the patient response to immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In addition, ferroptosis can also reprogram the TME to increase immunotherapy efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Therefore, we next explored the effect of NOLC1 knockdown on the TME. First, we collected blood samples and extracted lymphocytes. FACS was subsequently used to measure the abundance of specific lymphocytes. As is shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref> the proportions of CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which have been reported to play pivotal roles in killing cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, are significantly increased after treated with Cis plus anti-PD-1, and the proportions of CTLs in the knockdown group are much higher than that in the NC group. In addition, Cis monotherapy could increase the proportion of CTLs in the knockdown group, but not in the NC group. Furthermore, the IF staining results also revealed an increase in the number of CTLs infiltration in tumors in the knockdown group, especially in those treated with Cis plus anti-PD-1(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). The levels of tumor necrosis factor-<sub>a</sub> (TNF-<sub>a</sub>), interferon-<sub>y</sub> (IFN-<sub>y</sub>), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the combination treatment groups were significantly increased, and monotherapy did not effectively increase the levels of these factors (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). In the knockdown groups, this activation was much more obvious. Taken together, these data demonstrate that NOLC1 knockdown can promote ferroptosis-mediated ICD and reprogram the TME.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite advances in GC therapy, chemotherapy resistance remains the major obstacle to improving patient outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In this study, we identified NOLC1 as a mediator of anti-PD-1 plus Cis resistance in GC. The functions of NOLC1 in cancer is controversial, as evidenced by its pro- or antitumor potential in different tumor types and models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. NOLC1 functions as an oncogene in various tumors via different pathways. In esophageal cancer (ESCA), NOLC1 can activate the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. In ovarian cancer (OC), circ-NOLC1 binds to ESRP1 and upregulates CDK1 and RhoA expression to promote OC progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. More importantly, NOLC1 promotes non-small cell lung cancer resistance to multiple drugs. However, NOLC1 act as a tumor suppressor in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. The results of this study indicate that NOLC1 is up-regulated in GC tumors and Cis-resistant GC cells. In addition, silencing NOLC1 affected the efficacy of Cis and anti-PD-1 plus Cis combination treatment.</p>
<p>To determine its mechanism of action, we performed TEM imaging. The results revealed that after NOLC1 knockdown, cells displayed classical morphological features of ferroptosis, and treatment with a ferroptosis inhibitor counteract the Cis-sensitization effect of NOLC1 knockdown. These findings demonstrated that NOLC1 inhibits Cis-induced ferroptosis. Next, via mRNA-seq, we found that the p53 pathway, which is associated with NOLC1 functions, was significantly altered in MGC-803-CR cells. As a molecular chaperone, NOLC1 can interact with other proteins and regulate their translocation. We also revealed that NOLC1 interacts with p53 and inhibits p53 nuclear accumulation stimulated by Cis treatment rather than regulating p53 total protein levels, thus inhibiting p53 transcriptional activity. Eventually, p53-mediated ferroptosis is suppressed.</p>
<p>The mechanisms by which p53 promotes ferroptosis remain to be fully explored. Ferroptosis, a novel type of RCD, has received considerable attention in both basic and clinical research <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Recently, studies have revealed that p53 can significantly promote ferroptosis via different mechanisms. For example, p53 could transcriptional and untranscriptional mediate SLC7A11, a key component of the cystine/glutamate antiporter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Additionally, p53 can transcriptionally mediate several key ferroptosis proteins, such as TIGAR and GLS2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In this study, we found that inhibiting p53 transcriptional functions could markedly suppress ferroptosis in GC cells. These findings indicate that the transcriptional functions of p53 are critical for mediating ferroptosis.</p>
<p>Protein‒DNA interactions are central to the response of the tumor suppressor p53 to numerous stress signals. Under various stresses, p53 can enter the nuclear and bind to specific DNA via interactions between response elements (REs) and the p53 DBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Our results showed that NOLC1 interacts with the p53 DBD, which could block p53 binding to the DNA sequence, eventually inhibiting its tumor-suppressive functions. By using ChIP-seq, we found that NOLC1 strongly inhibited p53 binding to the transcription-associated DNA sequence (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M</xref>). Our results show that the interaction between NOLC1 and p53 not only inhibits p53 binding to the DNA sequence but also decreases p53 nuclear accumulation. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. S8A-B</xref>, the interaction between NOLC1 and p53 was limited to the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus. NOLC1-mediated inhibition of p53 functions relies mainly on blocking p53 nuclear accumulation rather than inhibiting its interaction with DNA.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the ability of tumor to inhibit p53 functions relies primarily on the MDM2‒p53 negative feedback loop or mutant p53 functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Our results reveal a novel way to inhibit p53 functions: sequestration of the p53 protein in the cytoplasm. p53 is mutated in 50% of cancers, and most of these mutation occur in the DBD (86% of tumorigenic mutants are present in the DBD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Therefore, this suppressive effect of NOLC1 on p53 is limited to only WT p53, and this combination of p53 and NOLC1 could further inhibit p53 functions.</p>
<p>More and more studies have shed light on the important role of p53 in immunotherapy. The activation of p53 suppresses tumor immune evasion and promotes the antitumor immune response via the cGAS-STING pathway, regulating T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity, etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. In addition, mut p53 exerts immunosuppressive effects via multiple mechanisms, such as increasing tumor-associated neutrophil infiltration, decreasing CTLs infiltration, and promoting fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Our results demonstrated that activating p53 transcriptional functions could enhance the immune response and reprogram the TME by promoting ferroptosis. Current treatments for GC have evolved significantly through systemic therapies and include chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has substantially advanced the treatment of GC with microsatellite instability (MSI) but has limited efficacy for GC with microsatellite stability (MSS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. However, MSI status is observed for only approximately 20% of GC patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Thus, identifying new molecular biomarkers is highly important. In this study, we found that NOLC1 knockdown could transform the chemoresistance tumor environment to a sensitive state. Thus, lower expression of NOLC1 could be a marker for identifying patients with a better response to combination treatment of anti-PD-1 plus Cis. Additionally, our studies identified NOLC1 could be promising target to increasing ICI sensitivity in MSS GC.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that NOLC1 binds to the p53 DBD and inhibits p53 nuclear accumulation and transcriptional functions, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis and ferroptosis-mediated ICD. Low expression of NOLC1 could be a new biomarker for identifying GC patients who may benefit from Cis plus anti-PD-1 treatment and targeting NOLC1 could increase the treatment response of anti-PD-1 plus Cis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Shengsheng Zhao et al. investigated the role of nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1 (NOLC1) in relegating gastric cancer (GC) development and cisplatin-induced drug resistance in GC. They found a significant correlation between high NOLC1 expression and the poor prognosis of GC. Meanwhile, upregulation of NOLC1 was associated with cis-resistant GC. Experimentally, the authors demonstrate that knocking down NOLC1 increased GC sensitivity to Cis possibly by regulating ferroptosis. Mechanistically, they found NOLC1 suppressed ferroptosis by blocking the translocation of P53 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and promoting its degradation. In addition, the authors also evaluated the effect of combinational treatment of anti-PD-1 and cisplatin in NOLC1 -knockdown tumor cells, revealing a potential role of NOLC1 in the targeted therapy for GC.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Chemoresistance is considered a major reason causing failure of tumor treatment and death of cancer patients. This paper explored the role of NOLC1 in the regulation of Cis-mediated resistance, which involves a regulated cell death named ferroptosis. These findings provide more evidence highlighting the study of regulated cell death to overcome drug resistance in cancer treatment, which could give us more potential strategies or targets for combating cancer.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>More evidence supporting the regulation of ferroptosis induced by Cisplatin by NOLC1 should be added. Particularly, the role of ferroptosis in the cisplatin-resistance should be verified and whether NOLC1 regulates ferroptosis induced by additional FINs should be explored. Besides, the experiments to verify the regulation of ferroptosis sensitivity by NOLC1 are sort of superficial. The role of MDM2/p53 in ferroptosis or cisplatin resistance mediated by NOLC1 should be further studied by genetic manipulation of p53, which is the key evidence to confirm its contribution to NOLC1 regulation of GC and relative cell death.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript (eLife-RP-RA-2024-103904), the authors identified that NOLC1 was upregulated in gastric cancer samples, which promoted cancer progression and cisplatin resistance. They further found that NOLC1 could bind to p53 and decrease its nuclear transcriptional activity, then inhibit p53-mediated ferroptosis. There are several major concerns regarding the conclusions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study identified that NOLC1 could bind to p53 and decrease its nuclear transcriptional activity, then inhibit p53-mediated ferroptosis in gastric cancer.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major conclusions were not sufficiently supported by the results. The experiments were not conducted in a comprehensive manner.</p>
<p>Major concerns</p>
<p>(1) The authors investigated NOLC1 expression in gastric cancer (GC) using clinical samples, which is valuable; however, the sample array includes only 3 patients. This sample size is insufficient to support conclusions for human samples. Please increase the sample size and apply a more robust statistical analysis. Additionally, specify the statistical methods used in the figure legend.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the kind comments and great suggestions. As suggested, we have increased the sample size of GC patients, and the new data (six pair samples) was shown in Fig. S1A, further reflecting that NOLC1 was upregulate in gastric cancer (GC). Moreover, the statistical methods have been added in each figure legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) These data are not sufficient to support the key conclusion of this study &quot;NOLC1 is significantly upregulated in GC tissues and Cis-resistant GC cells&quot;. There is no convincing data showing that NOLC1 upregulation is specific to cancer cells or any other cell types. Based on the following results that NOLC1 expressed in cancer cells can support cancer cell survival and drug resistance, the authors switched to investigating the role of NOLC1 in cancer cells without demonstrating cancer cells indeed highly upregulate NOLC1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for raising this good question. As shown in Fig. 1E-F, the TCGA database have shown that NOLC1 was upregulated in GC. Moreover, we further analyzed the NOLC1 expression level in other cancer type, according to the Human Protein Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/">https://www.proteinatlas.org/</ext-link>). The results indicated that NOLC1 mRNA level was much higher in almost all cancers except acute myeloid leukemia (LAML). In addition, according to the gene expression profiling interactive analysis (GEPIA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/index.html">http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/index.html</ext-link>), NOLC1 mRNA level was above 100 nTPM in most gastric cancer cell lines, however in most non-cancerous cell lines was below 100 nTPM, indicating that NOLC1 was up-regulated in gastric cancer.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors primarily use MGC-803 cells for experiments; however, MGC-803 is known to be a HeLa-contaminated cell line. Could the authors explain this choice of using this cell line only? Did they validate key findings with additional cell lines? This is particularly important for assays such as cisplatin resistance validation, in vivo experiments, TEM imaging, and MitoPeDPP fluorescence imaging.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for raising this good question. We are not only use MGC-803 cells, the key findings <italic>in vitro</italic> was also validated in MKN-45 cells (Fig. 2), and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment also validated in Mouse Forestomach Carcinoma cells (MFC)-tumor bearing 615 mice model (Fig 7). Furthermore, we further added some experiments in MKN-45 cells. The TEM imaging showed that NOLC1 could significantly inhibit cisplatin (Cis) induced lipid membrane damage in MKN-45 cells (Fig. S6A). Moreover, MitoPeDPP fluorescence assay analyzed by FCAs also indicating that rapid ROS was enriched in mitochondria in MKN-45 cells (Fig. 4E, Fig. S6J).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 2, did the authors perform assays with NOLC1 overexpression? If so, please include these results to strengthen the conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the kind comments and great suggestions. As suggested, we added new data about NOLC1 overexpression assay Cell counting kit-8 assay shows that NOLC1-overexpression group is more resistance to Cis compared to vector group (Fig. S4E, S5A).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors show in Figures 2A-B that shNOLC1 without cisplatin treatment does not affect cell viability. However, Figures 2D-E suggest increased apoptosis in shNOLC1 cells without cisplatin treatment. Additionally, in vivo studies in Figure 3 show no significant difference between the shNC+PBS and shNOLC1+PBS groups, which appears contradictory to the apoptosis assays. Similarly, Ki67 staining shows decreased scores in the shNOLC1 group compared to shNC. Could the authors clarify this inconsistency?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for raising this good question. In Fig 2D-E, the difference in proportion of death cells between shNOLC1 and shNC treated with PBS groups were only 3% (MGC-803) and 7% (MKN-45) which is much lower than that treated with cisplatin <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, in vivo analysis indicated that the average tumor volume in NOLC1+PBS group was smaller than that in NC group, but there was no statistical significance (p value = 0.3962). Moreover, tumor proliferation is a complex process regulated by many factors [1,2], thus the level of Ki67 is by no means the same as the rate of tumor proliferation, might be positively correlated.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In Figure 4, NOLC1 knockdown appears to enhance cisplatin-induced ferroptosis rather than apoptosis. Given p53's role in apoptosis, did the authors compare the effects of NOLC1 on cisplatin-induced apoptosis vs. ferroptosis? If so, please clarify whether NOLC1 predominantly regulates apoptosis or ferroptosis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for raising this good question. We do have compared the effects of NOLC1 on cisplatin-induced apoptosis vs. ferroptosis. As shown in Fig. 5A, NOLC1 knockdown obviously increased the BCL-2 protein level which is an anti-apoptotic protein and mediated by p53 via protein interaction in cytoplasm[3,4], this phenomenon may cause by the increasing level of p53 in cytoplasm (Fig. 6I). Also, the TEM imaging showed the classic ferroptotic morphological changes rather than apoptosis (Fig. 5A, S6A). Taken together, NOLC1 mainly regulates p53 mediated ferroptosis rather than apoptosis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Did the authors perform co-IP assays with p53 or HA antibodies to immunocapture NOLC1? If not, please add this experiment to support protein interactions. The mechanistic correlation between p53 and NOLC1 can be supported by adding experiments using multiple GC cell lines with various p53 alterations (such as loss-of- function or gain-of-function mutations/deletions). This is critical because the authors specifically claimed that NOLC1 can inhibit p53-mediated ferroptosis, but not other tumor suppressors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the kind comments and great suggestions. As suggested, we had performed Co-IP assay with anti-HA antibodies to immunocapture NOLC1-FLAG. As shown in Fig. 5K, p53 DNA binding domain (DBD)-HA could immunocapture with NOLC1, further indicated that NOLC1 could binding to p53 DBD. Moreover, we concur with the reviewer that adding experiments using multiple p53 alterations, however considering that different p53 mutants have completely different functional changes. Therefore, we using siRNA to knockdown p53 level in MGC-803 cells, the results shown that NOLC1 mediated resistance was disappear and the GPX4 level was increased (Fig. S10). These data have shown that NOLC1 promotes GC resistance via mediated p53 functions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) In Figure S5B, the LDH release can be blocked by Fer-1?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for raising this good question. As suggested, Fer-1 (20 μmol/mL) significantly blocked the LDH release in NOLC1 knockdown group (Fig S6E). This data further confirmed that NOLC1 suppressed Cis-induced ferroptosis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) How about the ubiquitination assay in MGC-803 cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for raising this good question. As suggested, we also analyzed the ubiquitination assay in MGC-803 cells. As the result showed that NOLC1 also could increasing level of ubiquitination of p53 (Fig. 6H).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) In Figure 6H, the DBD domain of NOLC1 is required for inhibiting P53 ubiquitination.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your opinion. However, in our paper, we only mentioned that p53 DBD domain, rather than NOLC1 DBD domain. Also, we did not find any DNA binding function of NOLC1 in the Pubmed database. Therefore, we would like to ask whether the revised opinion is correct.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) In Figure 8B, the CD3 antibody is not specific, please change it to a new one.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the kind comments and great suggestions. As suggested, we have used new CD3 antibody and the new data was added in Fig. 8B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) The authors report that NOLC1 influences peripheral blood lymphocytes with cisplatin treatment, with or without PD-1. Could the authors explain why NOLC1 would affect peripheral blood lymphocytes? Additionally, did they assess immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (TME) by flow cytometry?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for raising good question. The tumor size of the knockdown group treated with Cis + PD-1 was too small (less than 100 mg) to extract enough infiltrated immune cells (less than 10000 CD45<sup>+</sup> cells), thus we chose to detect immune cells in the blood of the mice. Considering that the infiltrating immune cells including CTLs were originate from peripheral blood by circulation. Under the normal conditions, serval tumor biology behavior impact the TME to limit immune responses and present barriers to cancer therapy. For example, tumor could express or secret lots of negative regulator like PD-L1. Causing immune cells cannot recognize tumor cells and infiltrate into tumor tissue. Ferroptosis, as a new from of ICD, could damage tumor cell plasm and release amount of tumor associated antigen and tumor-specific antigens causing immune cells priming and activation. Eventually, the activated immune cells in peripheral blood travel towards the tumor site, infiltrating the tumor tissue under favorable co-stimulatory conditions and guided by chemokine gradients. Once within the tumor microenvironment, these activated T cells can control tumor growth through direct tumor cell destruction and cytokine-mediated processes [5–8]</p>
<p>To assess immune cell infiltration in the TME, we analyzed the tumor infiltrated CD3<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> immune cells in tumor tissue by immunofluorescence (Fig. 8B). Thus, the peripheral blood lymphocytes could reflect the infiltration of immune cells in the tumor.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Shengsheng Zhao et al. investigated the role of nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1 (NOLC1) in relegating gastric cancer (GC) development and cisplatin-induced drug resistance in GC. They found a significant correlation between high NOLC1 expression and the poor prognosis of GC. Meanwhile, upregulation of NOLC1 was associated with cis-resistant GC. Experimentally, the authors demonstrate that knocking down NOLC1 increased GC sensitivity to Cis possibly by regulating ferroptosis. Mechanistically, they found NOLC1 suppressed ferroptosis by blocking the translocation of p53 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and promoting its degradation. In addition, The authors also evaluated the effect of combinational treatment of anti- PD-1 and cisplatin in NOLC1-knockdown tumor cells, revealing a potential role of NOLC1 in the targeted therapy for GC.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Chemoresistance is considered a major reason causing failure of tumor treatment and death of cancer patients. This paper explored the role of NOLC1 in the regulation of Cis-mediated resistance, which involves a regulated cell death named ferroptosis. These findings provide more evidence highlighting the study of regulated cell death to overcome drug resistance in cancer treatment, which could give us more potential strategies or targets for combating cancer.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>More evidence supporting the regulation of ferroptosis induced by Cisplatin by NOLC1 should be added. Particularly, the role of ferroptosis in the cisplatin-resistance should be verified and whether NOLC1 regulates ferroptosis induced by additional FINs should be explored. Besides, the experiments to verify the regulation of ferroptosis sensitivity by NOLC1 are sort of superficial. The role of MDM2/p53 in ferroptosis or cisplatin resistance mediated by NOLC1 should be further studied by genetic manipulation of p53, which is the key evidence to confirm its contribution to NOLC1 regulation of GC and relative cell death.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) More evidence supporting the regulation of ferroptosis induced by Cisplatin by NOLC1 should be added. Particularly, the role of ferroptosis in the cisplatin-resistance should be verified and whether NOLC1 regulates ferroptosis induced by additional FINs should be explored.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the kind comments and great suggestions. As suggested, we have further analyzed the ferroptosis inhibit ability of NOLC1 in MGC-45 cells treated with Erastin, a common used ferroptosis activator. As shown in Fig. S6B, the ferroptosis activated by Erastin was also blocked by NOLC1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 1J, the CR cell line should obviously have less apoptosis-maker c-PARP expression, which means these cells are resistant to apoptosis induced by CR. Thus, it would be more rational to study the role of apoptosis regulation by NOLC1. Why did the later data shift to the study of ferroptosis?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for raising this good question. In the CR cells, the expression levels of many genes were changed, so it is uncertain whether the decreased expression level of cleaved-PARP in the resistant cells is caused by NOLC1 up-regulated. To explore the specific mechanism of NOLC1 mediated resistant, we performed the TEM imaging (Fig. 4A, S6A) and the results showed that cells exhibited classic ferroptosis morphological changes. Moreover, the BCL-2 (an anti-apoptotic protein, and regulated by p53 via protein interaction in cytoplasm) was increased after NOLC1 knockdown (Fig S5A). This phenomenon may cause by the increasing p53 levels in the cytoplasm[3,4] (Fig 5I). Taken together we shift to study of cisplatin induced ferroptosis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Besides, how about the regulation of apoptosis during cis-resistance by NOLC1 in GC?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for raising this good question. As mentioned above the Cis induced apoptosis was not as significant as ferroptosis, caused by BCL-2 (a key anti-apoptosis protein) increasing which is mediated by p53 via protein interaction in cytoplasm. NOLC1 increased plasm p53 level subsequently increased BCL-2 level.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The experiments to verify the regulation of ferroptosis sensitivity by NOLC1 are sort of superficial. The role of MDM2/p53 in ferroptosis or cisplatin resistance mediated by NOLC1 should be further studied by genetic manipulation of p53, which is the key evidence to confirm its contribution to NOLC1 regulation of GC and relative cell death.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for raising this good question. As is shown in Fig S10, after knockdown p53 protein level by using siRNA, NOLC1 could not promote Cis-resistance and the GPX4 level was increased reflecting that NOLC1 promotes Cis resistance via mediate p53 function.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In Figure 2, the data indicated that the knockdown of NOLC1 increased rH2Ax in the presence of Cisplatin, which indicated that NOLC1 might regulate DNA damage-related cellular function. These functions should be more relevant to cisplatin resistance, considering the fundamental effect of this chemo drug.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the kind comments and great suggestions. Indeed, we found that DNA damage was more obvious in knockdown groups, but the ferroptotic changes like ROS and mitochondrial membrane damage were also significantly different in knockdown groups. Considering that as a chemo drug, cisplatin not only induces damage DNA but also acts as a stress which could activates various signal pathways including apoptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis, etc., under different drug concentrate or time [9–11]. Therefore, it is important to find out the NOLC1 predominantly blocked pathway in GC.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In Figure.4, ferroptosis inhibitors like Ferr-1 or DFO should be used to verify the regulation of ferroptosis by Cisplatin and NOLC1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the kind comments and great suggestions. As suggested, we performed additional LDH release assay. The results showed that Fer-1 also could block cisplatin induced LDH release in NOLC1 knockdown groups (Fig. S6E).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In Figure 4H, Cisplatin decreased FSP1 and GPX4, which could be enhanced in the NOLC1-konckdown cell line. Meanwhile, the knockdown of NOLC1 increased the ACSL4 level. These findings could be the key reason for the regulation of ferroptosis by NOLC1 rather than p53 since they all are direct regulators of ferroptosis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the kind comments and great suggestions. We rewrote the text as you suggested. Recently, it also has been reported that ACSL4-regulated ferroptosis is related to p53, but the exact mechanism is still unclear [12]. Moreover, further studies of specific relation between NOLC1 and FSP1/ACSL4 will be conducted in the further</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Whether p53 mediates the regulation of ferroptosis and cisplatin resistance by NOLC1 should be thoroughly studied using p53-KO cell lines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the kind comments and great suggestions. As previously mentioned, by using si-RNA to knockdown p53, the NOLC1 mediate Cis-resistance were blocked (Fig. S10). Meanwhile, the GPX4 level was also increased in p53/NOLC1 double-knockdown groups compared to the NOLC1 knockdown group. These data indicating that NOLC1 suppresses ferroptosis via mediating p53 functions.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>The authors have put forth a compelling argument that NOLC1 is indispensable for gastric cancer resistance in both in vivo and in vitro models. They have further elucidated that NOLC1 silencing augments cisplatin-induced ferroptosis in gastric cancer cells. The mechanistic underpinning of their findings suggests that NOLC1 modulates the p53 nuclear/plasma ratio by engaging with the p53 DNA Binding Domain, which in turn impedes p53-mediated transcriptional regulation of ferroptosis. Additionally, the authors have shown that NOLC1 knockdown triggers the release of ferroptosis-induced damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which activate the tumor microenvironment (TME) and enhance the efficacy of the anti-PD-1 and cisplatin combination therapy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript presents a robust dataset that substantiates the authors' conclusion. They have identified NOLC1 as a potential oncogene that confers resistance to immuno-chemotherapy in gastric cancer through the mediation of ferroptosis and subsequent TME reprogramming. This discovery positions NOLC1 as a promising therapeutic target for gastric cancer treatment. The authors have delineated a novel mechanistic pathway whereby NOLC1 suppresses p53 transcriptional functions by reducing its nuclear/plasma ratio, underscoring the significance of p53 nuclear levels in tumor suppression over total protein levels.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the overall findings are commendable, there are specific areas that could benefit from further refinement. The authors have posited that NOLC1 suppresses p53- mediated ferroptosis; however, the mRNA levels of ferroptosis genes regulated by p53 have not been quantified, which is a critical gap in the current study. In Figure 4A, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results are reported solely for the MGC-803 cell line. It would be beneficial to include TEM data for the MKN-45 cell line to strengthen the findings. The authors have proposed a link between NOLC1-mediated reduction in the p53 nuclear/plasma ratio and gastric cancer resistance, yet the correlation between this ratio and patient prognosis remains unexplored, which is a significant limitation in the context of clinical relevance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the kind comments and great suggestions. As suggested, recently studies have reported that CDKN1A (also called p21, a p53 transcriptional mediated protein) could promotes ferroptosis[13], the mRNA levels of ferroptosis genes regulated by p53 have were quantified in Fig. S8G-H. Moreover, we further proceed TEM imaging in MKN-45 cells, the result was consistent to MGC-803 cells, reflecting that NOLC1 has a broad spectrum of promoting drug resistance in gastric cancer. Also, recently studies have reported that p53 transcriptional active and p53 transcriptional inactive types include patients with intermediate prognosis and recurrence rates, with the p53-acvtie group showing better prognosis[14]. Considering p53 transcriptional activity depends on p53 nuclear accumulation, we assume that the low level of p53 nuclear/plasma may cause poor prognosis in gastric cancer. Meanwhile we will further collect enough samples and their prognostic information to analysis NOLC1-mediated reduction in the p53 nuclear/plasma ratio and gastric cancer resistance.</p>
