<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Abnormal cellular and circuit excitability is believed to drive many core phenotypes in fragile X syndrome (FXS). The dentate gyrus is a brain area performing critical computations essential for learning and memory. However, little is known about dentate circuit defects and their mechanisms in FXS. Understanding dentate circuit dysfunction in FXS has been complicated by the presence of two types of excitatory neurons, the granule cells and mossy cells. Here we report that loss of FMRP markedly decreased excitability of dentate mossy cells, a change opposite to all other known excitability defects in excitatory neurons in FXS. This mossy cell hypo-excitability is caused by increased Kv7 function in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. By reducing the excitatory drive onto local hilar interneurons, hypo-excitability of mossy cells results in increased excitation/inhibition ratio in granule cells and thus paradoxically leads to excessive dentate output. Circuit-wide inhibition of Kv7 channels in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice increases inhibitory drive onto granule cells and normalizes the dentate output in response to physiologically relevant theta-gamma coupling stimulation. Our study suggests that circuit-based interventions may provide a promising strategy in this disorder to bypass irreconcilable excitability defects in different cell types and restore their pathophysiological consequences at the circuit level.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism. This disorder arises from mutations in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> gene resulting in a loss of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Salcedo-Arellano, Hagerman &amp; Martinez-Cerdeno 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Willemsen &amp; Kooy 2017</xref>). Hippocampus, the brain area implicated as a central hub for learning and memory, is one of the most affected brain regions in FXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bostrom et al 2016</xref>). Within the hippocampus, dentate gyrus receives the bulk of cortical inputs and plays a critical role in many core information processing functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amaral, Scharfman &amp; Lavenex 2007</xref>), which are often dysregulated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including FXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deng et al 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Eadie et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ghilan et al 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lee, Panda &amp; Lee 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Yau et al 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Yau et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Yun &amp; Trommer 2011</xref>). Distinct from other hippocampal regions, dentate gyrus has two types of glutamatergic excitatory neurons: granule cells and mossy cells (MCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amaral, Scharfman &amp; Lavenex 2007</xref>). Granule cells are the first-station neurons of canonical trisynaptic pathway and the only type of output cells in the dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amaral, Scharfman &amp; Lavenex 2007</xref>); whereas MCs comprise a significant portion of neurons in the hilus region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Scharfman 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Scharfman 2018</xref>), which is sandwiched between the two blades of the granule cell layer. MCs are in a unique position to control dentate gyrus output because these cells not only can directly excite granule cells, but also indirectly inhibit them through innervating local GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amaral, Scharfman &amp; Lavenex 2007</xref>), which play a central role in controlling granule cell activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Pelkey et al 2017</xref>). Both MCs and hilar interneurons have been implicated in various pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Pelkey et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Scharfman 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Scharfman 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sloviter et al 2012</xref>). However, even though dentate gyrus has attracted extensive attention in the FXS field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deng et al 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lee, Panda &amp; Lee 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Modgil et al 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Monday et al 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Remmers &amp; Contractor 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sathyanarayana et al 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Yau et al 2019</xref>), whether or not MC function is abnormal and contribute to hippocampal circuit abnormalities in FXS remains unexplored.</p>
<p>Abnormal neural excitability in FXS has been often linked to dysregulated expression and/or function of various ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Deng &amp; Klyachko 2021</xref>), and particularly the family of K<sup>+</sup> channels, which control neuronal excitability by regulating the action potential (AP) threshold, duration, frequency and firing patterns. Kv7 (KCNQ) channels are a subthreshold-activated and non-inactivating K<sup>+</sup> conductance that plays key roles in regulating neuronal excitability throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brown &amp; Passmore 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Delmas &amp; Brown 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jones, Gamper &amp; Gao 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Liu, Bian &amp; Wang 2021</xref>), including hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Gu et al 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Incontro et al 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Martinello et al 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Peters et al 2005</xref>). Increasing evidence suggests that Kv7 channels contribute to synaptic plasticity, learning/memory and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baculis, Zhang &amp; Chung 2020</xref>); and their dysfunction contributes to a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baculis, Zhang &amp; Chung 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gilling et al 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Jentsch 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jones, Gamper &amp; Gao 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Liu, Bian &amp; Wang 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Miceli et al 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Miceli et al 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nappi et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Peters et al 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Springer, Varghese &amp; Tzingounis 2021</xref>). Two members of the Kv7 family (Kv7.2 and Kv7.3) have been identified as targets of FMRPâs translational regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Darnell et al 2011</xref>), yet it is unknown whether Kv7 expression/function is affected by FMRP loss and plays a role in pathophysiology of FXS.</p>
<p>Here, we report an unexpected hypo-excitability of MCs in FXS mouse model, resulted from upregulation of Kv7 function. We uncover the implications of this defect to dentate dysfunction at the synaptic, cellular, and circuit levels. While this MC excitability defect is unique in being opposite in direction to all other glutamatergic neurons in FXS mouse model, it never-the-less paradoxically leads to an elevated excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratio in granule cells and abnormal circuit processing in the dentate circuit via reduced activity of local inhibitory networks. Our analyses using circuit-wide inhibition of Kv7 channels in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice suggest that circuit-based interventions may be a promising strategy to bypass the need to correct irreconcilable excitability defects in different cell types, and restore their pathophysiological consequences in this disorder.</p>

<title>Decreased excitability of dentate mossy cells in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice</title>
<p>MCs comprise a large fraction of the cells in the dentate hilar region and are implicated in multiple pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Scharfman 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Scharfman 2018</xref>). To investigate whether MCs are involved in the pathophysiology of FXS, we first examined the excitability of MCs in wildtype (WT) and <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) mice, the FXS mouse model. Action potentials (APs) were recorded from MCs at different membrane potentials (from -64 to -55 mV, set by constant current injection). Unexpectedly, we found that loss of FMRP significantly decreased excitability of MCs, as evident by the reduced number of APs fired (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>; statistical data for every measurement in this study are listed in Table S1). This hypo-excitability is opposite to the changes previously observed in other excitatory neurons in FXS models, which typically exhibit hyperexcitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Contractor, Klyachko &amp; Portera-Cailliau 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Deng &amp; Klyachko 2021</xref>). To verify this observation, we employed a ramp protocol to evoke APs and examined various AP parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Deng et al 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Deng et al 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deng et al 2022</xref>). Similarly, we found a decreased number of APs fired (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>), as well as increased voltage threshold, rheobase, and rheobase charge transfer in MCs of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref>, 1D and 1F-1H), confirming the hypo-excitable state of MCs in the absence of FMRP. There were no significant changes in AP maximum rise rate, rise time, fall time, duration, peak potential and amplitude in KO MCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1I</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1N</xref>), indicating that the transient Na<sup>+</sup> current and fast activating K<sup>+</sup> conductances are likely unaffected in MCs of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice.</p>

<p>The MC hypo-excitability in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice can be attributed to cell-autonomous and/or circuit defects. We first asked whether this defect was caused by changes in the intrinsic passive membrane properties of MCs by examining the resting membrane potential (RMP), cell capacitance and input resistance at RMP level, and found all of them to be unaffected in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). However, since input resistance around the threshold level contributes directly to AP initiation, we examined it again at -45 mV (close to threshold level) using a depolarization step in the pharmacologically isolated MCs [using a combination of blockers against both glutamate and GABA receptors (in Î¼M): 10 NMDA, 50 APV, 10 MPEP, 5 gabazine and 2 CGP55845] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Deng et al 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deng et al 2022</xref>), as well as in the presence of 1 Î¼M TTX and 10 Î¼M CdCl<sub>2</sub> to block Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, respectively. Under these conditions, the input resistance was significantly lower in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO than WT MCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that the reduced input resistance around the threshold potential may be a primary contributor to MC hypo-excitability in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice.</p>

<title>Enhanced Kv7 function causes mossy cell hypo-excitability in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice</title>
<p>Among conductances active at sub-threshold potentials, Kv7 channels are known to play a major role in determining the input resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baculis, Zhang &amp; Chung 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Greene &amp; Hoshi 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jones, Gamper &amp; Gao 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">van der Horst, Greenwood &amp; Jepps 2020</xref>). We thus tested whether the reduced input resistance in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO MCs is associated with Kv7 dysfunction. We found that the Kv7 blocker XE991 (10 Î¼M) abolished the difference in input resistance at -45 mV between WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Moreover, Kv7 inhibition with XE991 also caused a larger shift in the holding current in KO than WT MCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), and a larger membrane depolarization in KO than WT MCs when the membrane potential was initially set at -45 mV (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We further observed that loss of FMRP increased Kv7 currents in MCs as measured by a ramp protocol (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Together, these results strongly suggest that Kv7 function is increased in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO MCs.</p>

<p>The âclassicalâ Kv7 current is carried predominantly by heteromeric KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brown &amp; Passmore 2009</xref>). KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 have been identified as targets of FMRP translational regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Darnell et al 2011</xref>) and are highly expressed in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Tzingounis et al 2010</xref>). We thus examined if KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 levels were altered by FMRP loss, but found no changes in expression of either isoform in the whole brain lysate as measured by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figures S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1B</xref>). To exclude the possibility that expression variation among brain regions masked KCNQ changes in a particular area, we performed the same experiment on dentate gyrus lysate only. We found no detectable changes in expression of KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figures S1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1D</xref>). We did not further investigate the precise mechanisms underlying enhancement of Kv7 function in the absence of FMRP, since the present study primarily focuses on the functional consequences of abnormal cellular and circuit excitability.</p>
<p>To verify the role of elevated Kv7 function in decreased excitability of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO MCs, we first confirmed that hypo-excitability is still observed in these cells when they were isolated from circuit activity using blockers of both glutamate and GABA receptors (as above). We found this to be the case, as evident by increased threshold, rheobase and rheobase charge transfer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3E</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>), as well as decreased number of APs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>) in circuit-isolated MCs of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO comparing to WT mice. Importantly, Kv7 blocker XE991 abolished all these differences in excitability metrics between genotypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3E</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these results indicate that the hypo-excitability of MCs in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice has primarily a cell-autonomous origin and can be attributed to abnormally elevated Kv7 function.</p>

<title>Mossy cell hypo-excitability dominates adaptive circuit changes in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice</title>
<p>Next we examined if, in addition to cell-autonomous Kv7-mediated defects, there is also a circuit contribution to MC hypo-excitability. First, we measured spontaneous and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs and mEPSCs), and found that the excitatory drive onto MCs was increased, as evident by the elevated number and instantaneous frequency of both sEPSCs and mEPSCs in KO MCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref>, 4B, S2A and S2B), without changes in their amplitudes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E</xref> and S2C). We note that this increase in excitatory drive cannot explain the MCsâ hypo-excitability; rather these results likely reflect the hyperexcitable state of granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deng et al 2022</xref>), which provide the majority of excitatory drive onto MCs. We next examined inhibitory inputs onto MCs and found that the number and instantaneous frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) was also increased in KO MCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>) without changes in amplitude (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). However, we did not observe significant differences in miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in KO MCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figures S2D-S2F</xref>). Because the overall circuit contribution to MC excitability is determined by the net effect of both excitatory and inhibitory drives, we examined the E/I ratio of these inputs, a parameter which integrates changes in both excitatory and inhibitory drives into a single variable and thus allows us to determine the net circuit effect on MCs excitability. Given that the amplitudes of sEPSCs and sIPSCs were indistinguishable between genotypes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>), we could estimate the E/I ratio simply by using the mean frequency of spontaneous synaptic events (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>), and observed an increased E/I ratio in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO MCs (â â¼20%, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>) which acts in opposition to the intrinsic hypo-excitability observed in MCs. Thus these adaptive circuit changes likely function as a compensatory mechanism to the intrinsic MCsâ hypo-excitability in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, similarly to adaptive circuit changes also seen in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Antoine et al 2019</xref>). However, this circuit adaptation is insufficient to compensate for MC excitability defects because we observed overall hypo-excitability in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO MCs in the intact circuits.</p>

<title>Mossy cell defects reduce excitatory drive onto hilar interneurons in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice</title>
<p>The principal output of the dentate circuit is determined by granule cell firing, which is largely controlled by the balance of the excitatory inputs to granule cells from the stellate cells of the entorhinal cortex via the perforant path (PP), local excitatory inputs from MCs and inhibitory inputs from local interneurons. In the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, stellate cells have normal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Deng &amp; Klyachko 2016</xref>); the granule cells are hyper-excitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deng et al 2022</xref>); while MCs are hypo-excitable. We thus next probed excitability of the hilar interneurons, the remaining component of this circuit that has not been examined thus far. Because these inhibitory neurons exhibit both morphological and electrophysiological diversity and no clear correlation between morphology and electrophysiological properties has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Mott et al 1997</xref>), here we classified a total of 66 recorded interneurons into 3 types according to AP firing pattern: 1) fast-spiking interneurons (high-frequency non-adapting firing); 2) regular-spiking interneurons (slower and adapting firing); and 3) stuttering-like interneurons (high-frequency irregular bursting firing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Golomb et al 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3A</xref>). Chi-square test showed no significant differences in the ratios of the 3 types of interneurons between WT and KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3A</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the passive membrane properties (RMP, capacitance and input resistance) and threshold of these interneurons were not significantly different between genotypes and among cell types (thus data were pooled, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figures S3B-S3E</xref>). These results indicate that the intrinsic excitability of hilar interneurons is not affected significantly in the absence of FMRP, suggesting that alterations in synaptic drive onto these cells may play a critical role in determining changes in local inhibition in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs.</p>
<p>Therefore, we next examined excitatory and inhibitory drives onto hilar interneurons by recording spontaneous and miniature synaptic inputs to these cells. We found that the number and instantaneous frequency of sEPSCs and mEPSCs were markedly decreased in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref>, 5B, S3F and S3G) with no changes in amplitudes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5E</xref> and S3H). Further, the number and instantaneous frequency of sIPSCs were also decreased in KO interneurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>) without change in amplitude (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>), while no significant changes in mIPSCs was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figures S3I-S3K</xref>). We then estimated the balance of E/I inputs onto interneurons using the same approach as above for MCs and observed a markedly decreased E/I ratio of inputs onto <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO interneurons (â â¼60%, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>).</p>

<p>Considering that excitability of stellate cells is largely unaffected and granule cells show profound hyperexcitability in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, our observations suggest that it is the MCs that provide the dominant excitatory drive to hilar interneurons, causing a marked decrease in E/I ratio of inputs onto interneurons in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. To determine if this is indeed the case, we took advantage of different properties of PP, granule cell and MC axonal terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chancey et al 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chiu &amp; Castillo 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Shigemoto et al 1997</xref>). Specifically, granule cell and PP axonal terminals contain group II mGluRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Shigemoto et al 1997</xref>), while MC axonal terminals express type I cannabinoid (CB1) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chancey et al 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chiu &amp; Castillo 2008</xref>). Accordingly, mGluR Group II agonist DCG-IV (1 Î¼M) selectively inhibits granule cell- and PP-derived EPSCs onto hilar interneurons; while the CB1 agonist WIN 55212-2 (WIN, 5 Î¼M) selectively inhibits MC-derived EPSCs onto these interneurons. In this analysis, for simplicity and better comparison among cells, we normalized the number of sEPSCs to its own baseline before agonist application. We observed that DCG-IV had little effect on the number of sEPSCs recorded in interneurons in both genotypes (WT 100.2 Â± 15.8% of basal; KO 107.7 Â± 16.2% of basal; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref>, 6C, 6D and 6F), indicating that granule cell- and PP-derived EPSCs comprise a limited portion of excitatory drive onto hilar interneurons in both genotypes. As a control for DCG-IV effectiveness, we observed that DCG-IV strongly reduced the number of sEPSCs recorded from MCs that primarily receive excitatory inputs from granule cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6G</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6I</xref>). In contrast, WIN markedly reduced the number of sEPSCs in both WT and KO mice (WT 49.4 Â± 6.0% of basal; KO 59.5 Â± 4.6% of basal; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6B</xref>, 6C, 6E and 6F), suggesting that MCs provide a large proportion of excitatory drive onto hilar interneurons (i.e., MCs provide at least â¼51% of the excitatory drive onto interneurons in WT and â¼41% in KO mice). Together with the observations above, this analysis supports the notion that the hypo-excitability of MCs in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice causes the reduction of excitatory drive onto hilar interneurons, which ultimately results in reduced local inhibition.</p>

<title>Circuit-wide inhibition of Kv7 channels increased local inhibitory drive and corrected granule cell excitability in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice</title>
<p>If upregulation of Kv7 function is largely limited to MCs in the dentate circuit of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, then our findings suggest that inhibition of Kv7 channels would be more efficient to enhance MC excitability in KO than WT mice and thus may be more effective to boost the inhibitory drive onto <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO granule cells, thus reducing granule cell hyperexcitability in KO mice. To test this hypothesis, we first simultaneously recorded sEPSCs and sIPSCs in the granule cells to get a better quantitative analysis of the E/I input onto these cells. Granule cells were held at -40 mV resulting in sEPSC appearing as a down-ward current, while sIPSC appearing as up-ward current, which was verified by selective blockers of GABA<sub>A</sub> or AMPA and NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4A</xref>). We found that loss of FMRP did not affect the mean frequencies, amplitudes and charge transfer of sEPSCs and sIPSCs onto granule cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7B</xref>, 7C and S4B-S4G), and thus did not alter the baseline E/I ratio as determined by any of these parameters (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7D</xref>, S4D and S4G). In line with our hypothesis, circuit-wide inhibition of Kv7 channels with bath application of XE991 markedly increased sIPSC frequency in the granule cells of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO but not in WT mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>), while having no effect on sEPSC frequency in either genotype (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). As a result, XE991 application shifted the E/I balance toward stronger inhibition in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO, but not in WT mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). These results indicate that circuit-wide inhibition of Kv7 channels could be effective in reducing granule cell hyperexcitability in the KO mice. We noted that XE991 also slightly reduced both sEPSC and sIPSC amplitudes, but to a similar extent in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figures S4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4C</xref>), and without detectable changes in charge transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figures S4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4F</xref>).</p>

<p>To examine more directly if circuit-wide inhibition of Kv7 channels could be effective in reducing granule cell hyperexcitability in the KO mice, we performed analyses of granule cell firing â the ultimate measure of cellular excitability. APs were evoked by a multistep current injection (55â75 pA, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). To disentangle the direct-and circuit-mediated-actions of Kv7 inhibition, we first synaptically isolated granule cells from the circuit using the same pharmacological approach as described above, and observed that loss of FMRP strongly increased the AP firing in granule cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7E</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref>, <italic>upper panels</italic>), as we reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deng et al 2022</xref>). Inhibition of Kv7 channels with XE991 (10 Î¼M) further increased AP firing in both genotypes, with significantly higher number of APs still observed in the isolated granule cells of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7E</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref>, <italic>lower panels</italic>). These results indicate that intrinsic hyperexcitability of granule cells in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice is largely unrelated to Kv7 channels. Indeed, we have demonstrated that this intrinsic defect is caused by abnormal extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activity in the absence of FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deng et al 2022</xref>). We then performed the same recordings in granule cells with intact dentate circuit, and again observed markedly increased excitability in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO, as evident by much larger number of APs fired by KO than WT granule cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7G</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7H</xref>, <italic>upper panels</italic>). In line with our hypothesis, circuit-wide inhibition of Kv7 channels with XE991 abolished the difference in the number of APs between genotypes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7G</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7H</xref>, <italic>lower panels</italic>). Together with the observations above (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>, <italic>lower panel</italic>), these results indicate that XE991 corrected granule cell hyperexcitability in a circuit-dependent manner.</p>
<p>To further clarify this notion, we compared the effects of XE991 between isolated- (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>) and circuit-intact-granule cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>), and probed the origin of XE991 contribution to granule cell excitability. Specifically, even though the direct action of XE991 on granule cells was to increase excitability in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5A</xref>), the circuit action of XE991 resulted in suppressing granule cell excitability in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (â â¼6 APs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5B</xref>), while having minimal effect in WT mice (changes fluctuating around 0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5B</xref>). This is in line with the observations above that XE991 increased sIPSC frequency but not sEPSC frequency, and only in the KO but not in WT mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7A</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>). Together with our findings that the interneuron activity is driven in a large part by excitatory input from the MCs, these results indicate that the primary site of action of XE991 is the MCs in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. Thus, our findings support the notion that circuit-wide inhibition of Kv7 channels boosted up inhibitory drive onto granule cells and restored granule cell excitability in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice by enhancing the local inhibitory circuit function.</p>

<title>Implications of mossy cell hypo-excitability and circuit E/I imbalance to dentate function</title>
<p>Granule cell excitability and dentate output are not only dependent on basal synaptic inputs (i.e., basal E/I balance, as evident in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>), but more importantly these cellular/circuit functions are controlled by a delicately tuned dynamic E/I balance during circuit activity. By providing the major excitatory drive to local interneurons, MCs play a key role in controlling circuit inhibition onto granule cells via a three-synapse pathway (Granule cellsâMCsâInterneuronsâGranule cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8A</xref>). Accordingly, we hypothesized that the Kv7-dependent hypo-excitability of MCs in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice compromises the effectiveness of this critical inhibitory pathway.</p>
<p>To test this possibility, we recorded compound postsynaptic current (cPSC) in granule cells by stimulating PP and holding cells at -45 mV. This holding potential was chosen as it was an intermediate potential between the excitatory and inhibitory reversal potentials ensuring comparable driving force for excitatory and inhibitory conductances. The PP-stimulation-evoked cPSC is the summation of largely overlapping excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents, which shows as an initial down-ward excitatory component and followed by an up-ward inhibitory component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6A</xref>). At the end of each recording, the pure EPSC was isolated by adding GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blocker gabazine (5 Î¼M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6B</xref>), which then was averaged to create an EPSC template for each cell in order to isolate underlying EPSC and IPSC from the cPSC and calculate E/I ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figures S6C-D</xref>). For better comparison among cells, we normalized the cPSC and underlying IPSC to their respective underlying EPSC, which reflects the PP stimulation intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6E</xref>).</p>
<p>In line with our observations above, loss of FMRP significantly decreased the inhibitory component of cPSC and the underlying IPSC (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8d</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8E</xref>, <italic>upper panels</italic>), while the excitatory component of cPSC was comparable between genotypes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>, <italic>upper panel</italic>). As a result, E/I ratio of the inputs onto granule cells was abnormally increased in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8F</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8G</xref>, <italic>upper panels</italic>). Moreover, we also observed a wider excitation window (defined as the duration of cPSC excitatory component, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6C</xref>) in the granule cells of the KO mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H</xref>, <italic>upper panel</italic>). In support of our hypothesis, circuit-wide inhibition of Kv7 with XE991 significantly increased the inhibitory component of cPSC and underlying IPSC in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8D</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8E</xref>, <italic>lower panels</italic>), but not in WT mice. Consequently, inhibition of Kv7 normalized E/I ratio (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8F</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8G</xref>, <italic>lower panels</italic>), as well as the excitation window in the granule cells of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H</xref>, <italic>lower panel</italic>). These results indicate that Kv7-dependent hypo-excitability of MCs in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice is a critical defect in the dentate circuit and that circuit-wide inhibition of Kv7 is sufficient to normalize circuit E/I balance.</p>

<p>Finally, we asked what are the functional consequences of MC hypo-excitability and dentate circuit E/I imbalance in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice? The power of theta-gamma oscillations is particularly high in the dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Csicsvari et al 2003</xref>), and plays a critical role in many dentate functions, such as pattern separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Leutgeb et al 2007</xref>), information coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mizuseki et al 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pernia-Andrade &amp; Jonas 2014</xref>), and thus learning/memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bott et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lisman &amp; Jensen 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Neves et al 2022</xref>). In order to evaluate the contribution of MC defects in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice to this critical dentate function, we used a protocol of double-oscillation interplay at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hasselmo, Giocomo &amp; Zilli 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Mircheva, Peralta &amp; Toth 2019</xref>). In this paradigm, gamma (â¼50Hz) frequency stimulation of PP suppresses granule cell output driven by PP stimulation at the theta (â¼5Hz) frequency range (gamma-suppression, for brevity). The experiments included two stimulation protocols: a control protocol at 5 Hz (theta stimulation, whose intensity was adjusted to achieve AP probability of â¼0.5 and the intensity was then kept in the following test protocol for the same cell); and a test protocol with a gamma burst (5 stimuli at 50 Hz) included 200 ms before the 5 Hz theta train. Theta stimulation of the PP evoked a steady baseline firing in granule cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8I</xref>-<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8K</xref>, <italic>upper panels</italic>). In line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hasselmo, Giocomo &amp; Zilli 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Mircheva, Peralta &amp; Toth 2019</xref>), a preceding gamma stimulation suppressed granule cell output in response to theta train in both genotypes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8I</xref>-<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8K</xref>, <italic>upper panels</italic>). However, this gamma-suppression was much less efficient in the KO than in WT mice, as evident by the significant higher AP probability in KO mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8I</xref>-<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8K</xref>, <italic>upper panels</italic>). Considering that granule cells are the only output neurons in the dentate gyrus and thus integrate all dentate circuit operations, these results indicate that loss of FMRP causes abnormal dentate information processing, leading to excessive dentate output.</p>
<p>The dentate GABAergic system plays a critical role in the above gamma-suppression of granule cell output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Mircheva, Peralta &amp; Toth 2019</xref>). Based on our findings, we hypothesized that the compromised dentate inhibitory pathway in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice weakens gamma-suppression through enhancing the EPSP summation in granule cells. The EPSP measured in granule cells in response to the PP stimulation integrates both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto granule cells, including the direct synaptic input from the PP and all the PP stimulation-associated feedforward and feedback synaptic inputs. In other words, the EPSP in granule cells integrates all dentate circuit âoperationsâ. Mechanistically, once the integrated EPSP reaches the threshold level, it triggers an AP, which makes the EPSP amplitude a direct predictor of AP firing. We found that theta stimulation evoked a steady EPSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figures S7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7B</xref>), and a preceding gamma burst markedly suppressed the EPSP in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure S7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7B</xref>). In line with our results above, this suppression effect was significantly weaker in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figures S7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7B</xref>), suggesting that the compromised dentate inhibitory pathway weakens gamma-suppression through enhancing the EPSP summation in the KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8B</xref>). If this is the case, our results predict that circuit-wide inhibition of Kv7 channels should dampen EPSP summation and restore the gamma-suppression. Indeed, we found that Kv7 blocker XE991 reduced the EPSP amplitude in KO mice to the WT level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figures S7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7D</xref>) and, most importantly, it normalized gamma-suppression of granule cell output during theta activity in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8J</xref>-<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8L</xref> and S8C).</p>
<p>Collectively, these findings demonstrates that MCs hypo-excitability in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice results in circuit E/I imbalance that compromises the dentate information processing functions, and that circuit-based interventions, such as inhibition of Kv7, could be a potential therapeutic strategy to re-normalize the circuit E/I balance and ameliorate dentate dysfunction in FXS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Dentate gyrus, the information gateway to the hippocampus, receives and processes the vast majority of cortical-hippocampal inputs. It carries out numerous information-processing tasks to form unique memories, and conveys the information to the CA3 region. The precisely controlled E/I balance in the dentate circuit is critical to many fundamental computations that are believed to underlie learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amaral, Scharfman &amp; Lavenex 2007</xref>). The dentate gyrus output is controlled by the local networks whose activity is determined not only by the entorhinal cortical inputs and local interneuron activity, but also by another type of local excitatory neurons, the MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Scharfman 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Scharfman 2018</xref>). These cells has long been considered âenigmaticâ due to their complex and incompletely understood roles in the circuit, yet recently the critical roles of MCs in dentate computations and spatial memory have emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amaral, Scharfman &amp; Lavenex 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berron et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Botterill et al 2021b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fredes &amp; Shigemoto 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Scharfman 2016</xref>). Moreover, MC defects were also found to play major roles in epilepsy and many neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Pelkey et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Scharfman 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Scharfman 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sloviter et al 2012</xref>). Whether MCs defects are present and contribute to hippocampal dysfunction in FXS has remained largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that loss of FMRP causes profound MC hypo-excitability, an unusual defect which is opposite to cellular hyperexcitability reported in all other excitatory neurons in FXS mouse model, including dentate granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deng et al 2022</xref>). Since MC hypo-excitability was observed both in the synaptically isolated MCs and with the intact circuit, this defect has a cell-autonomous origin and the adaptive circuit changes were insufficient to compensate for it.</p>
<p>In pursuing the mechanism of this defect, we discovered that it is caused by abnormally elevated Kv7 function in the absence of FMRP. While Kv7 contribution to input resistance is negligible at the resting potential of MCs (below -60 mV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Delmas &amp; Brown 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jones, Gamper &amp; Gao 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Liu, Bian &amp; Wang 2021</xref>), once the membrane potential rises to a near-threshold level (-45 mV), the excessive activity of Kv7 channels act to reduce input resistance and suppress AP initiation thus reducing MC excitability in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. How does loss of FMRP cause an increase in Kv7 function? Both KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 have been identified as FMRP translational targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Darnell et al 2011</xref>). Our western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 in KO mice were not altered in the whole brain lysate in general, nor in the dentate gyrus region, specifically. In addition to translational regulation, FMRP is also known to regulate activity of several K<sup>+</sup> channels, including Slack, BK, SK and Kv1.2 via protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Deng &amp; Klyachko 2021</xref>). However, in all of these cases, FMRP loss decreases rather than increases K<sup>+</sup> channel activity, making loss of protein-protein interactions an unlikely mechanism to explain increased Kv7 function. One alternative possibility is that loss of FMRP affects intracellular second-messenger signaling pathways that may regulate Kv7 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Haick et al 2017</xref>). For example, activation of PKC suppresses Kv7 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Delmas &amp; Brown 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Haick et al 2017</xref>) and PKCÎµ expression was found to be reduced in hippocampus of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Marsillo et al 2021</xref>). supporting a possibility that the increased Kv7 function in KO MCs may be associated with abnormal PKC signaling. However, further studies will be needed to elucidate the precise mechanism responsible for the increased Kv7 function in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice.</p>
<p>Our analyses show that while the MC excitability dysfunction is unusual in being opposite in direction to other excitatory neurons, it nevertheless leads to abnormally increased granule cell output (i.e., dentate output) in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. This counterintuitive effect arises because in addition to directly exciting granule cells, MCs act via local inhibitory networks to indirectly suppress granule cell activity. Therefore, the net effect of MC activity on granule cell output is orchestrated via a dynamically tuned E/I balance of direct excitation and indirect inhibition. In their control of inhibition, the MCs relay and expand granule cell-derived excitatory drive onto interneurons, which then convert this drive into stronger feed-back inhibition onto granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Botterill et al 2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hashimotodani et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Houser et al 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yeh et al 2018</xref>). Notably, the resulting E/I balance driving granule cell output is not static; rather, during network activity, short-term plasticity actively modulates outputs from both excitatory and inhibitory synapses to dynamically fine-tune the E/I drives and optimize neural computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bartley &amp; Dobrunz 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bhatia, Moza &amp; Bhalla 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Grangeray-Vilmint et al 2018</xref>). Consequently, the MC hypo-excitability in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice effectively reduces excitatory drive onto local interneurons, which in turn reduces local inhibitory drive to granule cells, ultimately leading to abnormal dentate information processing and exaggerated granule cell output. Given that granule cells normally fire sparsely during information processing, this increased AP output in granule cells is reminiscent of abnormal CA3-to-CA1 information transmission in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, in which a large amount of âânoiseââ that is normally filtered out during synaptic processing is being transmitted indiscriminately due to FMRP loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Deng et al 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>We note the discrepancy in the changes of inhibitory drives among different cell types, i.e., sIPSC frequency was increased in MCs, showed no change in granule cells and a decrease in interneurons, which cannot be explained by a simple change in excitability of any one cell type in dentate gyrus. Rather, these distinct changes might indicate a compensatory circuit reorganization of the interneuron axonal terminals onto these three targets in the absence of FMRP. Indeed, FMRP plays a crucial role in synaptogenesis and synaptic refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Booker et al 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Doll &amp; Broadie 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kennedy, Rinker &amp; Broadie 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Sears &amp; Broadie 2018</xref>), and loss of FMRP is well known to cause changes in synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gibson et al 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kennedy, Rinker &amp; Broadie 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Patel et al 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Patel et al 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tessier &amp; Broadie 2009</xref>). Such circuit reorganization can explain the balanced E/I drive onto granule cells in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice we observed in the basal state, which can result from reorganization of inhibitory axonal terminals in favor of increased contacts onto granule cells and MCs, and reduced contacts onto other interneurons, as a compensation for the decreased MC-derived excitatory drive. In line with this notion, it has been reported that dentate circuit reorganization occurs after status epilepticus, which can increase inhibitory drive onto granule cells and function as a homeostatic compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Butler, Westbrook &amp; Schnell 2022</xref>). Indeed, many of the cellular and synaptic changes in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice are antagonistic and mitigating circuit dysfunction, and thus compensate for the primary defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Domanski et al 2019</xref>). However, even though the homeostatic circuit compensation is able to maintain the basal E/I input balance in granule cells of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, this compensation was insufficient to maintain dynamic E/I balance during active states, such as during network activity evoked by PP stimulation. Consequently, the dentate output was exaggerated during the physiologically-relevant theta-gamma coupling activity in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. Indeed, as discussed above, E/I balance is dynamically tuned to rapidly adjust during circuit computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bartley &amp; Dobrunz 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bhatia, Moza &amp; Bhalla 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Grangeray-Vilmint et al 2018</xref>), which is thought to represent a fundamental mechanism underlying efficient neural coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zhou &amp; Yu 2018</xref>). Considering that the theta-gamma oscillation coupling plays a critical role in dentate information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bott et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Leutgeb et al 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lisman &amp; Jensen 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mizuseki et al 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Neves et al 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pernia-Andrade &amp; Jonas 2014</xref>), our findings indicate that MC-driven E/I imbalance is a critical defect contributing to dentate dysfunction in FXS. Moreover, by projecting axons both ipsi-and contra-laterally along the longitudinal axis of the dentate gyrus, MCs are uniquely positioned to influence dentate activity widely across lamellae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Jinde, Zsiros &amp; Nakazawa 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Scharfman 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Scharfman 2018</xref>). This wide-reaching control of dentate activity makes MC hypo-excitability in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice a core defect in the dysregulation of circuit E/I dynamics and information processing.</p>
<p>Most critical discovery in this regard is our finding that circuit-wide inhibition of Kv7 was sufficient to re-normalize E/I balance in the dentate circuit despite the irreconcilable hypo-excitable state of MCs and hyperexcitable state of granule cells in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. Specifically, XE991 corrected MC hypo-excitability via direct effect on Kv7 channels in MCs and normalized granule cell excitability through dentate three-synapse feedback pathway in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. Moreover, inhibition of Kv7 channels was also sufficient to restore the dentate output during the physiologically-relevant theta-gamma coupling activity in KO mice. Although inhibition of K<sup>+</sup> channels is typically expected to increase circuit excitability, the key role of MCs as the main excitatory drive for this three-synapse feed-back inhibition resulted in the overall suppression of circuit hyperexcitability in the dentate circuit of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. This effect arises because the excessive Kv7 function is present selectively in MCs of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. As a result, inhibition of Kv7 had a stronger effect on enhancing MC-dependent feedback inhibition onto granule cells than directly increasing granule cell excitability in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice.</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that a circuit-based intervention can normalize dynamic E/I balance and restore dentate gyrus output. Thus, circuit-based interventions can represent a potential therapeutic strategy to correct dentate dysfunction in this disorder.</p>

<title>Action potential recording</title>
<p>AP recordings using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) were made from mossy cells, interneurons or granule cells with infrared video microscopy and differential interference contrast optics (Olympus BX51WI).

The recording electrodes were filled with the following in the present study (unless stated otherwise) (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 0.1 EGTA, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 ATPNa<sub>2</sub>, 0.4 GTPNa, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3).

<p>Mossy cells were identified by their location, characteristic morphology (size and shape) and electrophysiological properties, including RMP, cell capacitance, input resistance, sEPSCs with high frequency and large amplitude, AP with relatively small afterhyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bui et al 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chancey et al 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Jinde et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Scharfman &amp; Myers 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wang et al 2021</xref>). For determination of excitability, mossy cell membrane potential was set to given potentials (-64 to - 55 mV with 1-mV step) through amplifierâs function of automatic current injection. Number of APs within 20 s was averaged from 4-5 trials for each cell. For measurements of AP parameters, we employed a ramp current injection (0.15 pA/ms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Deng et al 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deng et al 2022</xref>) with a hyperpolarizing onset to ensure maximal Na<sup>+</sup> channel availability before the 1st AP. All AP parameters (except number of APs) were determined only from the first APs of ramp-evoked AP trains to avoid the influence from cumulatively inactivating voltage-gated channels. AP threshold was defined as the voltage at the voltage trace turning point, corresponding to the first peak of 3rd order derivative of AP trace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deng et al 2022</xref>). The rheobase was defined as the ramp current amplitude at the time point of threshold; rheobase charge transfer was determined by the integration of time and input current. The maximum rising rate was determined as the peak of the 1st order derivative of AP trace. AP duration was measured at the level of AP trace crossing -10 mV. The AP amplitude was measured from the threshold point to the AP peak because the membrane potential was continuously ramp-up with time and the threshold point is the most reliable point before an AP in this setting. The rise and fall time was the interval of 10â 90% amplitude during AP upstroke and down-stroke, respectively.</p>
<p>Hilar interneurons were easily distinguished from mossy cells according to the differences in morphology and electrophysiological properties (relative to mossy cells, interneurons have more depolarizing RMP, smaller capacitance, higher input resistance, and larger afterhyperpolariztion). AP firing pattern in response to a 100 pA depolarizing step current for 600 ms was used to classify interneurons into 3 types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3A</xref>).</p>
<p>Granule cells were identified by the location and characteristic electrophysiological properties (relative to interneurons): very hyperpolarizing resting membrane potential (â¼ -80mV), very low sEPSC frequency, and smaller afterhyperpolarization. To avoid recording from newly generated immature granule cells, we used cells located at the outer regions of the granule cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deng et al 2022</xref>). For step-current-evoked AP output in granule cells, we used multistep-current (50â75 pA with an increase of 5 pA/step for 600 ms) to evoke APs from granule cells. The RMP was set to -80 mV by constant current injection (if necessary) for better comparison among cells. Number of APs was averaged over 5-8 trials in each cell. For PP stimulation-evoked AP in granule cells, the stimulation protocol consisted of a train of 5 Hz; the stimulation electrodes positioned in the middle molecular layer of dentate gyrus to stimulate medial PP. The RMP of granule cells was set to -70 mV for facilitating AP firing and the stimulation intensity was adjusted so that the AP probability was â¼0.5 (under 5 Hz stimulation). A burst of gamma stimulation (5 stimuli at 50 Hz, 200 ms before the first stimulus of 5 Hz train) was used to evaluate gamma stimulation-induced suppression of granule cell output in response to PP theta stimulation. Granule cell output was expressed as the AP probability. When PP stimulation failed to evoke APs, we measured the amplitude of EPSPs, which was defined as the voltage differences between individual EPSP peaks and the initial baseline before gamma-stimulation (set to be -70 mV). For better comparison, the EPSP amplitudes were normalized to their own controls. AP probability was calculated from at least 10 trials in each cell.</p>

<title>Measurement of resting membrane potential, capacitance and input resistance</title>
<p>Resting membrane potential (RMP) was measured immediately after whole-cell formation. Cell capacitance is determined by the amplifierâs auto whole-cell compensation function with slightly manual adjustment to optimize the measurement if needed. For input resistance, assessment was performed using the canonical method, in which the voltage response to a negative current injection (â60 pA for 500 ms) at RMP was used to calculate input resistance. For measurement of input resistance around threshold levels, we pharmacologically isolated MCs using blockers against both glutamate and GABA receptors (in Î¼M, 10 NMDA, 50 APV, 10 MPEP, 5 gabazine and 2 CGP55845) to isolate mossy cells from the dentate circuit. TTX (1 Î¼M) and CdCl<sub>2</sub> (10 Î¼M) were also used to block Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, respectively. Under these conditions, a positive current injection (+60 pA for 500 ms) at -45 mV (set by constant current injection) was used to evoke voltage response, which then used to calculate input resistance.</p>

For determining changes in membrane potentials in response to Kv7 inhibition, membrane potentials were initially set at -45 mV (by constant current injection). Under these conditions, the differences in membrane potentials before and during XE991 (10 Î¼M) were calculated as the changes in membrane potential.</p>

<title>Kv7 current recording</title>
<p>We used a depolarizing voltage ramp (-95 to +5 mV, 0.02 mV/ms) to evoke Kv7 current from MCs, using the same internal and external solutions as those in holding current recordings. Cell capacitance was compensated. Series resistance compensation was enabled with 80â90% correction and 16 Î¼s lag. Kv7 current was isolated by subtracting current in 10 Î¼M XE991 from that before XE991. The I-V curves were constructed from ramp-evoked Kv7 currents every 5 mV and normalized to respective cell capacitances (mean current value over 0.01 mV intervals from averages of four to five trials for each cell to approximate quasi-steady-state current).</p>

<title>Recordings of spontaneous and miniature postsynaptic currents</title>
<p>Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) were recorded from hilar mossy cells (holding at -65 mV) and interneurons (at -60 mV). The pipette solution was the same as that used in AP recording, except that QX-314 (1 mM) was included in the pipette solution to block possible action current. The bath solution was supplemented with gabazine (5 Î¼M) to block GABA<sub>A</sub>R responses. The solutions used to recording of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were the same as those for sEPSCs, except that tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 Î¼M) was included in the bath solution to block action potential-dependent responses.</p>
<p>For recording of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs), the recording pipette solution contained (in mM): 130 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 10 HEPES, and 0.1 EGTA (pH 7.3). The bath solution was supplemented with APV (50 Î¼M) and DNQX (10 Î¼M) to block responses of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Note that IPSC is down-going signal in this high chloride internal solution. For miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) recording, TTX was added in the bath solution.</p>
<p>For simultaneous recording of sEPSCs and sIPSCs from granule cells, the recording pipette solution contained (in mM): 135 K-gluconate, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, 0.2 EGTA and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3). External solution was the same as AP recordings (without any blockers, unless stated otherwise). The membrane potential was held at -40 mV. Under this condition, EPSC is down-going signal (inward current) and IPSC up-going signal (outward current). The events detection threshold was 10 pA for sEPSC and sIPSC detection; the automatic detection was visually verified.</p>

<title>Recording of compound postsynaptic current and isolation of underlying EPSC and IPSC</title>
<p>The compound postsynaptic current (cPSC) was recorded from granule cells by stimulation medial PP at 0.2 Hz and using the same pipette solution as that of simultaneous recording of sEPSCs and sIPSCs, except that QX314 (1 mM) was included to block action current. Granule cells were held at -45 mV, which is an intermediate potential between the excitatory and inhibitory reversal potentials ensuring comparable driving force for excitatory and inhibitory conductances. The PP-stimulation-evoked cPSC had an initial down-ward excitatory component and followed by an up-ward inhibitory component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6A</xref>). The cPSC excitation window was defined as the full duration of excitatory component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6C</xref>). At the end of each recording, the pure EPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6B</xref>) was recorded by adding GABA<sub>A</sub> blocker gabazine (5 Î¼M) and keeping the same stimulation intensity, which was used to create an EPSC template (average of at least 20 uncontaminated EPSCs) for each cell. The EPSC template was then repeatedly scaled to each data point of cPSC âapproximating segmentâ to obtain a set of scaled EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6C</xref>). All scaled EPSCs were then averaged to approximate an underlying EPSC for a given cPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6C</xref>). The âapproximating segmentâ of cPSC was defined as 25â65% height of cPSC excitatory component, but not beyond 2.5 ms after stimulation. The underlying IPSC was isolated by subtracting the underlying EPSC from corresponding cPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6D</xref>). For better comparison, we normalized the cPSC and underlying IPSC to their respective underlying EPSC, which reflects the PP stimulation intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6E</xref>). The underlying EPSC and IPSC were then used to estimate E/I ratio by their peak amplitudes or charge transfer (amplitude-time integration within 100 ms). Data for each cell were averages from 20â25 uncontaminated cPSC events.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Whole brains or dentate gyrus regions (isolated from the brain slices) were lysed in 2% sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Sciences) and manually homogenized. Protein concentration was determined by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) against bovine serum albumin standards. 50 Î¼g total protein was run on NuPage 4-12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels (Life Technologies) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blotted with antibodies directed against the following proteins: Î±-tubulin, Kv7.2, Kv7.3, rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Blots were developed with SuperSignal West Dura (ThermoFisher) and imaged with a ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The data were analyzed in MatLab, except for the postsynaptic currents (sEPSC, mEPSC, sIPSC and mIPSC) that were analyzed by MiniAnalysis. All figures were made in Origin or MatLab. Data are presented as mean Â± SEM. Studentâs t test, one-way ANOVA, Kolmogorovâ Smirnov (K-S) test or Chi-square test were used for statistical analysis as appropriate. Significance was set as p &lt; 0.05. The n was number of cells tested in electrophysiological experiments, which was from at least 3 different mice for each condition. The N in Western blotting was number of animals used. All statistical values can be found in Table S1.</p>

<caption><title>Estimation of direct and circuit effects of XE991 on granule cell excitability (related to Figure 7)</title>
<p>(A) XE991 can directly increase excitability of granule cells, leading to increase AP firing. The direct effect of XE991 on AP firing were defined as the differences between before and during XE991 in the isolated granule cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>), ie, values of (7F<italic><sub>lower</sub></italic> â 7F<italic><sub>upper</sub></italic>), where 7F<italic><sub>lower</sub></italic>and 7F<italic><sub>upper</sub></italic> are the mean values from <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref> lower and upper panels, respectively. Note that XE991 directly increases number of AP largely independent of step current intensity in both genotypes, but with relative larger effect in KO mice. GCs, granule cells.</p><p>(B) XE991 can also modulate granule cell excitability to change AP firing via its circuit effect. Values were estimated from the differences before and during XE991, between isolated granule cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>) and granule cells with intact circuit (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>), ie, values of [(7H<italic><sub>lower</sub></italic> â 7H<italic><sub>upper</sub></italic>) - (7F<italic><sub>lower</sub></italic> â 7F<italic><sub>upper</sub></italic>)], where 7F and 7H are the mean values from <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7F</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7H</xref> (lower or upper panel, accordingly). Note that the circuit effect of XE991 on AP firing was also independent of step current intensity (little effect in WT mice as shown by values fluctuating around 0; but dampening â¼6 APs in KO mice).</p></caption>

<caption><title>Isolation of underlying EPSC and IPSC from compound PSC (related to Figure 8)</title>
<p>(A and B) Compound postsynaptic current (cPSC) was recorded from granule cells by holding membrane potential at -45 mV. The cPSC (A) shows an initial excitatory component (down-ward) and followed by an inhibitory component (up-ward). Dotted line denotes the baseline before stimulation. At the end of each recording, the pure EPSC (B) was recorded by keeping the same stimulation intensity and in the presence of gabazine, which was used to create EPSC template (an average of at least 20 uncontaminated EPSCs) for the same cell. Note that the amplitude and decay trajectory of pure EPSC was largely different from excitatory component of cPSC. Stimulation artifacts were removed. Boxed area in (A) was enlarged to show the procedure of approximation of underlying EPSC.</p><p>(C) Zoom-in of boxed area in (A) showing approximation of underlying EPSC. The EPSC template was repeatedly scaled to each data point (black circles) of cPSC âapproximating segmentâ (AS) to obtain a set of scaled EPSCs (gray traces). All scaled EPSCs were then averaged to approximate an underlying EPSC (orange trace) for a given cPSC (black trace). The cPSC âapproximating segmentâ was defined as 25â65% height of cPSC excitatory component (but not beyond 2.5 ms after stimulation). Excitation window was defined as the full duration of cPSC excitatory component. Stimulation artifact was removed. âSâ denotes the stimulation time point.</p><p>(D) The underlying IPSC (blue trace) was isolated by subtracting the underlying EPSC (orange trace as that in C) from corresponding cPSC (black trace). For the purpose of view, the baseline before stimulation was shifted to be 0 in the figure. The two vertical red lines delimit the excitation window.</p><p>(E) Normalized traces of cPSC, underlying EPSC and IPSC. For better comparison, we normalized the cPSC and underlying IPSC to their respective underlying EPSC, which reflects the PP stimulation intensity.

<caption><title>Circuit-wide inhibition of Kv7 channels corrected dentate gyrus output in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (related to Figure 8)</title>
<p>(A) The diagram shows dentate gyrus output in response to theta-gamma coupling stimulation of PP in the WT mice. Here, we focus on the three-synapse indirect feedback inhibition pathway: Granule cells (GCs)âMCsâInterneurons (INs)âGCs (thickness of arrows indicating synaptic drive weight). Because MCs (rather than granule cells) provide the main source of excitatory drive onto interneurons, the three-synapse indirect feedback inhibition likely surpasses the canonical two-synapse feedback inhibition (ie, GCsâINsâGCs). This model indicates that, in the normal condition, MCs integrate the incoming excitatory input and then relay and expand it to interneurons, which secures a sufficient and well-timed inhibition feedback onto granule cells to maintain a dynamically balanced E/I inputs onto granule cells and a narrow excitation window, and thus ensures sparse AP firing in granule cells. Red arrows designate excitation and blue arrows inhibition. The arrow entering shading areas from left side represents PP input (theta-gamma coupling stimulation). The downward arrow exiting the shading area indicates dentate output to CA3. The thinly semi-transparent arrows are synaptic connections whose contribution to cellular excitability has not been evaluated in the present study. The thickness of arrows denotes the synaptic drive weight of excitation (or inhibition). It is noteworthy that the actual synaptic drive weight of each synapse varies dynamically to maintain the precisely well-timed circuit E/I balance and then proper information processing. Thus, one may imagine that the thickness of each arrow (ie, synaptic drive weight) changes dynamically and sequentially (due to neurotransmission direction and synaptic delays) to understand dynamic E/I balance.</p><p>(B) The same as in (<bold>a</bold>), but for KO mice. Loss of FMRP caused these changes (for details, see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>, 4, 5, 6 and 8): 1) the granule cells are hyperexcitable (highlighted by yellow explosion marker), and dentate output are increased (thicker arrow compared with that of WT mice in A); 2) MCs are hypo-excitable (shadow font) and MCs output are decreased (thinner arrow); 3) both excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto MCs are increased (thicker arrows); and 4) both excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto INs are reduced (thinner arrows).</p><p>(C) The same as in (B), but in the presence of XE991 (circuit-wide inhibition of Kv7 channels). XE991 caused these changes in the KO mice (for details, see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8</xref> and S7): 1) Owing to the abnormal enhanced Kv7 function in KO MCs, XE991 boosted up MC excitability (explosion marker) to enhance excitatory output (thicker red arrow) onto interneurons, which increases interneurons excitability (explosion marker); and 2) XE991 increased inhibitory drive onto granule cells (thicker blue arrow onto granule cells compared with that of in (B), which dampens EPSP integration (due to summation of enhanced inhibitory input) in granule cells and suppresses dentate gyrus output.</p></caption>

<p>This is a <bold>fundamental</bold> work that significantly advances our understanding of the role of mossy cells in the dentate gyrus in Fragile X Syndrome. Carefully designed experiments provide evidence that changes in their excitability occur due to up-regulation of Kv7 currents. While the evidence supporting the authors' conclusions is <bold>solid</bold>, some of their claims did not consider other potential factors and explanations. The work will be of interest to neuroscientists working on unveiling the mechanisms of Fragile X pathology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this work, the authors provide evidence to show that an increase in Kv7 channels in hilar mossy cells of Fmr1 knock out mice results in a marked decrease in their excitability. The reduction in excitatory drive onto local hilar interneurons produces an increased excitation/inhibition ratio in granule cells. Inhibiting Kv7 channels can help normalize the excitatory drive in this circuit, suggesting that they may represent a viable target for targeted therapeutics for fragile-x syndrome.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The work is supported by a compelling and thorough set of electrophysiological studies. The authors do an excellent job of analysing their data and present a very complete data set.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are no significant weaknesses in the experimental work, however the complexity of the data presentation and the lack of a schematic showing the organizational framework of this circuit make the data less accessible to non-experts in the field. I highly encourage a graphical abstract and network diagram to help individuals understand the implications of this work.</p>
<p>The work is important as it identifies a unique regional and cell-specific abnormality in Fmr1 KO mice, showing how the loss of one gene can result in region-specific changes in brain circuits.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Deng et al. investigate, for the first time to my knowledge, the role that hippocampal dentate gyrus mossy cells play in Fragile X Syndrome. They provide strong evidence that, in slice preparations from Fmr1 knockout mice, mossy cells are hypoactive due to increased Kv7 function whereas granule cells are hyperactive compared to slices from wild-type mice. They provide indirect evidence that the weakness of mossy cell-interneuron connections contributes to granule cell hyperexcitability, despite converse adaptations to mossy cell inputs. The authors show that application of the Kv7 inhibitor XE991 is able to rescue granule cell hyperexcitability back to wild-type baseline, supporting the overall conclusion that inhibition of Kv7 in the dentate may be a potential therapeutic approach for Fragile X Syndrome. However, any claims regarding specific circuit-based intervention or analysis are limited by the exclusively pharmacological approach of the manipulations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Thorough electrophysiological characterization of mossy cells in Fmr1 knockout mice, a novel finding.</p>
<p>Their electrophysiological approach is quite rigorous: patched different neuron types (GC, MC, INs) one at a time within the dentate gyrus in FMR1 KO and WT, with and without 'circuit blockade' by pharmacologically inhibiting neurotransmission. This allows the most detailed characterization possible of passive membrane/intrinsic cell differences in the dentate gyrus of Fmr1 knockout mice.</p>
<p>Provide several examples showing the use of Kv7 inhibitor XE991 is able to rescue excitability of granule cell circuit in Fmr1 knockout mice (AP firing in the intact circuit, postsynaptic current recordings, theta-gamma coupling stimulation).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The implications for these findings and the applicability of the potential treatment for the disorder in a whole animal are limited due to the fact that all experiments were done in slices.</p>
<p>The authors' interpretation of the word 'circuit-based' is problematic - there are no truly circuit-specific manipulations in this study due to the reliance on pharmacology for their manipulations. While the application of the Kv7 inhibitor may have a predominant effect on the circuit through changes to mossy cell excitability, this manipulation would affect many other cells within the dentate and adjacent brain regions that connect to the dentate that express Kv7 as well.</p>

<p>The paper by Deng, Kumar, Cavalli, Klyachko describes that, unlike in other cell types, loss of Fmr1 decreases the excitability of hippocampal mossy cells due to up-regulation of Kv7 currents. They also show evidence that while muting mossy cells appears to be a compensatory mechanism, it contributes to the higher activity of the dentate gyrus, because the removal of mossy cell output alleviates the inhibition of dentate principal cells. This may be important for the patho-mechanism in Fragile X syndrome caused by the loss of Fmr1.</p>
<p>These experiments were carefully designed, and the results are presented âin a very logical, insightful, and self-explanatory way. Therefore, this paper represents strong evidence for the claims of the authors. In the current state of the manuscript, there are only a few points that need additional explanation.</p>
<p>One of the results, which is shown in the supplementary dataset, does not fit the main conclusions. Changes in the mEPSC frequency suggest that in addition to the proposed network effects, there are additional changes in the synaptic machinery or synapse number that are independent of the actual activity of the neurons. Since the differences of the mEPSC and sEPSC frequencies are similar and because only the latter can signal network effects, while the former is typically interpreted as a presynaptic change, it cannot be claimed that sEPSC frequency changes are due to the hypo-excitability of mossy cells.</p>
<p>An apparent technical issue may imply a second weak point in the interpretation of the results. Because the IPSCs in the PP stimulation experiments (Fig 8) start within a few milliseconds, it is unlikely that its first âcomponents originate from the PP-GC-MC-IN feedforward inhibitory circuit. The involvement of this circuit and MCs in the Kv7-dependent excitability changes is the main implication of the results of this paper. But this feedforward inhibition requires three consecutive synaptic steps and EPSP-AP couplings, each of them lasting for at least 1ms + 2-5ms. Therefore, the inhibition via the PP-GC-MC-IN circuit can be only seen from 10-20ms after PP stimulation. The earlier components of the cPSCs should originate from other circuit elements that are not related to the rest of the paper. Therefore, more isolated measurements on the cPSC recordings are needed âwhich consider only the later phase of the IPSCs. This can be either a measurement of the decay phase or a pharmacological manipulation that selectively enhances/inhibits a specific component of the proposed circuit.</p>
<p>I suggest refraining from the conclusions saying &quot;âMCs provide at least ~51% of the excitatory drive onto interneurons in WT and ~41% in KO mice&quot;, because too many factors (eg. IN cell types, slice condition, synaptic reliability) are not accounted for in these actual numbers, and these values are not necessary for the general observation of the paper.</p>
<p>There are additional minor issues about the presentation of the results.</p>
