<title>Abstract</title><p>Perturbational complexity analysis predicts the presence of consciousness in volunteers and patients by stimulating the brain with brief pulses, recording electroencephalographic (<bold>EEG</bold>) responses, and computing their spatiotemporal complexity. We examined the underlying neural circuits in mice by directly stimulating cortex while recording with EEG and Neuropixels probes during wakefulness and isoflurane anesthesia. When mice are awake, stimulation of deep cortical layers reliably evokes locally a brief pulse of excitation, followed by a bi-phasic sequence of 120 ms profound <italic>off</italic> period and a <italic>rebound</italic> excitation. A similar pattern, partially attributed to burst spiking, is seen in thalamic nuclei, and is associated with a pronounced late component in the evoked EEG. We infer that cortico-thalamo-cortical interactions drive the long-lasting evoked EEG signals elicited by deep cortical stimulation during the awake state. The cortical and thalamic off period and rebound excitation, and the late component in the EEG, are reduced during running and absent during anesthesia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A long-standing clinical challenge has been to discover sensitive and specific biomarkers of consciousness. One obvious candidate is electroencephalography (<bold>EEG</bold>), with high amplitude delta activity usually taken as an indicator of absence of consciousness, as during deep sleep, anesthesia, in vegetative state patients (also known as behavioral unresponsive wakefulness syndrome), or in coma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Kobylarz &amp; Schiff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Schiff et al., 2014</xref>). However, given the vast diversity of patients and their etiology, spontaneous EEG can show very unusual spatio-temporal patterns, with attendant high false alarm and miss rates in diagnosing individual patients with disorders of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Farisco et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Frohlich et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Thibaut et al., 2019</xref>). More promising is the perturbational EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai et al., 2021</xref>), in which the brain is probed by a brief pulse (generated via transcranial magnetic stimulation, <bold>TMS</bold>, applied to the skull or electrical stimulation applied intracranially) and the resulting cortical activity is recorded using a high-density EEG electrode array or stereo-EEG electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Casali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Casarotto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Comolatti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Massimini et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Pigorini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Rosanova et al., 2018</xref>). A simple algorithm then computes the <italic>perturbational complexity index</italic> (<bold>PCI</bold>) of the brain’s reverberations to this pulse from which the presence of consciousness can be inferred with unprecedented sensitivity (low false alarm rate), and specificity (low miss rate), at the level of individual patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Kondziella et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>PCI has been comprehensively studied and validated in humans since its introduction by Massimini and colleagues in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Casali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Casarotto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Comolatti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ferrarelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Massimini et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Rosanova et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Pigorini et al. (2015)</xref> proposed that during non-rapid eye movement (<bold>NREM</bold>) sleep, when the brain is characterized by cortical bistability, neurons tend to fall into a down-state following activation (either endogenous or exogenous) preventing extended causal interactions that are typical during wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Hill &amp; Tononi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Rosanova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Timofeev et al., 2001</xref>). Limitations in access to high resolution cellular recordings in humans have motivated recent efforts to translate the PCI technique to model systems for more detailed studies of the circuit mechanisms underlying complexity changes. In 2018, D’Andola et al. demonstrated that an approximation of PCI developed for <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements captured complexity differences in ferret cortical slices exhibiting sleep- and awake-like activity patterns. They showed that during a sleep-like state, electrical stimulation induced a down-state that disrupted the complex pattern of activation observed in the awake-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">D’Andola et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arena et al. (2021)</xref> were the first to recapitulate the human PCI results <italic>in vivo</italic> in rodents; they computed the complexity of electrically evoked EEG responses in rats and showed that PCI was high during wakefulness and low during anesthesia. In their comprehensive study, they found that in the anesthetized state (via propofol or sevoflurane), stimulation was followed by a widespread suppression of high frequencies in the EEG responses, suggestive of a down-state, in agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">D’Andola et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Pigorini et al., 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Dasilva et al. (2021)</xref> measured PCI <italic>in vivo</italic> in anesthetized mice and showed that complexity can be modulated even within the anesthetized state. They showed that PCI was highest for mice under light isoflurane anesthesia (defined as a concentration of 0.1%), decreasing systematically at medium (0.34%) and deep (1.16%) concentrations. Recently, Cavelli, Mao et al. (2022) validated the use of PCI in freely moving rodents across wakefulness, both REM and NREM sleep, and anesthesia by demonstrating that PCI calculated on cortical laminar local field potential (<bold>LFP</bold>) signals decreases in unconscious states (both natural and induced) in rats and mice. While pioneering, none of these studies simultaneously recorded micro- and macro-signals – neurons and LFP at hundreds of sites, together with EEG.</p>
<p>To investigate how cortico-cortical and cortico-thalamic activity influences the complexity of the evoked responses, we used EEG simultaneously with Neuropixels probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Jun et al., 2017</xref>) to record brain-wide evoked responses to cortical electrical stimulation in head-fixed mice that were awake and, subsequently, anesthetized with isoflurane. Due to their ability to record spiking and LFP signals from hundreds of sites across cortical layers and subcortical structures at 20 μm resolution, Neuropixels probes provide unprecedented access to the intra- and interareal dynamics that underlie the macro-scale EEG signals. We show that cortical stimulation elicits a widespread, complex event-related potential (<bold>ERP</bold>) in the EEG signals in the awake state, but a much simpler ERP in the isoflurane-anesthetized state, in agreement with what has been shown in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Casali et al., 2013</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arena et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cavelli et al., 2022</xref>). We demonstrate a stereotyped pattern of activity to stimulation in deep (but not superficial) cortical layers – brief excitation, followed by a profound <italic>off</italic> period and a <italic>rebound</italic> excitation (“rebound” is a term often used to describe a period of enhanced spiking following a period of inhibition or silence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Grenier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Guido &amp; Weyand, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Roux et al., 2014</xref>]). This sequence is repeated in the thalamus, supported by burst firing in excitatory thalamic neurons. Based on relative timing between cortical and thalamic evoked activity, we infer that thalamic bursting is necessary for the late, evoked EEG component seen in response to electrical stimulation, a novel result that links the ERP to activity in the cortico-thalamo-cortical (<bold>CTC</bold>) loop.</p>

<title>Global evoked responses are modulated by the depth of the cortical stimulation site</title>
<p>We recorded global EEG-like neural signals using a multi-electrode surface array on the skull, but below the scalp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Jonak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Land et al., 2019</xref>), in head-fixed mice. The multi-electrode array consisted of 30 electrodes situated over primary and secondary motor, somatosensory, visual, and retrosplenial areas in both hemispheres (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We used an average reference montage that removed signals common to all EEG electrodes (see Methods). We inserted a bipolar wire electrode intra-cortically to repeatedly deliver a single electrical current pulse into the cortex and measured the evoked potentials with the EEG array (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). The current pulses were biphasic with an amplitude between 10-100 μA (details in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> inset). Stimulation artifacts in the EEG signals were reduced by replacing the signal between 0 and +2 ms following each stimulus with the signal between −2 and 0 ms; this was done to all traces in all trials during an offline, signal pre-processing step. All subsequent analysis of the ERP (the trial-averaged EEG response) excludes the signal between −2 and +2 ms. During the experiment, we closely observed the animal for signs of electrically evoked motor twitches and chose lower stimulation amplitudes if we observed any.</p>

</fig>
<p>To understand how the features of the ERP depend on the location of the electrical stimulation, we varied both the area and the depth (or cortical layer) of the stimulating electrode. We stimulated in the secondary motor area (<bold>MOs</bold>) and the primary somatosensory area (<bold>SSp</bold>) in layer 2/3 (superficial: 0.41±0.04 mm below the brain surface) and layer 5/6 (deep: 1.06±0.05 mm below the brain surface) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). We found that regardless of area, when we stimulated layer 5/6 during the awake period, we usually observed two prominent peaks in the ERP: an initial response around 25 ms and secondary peak at around 180 ms post-stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>).</p>
<p>The early component was preserved, whereas the second, late component was not evident when stimulating superficially in either area (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The total duration of the ERP was shorter when stimulating superficial layers compared to deep layers although not significant (mean ERP duration for superficial stimulation: 0.4±0.0 s; deep stimulation: 0.5±0.1 s; Student’s two-tailed t-test, p=0.0843; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>). When stimulating superficially, ERPs had a significantly smaller normalized magnitude compared to stimulating deep layers (mean ERP magnitude for superficial stimulation: 3.3±0.8 s.d.·s; deep stimulation: 6.2±0.9 s.d.·s; Student’s two-tailed t-test, p=0.0354; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The amplitude of the first peak in the ERP decays systematically when moving away from the stimulation site until it eventually flips its sign, most likely reflecting volume conduction (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2</xref>). The magnitude and polarity of the second component likewise changes continuously but in a different pattern, suggesting a different mechanistic origin.</p>

<title>The spiking response pattern of the stimulated cortex echoes the ERP</title>
<p>In addition to recording EEG signals, we simultaneously collected data from up to three Neuropixels probes – linear silicon probes with a 10 mm long non-tapered shank with 384 simultaneously recorded electrodes capable of capturing LFP and action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Jun et al., 2017</xref>). The Neuropixels probes were placed in such a manner as to record from cortex (motor <bold>MO</bold>, anterior cingulate <bold>ACA</bold>, somatosensory <bold>SS</bold>, and visual <bold>VIS</bold>) and sensorimotor-related thalamic nuclei (<bold>SM-TH</bold>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), see full list of thalamic nuclei in the Methods section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; J. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Harris et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Hooks et al., 2013</xref>). The Neuropixels probes were inserted approximately perpendicular to the cortical surface. This allowed us to observe the LFP and the spiking activity of hundreds of individual cortical and thalamic neurons. From the LFP, we infer the current source density (<bold>CSD</bold>) using a computational method that assumes an ohmic conductive medium, constant extracellular conductivity (0.3 S/m), and homogeneous in-plane neuronal activity, with the boundary condition of zero current outside the sampled area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Freeman &amp; Nicholson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Mitzdorf, 1985</xref>).</p>

<p>We inserted a Neuropixels probe near the stimulating electrode (within 0.5 mm) and, often, up to two additional Neuropixels probes at distal locations. We observed direct responses (i.e., defined operationally as neurons that spike between 2-25 ms following the electrical pulse; this might miss a handful of very rapidly (i.e., &lt; 2 ms) responding neurons; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Sombeck et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Stoelzel et al., 2009</xref>) as well as indirect responses to the electrical stimulation. To look for cell-type specific activation patterns we classified regular spiking (<bold>RS</bold>) and fast spiking (<bold>FS</bold>) neurons (putative pyramidal and putative parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons, respectively) based on their spike waveform duration (RS duration &gt; 4 ms; FS duration ≤ 0.4 ms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Barthó et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bortone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Bruno &amp; Simons, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Niell &amp; Stryker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sirota et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Stimulating superficial MOs evoked a local spike, LFP and CSD response, followed by a period of quiescence lasting 94.2±16.1 ms in MO neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, left). There were minimal to no evoked responses (LFP, CSD, or spikes) in other sampled areas (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-2F</xref>, left).</p>
<p>Stimulating deep MOs evoked a robust change in LFP and CSD, accompanied by spiking activity reflective of the two components in the ERP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> right): an initial excitation within 25 ms (peak population firing rate 38.1±4.2 Hz), followed by quiescence (duration 125.0±5.5 ms) and a longer period of strong excitation (peak population firing rate 7.9±0.7 Hz; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, right). This cortical response pattern was quite stereotyped – an initial excitation, followed by an off period and a strong rebound excitation – and was also observed in SM-TH (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, right). We seldom observed this pattern for superficial stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, left). Indeed, on average, about three times more cortical neurons respond significantly to deep than to superficial stimulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>).</p>

<title>Global ERPs are associated with widespread evoked cortical activity</title>
<p>Intrigued by the apparent lack of firing in non-stimulated cortical regions, we quantified the evoked magnitude of the LFP, CSD, and spiking in response to superficial and deep stimulation (note that our magnitude metric accounts for both reductions as well as increases and is calculated as the integral of the z-score relative to background; see method “LFP, CSD, and population spiking magnitude”; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-3C</xref>). The magnitude of the LFP near the stimulation site is greater than background activity (54.0 s.d.·s in motor cortex) and decays with distance from the stimulation site (18.0 s.d.·s in visual cortex; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Because the LFP reflects the summation of local presynaptic activity as well as volume conduction from more distant current sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Kajikawa &amp; Schroeder, 2011</xref>), we examined the CSD responses, which minimize the effect of volume conduction and emphasize local current flows. The magnitude of the CSD shows a similar pattern: large in stimulated cortex (51.4 s.d.·s in motor cortex) and smaller at more distant sites (4.8 s.d.·s in visual cortex), though the response is larger than baseline in both (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Yet while we see robust evoked firing of cortical neurons (30.9 s.d.·s in motor cortex) close to the stimulation electrode, changes in firing are often much smaller away from stimulation (1.8 s.d.·s in visual cortex; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>Stimulating superficial layers significantly modulated local LFP, CSD, and cortical spiking with respect to background (N=6; LFP median 19.8 [16.3-24.2 IQR], Wilcoxon signed-rank test corrected for multiple comparisons using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate, p=0.0313; CSD 20.8 [17.5-22.9 IQR], p=0.0313; spiking 1.8 [0.5-5.0 IQR], p=0.0313; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, left bars). It also modulated LFP and CSD in non-stimulated cortical areas (N=8; LFP 7.5 [5.1-9.7 IQR], p=0.0078; CSD 3.9 [2.7-10.0 IQR], p=0.0078), though to a lesser extent compared to the stimulated area. We did not detect evoked spiking outside of the stimulated area for superficial stimulation (-0.2 [-0.5-0.3 IQR], p=0.7422).</p>
<p>When we stimulated deep layers, we again observed large evoked LFP, CSD, and cortical spiking (deep, N=14; LFP 68.5 [55.3-79.2 IQR], Wilcoxon signed-rank test corrected for multiple comparisons using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate, p=1.221E-4; CSD 95.1 [66.9-139.8 IQR], p=1.221E-4; spiking 29.3 [22.4-38.8 IQR], p=1.221E-4; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, right bars). In contrast to superficial stimulation, deep stimulation-evoked responses in non-stimulated cortical regions were significantly greater than background (LFP 34.2 [18.5-51.3 IQR], p=3.052E-5; CSD 14.9 [11.9-33.4 IQR], p=3.052E-5, spiking 4.4 [2.7-10.1 IQR], p=3.052E-5).</p>
<p>Together, these data show that cortical stimulation evoked widespread changes in the LFP and CSD, but only evoked ipsilateral cortical spiking outside of the stimulated area when stimulating deep layers.</p>
<p>To further investigate the evoked neural spiking across both stimulated and non-stimulated areas, we computed the percentage of modulated (significantly increased or decreased spiking relative to the pre-stimulus baseline) RS neurons per subject in three temporal windows following the stimulus: 2-25 ms (initial excitation), 25-150 ms (off period), and 150-300 ms (rebound excitation; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The three temporal windows were chosen to match the stereotyped firing patterns, which align with maximum peaks in the ERPs and the period in between (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2</xref>). We separately analyzed FS neurons and found they behave like RS neurons (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>); therefore, further analyses focus only on RS neurons.</p>
<p>During the initial excitation, the fraction of activated (significantly increased spiking relative to baseline) neurons was always higher in the stimulated cortex than other cortical areas, for both superficial and deep stimulation. The fraction of activated neurons in non-stimulated ipsilateral cortical regions was only marginally above zero (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). Indeed, across all 24 animals, only an average of 0.5% (minimum 0%, maximum 2.6%) of the neurons were modulated in the initial excitation, compared to an average of 17.8% (minimum 0%, maximum 83.3%) in stimulated cortex.</p>
<p>Next, we quantified the fraction of modulated RS neurons in the off period between 25 and 150 ms, capturing the period between the two large ERP amplitude components (present with deep stimulation; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2</xref>). There were very few neurons with increased spiking, regardless of stimulation depth and area (mean 0.4%, minimum 0%, maximum 2.8%; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). In contrast, spiking in 18/22 subjects was significantly reduced from baseline following either superficial or deep stimulation. Interestingly, some non-stimulated areas showed decreased spiking but only in response to deep stimulation (mean 10.1%, minimum 0%, maximum 55.7%).</p>
<p>The final temporal window we considered was the rebound excitation window between 150 and 300 ms, coinciding with the second component in the ERP. All 16 subjects who received deep stimulation showed significant rebound excitation in the stimulated cortex, whereas only 1/6 superficial stimulation subjects did (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Some subjects who received deep stimulation showed significant rebound excitation in the non-stimulated areas (6/16; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), but it was nonexistent amongst the superficial stimulation subjects (0/7; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>To summarize, deep cortical stimulation is more likely to significantly modulate single neurons outside of the stimulated cortical area. This largely consisted of decreases in firing in the 25-150 ms window and mixed increases and decreases in firing during the 150-300 ms window (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>

<title>Cortico-thalamo-cortical interactions underlie features of the ERPs</title>
<p>The striking tri-phasic cortical spiking pattern for deep stimulation is replicated in the associated thalamic nuclei that are connected to the stimulated cortical area (here SM-TH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Harris et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Hooks et al., 2013</xref>; bottom right in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), though shifted in time.

<p>Thalamic response shows bursts of action potentials during the rebound (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>); bursting is a well-known activity mode of thalamic relay cells and is defined as two or more consecutive spikes with an inter-spike interval less than 4 ms preceded by at least 100 ms of silence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Contreras &amp; Steriade, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Grenier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Guido &amp; Weyand, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Halassa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Lu et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Nestvogel &amp; McCormick, 2021</xref>). We quantified the average burst probability (75-300 ms after stimulus onset) and found that deep stimulation had a significantly higher likelihood of evoking bursts (superficial stimulation: median 0 [0-0.02 IQR]; deep stimulation: median 0.12 [0.02-0.2 IQR]; Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, p=0.0258; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>We hypothesized that deep stimulation elicits spiking in cortico-thalamic projection neurons, followed – with some delay due to axonal propagation and synaptic transmission – by thalamic neurons, whereas during the rebound period thalamic bursting precedes cortical rebound spiking (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). Indeed, during the initial excitation, stimulated cortical RS cells had a median first-spike latency of 4.4±0.9 ms, with the thalamic population following at 11.4±2.8 ms (mean latency difference of 6.9 ms; paired t-test, p=4.838E-6; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). During the rebound excitation window, the temporal relationship flipped: the thalamic population had a median rebound spike latency of 148.2±21.2 ms, with cortex following at 184.2±17.3 ms (mean latency difference −36.0 ms; paired t-test, p=2.136E-4; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, the CSD analysis generated results supporting our initial hypothesis. Thalamic bursts powerfully activate cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Borden et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Nestvogel &amp; McCormick, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Ramcharan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Sherman, 1996</xref>) via synaptic activity that can be captured by the inferred CSD. We observed a pronounced current sink near the border of layers 2/3 and 5 in MOs (near the deep stimulation site) that coincided with the timing of the thalamic rebound burst (∼180 ms). This was consistent across subjects (N=9, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p&lt;0.05; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We also analyzed the correlation between the ERP and laminar CSD on a trial-by-trial basis and found that the EEG signals correlated more strongly with CSD of deep compared to superficial layers (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>). To further investigate the relationship between thalamic bursting, cortical spiking, and the ERP, we computed the correlation between these metrics in the rebound window (75-300 ms after stimulus onset) on a trial-by-trial basis for each subject. The fraction of bursting SM-TH neurons was correlated with the cortical population firing rate (8/13 mice with a significant correlation [p&lt;0.05], mean Pearson r value: 0.4±0.04; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). The cortical population firing rate was likewise correlated with the magnitude of the second, late component in the ERP (9/13 mice with a significant correlation [p&lt;0.05], mean Pearson r value: 0.5±0.04; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Additionally, the late component in the ERP was significantly correlated with the fraction of bursting SM-TH neurons (13/13 mice with a significant correlation [p&lt;0.05], mean Pearson r value: 0.5±0.07; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 2A</xref>), much more so than it was correlated with the SM-TH population firing rate (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 2B</xref>). These important observations link micro-scale dynamics (cellular thalamic bursting) with a macro-scale read-out (cortical EEG).</p>

<title>Behavioral states modulate the ERP and the cortico-thalamic interactions</title>
<p>To study differences between the evoked responses across conscious and unconscious states, we performed experiments on mice that were awake and subsequently anesthetized. At the start of an experiment, we delivered up to 120 single electrical pulses while the mouse was awake, free to rest or run on a freely moving wheel. Next, we induced anesthesia with isoflurane via inhalation. Once the mouse reached a stable level of unconsciousness (no reaction to an alcohol swab placed in front of the nose; 4.0±0.3 min after induction onset at 5% isoflurane concentration), we delivered the same set of electrical stimuli.</p>
<p>We separated each trial by behavioral state based on whether the animal was stationary (<italic>quiet wakefulness</italic>) or running (<italic>active wakefulness</italic>, defined here as an average running speed exceeding 0 cm/s in a window from −0.5 to 0.5 s from the stimulation onset). We then compared average responses from 97 (median, [86-104 IQR]) quiet wakefulness, 21 (median, [16-27 IQR]) active wakefulness, and 120 (median, [120-120 IQR]) anesthetized trials across 17 animals.

In both regions, the baseline firing rates (measured during the pre-stimulus epoch) were higher during running and lower during anesthesia compared to quiet wakefulness (stimulated cortex baseline firing rate: N=16, quiet wakefulness 3.5±0.2 Hz, running 5.2±0.5 Hz, anesthetized 1.1±0.2 Hz; one-way repeated measures (RM) ANOVA, state effect: F(2, 30)=66.3, p=2.901E-9, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref> left; SM-TH baseline firing rate: N=13, quiet wakefulness 9.0±1.4 Hz, running 16.4±1.5 Hz, anesthetized 0.8±0.4 Hz; Friedman test, state effect: Q(2)=24.2, p=5.689E-6, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref> right).</p>
<p>The median first spike latencies for cortical and thalamic populations were the same when looking at the initial excitation (N=13; stimulated cortex latency: quiet wakefulness 4.5±0.3 ms, running 4.0±0.2 ms, anesthetized 4.6±0.4 ms; SM-TH latency: quiet wakefulness 11.5±0.8 ms, running 11.3±0.8 ms, anesthetized 10.9±0.6 ms; two-way RM ANOVA, state effect: F(2, 24)=0.3, p=0.6281, region effect: F(1, 12)=89.3, p=6.581E-7, interaction: F(2, 24)=0.5, p=0.5062; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). However, the rebound spike latencies for cortex and thalamus were earlier during running compared to quiet wakefulness (N=13; stimulated cortex latency: quiet wakefulness 186.7±4.6 ms, running 163.8±5.0 ms, anesthetized 200.2±7.5 ms; SM-TH latency: quiet wakefulness 156.0±7.1 ms, running 123.1±3.9 ms, anesthetized 195.1±9.5 ms; two-way RM ANOVA, state effect: F(2, 24)=31.4, p=2.020E-7, region effect: F(1, 12)=17.2, p=1.349E-3, interaction: F(2, 24)=6.6, p=0.053; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). The cortex and thalamus did not exhibit consistently timed rebound excitation during anesthesia, so the relative timing during this state was random and often later than during quiet and active wakefulness. The probability of evoking thalamic bursts decreased during running compared to quiet wakefulness and was very low (zero for many subjects) during anesthesia (N=13; median probability: quiet wakefulness 0.1 [0.01-0.24 IQR], running 0 [0-0.07 IQR], anesthetized 0 [0-0.002 IQR]; Friedman test, state effect: Q(2)=18.6, p=9.142E-5; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, thalamic activity preceded cortical activity during the rebound excitation in both quiet and active wakefulness. However, during quiet wakefulness the rebound is characterized by thalamic burst firing, which correlated with increased cortical spiking and higher ERP magnitudes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Thalamo-cortical interactions affect perturbational complexity in head-fixed mice</title>
<p>The differences of ERPs across behavioral states, reflecting differences in the cortico-cortical and cortico-thalamic interactions as described above, resulted in significant changes in complexity across states (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). To quantify complexity, we used an algorithm that quantifies the number of state transitions for each principal component in the ERP (<bold>PCI<sup>ST</sup></bold>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Comolatti et al., 2019</xref>).

When PCI<sup>ST</sup> is high, signals are both spatially and temporally differentiated. When it is low, signals are highly correlated across space and time or very small relative to the pre-stimulus signal. We found that PCI<sup>ST</sup> was higher during the awake state than during the isoflurane-anesthetized state in all subjects (N=31; awake PCI<sup>ST</sup> 45.5±3.6; anesthetized PCI<sup>ST</sup> 16.5±2.4; paired t-test, p=2.508E-11; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>).</p>

<p>Based on our observation that superficial stimulation evoked simpler responses than deep stimulation (in the awake state), we found that PCI<sup>ST</sup> was, indeed, significantly lower for superficial than for deep stimulation (superficial: N=13, awake PCI<sup>ST</sup> 35.6±4.8; deep: N=18, awake PCI<sup>ST</sup> 52.7±4.4; Student’s two-tailed t-test, p=0.0179; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>).</p>
<p>To compare PCI<sup>ST</sup> during quiet and active wakefulness, and isoflurane anesthesia, we selected subjects that had at least 30 running trials (for this comparison, trial numbers were matched within subject, on average 51 trials) since averaging the ERP over too few trials can affect the PCI<sup>ST</sup> calculation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Comolatti et al. (2019)</xref> showed that PCI<sup>ST</sup> increased as the number of trials increased, specifically in wakefulness because averaging over more trials increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the ERP by reducing the contribution of background, non-stimulus-evoked activity. PCI<sup>ST</sup> was significantly different for all states; the highest complexity ERPs were seen when mice were in quiet wakefulness, slightly lower complexity ERPs during active wakefulness, with the lowest complexity during anesthesia (N=8; quiet PCI<sup>ST</sup> 55.2±10.3, active wakefulness 39.9±7.7; anesthetized 14.0±5.8; one-way RM ANOVA, state effect: F(2, 14)=28.3, p=1.202E-5; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether PCI<sup>ST</sup> recovered to baseline after anesthesia, we repeated the same set of 120 electrical stimuli up to two times over one hour following cessation of the isoflurane in a subset of mice.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We recorded brain-wide, multi-scale, evoked EEG, LFP, and single neuron responses to cortical electrical stimulation in head-fixed mice that are awake and, subsequently, anesthetized with isoflurane. We find that cortico-thalamo-cortical (<bold>CTC</bold>) interactions drive the long-lasting ERPs elicited by deep cortical stimulation during quiet wakefulness. The thalamic rebound response is characterized by thalamic burst firing that temporally coincides and is correlated with the second, late component in the ERP. Furthermore, the CTC interactions are modulated by the behavioral state of the animal, which is mirrored in the ERP.</p>

<title>Electrically evoked spiking pattern depends on the depth of stimulation</title>
<p>Electrical stimulation of superficial layers results in a brief excitation followed by 44.3±16.4 ms of silence in local cortical neurons only (without any detected involvement of the thalamus). This pattern has been seen in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Butovas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Butovas &amp; Schwarz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cavelli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Chung &amp; Ferster, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Contreras &amp; Steriade, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Douglas &amp; Martin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Grenier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Hao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Kara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Logothetis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Sombeck et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Vyazovskiy et al., 2013</xref>) and is reminiscent of the bi-stability (a state characterized by spontaneous alternation between bouts of activity and periods of silence) reported in deep sleep and in unconscious patients following a brief stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Hill &amp; Tononi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Pigorini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Rosanova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Timofeev et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Usami et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Deep electrical stimulation elicits a stereotyped tri-phasic spiking pattern – a brief excitation followed by 127.8±4.1 ms of silence and a <italic>rebound</italic> excitation – in local cortical and thalamic neurons. Other studies also describe rebound excitation at similar latencies following stimulation-evoked quiescent periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Butovas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Butovas &amp; Schwarz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cavelli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Grenier et al., 1998</xref>). This local, cortical down-state may be due to a brief shift in excitatory-inhibitory balance, a large fraction of cortical cells being refractory, and/or a lack of excitatory input from the thalamus. We see similar response profiles in both RS and FS cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2, 4</xref>, and S3).</p>
<p>Given the direct projections from deep pyramidal neurons to thalamic regions (J. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Harris et al., 2019</xref>; K. D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Harris &amp; Shepherd, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Hooks et al., 2013</xref>), it is not surprising that we observe strong recruitment of thalamic neurons 6.7 ms (on average) following the onset of cortical spiking. The thalamic spiking pattern evoked by deep stimulation during quiet wakefulness – brief excitation followed by a period of quiescence (74.6±15.5 ms) and a subsequent burst of action potentials – is consistent with previously described thalamic responses to cortical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Contreras &amp; Steriade, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Grenier et al., 1998</xref>). The fast action potential bursts in thalamic cells following the period of quiescence are likely to be triggered by low-threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, known to follow periods of pronounced hyperpolarization in thalamic relay neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Borden et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Contreras &amp; Steriade, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Grenier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Guido &amp; Weyand, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Halassa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Lu et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Nestvogel &amp; McCormick, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Urbain et al., 2019</xref>). The thalamic silence-burst pattern may be a result of a withdrawal of excitation due to the cortical down-state or disynaptic inhibition via stimulation of thalamic reticular neurons, a primary source of GABAergic input to the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Domich et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Pinault, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Sherman &amp; Guillery, 1996</xref>), both leading to the low-threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike burst. We are currently unable to distinguish between these two possible mechanisms but are planning follow-up experiments to address this important question.</p>
<p>Evoked thalamic bursting consistently preceded cortical rebound spiking by 37.0 ms (on average, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>), comparable to the latency described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Grenier et al. (1998)</xref>. The occurrence of bursts is compatible with these being thalamic relay neurons that excite their cortical targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Sherman, 2001</xref>). Numerous previous studies have shown that thalamic relay neurons exhibit <italic>spontaneous</italic> bursting during anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Contreras &amp; Steriade, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Grenier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Swadlow &amp; Gusev, 2001</xref>), NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Domich et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Halassa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Urbain et al., 2019</xref>), drowsiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Stoelzel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Swadlow &amp; Gusev, 2001</xref>), and wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Nestvogel &amp; McCormick, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Urbain et al., 2015</xref>). In our hands, thalamic relay neurons exhibit <italic>evoked</italic> rebound bursting during quiet wakefulness, but not during running or isoflurane anesthesia. This is consistent with findings showing that thalamic hyperpolarization and low-threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike-bursting coincides with movement offset in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Nestvogel &amp; McCormick, 2021</xref>). Likewise, some anesthetics decrease the probability of thalamic bursts; specifically, isoflurane has been shown to shunt the low-threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes and, therefore, the associated bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Ries &amp; Puil, 1999</xref>; this does not rule out additional cortical effects of isoflurane, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bharioke et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, our finding does not contradict results from other studies reporting evoked thalamic bursting in unconscious states, such as anesthesia via pentobarbital or ketamine/xylazine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Contreras &amp; Steriade, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Grenier et al., 1998</xref>) and NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Urbain et al., 2019</xref>), which are likely to affect thalamic neurons in different ways compared to isoflurane.</p>

<title>Thalamo-cortical dynamics modulate perturbational complexity in mice</title>
<p>The behavioral state of the mouse strongly affects the underlying neural activity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Running and isoflurane anesthesia modulates the excitability of the network in opposing directions. Cortical firing rates during quiet wakefulness, 3.3±0.2 Hz, increase to 5.0±0.5 Hz for active wakefulness and decrease to 1.1±0.2 Hz during anesthesia (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref> left); likewise in SM-TH, where baseline rates increase from 9.4±1.5 Hz during quiet wakefulness to 16.8±1.6 Hz during active wakefulness and drop to 0.8±0.4 Hz during anesthesia (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref> right). Conversely, the median probability of electrically evoked thalamic bursting decreases from its baseline during quiet wakefulness of 9.5% ([10.0-23.7 IQR] to effectively zero for both active wakefulness [0-7.4 IQR] and anesthesia [0-0.2 IQR]). While we cannot conclusively rule out that mice were asleep during the <italic>quiet wakefulness</italic> periods we analyzed, we believe they are likely to be awake because the experiments are performed during the dark phase of the light/dark cycle, when they are less likely to enter a sleep state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Franken et al., 1999</xref>) and the mice do not undergo specific training to promote drowsiness or sleep.</p>
<p>The stimulus-evoked bursts in the thalamus and the resulting thalamo-cortical interaction, that primarily occur when the animal is in quiet wakefulness, result in longer, higher amplitude ERPs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>). This is consistent with previous studies showing that stimulus-evoked bursting in thalamic relay neurons robustly activates cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Borden et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Nestvogel &amp; McCormick, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Ramcharan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Stoelzel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Swadlow &amp; Gusev, 2001</xref>), with a cortical rebound depolarization lasting up to ∼0.5 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Grenier et al., 1998</xref>), and 3-5 Hz cortical oscillation of ∼1 s median duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Nestvogel &amp; McCormick, 2021</xref>). Indeed, the more thalamic cells burst during the rebound period, the larger the magnitude of the second, late component in the ERP (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 2A</xref>). This observed link between the ERP and activity in the CTC loop, an important finding made possible by our unique experimental design, may help interpret the complex physiological and behavioral effects of electrical or magnetic stimulation on the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Borchers et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>ERPs are associated with higher PCI<sup>ST</sup> values during awake than during isoflurane anesthesia (quiet wakefulness PCI<sup>ST</sup> 55.2±10.3; active wakefulness PCI<sup>ST</sup> 39.9±7.7; anesthetized PCI<sup>ST</sup> 14.0±5.8), consistent with prior work in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Comolatti et al., 2019</xref>) and in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arena et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cavelli et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, the ERPs are shorter and the associated PCI<sup>ST</sup> lower during active wakefulness than during quiet wakefulness, possibly due to a lower probability of evoked thalamic bursting. All subjects have higher PCI<sup>ST</sup> during active wakefulness compared to anesthesia (active wakefulness PCI<sup>ST</sup> 39.9±7.7; anesthetized PCI<sup>ST</sup> 14.0±5.8). The comparison of PCI<sup>ST</sup> across quiet wakefulness, active wakefulness, and anesthesia suggests that in mice there is an optimal network state which maximizes complexity, reminiscent of the inverted-U relationship between arousal and task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Yerkes &amp; Dodson, 1908</xref>).</p>
<p>The last decade has witnessed the emergence of the mouse as a model organism to study the neuronal correlates of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aru et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bharioke et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Koch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Larkum, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sachidhanandam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Suzuki &amp; Larkum, 2020</xref>). These studies point to the critical role of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, as well as cortico-cortical feedback to apical dendrites of infragranular pyramidal neurons. Although the present study was not designed with a classical perceived vs. non-perceived paradigm in mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Koch et al., 2016</xref>), our finding of shorter and less complex ERPs and a reduced effectiveness of the CTC circuit during isoflurane anesthesia is certainly compatible with such results. To understand the extent to which our results generalize, it would be important to apply the PCI method to a diversity of different anesthetics in mice (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arena et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bharioke et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cavelli et al., 2022</xref>) and investigate the role of thalamic bursting and CTC activity in relation to large scale EEG dynamics in such states.</p>

<title>Thalamic-mediated local neural responses underlie global ERP in distant cortical regions</title>
<p>Based on the presence of dense intercortical connections between areas (from neurons in layers 2/3-6; J. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Harris et al., 2019</xref>), we expected that cortical stimulation during quiet wakefulness would directly elicit synaptic and spiking activity in other cortical sites outside the stimulated area. We observed large-amplitude evoked activity in the EEG and LFP in ipsilateral cortical regions close (0.5-1 mm) and up to 5 mm away from the stimulated site (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Buzsáki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Kajikawa &amp; Schroeder, 2011</xref>), consistent with complex evoked LFP responses in distal ipsilateral and contralateral cortical sites in response to electrical and optogenetic stimulation in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cavelli et al., 2022</xref>)</p>
<p>Given that the LFP reflects volume conduction and not only local activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Buzsáki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Kajikawa &amp; Schroeder, 2011</xref>), we examined CSD and population spiking of both stimulated and non-stimulated cortical regions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Deep cortical stimulation elicits measurable responses in both CSD and population spiking, whereas we were unable to detect such activations in non-stimulated cortical areas from superficial stimulation. Similarly, Cavelli, Mao et al. (2022) showed that evoked laminar LFP responses were either undetectable or smaller when electrical stimulation was applied to the most superficial layers of the rat cortex compared to deeper layers, reflected by smaller PCI<sup>ST</sup> values. The Neuropixels probes were inserted approximately perpendicular to the cortical surface. Deviation from perpendicular will impact the CSD derivation by effectively increasing the “effective” cortical thickness. This should not significantly affect the location of sources and sinks identified by the analysis.</p>
<p>The effects of electrical microstimulation are thought to be predominantly mediated by activation of axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Gustafsson &amp; Jankowska, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Hao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Histed et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Nowak &amp; Bullier, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Tehovnik et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the stronger evoked responses to deep stimulation could be due to activation of layer 5 and 6 cortico-thalamic cells via direct activation of axons that primarily terminate in thalamic regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), consistent with the literature suggesting that subcortical projecting, myelinated axons are more excitable than non-myelinated horizontal fibers within the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Tehovnik &amp; Slocum, 2013</xref>). Because most of the modulation in non-stimulated cortical regions occurs in the late time windows (25-300 ms after stimulation onset; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), and the CSD analysis shows consistent sources/sinks across subjects only for late times (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), we speculate that involvement of non-stimulated cortical areas is due to bursting in common thalamic projections and underscores the role of the CTC loop in perturbational complexity.</p>

The mouse brain is roughly 0.5 cm<sup>3</sup> and contains 71 million neurons whereas the human brain is closer to 1200 cm<sup>3</sup> with 86 billion neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Herculano-Houzel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">von Bartheld et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Walløe et al., 2014</xref>). The smooth mouse neocortex is 0.8-1 mm thick, with 14 million neurons whereas the highly folded human neocortex is 2.5-3.0 mm thick with 16 billion neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Herculano-Houzel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Walløe et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bakken et al. (2021)</xref> published a comprehensive comparative analysis of cell types across human, marmoset, and mouse cortex. A key difference they highlight is more layer 2/3 intratelencephalic neurons in primates compared to mice, whereas layer 5 extratelencephalic and layer 6 corticothalamic neurons were significantly more common in mice. This is consistent with our findings that show pronounced cortico-thalamic activation and little evidence of wide-spread cortico-cortical activation in mice.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation for the striking difference in the ERPs between the two species is the different biophysical modes of stimulation – direct current flow from and to the inserted electrode versus a magnetic-field induced current flow in the cortical tissue underneath the TMS coil resting against the scalp. Electrical stimulation directly activates axons that run near the stimulation site, which can lead to antidromic activation of cell bodies and/or orthodromic propagation to the axon targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Borchers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Gustafsson &amp; Jankowska, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Histed et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Nowak &amp; Bullier, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Sombeck et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Tehovnik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Tehovnik &amp; Slocum, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Terao &amp; Ugawa, 2002</xref>), whereas TMS elicits indirect waves of cortical activation by exciting axons and neurons mainly trans-synaptically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Pashut et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Siebner et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Terao &amp; Ugawa, 2002</xref>). However, there are also many similarities - stimulation in awake humans evokes a suppression of high frequencies, presumed to be an <italic>off</italic> period, close to the stimulated site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Pigorini et al., 2015</xref>). This is in line with the down-state we observe in mice, which highlights the role of the perturbational technique used for complexity measurements.</p>
<p>Despite these differences, this study led to novel and unexpected results linking the ERP to activity in the CTC loop. There are many additional open questions regarding neural mechanisms underlying spontaneous and stimulus-evoked EEG signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Cohen, 2017</xref>). Rodent models offer a unique opportunity to combine EEG recordings with high-density extracellular recording technology to shine light on the underlying microcircuit dynamics. This study opens the door for future work with rodents using different perturbational techniques (e.g., chemogenetics, optogenetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cavelli et al., 2022</xref>], TMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Senda et al., 2021</xref>]) to causally link the contributions of different cell types, brain regions, and network dynamics to EEG signals and ERP features commonly used in clinical and research settings.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Experimental procedures closely followed those described in Siegle, Jia et al. (2021). A summary of these methods and details of procedures that differ are provided below.</p>
<sec id="s6a">
<title>Mice</title>
<p>Mice were maintained in the Allen Institute animal facility and used in accordance with protocols approved by the Allen Institute’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under protocols 1703 and 2003. All experiments used C57BL/6J wild-type mice (N=37). Male and female wild-type C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (JAX stock #000664) at postnatal day 28 and they were 9-28 weeks old at the time of all <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiological recordings.</p>
<p>After surgery, all mice were single-housed and maintained on a reverse 12-h light cycle in a shared facility with room temperatures between 20 and 22 °C and humidity between 30 and 70%. All experiments were performed during the dark cycle. Mice had ad libitum access to food and water.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6b">
<title>Surgical procedures and habituation</title>
<p>Each mouse went through the following order of procedures prior to the day of the experiment: 1) an initial sterile surgery to implant an EEG array and a titanium headframe for head-fixed electrophysiological experiments <italic>in vivo</italic>; 2) five days of recovery time post-surgery; 3) at least three weeks of habituation to head-fixation; 4) and a second sterile surgery to perform small craniotomies to allow for insertion of the stimulating electrode and Neuropixels probes.</p>
<p>One to three hours prior to each surgery, pre-operative injections of dexamethasone (3-4 mg/kg, IM) and ceftriaxone (100-125 mg/kg, SC) were administered. Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (5% isoflurane induction, 1.5-2.5% maintenance) and placed in a stereotaxic frame. Vital signs were monitored, body temperature was maintained at 37.5 °C with a heating pad under the animal (TC-1000 temperature controller, CWE, Inc.), and ocular lubricant (I Drop, VetPLUS) was applied to maintain hydration of the eyes during anesthesia. Atropine (0.02-0.05 mg/kg, SC) and carprofen (5-10 mg/kg, SC) were administered at the start of the procedure. After the surgical procedure, mice received an injection of lactated Ringer’s solution (up to 1 mL, SC) and recovered on a heating pad. Animals received two days of analgesics and antibiotics post-surgery.</p>
<p>The initial surgery was performed on healthy mice that ranged in age from 5-20 weeks. Mice were deeply anesthetized prior to removing skin and exposing the skull. After leveling the skull, a 30-electrode mouse EEG array (NeuroNexus Technologies, Inc., Ann Arbor, Michigan) was carefully positioned on top of the skull and fixed in place with Kwik-Cast (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, Florida). Skull screws were implanted either over the right olfactory bulb or left and right cerebellum that functioned as reference and ground for the EEG signals. White C&amp;B Metabond (Parkell, Inc., Edgewood, New York) was then used to secure a custom titanium headframe and the EEG array to the skull. After five days of recovery, mice spent at least three weeks being habituated to handling and head-fixation.</p>
<p>Following habituation and up to one day before the recording, mice underwent the second surgical procedure. Under a microscope, the skull was exposed by drilling through the outer layer of Metabond then removing the Kwik-Cast and a small portion of the EEG polymer substrate, carefully avoiding damage to the EEG contacts. Up to three small craniotomies (less than 0.5 mm in diameter) were drilled to allow access to the brain regions of interest for the subsequent experiment. A small piece of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (<bold>ACSF</bold>)-soaked gel-foam sponge was positioned on top of each craniotomy and Kwik-Cast was used to seal it. A 3D-printed plastic well was also fixed to the existing Metabond around the craniotomies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6c">
<title><italic>In-vivo</italic> recording and stimulation</title>
<p>The day of the experiment, the mouse was placed on the running wheel and fixed to the headframe clamp with two set screws. Next, the thin layer of Kwik-Cast was removed to expose the craniotomies and abundant ACSF was added on top of the skull to prevent the exposed brain tissue from drying out. A 3D-printed cone was lowered to prevent the mouse’s tail from contacting the probes and a black curtain was lowered over the front of the rig, placing the mouse in complete darkness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6d">
<title>EEG recording</title>
<p>All 30 EEG electrodes were connected to a 32-channel head-stage (RHD 32ch, Intan Technologies, Los Angeles, California) controlled by an Open Ephys acquisition board (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Siegle et al., 2017</xref>). EEG signals were sampled at 2.5 kHz with a low-frequency cutoff of 0.1 Hz and digitized with 16-bit resolution. Each circular, platinum electrode on the EEG array had a diameter of 500 μm and an impedance of 0.01 MΩ (impedance measured by the manufacturer). All subjects had a skull screw implanted over the right cerebellum (penetrating the skull but not the dura) that served as electrical ground. One of the following served as a common refence electrode for the EEG signals: a 0.7 x 0.7 mm square platinum surface electrode above the left cerebellum, a skull screw implanted over the right olfactory bulb, or a skull screw implanted over the left cerebellum.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6e">
<title>Neuropixels recording</title>
<p>In a subset of mice (N=26/37), simultaneous recordings from the EEG array and multiple Neuropixels probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Jun et al., 2017</xref>) were performed. These experiments used Neuropixels 3a prototypes or standard Neuropixels 1.0 probes configured to record from the 384 electrodes closest to the tip of the probe. The signals from each recording site were split in hardware into a spike band (30 kHz sampling rate, 500 Hz high-pass filter, 500x gain) and an LFP band (2.5 kHz sampling rate, 1,000 Hz low-pass filter, 250x gain) and data was acquired using the Open Ephys GUI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Siegle et al., 2017</xref>). Each probe was either connected to a dedicated FPGA streaming data over Ethernet (Neuropixels 3a) or a PXIe card inside a National Instruments chassis (Neuropixels 1.0).</p>
<p>The reference connection on the Neuropixels probes was permanently soldered to ground using a silver wire, and all recordings were made using either an external reference configuration (Neuropixels 3a) or a tip reference configuration (Neuropixels 1.0). All Neuropixels head-stage grounds, which were contiguous with the probe grounds, were connected in parallel to animal ground – a 32 AWG silver wire (A-M Systems, Sequim, Washington) placed in the ACSF on top of the craniotomies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6f">
<title>Neuropixels insertion</title>
<p>During the acute electrophysiological experiment, up to three Neuropixels probes were inserted targeting motor (MO), anterior cingulate (ACA), somatosensory (SS), visual (VIS), and thalamic nuclei. We restricted our analysis of thalamic nuclei to those that had strong projections to and/or from motor and somatosensory areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; J. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Harris et al., 2019</xref>): anteroventral (AV), central lateral (CL), mediodorsal (MD), posterior (PO), reticular (RT), ventral anterior-lateral (VAL), ventral posterolateral (VPL), ventral posteromedial (VPM), and ventral medial (VM). We refer to these collectively as the somatomotor-related thalamic nuclei (SM-TH), disregarding the distinction between first and higher order thalamic regions.</p>
<p>The probe insertion process followed the steps detailed by Siegle, Jia et al. (2021). Briefly, each probe was individually inserted into the brain using a 3-axis micromanipulator (New Scale Technologies, Victor, New York) at a rate of 200 μm per min to a depth of 3.5 mm or less in the brain. After the probes reached their targets, they were allowed to settle for 10-15 min before starting the experiment. Before insertion, all Neuropixels probes were coated with a fluorescent dye (Vybrant DiI/DiO/DiD, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) by repeatedly immersing them in a well filled with the dye and removing each probe slowly allowing the dye to dry on the surface.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6g">
<title>Behavioral data and synchronization</title>
<p>The angular position of the running wheel and the synchronization signal for the electrical stimulus were acquired by a dedicated computer with a National Instruments card acquiring digital inputs at 100 kHz, which was considered the master clock. A 32-bit digital “barcode” was sent with an Arduino Uno (DEV-11021, SparkFun Electronics, Niwot, Colorado) every 30 s to synchronize all devices with the neural data from the EEG array and the Neuropixels probes. Details regarding the post-hoc data synchronization using the barcodes are described by Siegle, Jia et al. (2021).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6h">
<title>Cortical Stimulation</title>
<p>Electrical stimulation was delivered through a custom bipolar platinum-iridium stereotrode (Microprobes for Life Science, Gaithersburg, Maryland) consisting of two parallel monopolar electrodes (50 kOhm impedance) with a vertical offset of 300 µm between the two tips. During each stage of the experiment, up to 120 biphasic, charge-balanced, cathodic-first current pulses (200 μs per phase, 3.5-4.5 s inter-stimulus interval) were delivered at three different current intensities (360 pulses total). The current intensities were chosen for each animal while it was awake before starting the experiment based on the following criteria: 1) the electrical pulse did not evoke any visible twitches and 2) the medium current elicited visible averaged evoked responses for most of the EEG electrodes (n &gt; 15) defined as 3 standard deviations above baseline for at least 100 ms following the stimulus onset.</p>
<p>The stimulation electrode was acutely inserted using a 3-axis micromanipulator, like the Neuropixels probes. We targeted four locations for stimulation: secondary motor cortex (MOs), layer 2/3 (N=10 mice, 0.37±0.04 mm below the brain surface); MOs, layer 5/6 (N=11 mice, 1.15±0.06 mm below the brain surface); primary somatosensory cortex (SSp), layer 2/3 (N=8 mice, 0.47±0.06 mm below the brain surface); and SSp, layer 5/6 (N=11 mice, 0.92±0.05 mm below the brain surface). Some mice received stimulation in multiple locations (N=10). Before insertion, the stimulation electrode was coated with a fluorescent dye, like the Neuropixels probes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6i">
<title>Experimental timeline</title>
<p>The paired EEG/Neuropixels recordings were acute, lasting 2-3 hours. At the beginning, awake head-fixed mice (free to run on or rest on the running wheel) were exposed to electrical stimuli after 5 min of baseline recording without stimulation. After the awake session, mice were anesthetized via inhaled isoflurane (5% induction) delivered through a small tube placed in front of the mouse’s nose. Once a surgical level of anesthesia was reached, the animal was maintained unconscious by keeping the isoflurane level at 1-1.5%. The unconscious state was verified by lack of reaction to noxious stimuli such as toe or tail pinch and alcohol pad close to the nose of the animal. The EEG signals were also continuously monitored to avoid the burst suppression mode indicative of very deep anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Purdon et al., 2015</xref>). Then the same electrical stimuli session was repeated. While under anesthesia, we recorded the precise concentration of isoflurane delivered over time, in addition to the data streams listed above. Finally, the isoflurane was turned off and the mouse recovered. In a subset of mice (N=16), the electrical stimuli were delivered for a third (and sometimes a fourth) time during the recovery period. The resulting dataset allowed a direct comparison of the evoked neural responses across different brain states (quiet wakefulness, running, anesthetized, recovery).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6j">
<title>Probe removal and cleaning</title>
<p>Upon completion of the experiment, probes were retracted from the brain at a rate of 1 mm/s. The craniotomies were protected with a small piece of ACSF-soaked gel-foam sponge and a thin layer of Kwik-Cast before mice were removed from head fixation and returned to their home cages overnight. The probes and the stimulating electrode were immersed in a well of 1% Tergazyme for around 2-6 h to remove residual tissue, and then rinsed in purified water.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6k">
<title>Quality control for the EEG experiments</title>
<sec id="s6l">
<title>Overall EEG signal quality</title>
<p>Before the experiment, the EEG signals were tested by exposing the animal to visual flashes and evaluating the signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG evoked responses. Animals with low signal-to-noise ratio, high levels of 60 Hz noise, or large movement artifacts were not used for the experiment (8 mice).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6m">
<title>EEG stimulation artifact</title>
<p>If more than half of the EEG channels over the course of the experiment showed large stimulation artifacts lasting for hundreds of milliseconds after the stimulation onset, the session was excluded (8 sessions across 6 mice). In total, out of 37 implanted mice, 23 were included in the study.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s6n">
<title>Ex vivo imaging and localization of electrodes</title>
<p>After the experiment, mice were deeply anesthetized (5% isoflurane) and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were preserved in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 hours, rinsed with 1x PBS, and stored at 4 °C in PBS. The brains were then processed in one of two ways: brains were sliced into 100 µm coronal sections using a vibratome (Leica VT1000S) and imaged with a fluorescent microscope (Olympus VS110/120) at 10x magnification or whole brains were imaged using serial two-photon tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Ragan et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Images of the 100 µm coronal sections were aligned to the Allen Institute Common Coordinate Framework (CCFv3) following the process detailed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">McBride et al. (2022)</xref> and images from serial two-photon tomography were aligned to the CCFv3 following the process detailed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Oh et al. (2014)</xref>. Fluorescent tracks corresponding to the location of the Neuropixels probes and the stimulation electrode were manually identified in the aligned images. Because each CCFv3 coordinate corresponds to a unique brain region, the precision of brain region assignments is determined by the resolution of the CCFv3, which was 25 µm per pixel. For each Neuropixels probe the locations of major structural boundaries along the track was manually aligned with the physiology data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Siegle et al., 2021</xref>). Then each recording channel along the Neuropixels probe (and associated neurons) was assigned to a unique CCFv3 structure. Other studies have reported better than 0.1 mm accuracy for electrode localization following similar methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Liu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>Data processing</title>
<sec id="s6oa">
<title>Stimulus artifact masking</title>
<p>In all recordings we observed short latency voltage transients time-locked to the stimulus. Though the stimulus had a total duration of 0.4 ms, artifacts sometimes lasted up to 2 ms. To mask the artifact, the raw signal from −2 to 0 ms was copied, reversed, and replaced the 0 to 2 ms artifact window. The same masking procedure was used across all electrophysiology data types.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6ob">
<title>EEG</title>
<p>After artifact masking, EEG recordings were visually inspected to identify electrodes containing noise artifacts or remaining large and long stimulation artifacts. These were excluded from further analysis, leaving an average of 23 +/-4 artifact-free electrodes out of 30 for each subject. EEG signals from all good electrodes were re-referenced to the common average across electrodes and bandpass filtered from 0.1 to 100 Hz (Butterworth filter, 3<sup>rd</sup> order). Finally, the continuous EEG signals were segmented into epochs from −2 to +2 s from stimulus onset and saved for further analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6oc">
<title>Neuropixels LFP</title>
<p>After artifact masking, LFP signals were down sampled from 2.5 kHz to 1.25 kHz after applying an anti-aliasing filter. The signals were then high pass filtered (Butterworth filter, 1<sup>st</sup> order) and re-referenced to the median signal from electrodes that were in the ACSF above the brain surface (to remove common signal from the tip reference electrode). Finally, the continuous LFP signals were segmented into epochs from −2 to +2 s from stimulus onset and saved for further analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6od">
<title>Neuropixels CSD</title>
<p>The preprocessed LFP epochs underwent an automatic channel rejection based on Chebyshev’s inequality, iteratively interpolating any channel whose amplitude instantaneously exceeded ±7 standard deviations with respect to the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Russo et al., 2021</xref>). The cleaned LFP voltages where smoothed in the time (window=8 ms) and space domain (1<sup>st</sup> smoothing window=26 channels; 2<sup>nd</sup> smoothing window=4 channels). The CSD was calculated as the second spatial derivative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Mitzdorf, 1985</xref>) from the cleaned, smoothed LFP signals. The CSD formulation employed assumes an ohmic conductive medium, constant extracellular conductivity (σ=0.3 S/m), and homogeneous in-plane neuronal activity, with the boundary condition of zero current outside the sampled area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6oe">
<title>Spike sorting</title>
<p>After applying the artifact masking to the raw spike band data, it was pre-processed and spike-sorted using Kilosort 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>) as described by Siegle, Jia et al. (2021). After spike sorting, any spikes that occurred during the artifact window (0 to +2 ms from stimulus onset) were removed from further analysis. High quality units were identified for further analysis using metrics described by Siegle, Jia et al. (2021). We classified regular spiking (<bold>RS</bold>) and fast spiking (<bold>FS</bold>) neurons (putative pyramidal and inhibitory neurons, respectively) based on their spike waveform duration (RS duration &gt; 4 ms; FS duration ≤ 0.4 ms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Barthó et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bortone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Bruno &amp; Simons, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Niell &amp; Stryker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sirota et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<sec id="s6pa">
<title>EEG event-related potentials (ERPs)</title>
<p>Across each experiment, trials were classified by the behavioral state of the animal: quiet wakefulness, if the mouse’s speed (measured by the wheel’s angular velocity) was equal to 0 cm/s from −0.5 to +0.5 s from the stimulus onset; running, if the mouse’s speed was greater than 0 cm/s; anesthetized, when the mouse was unconscious; and recovery, after the isoflurane delivery was discontinued. ERPs associated with a given state were then compiled by averaging all EEG traces assigned to that state.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6pb">
<title>ERP magnitude and duration</title>
<p>To quantify the ERP metrics, the trial-averaged EEG signals (-2 to +2 s after stimulus onset) were used to calculate the global field power (global mean field power) by taking the standard deviation across all channels for every time point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Cohen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Esser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Lehmann &amp; Skrandies, 1980</xref>). Next, the z-score of the global field power was computed relative to baseline values (-2 to 0 s). The duration of the response was measured as the length of time the global field power (z-score) was greater than three standard deviations above baseline (z=3) in the response window (0 to +2 s). The magnitude of the response was calculated by integrating under the global field power (z-score) but above z=3 in the response window and dividing it by the area under the baseline window (see <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6pc">
<title>LFP, CSD, and population spiking magnitude</title>
<p>To quantify the magnitude of the evoked LFP and CSD response, the spatial average of the rectified, trial averaged signals for all channels in the respective cortical region, all layers except for layer 1. Then the area under the curve was calculated for the post-stimulus period (0 to +0.5 s) of the grand average (z-score of the baseline). A similar procedure was used for the population spiking, except the signals used were single neuron spike density functions. For all data types, the magnitude of the background activity was determined using a permutation test to shuffle the event onset time per trial (n=1000 shuffles), thus creating a distribution of null values representing the area under the curve of the background activity. The response magnitude was then calculated by subtracting the mean of the onset-shuffled values and dividing by the standard deviation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6pd">
<title>Significantly modulated neurons</title>
<p>The fraction of neurons modulated by the electrical stimulation was quantified following the method detailed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">McBride et al. (2022)</xref>. Briefly, for each neuron pre- and post-stimulus spikes were counted on a trial-by-trial basis for the specified windows: 2-25 ms, 25-150 ms, and 150-300 ms. The duration of the window was always matched for pre- and post-stimulus. Then a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed on the trial-wise pre- and post-stimulus spike counts to obtain a p-value. The p-values obtained for all RS neurons in all areas of interest were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction with the false discovery rate set at 0.05. Neurons with an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 were considered significantly modulated. They were labeled as “increased” or “decreased” based on whether their spike count increased or decreased, respectively, in the post-stimulus window relative to the pre-stimulus window on average.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6pe">
<title>Population CSD</title>
<p>To compare CSD across mice, we transformed each CSD trace to a homogeneous space (10 bins per layer) through a non-linear transform. Significantly consistent activations were assessed through a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (threshold p&lt;0.05). Isolated significant bins (i.e., not surrounded by significant bins in both space and time) were removed.</p>

<title>Perturbational Complexity Index, state-transition (PCI<sup>ST</sup>)</title>
<p>PCI<sup>ST</sup> was used to evaluate the spatiotemporal complexity of the EEG ERPs for each brain state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Comolatti et al., 2019</xref>). PCI<sup>ST</sup> was computed using the code available at github.com/renzocom/PCIst and the parameters were set as follows: baseline window = [-0.8, −0.002] s; response window = [0.002, 0.8] s; minimum SNR = 1.6; maximum variance = 99%; and the parameter k = 1.2. In all calculations, the number of trials per state within subject was matched.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed in Python. All data was tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test from the SciPy package (scipy.stats.shapiro). For normally distributed datasets we used the unpaired t-test (scipy.stats.ttest_ind) or the paired t-test (scipy.stats.ttest_rel). For non-parametric datasets we used the Mann-Whitney U test (scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu) or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (scipy.stats.wilcoxon). All comparisons using t-tests are two-sided. Statistical comparisons between multiple groups were performed using both parametric (ANOVA) and non-parametric (Friedman) tests with post hoc, pairwise comparisons corrected for multiple comparisons using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate. Correlational analyses were performed using Pearson correlation coefficients.</p>
<p>In all figures, the convention is * weak evidence to reject null hypothesis (0.05 &gt; p &gt; 0.01), ** strong evidence to reject null hypothesis (0.01 &gt; p &gt; 0.001), *** very strong evidence to reject null hypothesis (0.001 &gt; p). The values in the text indicate the mean and standard error of the mean (mean ± SEM) or the median and IQR [25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles] for normally distributed and non-parametric datasets, respectively.</p>

<p>The authors investigated state-dependent changes in evoked brain activity, using electrical stimulation combined with multisite neural activity across wakefulness and anesthesia. The approach is novel, and the results are compelling. The study benefits from in depth sophisticated analysis of neural signals. The effects of behavioral state on brain responses to stimulation are generally convincing.</p>
<p>It is possible that the authors' use of &quot;an average reference montage that removed signals common to all EEG electrodes&quot; could also remove useful components of the signal, which are common across EEG electrodes, especially during deep anesthesia. For example, it is possible (in fact from my experience I would be surprised if it is not the case) that under isoflurane anesthesia, electrical stimulation induces a generalized slow wave or a burst of activity across the brain. Subtracting the average signal will simply remove that from all channels. This does not only result in signals under anesthesia being affected more by the referencing procedure than during waking, but also will have different effects on different channels, e.g. depending on how strong the response is in a specific channel.</p>

<p>This study reports a novel role of thalamic activity in the late components of a cortical event related potential (ERP). To show this association, the authors used high-density EEG together with multiple deep electrophysiological recordings combined with electrical stimulation of superficial and deep cortical layers. Stimulation of deep layers elicits a late ERP component that is closely related to bursts of thalamic activity during quiet wakefulness. This relationship is quite noticeable when deep layers of the cortex are stimulated, and it does depend on arousal state, being maximal during quiet wakefulness, diminished during active wakefulness, and absent during anesthesia.</p>
<p>The study is very well performed, with a high number of subjects and appropriate methodology. Performing simultaneous recording of EEG and several neuropixels probes together with cortical microstimulation is no small feat considering the size of the mouse head and the fact that mice are freely behaving in many of the experiments. It is also noticeable how the authors use a seemingly outdated technique (electrical microstimulation) to produce compelling and significant research. The conclusions regarding the thalamic contributions to the ERP components are strongly supported by the data.</p>
<p>The spatiotemporal complexity is almost a side point compared to what seems to me the most important point of the paper: showing the contribution of thalamic activity to some components of the cortical ERP. Scalp ERP's have long been regarded as purely cortical phenomena, just like most of EEG, and this study shows convincing evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>The data presented seemingly contradicts the results presented in Histed et al. (2009), who asserts that cortical microstimulation only affects passing fibers near the tip of the electrodes, and results in distant, sparse, and somewhat random neural activation. In this study, it is clear that the maximum effect happens near the electrodes, decays with distance, and it is not sparse at all, suggesting that not only passing fibers are activated but that also neuronal elements might be activated by antidromic propagation from the axonal hillock. This appears to offer proof that microstimulation might be much more effective than it was thought after the publication of Histed 2009, as the uber-successful use of DBS to treat Parkinson disease has also shown.</p>

<p>The following is the authors' response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors investigated state-dependent changes in evoked brain activity, using electrical stimulation combined with multisite neural activity across wakefulness and anesthesia. The approach is novel, and the results are compelling. The study benefits from an in-depth sophisticated analysis of neural signals. The effects of behavioral state on brain responses to stimulation are generally convincing.</p>
<p>It is possible that the authors' use of &quot;an average reference montage that removed signals common to all EEG electrodes&quot; could also remove useful components of the signal, which are common across EEG electrodes, especially during deep anesthesia. For example, it is possible (in fact from my experience I would be surprised if it is not the case) that under isoflurane anesthesia, electrical stimulation induces a generalized slow wave or a burst of activity across the brain. Subtracting the average signal will simply remove that from all channels. This does not only result in signals under anesthesia being affected more by the referencing procedure than during waking but also will have different effects on different channels, e.g. depending on how strong the response is in a specific channel.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments and for raising this point. We do not believe that the average reference montage is obscuring an evoked slow wave in the isoflurane-anesthetized mice. Electrical stimulation did elicit a brief activation in nearby neurons that was followed by roughly 200 ms of quiescence, but no significant changes in firing in the other regions we recorded from (Author response image 1).</p>

<p>We are familiar with the work from Dasilva et al. (2021), a study similar to ours because they also performed cortical electrical stimulation in mice anesthetized with isoflurane. They show widespread evoked multi-unit activity (derived from LFP) in isoflurane-anesthetized mice in response to electrical stimulation, but critical experimental differences may underlie the conflicting results presented in our study. Both works use similar levels of isoflurane to maintain anesthesia (we use a level roughly equivalent to their “deep” level). However, our experiments use only isoflurane, whereas Dasilva et al. induced anesthesia with ketamine and medetomidine followed by isoflurane. It has been shown that isoflurane and ketamine have different effects on neural dynamics (Sorrenti et al., 2021). Typically, isoflurane causes reduced spontaneous firing rates and decreased evoked response amplitudes compared to wakefulness, whereas ketamine has been shown to increase firing rates and evoked response amplitudes (Aasebø et al., 2017; Michelson &amp; Kozai, 2018). Perhaps a more relevant difference are the electrical stimulation parameters used to perturb the brain. Dasilva et al. used 1 ms pulses of 500 μA, which would have a much larger effect than the stimulation used in this work, 0.2 ms pulses of 10-100 μA.</p>
<p>Additionally, we would like to clarify that the average reference montage is not impacting the main findings of this work. As the reviewer correctly pointed out, the average reference montage does change the appearance of the ERP in the butterfly plots (Top panel in Author response image 1). However, all the quantitative analyses of the EEG-ERPs are performed on the global field power, computed by taking the standard deviation across all EEG channels, which is not affected by the average reference montage.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments and thoughtful suggestions. We appreciate and agree with the reviewer’s perspective that the thalamic contribution to the cortical ERP is one of the key points of this study. We also thank the reviewer for their comment on the apparently contradictory results reported by Histed et al. (2009). This gives us the opportunity to further highlight the important contribution of our study to the field.</p>
<p>First, we would like to highlight some key experimental differences between the two studies. In our study we used single pulse stimulation with currents between 10 and 100 μA, whereas Histed et al. used trains of pulses (100 ms in duration at 250 Hz) with lower current intensities (between 2 and 50 μA). We varied the depth of stimulation, targeting superficial and deep cortical layers; Histed et al. exclusively stimulated superficial cortical layers. In addition, the two studies used recording methods that are orthogonal in nature. We used Neuropixels probes that record from neurons that span all cortical layers depth-wise while Histed et al. used two-photon calcium imaging to record from a horizontal plane of neurons (again, in the superficial cortical layers).</p>
<p>Because of these important methodological differences, it is more appropriate to compare the Histed et al. results to our results from superficial stimulation at comparable current intensities. In this case, we believe the two studies show similar results: stimulation activated a small fraction of neurons even hundreds of microns away from the stimulating electrode (see Figure 4A from our manuscript). However, our study adds an important observation pointing to the critical role of the depth of the stimulating electrode. We observe significant excitation of local cortical neurons (Figure 4D) and trans-synaptic activation of the thalamus only when we delivered deep stimulation (Figure5A). This effect is likely mediated by activation of large, myelinated cortico-thalamic fibers, which are thought to be more excitable that non-myelinated horizontal fibers (Tehovnik &amp; Slocum, 2013).</p>
<p>To summarize, Histed et al. (2009) concluded that microstimulation causes a sparse activation of a distributed set of neurons with little evidence of synaptically driven activation. Instead, we showed that microstimulation can robustly activate local neurons and trans-synaptically activate distant neurons when stronger stimuli are directed to deep cortical layers. Based on this, we conclude that electrical stimulation is indeed highly effective, and is a valid tool that can be used to probe and characterize the cortico-thalamo-cortical network of any behavioral state.</p>

<p>1. I am not clear how &quot;putative pyramidal&quot; or RS and &quot;putative inhibitory&quot; fast-spiking neurons were identified. Please provide some further details on that, including average spike wave shapes, and distribution of firing rates, and it would be interesting to know the proportion of &quot;putative&quot; RS and FS neurons in your recorded population. Obviously, caution is warranted here because, without further work, you cannot be sure that those are indeed pyramidal cells or interneurons! Is this subdivision necessary at all?</p>

<p>We added details regarding the cell-type classification to the Results (lines 136-140) and the Methods section. This classification is common practice in cortical extracellular electrophysiology recordings given that cell-type specific analyses can reveal important differences between the two putative populations (Barthó et al., 2004; Bortone et al., 2014; Bruno &amp; Simons, 2002; Jia et al., 2016; Niell &amp; Stryker, 2008; Sirota et al., 2008). Based on our findings that the two populations respond to electrical stimulation in similar ways (excitation followed by a period of quiescence and rebound excitation), we agree the subdivision is not necessary to support our conclusions. However, we believe that some readers will appreciate seeing the two putative populations presented separately.</p>

<p>2. I wonder how the authors know whether the animals were awake, specifically when they were not running. Did you observe animals falling asleep when head-fixed? Providing some analyses of spontaneous EEG/LFP signals in each state could add some reassurance that only wakefulness was included, as intended.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we cannot conclusively rule out that mice were asleep during the “quiet wakefulness” periods we analyzed, we believe they are likely to be awake for two main reasons: 1) all the experiments are performed during the dark phase of the light/dark cycle, when the mice are less likely to enter a sleep state (Franken et al., 1999); 2) the animals are not undergoing specific training to promote drowsiness or sleep. Indeed, many sleep-focused studies in head-fixed mice are performed during the light phase of the animal’s cycle to maximize the likelihood of capturing sleep states (Kobayashi et al., 2023; Turner et al., 2020; Yüzgeç et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2022). We have added this note to the Discussion section (lines 402-406).</p>
<p>Because we do not specifically record during sleep states and our recording does not include electromyography, which is commonly used in conjunction with EEG to classify sleep stages, we cannot accurately perform spectral comparison between “quiet wakefulness” and sleep states in our recordings.</p>

<p>3. I was unsure about the meaning of some of the terminology, specifically &quot;rebound&quot;, &quot;rebound spiking&quot;, &quot;rebound excitation&quot; etc. Why do you call it &quot;rebound&quot;?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>“Rebound” is a term often used to describe a period of enhanced spiking following a period of prolonged silence or inhibition (Guido &amp; Weyand, 1995; Roux et al., 2014). Grenier et al. list “postinhibitory rebound excitation” as an intrinsic property of cortical and thalamic neurons (1998). We added this description to the text (lines 79-80).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Regarding analysis, I would make three main points:</p>
<p>Regarding the CSD analysis, I think the authors have done a good job of circumventing several of the known issues of this technique, especially by using ERPs rather than ongoing activity. However, although I do not immediately have access to the literature to back up this claim, I've heard that many assumptions behind CSD require a laminar structure with electrodes positioned perpendicular to these layers. In Figure 1B it seems like the neuropixels probe is not really perpendicular to the cortical layers, and I wonder if this might be an issue. I am also wondering how to interpret the thalamic CSD, as this structure is not laminar, lacks the mass of neatly stacked neuronal dipoles present in the cortex, and does not have an orderly array of synaptic inputs and outputs. I understand that CSD analysis helps minimize the contributions of volume conduction, but in this case, I also wonder if the thalamic CSD is even necessary to back up the paper's claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>One-dimensional CSD is computed assuming that the electrode is inserted perpendicular to cortex. This is mainly important for the interpretation of sinks and sources, since CSD can be also computed on radial voltages (e.g., EEG [Tenke &amp; Kayser, 2012]). In general, our Neuropixels probes do not significantly deviate from perpendicular (mean deviation from perpendicular 15.3 degrees, minimum 5.2 degrees, and maximum 36.6 degrees). The probe represented in Figure 1B deviates from perpendicular by 31.2 degrees, which is an outlier compared to the rest of the insertions. Any deviation from perpendicular would result in the “effective” cortical thickness being larger by a factor of 1/cos(angle deviation from perpendicular) and thus would not affect the relative location of sources and sinks. We have added a statement to clarify this in the text (lines 126 and 454-456).</p>
<p>We agree with the statement regarding CSD analysis in the thalamus. We originally included the CSD for the thalamus in Figure 2F for completeness. As the reviewer pointed out, thalamic CSD was not used to perform any subsequent analysis and is, therefore, not necessary to back up any claims. As such, we have removed CSD plot from Figure 2F to avoid any confusion and made a comment to this effect in the legend (lines 1175-1177).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>On the merits of using the z-score normalization for spike rates vs. other strategies like standardizing to maximum firing, I am aware that both procedures have limitations, but the z-score changes the range of the firing rate from [0, +Inf] to [-Inf, +Inf]. This does not seem correct considering that negative spiking rates do not exist. The standardization to maximum rate keeps the range within [0, 1], not creating negative rates. Another point that it will be worth discussing is the reported values of the z-scored values. For example, what does it mean to be 54 standard deviations away from the mean? 6 standard deviations is already a big distance from the mean.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For Figure 2, we chose to represent the neural firing rates as z-scores because we found it important to report the magnitude of both the increase and decrease of the evoked firing rates in the post-stimulus period relative to the pre-stimulus rate. The normalization we used helps to visualize the magnitude of the effects of electrical stimulation in neuronal activity for both directions, which is an important result of the study. Despite the differences between the two normalization methods, the normalization based on the maximum firing does not significantly change the qualitative interpretation of Figure 2 in the manuscript (Author response image 2).</p>

<p>Regarding Figure 3 and the associated text, we would like to clarify that the magnitude metric is not simply a z-score value (with units of s.d.) but rather it is the integrated area under the z-scored response over the response window (with units of s.d.∙seconds). This can help explain why we see values of ~50 s.d.∙s. We chose to z-score firing rates, LFP, and CSD to normalize across the different signals and magnitudes of the evoked responses. We often observed the largest responses in the LFP (see Figure 3A), which may be partly due to the signal naturally having a larger dynamic range than the measured neural firing rates. Then we integrated the z-score response time series to capture the dynamic of the signal over the response window, rather than a static value such as the mean or maximum z-score. After performing a thorough literature search, we found no other ways to capture and compare the magnitudes of the different signals. We have added language to clarify the magnitude metric (lines 155-156) and added the appropriate units.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In reporting the p-values, I recommend increasing the number of significant digits to four because the p-value seems to be the same for different tests in several places (e.g.: lines 207 to 218), which seems odd. I also wonder whether this could be an artifact of the z-scoring procedure. In the figures, I would like to advise the use of 1 asterisk to denote &quot;weak evidence to reject the null hypothesis (0.05 &gt; p &gt; 0.01)&quot; and two asterisks to denote &quot;strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis (0.01 &gt; p)&quot;, and make a note of it accordingly in the manuscript and/or figure legends.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have changed the statistics language to “* weak evidence to reject null hypothesis (0.05 &gt; p &gt; 0.01), ** strong evidence to reject null hypothesis (0.01 &gt; p &gt; 0.001), *** very strong evidence to reject null hypothesis (0.001 &gt; p)” throughout the manuscript.</p>
<p>We have also increased the number of significant digits to four throughout the manuscript. It is true that some of the p-values reported for Figure 3 (lines 169-180) are the same for different tests. This is not an artifact of the z-scoring, but rather a consequence of performing the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (an ordinal statistical test) with small sample numbers. Because the p-value depends only on the relative ordering, not the continuous distribution of values, the small sample size (N=6-14) increases the likelihood of obtaining the exact same p-value if the relative ordering of samples is the same.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 202: If the magnitude corresponds to z-score data, please add &quot;s.d.&quot; after the number, as z-scored values are expressed in standard deviation units. Please update this throughout the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As stated above the magnitude metric is the integrated area under the z-scored response over the response window (with units of s.d.∙seconds). We have added the correct units in all places.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 601: It is asserted that &quot;Electrical stimulation directly activates local cells and axons that run near the stimulation site via activation of the axon initial segment&quot; and the paper by Histed et al. 2009 is cited. This does not seem like an appropriate citation, as Histed et al. explicitly state that electrical microstimulation does not activate local neuronal bodies near the electrode tip. See my comment above.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Upon further reading, we believe we are seeing evidence of direct axonal activation and subsequent antidromic activation of local cell bodies, as you suggested in your above comment and has been proposed by many including Histed et al. (2009) and Nowak and Bullier (1998). We edited our sentence accordingly, kept the Histed et al. citation, and added other relevant citations (lines 487-490).</p>
