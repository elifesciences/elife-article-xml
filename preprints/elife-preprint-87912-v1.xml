<title>Abstract</title><p>The abscission of floral organs and emergence of lateral roots in Arabidopsis is regulated by the peptide ligand INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA) and the receptor protein kinases HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-LIKE 2 (HSL2). During these cell separation processes, the plant induces defense-associated genes to protect against pathogen invasion. However, the molecular coordination between abscission and immunity has not been thoroughly explored. Here we show that IDA induces a receptor-dependent release of cytosolic calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and apoplastic production of reactive oxygen species, which are signatures of early defense responses. In addition, we find that IDA promotes late defense responses by the transcriptional upregulation of genes known to be involved in immunity. When comparing the IDA induced early immune responses to known immune responses, such as those elicited by flagellin22 treatment, we observe both similarities and differences. We propose a molecular mechanism by which IDA promotes signatures of an immune response in cells destined for separation to guard them from pathogen attack.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All multicellular organisms require tightly regulated cell-to-cell communication during development and adaptive responses. In addition to hormones, plants use small-secreted peptide ligands to regulate these highly coordinated events of growth, development and responses to abiotic and biotic stress (<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">Matsubayashi, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">Olsson et al., 2018</xref>). In plants, organ separation or abscission, involves cell separation between specialized abscission zone (AZ) cells and enables the removal of unwanted or diseased organs in response to endogenous developmental signals or environmental stimuli. <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Arabidopsis) abscise floral organs (stamen, petals and sepals) after pollination, and this system has been used as a model to study the regulation of cell separation and abscission (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Bleecker &amp; Patterson, 1997</xref>). Precise cell separation also occurs during the emergence of new lateral root (LR) primordia, root cap sloughing, formation of stomata and radicle emergence during germination (<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 2000</xref>). In Arabidopsis, the INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA) peptide mediated signaling system ensures the correct spatial and temporal abscission of sepals, petals, and stamens. The IDA protein shares a conserved C-terminal domain with the other 7 IDA-LIKE (IDL) members (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Butenko et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr">Vie et al., 2015</xref>) which is processed to a functional 12 amino acid hydroxylated peptide (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Butenko et al., 2014</xref>). The abscission process is regulated by the production and release of IDA, which binds the genetically redundant plasma membrane (PM) localized receptor kinases (RKs), HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-LIKE 2 (HSL2). IDA binding to HAE and HSL2 promotes receptor association with members of the co-receptor SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE (SERK) family and further downstream signaling leading to cell separation events. (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">Meng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">Santiago et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr">Stenvik et al., 2008</xref>). A deficiency in the IDA signaling pathway prevents the expression of genes encoding secreted cell wall remodeling and hydrolase enzymes thus hindering floral organs to abscise (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Butenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">Kumpf et al., 2013</xref>; Xiangzong <xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">Meng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">Niederhuth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr">Stenvik et al., 2008</xref>; Isaiah Taylor &amp; John C. Walker, 2018). Interestingly, components of the IDA signaling pathway control different cell separation events during Arabidopsis development. IDA signaling through HAE and HSL2 regulates cell wall remodeling genes in the endodermal, cortical, and epidermal tissues overlaying the LR primordia during LR emergence (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">Kumpf et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, IDL1 signals through HSL2 to regulate cell separation during root cap sloughing (<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Plant cell walls act as physical barriers against pathogenic invaders. The cell-wall processing and remodeling that occurs during abscission leads to exposure of previously protected tissue. This provides an entry point for phytopathogens thereby increasing the need for an effective defense system in these cells (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Agustí et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that AZ cells undergoing cell separation express defense genes and it has been proposed that they function in protecting the AZ from infection after abscission has occurred (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Cai &amp; Lashbrook, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">Niederhuth et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>mIDA</italic> elicits the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> (<italic>N.benthamiana</italic>) leaves transiently expressing the HAE or HSL2 receptor (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Butenko et al., 2014</xref>). As a consequence of defense responses, ROS occurs in the apoplast and is involved in regulating the cell wall structure by producing cross-linking of cell wall components in the form of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) or act as cell wall loosening agents in the form of hydroxyl radical (.OH)radicals (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">Kärkönen &amp; Kuchitsu, 2015</xref>). ROS may also serve as a direct defense response by their highly reactive and toxic properties (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">Kärkönen &amp; Kuchitsu, 2015</xref>). In addition, ROS may act as a secondary signaling molecule enhancing intracellular defense responses as well as contributing to the induction of defense related genes (Reviewed in (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Castro et al., 2021</xref>)). In Arabidopsis, apoplastic ROS is mainly produced by a family of NADPH oxidases located in the plasma membrane known as RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE PROTEINs (RBOHs) (<xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr">Torres &amp; Dangl, 2005</xref>). The production of ROS is often found closely linked to an increase in the concentration of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>), where the interplay between these signaling molecules is observed in immunity across kingdoms (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Kadota et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">Steinhorst &amp; Kudla, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, ROS and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> are known signaling molecules acting downstream of several peptide ligand-receptor pairs. This includes the endogenous PAMPs ELICITOR PEPTIDE(PEP)1, PEP2 and PEP3 which function as elicitors of systemic responses against pathogen attack and herbivory (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Huffaker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">Qi et al., 2010</xref>), as well as the pathogen derived peptide ligands flagellin22 (flg22) and Ef-Tu which bind and activate defense related RKs in the PM of the plant cell (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Felix et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Gómez-Gómez et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">Ranf et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The interplay between ROS and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> has been well studied in the flg22 induced signaling system. The flg22 peptide interacts with the extracellular domain of the FLAGELLIN SENSING2 (FLS2) receptor kinase, which rapidly leads to an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> (<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">Ranf et al., 2011</xref>). In a resting state, the co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1/SERK3) (BAK1) and the cytoplasmic kinase BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE1 (BIK1) form a complex with FLS2. Upon binding of flg22 to the FLS2 receptor, BIK1 is released from the receptor complex and activates intracellular signaling molecules through phosphorylation, among other, the PM localized RBOHD (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">Kadota et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2014</xref>). flg22 induced apoplastic ROS production binds to PM localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels on neighboring cells, activating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the cytosol. The cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> may bind to CALCIUM DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE5 (CDPKs) regulating RBOHD activity through phosphorylation. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent phosphorylation of RBOH enhances ROS production, which in turn leads to a propagation of the ROS/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal through the plant tissue (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Dubiella et al., 2013</xref>)</p>
<p>A rapid increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> is not only observed in peptide-ligand induced signaling. Similar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> changes are observed as responses to developmental signals, such as extracellular auxin and environmental signals such as high salt conditions and drought(reviewed in (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">Kudla et al., 2018</xref>)). Also, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> signals are observed in single cells during pollen tube and root hair growth (<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">Monshausen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">Sanders et al., 1999</xref>). How cells decipher the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> changes into a specific cellular response is still largely unknown, however the cell contains a large toolkit of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor proteins that may affect cellular function through changes in protein phosphorylation and gene expression. Each Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein has specific affinities for Ca<sup>2+</sup> allowing them to respond to different Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations providing a specific cellular response (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Geiger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">Scherzer et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to our previous studies showing IDA induced apoplastic ROS production (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Butenko et al., 2014</xref>), and the known link between ROS and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response observed for other ligands such as flg22 (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Dubiella et al., 2013</xref>), we sought to investigate if IDA induces a release of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>. Here we report that IDA is able to induce an intracellular release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in Arabidopsis root tips as well as in the AZ. Therefore, we aimed to understand how the observed production of ROS and Ca<sup>2+</sup> is involved in the IDA-HAE/HSL2 signaling pathway, either by being a part of the developmental process of abscission or as a part of a suggested involvement of IDA in regulating plant defense (<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">Patharkar et al., 2017</xref>). We show that a range of biotic and abiotic signals can induce <italic>IDA</italic> expression and we demonstrate that the IDA signal modulates responses of plant immune signaling. We propose that, in addition to regulating cell separation, IDA plays a role in enhancing a defense response in tissues undergoing cell separation thus providing the essential need for enhanced defense responses in tissue during the cell separation event.</p>

<title>IDA induces apoplastic production of ROS and elevation in cytosolic calcium-ion concentration</title>
<p>We have previously shown that a 12 amino acids functional IDA peptide, hereby referred to as mIDA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Sup Table 1</xref>), elicits the production of a ROS burst in <italic>N.benthamiana</italic> leaves transiently expressing <italic>HAE</italic> or <italic>HSL2</italic> (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Butenko et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate whether mIDA could elicit a ROS burst in Arabidopsis, a luminol-dependent ROS assay on <italic>hae hsl2</italic> mutant rosette leaves expressing the full length HAE receptor under a constitutive promoter (<italic>35S:HAE-YFP</italic>) was performed. <italic>hae hsl2 35S:HAE-YFP</italic> leaf discs treated with mIDA emitted extracellular ROS, whereas no response was observed in wild-type (WT) leaves most likely due to the absence of <italic>HAE</italic> expression (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig. 1</xref>). Since rapid production of ROS is often linked to an elevation in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> (<xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">Steinhorst &amp; Kudla, 2013</xref>), we aimed to investigate if mIDA could induce a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response. We imaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> in 10 days-old roots expressing the cytosolic localized fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor R-GECO1 (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">Keinath et al., 2015</xref>). As a positive control for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> release we added 1mM extracellular ATP (eATP), which leads to a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> elevation in the root tip within a minute after application (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Breiden et al., 2021</xref>). After application of 1μM mIDA, we detected an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and Movie 1). R-GECO1 fluorescence intensities normalized to background intensities (ΔF/F) were measured from a region of interest (ROI) covering the meristematic and elongation zone of the root and revealed that the response starts 4-5 minutes after application of the mIDA peptide and lasts for 7-8 minutes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The signal initiated in the root meristematic zone from where it spread toward the elongation zone and root tip, a second wave was observed in the meristematic zone continuing with Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes. The signal amplitude was at a maximum within the elongation zone and decreased as the signal spread (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>

<p>The [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response in roots to the bacterial elicitor flg22 has previously been studied using the R-GECO1 sensor (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">Keinath et al., 2015</xref>). To better understand the specificity of the mIDA induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response, we aimed to compare the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in mIDA treated roots to those treated with flg22. We observed striking differences in the onset and distribution of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Analysis of roots treated with 1 μM flg22 showed that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal initiated in the root elongation zone from where it spread toward the meristematic zone as a single wave and that the signal amplitude was at a maximum within the elongation zone and decreased as the signal spread (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, Movie 2). These observations indicate differences in tissue specificity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses between mIDA and flg22, which we hypothesize depend on the cellular distribution of their cognate receptors. Indeed, when investigating the promoter activity of the <italic>HAE</italic>, <italic>HSL2</italic> and <italic>FLS2</italic> receptors by cloning the promoters fused to the nuclear localized YFP-derived fluorophore Venus protein (<italic>pHAE:Venus-H2B</italic>, <italic>pHSL2:Venus-H2B</italic> and <italic>pFLS2:Venus-H2B</italic>) we observed a different pattern of fluorescent nuclei in the roots (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c,d,e</xref>). <italic>pHAE:Venus-H2B</italic> lines had fluorescent expression in the epidermis and stele of the elongation zone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) and <italic>pHSL2:Venus-H2B</italic> lines in the lateral root cap, root tip and root meristem (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>); while fluorescent nuclei were observed in the stele of the elongation zone in <italic>pFLS2:Venus-H2B lines</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). The different patterns of fluorescent nuclei observed for the three different receptor constructs could indeed explain the differences in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures triggered by mIDA and flg22. However, the receptors promoter activity show a broader expression pattern compared to the respective ligand induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> responses, indicating additional regulating factors for the observed [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response.</p>
<p>The flg22 induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response is completely abolished in the <italic>fls2</italic> mutant (<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">Ranf et al., 2011</xref>). To investigate the dependency of the mIDA-induced response on HAE and HSL2, a cytosolic localized Aequorin-based luminescence Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor (Aeq) was introduced into the <italic>hae hsl2</italic> mutant background (<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Knight et al., 1991</xref>). The Aeq sensor was chosen due to the well-established use of this sensor in mutant studies (<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">Ranf et al., 2011</xref>) and due to problems with transgene silencing of the R-GECO1 reporter in <italic>hae hsl2</italic> (not shown). The mIDA triggered increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> was completely abolished in <italic>hae hsl2 Aeq</italic> seedlings compared to WT <italic>Aeq</italic> expressing seedlings, indicating that the response observed is receptors dependent (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig. 2a</xref>). Removing the last Asparagine of the mIDA peptide (IDAΔN69; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Sup Table 1</xref>) renders it inactive (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Butenko et al., 2014</xref>). Seedlings treated with 1 μM IDAΔN69 did not show any increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig. 2a</xref>). To investigate if the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> increase triggered by mIDA was dependent on extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we pre-treated seedling with LaCl<sub>3</sub> and Ethylene glycol-bis (2-aminoethylether)-N, N, N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). LaCl<sub>3</sub> and EGTA are inhibitors that block plasma membrane localized cation channels and chelate Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the extracellular space, respectively (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">Knight et al., 1997</xref>). The mIDA induced response was abolished in <italic>Aeq</italic>-seedlings pre-incubated in 2 mM EGTA or 1 mM LaCL<sub>3</sub> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig. 2b</xref>), indicating that the mIDA dependent [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response depends on Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the extracellular space.</p>
<p>Next we set out to investigate whether mIDA would trigger an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> in floral AZ cells. We utilized the Aeq expressing line and monitored [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> changes in flowers at different developmental stages (see <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig. 3a</xref> for developmental stages [floral positions]) to 1 μM mIDA. Interestingly, only flowers at a the stage where there is an initial weakening of the AZ cell walls showed an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig. 3</xref>). Flowers treated with mIDA prior to cell wall loosening showed no increase in luminescence (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig. 3</xref>), indicating that the mIDA triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in flowers correlates with the onset of the abscission process and the increase in <italic>HAE</italic> and <italic>HSL2</italic> expression at the AZ (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Cai &amp; Lashbrook, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">Patharkar &amp; Walker, 2015</xref>). Using plants expressing the R-GECO1 sensor we performed a detailed investigation of the mIDA induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response in flowers at position 6 which is the position where initial cell wall loosening occurs. The AZ region was analyzed for signal intensity values and revealed that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was composed of one wave (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, Movie 3). The signal initiated close to the nectaries and spread throughout the AZ and further into the floral receptacle. Flowers treated with 1 μM IDAΔN69 did not show any increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> in the AZ or receptacle, while a clear Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave could be detected in the whole AZ, receptacle and proximal pedicel after treatment with eATP (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig.4</xref>, Sup Movie 2). Detailed investigation of <italic>HAE</italic> and <italic>HSL2</italic> promoter activity in flowers at position 6 shows restricted promoter activity to the AZ cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). The observed promoter activity correlates with the observed mIDA induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response.</p>

<title>The ROS producing enzymes, RBOHD and RBOHF, are not involved in the developmental process of abscission</title>
<p>ROS and Ca<sup>2+</sup> are secondary messengers that can play a role in developmental processes involving cell wall remodeling, but are also important players in plant immunity (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">Kärkönen &amp; Kuchitsu, 2015</xref>). We therefore set out to investigate if the IDA induced production of ROS and increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> function in the developmental process of abscission or if these signaling molecules form part of IDA modulated plant immunity.</p>
<p>The IDA induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response depends on Ca<sup>2+</sup> from extracellular space (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig. 2b</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport over the plasma membrane is enabled by a variety of Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable channels, including the CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE GATED CHANNELs (CNGCs). Various CNGCs are known to be involved in peptide ligand signaling in plants, including the involvement of CNGC6 and CNGC9 in CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION40 signaling in roots (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Breiden et al., 2021</xref>), and CNGC17 In phytosulfokine signaling (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">Ladwig et al., 2015</xref>). Using publicly available expression data we identified multiple CNGCs expressed in the AZ of Arabidopsis (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Cai &amp; Lashbrook, 2008</xref>) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig. 5a</xref>) and investigated if plants carrying mutations in the <italic>CNGSs</italic> genes expressed in AZs showed a defect in floral organ abscission. We observed no deficiency in floral abscission in the <italic>cngc</italic> mutants (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig. 5b</xref>), in contrast to what is observed in the <italic>hae hsl2</italic> mutant where all floral organs are retained throughout the inflorescence. Ca<sup>2+</sup> partially activates members of the NOX family of NADPH oxidases (RBOHs), key producers of ROS (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Kadota et al., 2015</xref>). Two members of this family, <italic>RBOHD</italic> and <italic>RBOHF</italic> have high transcriptional levels in the floral AZs (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Cai &amp; Lashbrook, 2008</xref>) and have been reported to be important in the cell separation event during floral abscission in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore set out to investigate if ROS production in AZ cells was dependent on RBOHD and RBOHF and to quantify to which degree these NADPH oxidases were necessary for organ separation. We treated AZs with the ROS indicator, H2DCF-DA, which upon contact with ROS has fluorescent properties, and observed ROS in both WT and to a lower extent in <italic>rbohd rbohdf</italic> flowers. In addition, we observed normal floral abscission in the <italic>rbohd rbohf</italic> double mutant flowers, indicated that neither ROS production in the AZ nor cell separation was dependent on RBOHD and RBOHF (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig. 5c,d</xref>). These results are in stark contrast to what has previously been reported, where cell separation during floral abscission was shown to be dependent on RBOHD and RBOHF (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). We used a stress transducer to quantify the force needed to remove petals, the petal breakstrength (pBS) (<xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr">Stenvik et al., 2008</xref>), from the receptacle of gradually older flowers along the inflorescence of WT and <italic>rbohd rbohf</italic> flowers. Measurements showed a significant lower pBS value for the <italic>rbohd rbohf</italic> mutant compared to WT at the developmental stage where cell loosening normally occurs, indicating premature cell wall loosening (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig. 5e</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>rbohd rbohf</italic> petals abscised one position earlier than WT (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig. 5e</xref>). In conclusion, we found no RBOHD and RBOHF dependency for cell separation during floral abscission (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Crick et al., 2022</xref>). Due to a known function of IDA in inducing ROS production (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Sup fig 1</xref>), these results points towards a role for IDA in modulating additional responses to the process of cell separation.</p>

<title><italic>IDA</italic> is upregulated by biotic and abiotic factors</title>
<p>In Arabidopsis, infection with the pathogen <italic>P.syringae</italic> induces cauline leaf abscission. Interestingly, stress induced cauline leaf abscission was reduced in plants with mutations in components of the IDA-HAE/HSL2 signaling pathway (<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">Patharkar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">Patharkar &amp; Walker, 2016</xref>).

To further investigate the involvement of IDA in stress responses we investigated if <italic>IDA</italic> is upregulated by biotic and abiotic elicitors. Transgenic plants containing the <italic>β-glucuronidase (GUS</italic>) gene under the control of the <italic>IDA</italic> promoter (<italic>pIDA:GUS</italic>) have previously been reported to exhibit <italic>GUS</italic> expression in cells overlaying newly formed LR primordia (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Butenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">Kumpf et al., 2013</xref>). To investigate the expression of the <italic>IDA</italic> gene in response to biotic stress <italic>pIDA:GUS</italic> seedlings were exposed to the bacterial elicitor flg22 and fungal chitin. Compared to the control seedlings, the seedlings exposed to flg22 and chitin showed a significant increase in <italic>GUS</italic> expression in LR primordia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Also, when comparing untreated root tips to those exposed to flg22 and chitin we observed a GUS signal in the primary root of flg22 and chitin treated roots (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). We used the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-glucuronide (4-MUG) which is hydrolysed to the fluorochrome 4-methyl umbelliferone (4-MU) to quantify GUS-activity (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Blazquez, 2007</xref>). A significant increase in fluorescence was observed for flg22 and chitin treated samples compared to untreated controls, (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Exposure of <italic>pIDA:GUS</italic> seedlings to IDAΔN69 did not increase GUS activity in the root, supporting the specific increment of <italic>pIDA:GUS</italic> expression to flg22 peptide (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Spatial <italic>pIDA:GUS</italic> expression was also monitored upon abiotic stress. When <italic>pIDA:GUS</italic> seedling were treated with the osmotic agent mannitol or exposed to salt stress by NaCl, both treatments simulating dry soil, a similar increment in GUS signal was observed surrounding the LR primordia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). However, no <italic>pIDA:GUS</italic> expression was detected in the primary root (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Taken together these results indicate an upregulation of <italic>IDA</italic> in tissue involved in cell separation processes such as the LR primordia and, interestingly, the root cap upon biotic stress. The process of cell separation is a fast and time-restricted response where cells previously protected by outer cell layers are rapidly exposed to the environment. These cells need strong and rapid protection against the environment, and we therefore aimed to investigate if IDA is involved in modulating immune responses in addition to inducing ROS and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> responses.</p>

<title>mIDA triggers expression of defense-associated marker genes associated with innate immunity</title>
<p>A -well-known part of a plants immune response is the enhanced transcription of genes involved in immunity. Transcriptional reprogramming mostly mediated by WRKY transcription factors takes place during microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP)-triggered immunity and is essential to mount an appropriate host defense response (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">Birkenbihl et al., 2017</xref>). We selected well-established defense-associated marker genes: <italic>FLG22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1</italic> (<italic>FRK1</italic>), a specific and early immune-responsive gene activated by multiple MAMPs (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Asai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>MYB51</italic>, a WRKY target gene, previously shown to increase in response to the MAMP flg22 (<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">Frerigmann et al., 2016</xref>) resulting in biosynthesis of the secondary metabolite indolic glucosinolates; and an endogenous danger peptide, ELICITOR PEPTIDE 3 (PEP3) (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Huffaker et al., 2006</xref>). Seven days-old WT seedlings treated with 1µM mIDA were monitored for changes in transcription of the aforementioned genes by RT-qPCR compared to untreated controls at two time points, 1h and 12h after treatment. All genes showed a significant transcriptional elevation 1 h after mIDA treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). This in accordance with previous reports, where the expression of <italic>FRK1</italic> and <italic>PEP3</italic> was monitored in response to bacterial elicitors (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Huffaker et al., 2006</xref>). After 12 h, <italic>FRK1</italic> and <italic>PEP3</italic> transcription in mIDA treated tissue was not significantly different from untreated tissue; while transcription of MYB51 in mIDA treated tissue remained elevated after 12 h but was significantly lower compared to 1 h after mIDA treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Interestingly, the observed increase in transcription of the defense genes <italic>MYB51</italic> and <italic>PEP3</italic>, was only partially reduced in the <italic>hae hsl2</italic> mutant (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig. 6</xref>).

Together, these data show that IDA can trigger a rapid increase in the expression of key genes involved in immunity.</p>
<p>We next investigated if the mIDA induced transcription of defense related genes was similar to that induced by flg22. Seven days-old Col-0 WT seedlings were treated for 1h with mIDA, flg22 or a combination of mIDA and flg22 to explore potential additive effects. The relative increase in transcription of the genes tested is similar when seedlings are treated with mIDA and flg22 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). However, when treating seedlings with both peptides the relative transcription of the genes of interest increased substantially. To our surprise, the combined enhanced transcription when seedling where co-treated with both flg22 and mIDA exceeds a simple additive effect of the two peptides, suggesting that IDA has a role in enhancing the defense response triggered by flg22. Based on these results we propose a role for IDA in enhancing immune responses in tissue undergoing cell separation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several plant species can abscise infected organs to limit colonization of pathogenic microorganisms thereby adding an additional layer of defense to the innate immune system (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">Kissoudis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">Patharkar et al., 2017</xref>). Also, in a developmental context, there is an induction of defense associated genes in AZ cells during cell separation and prior to the formation of the suberized layer that functions as a barrier rendering protection to pathogen attacks (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Cai &amp; Lashbrook, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">Niederhuth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="c67" ref-type="bibr">I. Taylor &amp; J. C. Walker, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the induction of defense genes during floral organ abscission is altered in <italic>hae hsl2</italic> plants (<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">Niederhuth et al., 2013</xref>). It is largely unknown how molecular components regulating cell separation and how the IDA-HAE/HSL2 signaling pathway, contributes to modulation of plant immune responses. Here we show that the mature IDA peptide, mIDA, is involved in activating known defense responses in Arabidopsis, including the production of ROS, the intracellular release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the transcription of genes known to be involved in defense (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). We suggest a role for IDA in ensuring optimal cellular responses in tissue undergoing cell separation, regulating both development and defense.</p>
<p>The intracellular event occurring downstream of IDA is still partially unknown. Here we report the release of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a new signaling component. Roots and AZs expressing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor R-GECO1, showed a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> in response to mIDA. Moreover, the increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> in response to mIDA in flowers occurred only at stages where cell separation was taking place, linking the observed [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response to the temporal point of abscission and the need for an induced local defense response. During floral development the expression of the <italic>HAE</italic> and <italic>HSL2</italic> receptors increase prior to the onset of abscission (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Cai &amp; Lashbrook, 2008</xref>) and may account for the temporal mIDA induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response observed.</p>
<p>Based on these results, it is likely that the expression of the receptors is the limiting factor for a cell’s ability to respond to the mIDA peptide with a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response. However, promoter activity of the receptors are observed in a broader area of the root than the observed [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response. As an example, <italic>pHSL2</italic> is found to have a localized activation in the root tip, and when HSL2 is activated by IDL1 be involved in regulation cell separation during root cap sloughing (<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2018</xref>). IDL1 and IDA have a high degree of similarity in the protein sequence, and <italic>IDL1</italic> expressed under the <italic>IDA</italic> promoter can fully rescue the abscission phenotype observed in the <italic>ida</italic> mutant (<xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr">Stenvik et al., 2008</xref>). We can assume that IDL1 activates similar signaling components in the root cap as those used by IDA. Despite the expression of HSL2 and the involvement of the receptor in root cap sloughing, no [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response is observed in this region when plants are treated with the IDA peptide. The absence of an observed [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response in the root tip indicates that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> is most likely not involved in the cell separation process during root cap sloughing, or that cells involved in this process only are able to induce a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response at a specific developmental time point. Thus, in addition to receptor availability, other factors must be involved in regulating the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response. It is intriguing that the mIDA cellular output is similar to that of flg22 (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Kadota et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">Kadota et al., 2014</xref>) yet shows some distinct differences. The spatial distribution of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave originated by mIDA differs from that of flg22. The <italic>rbohd rbohf</italic> mutant shows ROS production in the AZ, indicating that other NADPH oxidases or cell wall peroxidases expressed in the AZ may be involved in ROS production, in contrast to the importance of RBOHD RBOHF in flg22 signaling (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Kadota et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that while IDA and flg22 share many components for their signal transduction, such as the BAK1 co-receptor (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Chinchilla et al., 2007</xref>; X. <xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">Meng et al., 2016</xref>) and MAPK cascade (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Asai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2008</xref>), there are other specific components that are likely important to provide differences in signaling. The difference in callose deposition observed in mIDA and flg22 cotyledons supports this.</p>
<p>Interestingly, FLS2 arrangement into nanoscale domains at the PM is dependent on FERONIA (FER). FLS2 becomes more disperse and mobile in <italic>fer</italic> mutants, implying a role for FER in regulating FLS2 activity (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Gronnier et al., 2022</xref>). Also altering of the cell wall affects FLS2 nanoscale organization (<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">McKenna et al., 2019</xref>). Formation of nanoscale domains containing the HAE and HSL2 receptors may be an important signaling step in the IDA-HAE/HSL2 signaling pathway. An intriguing thought is a possible co-localization of HAE and HSL2 with FLS2 in nanoscale domains, making a signaling unit possible to involve multiple different receptors responsible for the signaling outcome observed. In this paper, we show that co-treatment with mIDA and flg22 induces an enhanced transcription of defense related genes. How FLS2, HAE and HSL2 communicate at the plasma membrane of the responsive cells may give the answers to the molecular mechanisms behind the augmented transcriptional regulation observed when co-treatment of IDA and flg22 is performed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). We can investigate possible interaction partners of HAE and HSL2 looking at available data from a sensitized high-throughput interaction assay between extracellular domains (ECDs) of 200 Leucine Rich Repeat (LRR) (<xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">Smakowska-Luzan et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, LRR-RLKs known to play a function in biotic or abiotic stress responses, such as RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE7 (RLK7), STRUBBELIG-RECEPTOR FAMILY3 , RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN KINASE 1 and FRK1, are found to interact mainly with HSL2, whereas HAE shows interaction with LRRs mainly involved in development (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Sup Fig. 8</xref>). RLK7 has recently been identified as an additional receptor for CEP4, involved in regulating cell surface immunity and response to nitrogen starvation, indication a role of RLK7 as an additional receptor regulating defense responses in known peptide-receptor complexes (<xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">Rzemieniewski et al., 2022</xref>). It would be interesting to investigate a possible role of RLK7 in IDA-HAE/HSL2 signaling as a possible signaling partner in the observed IDA-induced early defense responses.</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a model where the IDA-HAE/HSL2 signaling pathway modulates defense responses in tissues undergoing cell separation. It is beneficial for the plant to ensure an upregulation of defense responses in tissues undergoing cell separation as a precaution against pathogen attack. This tissue is a major entry route for pathogens, and by combining the need of both the IDA peptide and the pathogen molecular pattern, such as flg22, for the induction of a strong defense response, the plant ensures maximum immunity in the most prone cells without spending energy inducing this in all cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Such a molecular mechanism, where the presence of mIDA in tissue exposed to stress leads to maximum activation of the immune responses, will ensure maximal protection of infected cells during cell separation, cells which are major potential entry routes for invading pathogens.</p>

Seedling mounting was performed as described in (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">Krebs &amp; Schumacher, 2013</xref>). The plant tissues were incubated overnight in half strength MS, 21°C and continuous light conditions before the day of imaging. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> in the abscission zone were detected using WT plants expressing R-GECO1 (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">Keinath et al., 2015</xref>). Abscission zones of position 7 were used. Mounting of the abscission zones were performed using the same device as for seedlings (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">Krebs &amp; Schumacher, 2013</xref>). The abscission zones were incubated in half strength MS medium for 1 h before imaging. Measurements were performed with a Zeiss LSM880 Airyscan using a Plan-Apochromat 10× air NA 0.30 objective. Images were recorded with a frame rate of 10 seconds. R-GECO1 was excited with a white light laser at 561 nm and its emission was detected at 590 nm to 670 nm using a HyD detector. Laser power and gain settings were chosen for each experiment to maintain comparable intensity values. For mIDA and flg22 two-fold concentrations were prepared in half strength MS. mIDA or flg22 were added in a 1:1 volume ratio to the imaging chamber (final concentration 1 µM). ATP was prepared in a 100-fold concentration in half strength MS and added as a last treatment in a 1:100 volume ratio (final concentration 1 mM) to the imaging chamber as a positive control for activity of the R-GECO1 sensor (Movie 3).

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study provides insights into the IDA peptide with dual functions in development and immunity. The approach used is <bold>solid</bold> and helps to define the role of IDA in a two-step process, cell separation followed by activation of innate defenses. The main limitation of the study is the lack of direct evidence linking signaling by IDA and its HAE receptors to immunity. As such the work remains descriptive but it will nevertheless be of interest to a wide range of plant cell biologists.</p>

<p>The paper titled 'A dual function of the IDA peptide in regulating cell separation and modulating plant immunity at the molecular level' by Olsson Lalun et al., 2023 aims to understand how IDA-HAE/HSL2 signalling modulates immunity, a pathway that has previously been implicated in development. This is a timely question to address as conflicting reports exist within the field. IDL6/7 have previously been shown to negatively regulate immune signalling, disease resistance and stress responses in leaf tissue, however IDA has been shown to positively regulate immunity through the shedding of infected tissues. Moreover, recently the related receptor NUT/HSL3 has been shown to positively regulate immune signalling and disease resistance. This work has the potential to bring clarity to this field, however the manuscript requires some additional work to address these questions. This is especially the case as it contracts some previous work with IDL peptides which are perceived by the same receptor complexes.</p>
<p>Can IDA induce pathogen resistance? Does the infiltration of IDA into leaf tissue enhance or reduce pathogen growth? Previously it has been shown that IDL6 makes plants more susceptible. Is this also true for IDA? Currently cytoplasmic calcium influx and apoplastic ROS as overinterpreted as immune responses - these can also be induced by many developmental cue e.g. CLE40 induced calcium transients. Whilst gene expression is more specific is also true that treatment with synthetic peptides, which are recognised by LRR-RKs, can induce immune gene expression, especially in the short term, even when that is not there in vivo function e.g. doi.org/10.15252/embj.2019103894.</p>
<p>This paper shows that receptors other than hae/hsl2 are genetically required to induce defense gene expression, it would have been interesting to see what phenotype would be associated with higher order mutants of closely related haesa/haesa-like receptors. Indeed recently HSL1 has been shown to function as a receptor for IDA/IDL peptides. Could the triple mutant suppress all response? Could the different receptors have distinct outputs? For example for FRK1 gene expression the hae hsl2 mutant has an enhanced response. Could defence gene expression be primarily mediated by HSL1 with subfunctionalisation within this clade?</p>
<p>One striking finding of the study is the strong additive interaction between IDA and flg22 treatment on gene expression. Do the authors also see this for co-treatment of different peptides with flg22, or is this unique function of IDA? Is this receptor dependent (HAE/HSL1/HSL2)?</p>
<p>It is interesting how tissue specific calcium responses are in response to IDA and flg22, suggesting the cellular distribution of their cognate receptors. However, one striking observation made by the authors as well, is that the expression of promoter seems to be broader than the calcium response. Indicating that additional factors are required for the observed calcium response. Could diffusion of the peptide be a contributing factor, or are only some cells competent to induce a calcium response?</p>
<p>
It is interesting that the authors look for floral abscission phenotypes in cngc and rbohd/f mutants to conclude for genetic requirement of these in floral abscission. Do the authors have a hypothesis for why they failed to see a phenotype for the rbohd/f mutant as was published previously? Do you think there might be additional players redundantly mediating these processes?</p>
<p>Can you observe callose deposition in the cotyledons of the 35S::HAE line? Are the receptors expressed in native cotyledons? This is the only phenotype tested in the cotyledons.</p>
<p>Are flg22-induced calcium responses affected in hae hsl2?</p>

<p>Lalun and co-authors investigate the signalling outputs triggered by the perception of IDA, a plant peptide regulating organs abscission. The authors observed that IDA perception leads to a transient influx of Ca2+, to the production of reactive oxygen species in the apoplast, and to an increase accumulation of transcripts which are also responsive to an immunogenic epitope of bacterial flagellin, flg22. The authors show that IDA is transcriptionally upregulated in response to several biotic and abiotic stimuli. Finally, based on the similarities in the molecular responses triggered by IDA and elicitors (such as flg22) the authors proposed that IDA has a dual function in modulating abscission and immunity. The manuscript is rather descriptive and provide little information regarding IDA signalling per se. A potential functional link between IDA signalling and immune signalling remains speculative.</p>

<p>Previously, it has been shown the essential role of IDA peptide and HAESA receptor families in driving various cell separation processes such as abscission of flowers as a natural developmental process, of leaves as a defense mechanism when plants are under pathogenic attack or at the lateral root emergence and root tip cell sloughing. In this work, Olsson et al. show for the first time the possible role of IDA peptide in triggering plant innate immunity after the cell separation process occurred. Such an event has been previously proposed to take place in order to seal open remaining tissue after cell separation to avoid creating an entry point for opportunistic pathogens. The elegant experiments in this work demonstrate that IDA peptide is triggering the defense-associated marker genes together with immune specific responses including release of ROS and intracellular CA2+. Thus, the work highlights an intriguing direct link between endogenous cell wall remodeling and plant immunity. Moreover, the upregulation of IDA in response to abiotic and especially biotic stimuli are providing a valuable indication for potential involvement of HAE/IDA signalling in other processes than plant development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The various methods and different approaches chosen by the authors consolidates the additional new role for a hormone-peptide such as IDA. The involvement of IDA in triggering of the immunity complex process represents a further step in understanding what happens after cell separation occurs. The Ca2+ and ROS imaging and measurements together with using the haehsl2 and haehsl2 p35S::HAE-YFP genotypes provide a robust quantification of defense responses activation. While Ca2+ and ROS can be detected after applying the IDA treatment after the occurrence of cell separation it is adequately shown that the enzymes responsible for ROS production, RBOHD and RBOHF, are not implicated in the floral abscission.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, IDA production is triggered by biotic and abiotic factors such as flg22, a bacterial elicitor, fungi, mannitol or salt, while the mature IDA is activating the production of FRK1, MYB51 and PEP3, genes known for being part of plant defense process.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Even though there is shown a clear involvement of IDA in activating the after-cell separation immune system, the use of p35S:HAE-YFP line represent a weak point in the scientific demonstration. The mentioned line is driving the HAE receptor by a constitutive promoter, capable of loading the plant with HAE protein without discriminating on a specific tissue. Since it is known that IDA family consist of more members distributed in various tissues, it is very difficult to fully differentiate the effects of HAE present ubiquitously.</p>
<p>
The co-localization of HAE/HSL2 and FLS2 receptors is a valuable point to address since in the present work, the marker lines presented do not get activated in the same cell types of the root tissues which renders the idea of nanodomains co-localization (as hypothetically written in the discussion) rather unlikely.</p>
