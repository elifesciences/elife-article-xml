<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Biomineralization had apparently evolved independently in different phyla, using distinct minerals, organic scaffolds and gene regulatory networks (GRNs). However, diverse eukaryotes from unicellular organisms, through echinoderms to vertebrates, use the actomyosin network during biomineralization. Specifically, the actomyosin remodeling protein, Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) regulates cell differentiation and gene expression in vertebrates’ biomineralizing cells, yet, little is known on ROCK’s role in invertebrates’ biomineralization. Here we reveal that ROCK controls the formation, growth and morphology of the calcite spicules in the sea urchin larva. ROCK expression is elevated in the sea urchin skeletogenic cells downstream of the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) signaling. ROCK inhibition leads to skeletal loss and disrupts skeletogenic gene expression. ROCK inhibition after spicule formation reduces spicule elongation rate and induces ectopic spicule branching. Similar skeletogenic phenotypes are observed when ROCK is inhibited in a skeletogenic cell culture, indicating that these phenotypes are due to ROCK activity specifically in the skeletogenic cells. Reduced skeletal growth and enhanced branching are also observed under direct perturbations of the actomyosin network. We propose that ROCK and the actomyosin machinery were employed independently, downstream of distinct GRNs, to regulate biomineral growth and morphology in Eukaryotes.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>1.We measured the effect of ROCK MASOs on the ROCK expression by immunostaining and observed a reduction in ROCK signal, supporting the downregulation of ROCK protein level under ROCK MASOs (new Fig. S3).
2.We measured the effect of lower concertation of ROCK inhibitor, Y27632 (10uM), and observe the same phenotypes of skeletal loss, skeletal reduction and ectopic branching in this concentration (Fig. 2, S4). Importantly, these phenotypes were not observed when directly inhibiting PKA and PKC, in whole sea urchin embryos (1) and in skeletogenic cell cultures (2), further supporting the specificity of ROCK inhibitor.
3.We added a time course of Pl-ROCK expression and immunostaining of ROCK in the fertilized egg, that show that this gene is maternal and the protein is present in the egg Fig. 2SA-C.
4.We recorded F-actin in ROCK MASOs and demonstrate that it is still detected around the spicules and their tips, similarly to ROCK inhibited embryos (new Fig.S3).

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Biomineralization is the process in which organisms from the five kingdoms of life, use minerals to produce shells, skeletons and teeth that protect and support them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Recent studies suggest that biomineralization evolved by the phylum specific co-option of ancestral gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that drove the construction of distinct organic scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) and by the evolution of specialized sets of biomineralization proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). This explanation is in line with the dissimilar GRNs and biomineralization proteins that drive biomineralization in different phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Yet, there are common cellular processes required for mineralization in highly diverse phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), suggesting that distinct upstream GRNs might have recruited common cellular and molecular mechanisms to drive biomineralization.</p>
<p>The actomyosin network was shown to play a role in biomineralization in various Eukaryote models, from unicellular organisms to vertebrates’ bones and teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). There is a tight association between actin filaments and the biomineralization compartment in diatoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) and a highly dynamic actin organization that forms the biomineralization compartment in foraminifera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Perturbations of actin polymerization result with severely deformed shells and inhibition of shell shedding in coccolithophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) and diatoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). In vertebrates, Rho GTPases and Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK), regulate chondrocytes, osteoblasts and odontoblasts differentiation and affect genes expression in these biomineralizing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). However, the roles of actomyosin remodeling in controlling mineral deposition and shaping biomineral morphology, are still unclear.</p>
<p>Sea urchin larval skeletogenesis provides an attractive model to study the role of the actomyosin network in biomineralization. Sea urchin larval skeletons are made of two frameworks of interconnected calcite rods, termed “spicules” that are generated by the skeletogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). To make the spicules, the skeletogenic cells form a ring with two lateral skeletogenic clusters and fuse through their filopodia forming a pseudopodia cable that links them into a syncytium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). The mineral is concentrated in the form of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) inside intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). The vesicles are secreted into the biomineralization compartment generated in the skeletogenic cell clusters forming two triradiate spicules (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>)). The tubular biomineralization compartment, also called the spicule cavity, elongates within the pseudopodia cable by localized mineral deposition at the tip of each rod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>).</p>
<p>The GRN that controls sea urchin skeletogenesis is known in great detail and is highly similar to the GRN that controls vertebrates’ vascularization, suggesting a common evolutionary origin of these two tubulogenesis programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). As the spicules elongate, the expression of key regulatory and biomineralization related genes becomes restricted to the skeletogenic cells proximal to the growing tips, possibly to promote mineral deposition at these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Localized gene expression is regulated by signaling cues such as the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). However, how the skeletogenic GRN drives spicule formation and localized mineral deposition at the tips of the rods is poorly understood.</p>
<p>Previous works suggest that the actomyosin network is essential for sea urchin skeletal growth. Calcium bearing vesicles perform an active diffusion motion in the skeletogenic cells with a diffusion length that inversely correlates with the strength and activity of the actomyosin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Actin filaments are formed around the spicule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) and F-actin signal is enriched at the tips of the growing skeletal rods in skeletogenic cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Genetic and pharmacological perturbations of the GTPase, CDC42, prevent the formation of filopodia in the skeletogenic cells and inhibit spicule formation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Pharmacological perturbations of ROCK prevent spicule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) and genetic perturbations of Rhogap24l/2 result with ectopic spicule splitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Despite these characterizations, little is known on the role of the actomyosin machinery in regulating sea urchin biomineral growth and morphology.</p>
<p>Here we study the role of ROCK and the actomyosin network in the sea urchin <italic>Paracentraorus lividus (P. lividus)</italic>. Our findings reveal the critical role of ROCK and the actomyosin network in multiple aspects of sea urchin biomineralization, suggesting a common use of these factors in Eukaryote biomineralization, downstream of distinct GRNs.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>ROCK is enriched in the skeletogenic cells depending on VEGF signaling</title>
<p>We sought to study the spatial expression of the ROCK protein and its regulation by VEGF signaling, a prominent regulator of sea urchin skeletogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). The sequence of ROCK and especially, its functional domains are highly conserved between human and sea urchin (Fig. S1, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>)). According to RNA-seq data measured in <italic>P. lividus</italic>, ROCK is a maternal gene that degrades after the maternal to zygotic transition and picks up again after hatching (&gt;14 hours post fertilization (hpf), Fig. S2A). We used a commercial antibody that recognizes human ROCK protein to test ROCK expression in <italic>P. lividus</italic> embryos. We first used western blot to detect ROCK expression in control and under VEGFR inhibition at the time of spicule formation and during skeletal elongation (Axitinib treatment, ∼22hpf, 27hpf and 33hpf, Fig. S2D). The antibody detected a ∼150kDa protein (Fig. S2D) that is the predicted size for <italic>P. lividus</italic> ROCK protein (153kDa). VEGFR inhibition marginally increased the overall level of ROCK at 22hpf, but did not affect it at 27hpf and 33hpf (Fig. S2E). Yet, this measurement was done on proteins extracted from whole embryos, and we wanted to study the spatial expression of ROCK and specifically, its regulation in the skeletogenic cells.</p>
<p>We studied the spatial distribution of ROCK protein using ROCK antibody and the skeletal cell marker, 6a9, that marks the skeletogenic syncytium membrane, in control and under VEGFR inhibition ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We quantified ROCK signal in the skeletogenic cells compared to the neighboring ectodermal cells in both conditions, at the three time points mentioned above. In the three time points, under VEGFR inhibition, the skeletogenic cells do not migrate to their proper positions in the anterlateral and post-oral chains, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). At 22hpf, ROCK expression in the skeletogenic cells is mildly enriched compared to the neighboring ectodermal cells and this enrichment is not observed under VEGFR inhibition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-F</xref>). At 27hpf, ROCK enrichment in the skeletogenic cells increases, but similar enrichment is observed under VEGFR inhibition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G-L</xref>). At 33hpf, ROCK enrichment in the skeletogenic cells is most apparent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1M-O</xref>) and depends on VEGF signaling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1P-S</xref>). At both 27hpf and 33hpf in control embryos, ROCK seems localized near the skeletogenic cell membranes, which further supports its activation in these cells, since ROCK activation leads to its localization to the cell membranes in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Overall, this data demonstrate that ROCK expression is elevated in the skeletogenic cells and this enrichment strengthens with skeletal elongation and depends on VEGF signaling.</p>

<title>ROCK activity in the skeletogenic cells controls spicule initiation, growth and morphology</title>
<p>Next, we studied the role of ROCK in sea urchin skeletogenesis using genetic perturbations. We downregulated the expression of ROCK by the injection of two different translation morpholino anti-sense oligonucleotides (MASOs). ROCK MASO-1 matches the start of translation region, ROCK MASO-2 matches the 5’ region upstream the start of translation, and random MASO was used as a control. Embryos injected with either ROCK MASO-1 or MASO-2 show reduced ROCK signal at 33hpf, supporting the downregulation of the ROCK protein using these MASO’s (Fig. S3B, F, J, N, R, V). Embryos injected with ROCK MASO-1 or MASO-2 show strongly reduced skeletons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>) and embryos injected with ROCK MASO-2 show an additional phenotype of severely branched skeleton (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The additional branching phenotype and the larger percentage of affected embryos in ROCK MASO-2 are probably due to its higher efficiency resulting from its more 5’ location relative to translation start codon (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Thus, the genetic perturbations of ROCK expression indicate that sea urchin ROCK is important for skeletal elongation and normal branching pattern.</p>

</fig>
<p>To elucidate the dependence of ROCK phenotypes on ROCK activity level and identify its effect on different stages of skeletogenesis, we tested the skeletogenic phenotypes of different concentrations of ROCK inhibitor, Y27632, applied at different time points (Fig. S4A). Y27632 binds to the ATP site of ROCK’s kinase domain and prevents its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Y27632 affinity to ROCK is 100 times higher than its affinity to other kinases, such as PKA and PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). The amino-acids to which Y27632 binds, are conserved in the sea urchin ROCK protein, supporting its specific inhibition of this protein (Fig. S1C). Y27632 had been used in cell cultures and live embryos from vertebrates to <italic>Drosophila,</italic> in concentrations between 10-100µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). In the sea urchin embryo a concertation of 75µM of Y27632 was reported to completely block skeleton formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) and a concentration of 100µM was shown to delay gut invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Therefore, we tested the range of 10-80µM Y27632 applied before or after spicule initiation (Fig. S4A).</p>
<p>Continuous ROCK inhibition beginning at egg fertilization, resulted with significant skeletogenic phenotypes that are dose dependent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, Fig. S4). Continuous ROCK inhibition using 80µM Y27632, did not affect skeletogenic cell migration but eliminated skeletal formation at 27hpf (Fig. S4B, C). At two days post fertilization (dpf), complete skeletal loss is detected under continuous ROCK inhibition in all concentrations, ranging from 15% of the embryos exposed to 10µM to 67% of the embryos exposed to 80µM Y27632 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G, K, in</xref> agreement with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>)). The rest of the embryos exposed to continuous ROCK inhibition show either spicule initiations or small spicules with enhanced ectopic branching, with percentage depending on Y27632 concertation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref>, S4K). Except from the skeletogenic phenotypes, the overall embryonic development of embryos exposed to Y27632 in all concentrations seems normal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G, J</xref>). Similar results are observed when adding the inhibitor at 20hpf, with distribution of phenotypes that depends on the concentration (Fig. S4I, K). Importantly, skeletal loss, spicule initiation and ectopic branching were not observed under PKC or PKA inhibition, that resulted with much milder skeletogenic phenotypes (PKC) or no skeletogenic phenotype (PKA, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>)), supporting the selective inhibition of ROCK by Y27632. Altogether, continuous ROCK inhibition results with severe skeletogenic phenotype ranging from complete skeletal loss to small spicule with ectopic branching, with ratios that depend on the inhibitor concentration.</p>
<p>The addition of the inhibitor at 25hpf, after spicule initiation, results in a majority of embryos showing ectopic spicule branching (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H-K</xref>, S4F-H, K). The reduction of skeletal growth rate and ectopic branching can be observed a few hours after the addition of ROCK inhibitor (Fig. S5, 30µM). Washing the inhibitor at the highest concertation after 25hpf results in partial recovery of skeletogenesis, with normal or mildly delayed skeletons, indicating that ROCK inhibition is reversable (Fig. S4E, K).</p>
<p>Overall, the genetic and pharmacological perturbations of ROCK result with sever reduction of skeletal growth and enhanced skeletal branching, but only continuous ROCK inhibition leads to complete skeletal loss (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G, K</xref>). Immunostaining of fertilized eggs clearly shows that ROCK protein is maternal, in agreement with our RNA-seq data (Fig. S2A-C). The injected MASO’s cannot interfere with the maternal ROCK protein whereas the inhibitor affects the activity of both maternal and zygotic ROCK, which could underlie the absence of skeletal loss in the genetic perturbations. Indeed, ROCK signal is only moderately reduced in ROCK MASO injected embryos at 33hpf (Fig. S3F, J, N), demonstrating the partial penetration of the MASO. Thus, our genetic and pharmacological perturbations reconcile, and indicate that ROCK activity is necessary for spicule formation, skeletal elongation and normal branching pattern.</p>
<p>To test if ROCK skeletogenic phenotypes are due to its activity specifically in the skeletogenic cells, we inhibited ROCK in a culture of isolated skeletogenic cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L-P</xref>). The addition of ROCK inhibitor to the skeletogenic cell culture at 16hpf, before the spicules form, completely abolished spicule formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2M</xref>). The addition of the inhibitor at 48hpf, after spicule formation, resulted with significantly shorter spicules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L, N</xref>) and increased branching compared to control spicules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2O</xref>). The reduction of the spicule length becomes more significant with increasing concentration of the ROCK inhibitor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2P</xref>). Notably, skeletal loss and ectopic spicule branching were not observed in PKA or PKC inhibition in skeletogenic cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), further supporting the selective inhibition of ROCK by Y27632. ROCK skeletogenic phenotypes in the isolated skeletogenic cell culture are similar to its phenotypes in whole embryos, verifying that ROCK activity in the skeletogenic cells is essential for spicule formation, normal elongation and prevention of branching.</p>

<title>ROCK inhibition reduces spicule volume, surface area and total length, but not thickness (SR-µCT)</title>
<p>To quantify the effect of ROCK inhibition on mineral deposition and skeletal shape we used synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (SR-µCT) that enables three-dimensional visualization and quantification of spicule morphology at 2 and 3dpf (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>, S6, 40µM Y27632, see methods for details). The aberrant morphology of ROCK inhibited spicules is visible at both developmental time points (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The ectopic branching occurs both at the tips where tip-splitting is detected (arrowheads, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), as well as in the back, where small spicule extensions, or mineral ‘dripping’ are observed (arrow at 48hpf, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). This demonstrates that the regulation of mineral deposition is perturbed both at the tip and in the back of the spicules under ROCK inhibition.</p>

<p>When compared to control spicules, ROCK inhibition leads to a ∼2.5-fold reduction of the spicule volume and surface area in both 2 and 3dpf (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-D</xref>, see Table S2 for measured values and standard deviations and S3 for statistical analyses). The average rate of spicule growth between 48hpf and 72hpf in control embryos is 325.5µm<sup>3</sup>/hour, and reduces to 119.8µm<sup>3</sup>/hour under ROCK inhibition. Hence, the rate of mineral deposition is significantly reduced under ROCK inhibition.</p>
<p>To understand the specific effect of ROCK inhibition on spicule elongation vs. thickening, we compared the total length and the mean thickness of the spicules between control and ROCK inhibition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E-G</xref>). The total length of control spicules was on average about 2.5-times longer than the length under ROCK inhibition in both 2dpf and 3dpf (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E, F</xref>, tables S2 and S3). In contrast to its effect on the spicule length, ROCK inhibition caused a minor increase of the spicule thickness at 2dpf and at 3dpf the thickness was not affected by the inhibition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E-G</xref>, Tables S2, S3). These SR-µCT measurements indicate that ROCK activity plays a crucial role in controlling the rate of mineral deposition at the tips of the rods and spicule elongation, and is not affecting spicule thickening.</p>

<title>ROCK activity does not control mineral uptake but is required for “tip-dominance”</title>
<p>To test the effect of ROCK inhibition on mineral intake, we used the fluorescent chromophore, calcein that binds to divalent ions including Ca<sup>+2</sup> and is widely used to track the calcium pathway in biomineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). We measured the number of calcein stained vesicles per area as well as the number of pixels of calcein signal per area in the skeletogenic cells, in control and under ROCK inhibition at 1dpf and 2dpf (Fig. S7A-E). Continuous ROCK inhibition does not change the number of calcium bearing vesicles at 1dpf, but the number of calcein stained pixels significantly increases in this condition, possibly indicting that the vesicle volume is larger (Fig. S7F, G). At 2dpf, the number of calcein stained pixels is similar in control and in continuous ROCK inhibition, suggesting that the overall calcium content does not change in this condition (Fig. S7H, I). The number of calcein stained vesicles is however decreased under ROCK inhibition, possibly indicating that there are fewer vesicles with larger volume. Addition of ROCK inhibitor at 25hpf affects neither the number of calcein stained vesicles nor the number of calcein stained pixels in the skeletogenic cells. Together, these measurements show that ROCK is not required for the uptake of calcium into the cells. Therefore, the skeletal phenotypes occurring under ROCK inhibition are not related to a decrease in calcium uptake or shortage in intracellular calcium, but are due to defects in mineral processing within the cells and in mineral deposition.</p>
<p>To monitor the effect of ROCK inhibition on mineral deposition rate and distribution, we applied two pulses of different calcein dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>): blue calcein was added at 29hpf and washed after one hour, followed by green calcein added at 44hpf and washed after one hour. Hence, blue calcein marks the initial triradiate region and green calcein marks the edges of the spicules that were recently deposited (blue and green arrows in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H, I</xref>). The dye FM4-64 was used to mark the cell membranes. Under ROCK inhibition, the green labeled region is much closer to the blue labeled region compared to control, due to the reduction in skeletal elongation rate, in agreement with our SR-µCT measurements. However, while in control embryos each body rod has a single tip stained in green calcein, under ROCK inhibition one of the body rods has two tips and both are stained in green. This indicates that mineral is being deposited in both edges, and the mechanism that prevents the growth of multiple tips in each rod, enabling “tip-dominance”, (in analogy to plant stem apical dominance), is disrupted under ROCK inhibition.</p>

<title>The activity of the actomyosin network is essential for normal spicule elongation and inhibition of ectopic branching</title>
<p>In other systems, major roles of ROCK are to control F-actin polymerization and MyoII activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), hence we wanted to directly test the role of these actomyosin components in sea urchin skeletogenesis.

<p>Our results indicate that F-actin polymerization and to a lesser extent, actomyosin contractility, are essential for normal skeletal growth and inhibition of ectopic branching. The majority of the embryos where MyoII activation was inhibited show ectopic branching mostly at the tips of the rods, and a minor delay in skeletal growth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, C, G</xref>). These phenotypes are quite similar to those observe in the addition of 10µM of ROCK inhibitor at 25hpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H, K</xref>). The majority of the embryos where F-actin formation was inhibited show significant reduction of skeletal growth and severe ectopic skeletal branching (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, F</xref> and similar phenotypes to <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, statistics in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). These phenotypes are quite similar to those observed in 10µM continuous inhibition of ROCK and the addition of 30µM of ROCK inhibitor at 20hpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H, K</xref>). In some embryos, additional spicules form (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F, G</xref>). The co-inhibition of F-actin polymerization and MyoII activity results in skeletogenic phenotypes that resemble, but are slightly stronger, than those of the inhibition of F-actin alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D, G</xref>). Thus, the phenotypes resulting from the inhibition of MyoII activation resemble those of the late inhibition of ROCK at low inhibitor concertation. The phenotypes resulting from inhibition of actin polymerization resemble those of the continuous inhibition of ROCK in low inhibitor concertation and the late inhibition of ROCK at higher inhibitor concentrations, yet skeletal loss is only observed under ROCK continuous inhibition.</p>
<p>To test whether actin polymerization and myosin activity specifically in the skeletogenic cells underlies the observed skeletogenic phenotypes, we inhibit both in an isolated skeletogenic cell culture (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H-K</xref>). We added the inhibitors after the spicule formed (&gt;48hpf) and observed the phenotypes at 3dpf. Both inhibitors reduced skeletal growth, with Lantruculin-A having a significantly stronger effect than Blebbistatin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref>), in agreement with the stronger skeletogenic phenotypes of Lantruculin-A in whole embryos. However, differently than in whole embryos, skeletal branching in both Lantruculin-A and Blebbistatin is not affected and is similar to the observed branching in control cultures. The absence of the branching phenotype in the skeletogenic cell culture could be due to the increased rigidity of the substrate that could compensate for the reduce actomyosin activity. Another option is that the branching phenotype in whole embryos is due to the reduction of the activity of the actomyosin network in non-skeletogenic cells. Nevertheless, these results indicate that normal skeletal growth depends primarily on F-actin polymerization and to a lesser extent, on myosin contractility in the skeletogenic cells.</p>

<title>ROCK activity is required for F-actin organization around the forming spicule</title>
<p>The similarity between the skeletogenic phenotypes under ROCK inhibition and the direct perturbations of the actomyosin network led us to test the effect of ROCK inhibition on F-actin organization and MyoII activity. To accomplish this we used phalloidin, a fluorophore that binds F-actin specifically, an antibody that detects phosphorylated MyoII (MyoIIP, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>)) and the skeletogenic marker, 6a9 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). In control embryos, F-actin is detected around the tri-radiate calcite spicules at 27hpf (green arrow in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, in agreement with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>)). The pseudopodia cable that connects the skeletogenic cells shows lower F-actin signal compared to the signal around the spicule (blue line in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, C, E</xref> blue arrows in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G, H, J</xref>). MyoIIP signal is not enriched in the skeletogenic cells nor in the spicule (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D, I</xref>). Under continuous ROCK inhibition, the pseudopodia that connects the skeletogenic cells still forms (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5R</xref>) and enhanced F-actin signal is still observed in the lateral skeletogenic cell clusters (green arrow in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L</xref>); but unlike control embryos, the spicule cavity is not formed and F-actin is not organized around it (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L</xref>). MyoIIP signal seems unchanged by ROCK inhibition at this time (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5N, S</xref>), in agreement with the weak and late phenotype of MyoII inhibition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Thus, the pseudopodia cable forms but F-actin organization around the spicules does not occur under continuous ROCK inhibition, however it is not clear if the effect on F-actin organization is direct or due to the absence of spicule in this condition.</p>

Some non-skeletogenic cells that are enriched with MyoIIP signal are detected at this time (red arrowheads in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6N-Q</xref>).

F-actin is detected at the tips, in both control cultures and cultures where ROCK was inhibited after spicule formation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6W, X</xref>). Yet, under ROCK inhibition, branching is enhanced and F-actin is enriched at the splitting tips of the spicule rods (Fig, 6X).

<p>Both continuous and late ROCK inhibition strongly affect the spatial expression of key regulatory and biomineralization genes that are normally expressed differentially within the skeletogenic lineage at the pluteus stage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7D-F</xref>, S8). These include, the VEGF receptor (VEGFR), the biomineralization genes <italic>SM50</italic> and <italic>SM30,</italic> skeletogenic transcription factors, Ets1, Alx1 and Erg1 that are essential for skeletogenic cell specification and biomineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>) and the transcription factors Hex and MyoD1. In normal plutei these genes are differentially expressed within skeletogenic lineage, but in both continuous and late ROCK inhibition the expression of these genes becomes localized to the two lateral skeletogenic cell clusters and their vicinity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D-F</xref>, S8). The lateral skeletogenic cells clusters are the cells where these genes are expressed in the gastrula stage (24-27hpf) and where spicule formation begins in normal embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). The expression of VEGFR and SM50 under ROCK inhibition is more expanded than the other tested genes and is also observed at the anterolateral rods (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D, E</xref>). The VEGF ligand that is normally expressed in the ectodermal cells near the four tips of the post-oral and anterolateral rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), is expressed at four ectodermal domains near the lateral skeletogenic cell clusters and near the end of the anterolateral chain, under ROCK inhibition (Fig. S8G). Our data shows that under ROCK inhibition, the expression of key skeletogenic genes remains localized to the area near the lateral skeletogenic cells clusters (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D-F</xref>, S8), despite the proper formation of the dorsal, anterolateral and mid-ventral chains (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Overall, ROCK activity is essential for normal expression level and spatial gene expression in the skeletogenic lineage.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Biomineralization is a complex morphogenetic process, encoded in the species genome and executed by the GRNs and the cellular machinery. Here we used the sea urchin larval skeletogenesis to investigate the role of ROCK and the actomyosin network in biomineral formation and in regulating gene expression, as we summarize in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>. ROCK expression is enriched in the skeletogenic cells, partially depending on VEGF signaling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8C</xref>). ROCK activity in the skeletogenic cells is necessary for spicule formation, skeletal elongation and prevention of ectopic skeletal branching (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, S4, S5). Direct inhibition of F-actin polymerization results in similar but not identical skeletogenic phenotypes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). F-actin is organized around the spicule cavity and enriched at the spicule tips (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref>, 6). ROCK activity feeds back into the skeletogenic GRN and affects regulatory and biomineralization gene expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Below we discuss our findings and their implications on the biological control and evolution of biomineralization.</p>

</fig>
<p>The first step in generating the sea urchin spicules is the construction of the spicule cavity, a membrane filled with calcium carbonate and coated with F-actin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). ROCK activity is necessary for the spicule initiation and for the organization of F-actin around the spicule cavity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8B</xref>). However, since the spicule doesn’t form under ROCK inhibition, it is hard to conclude if the absence of F-actin organization around the spicule is due to ROCK regulation of actin polymerization or due to the absence of spicule in this condition. Relatedly, a direct perturbation of F-actin polymerization strongly disrupts spicule growth and shape, but not spicule formation, indicating that F-actin is not essential for spicule initiation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). We therefore propose that ROCK activity is necessary for spicule initiation, but not through its’ direct regulation of the actomyosin network, but though its other targets, yet to be identified (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>).</p>
<p>After the spicule cavity has formed, the spicules elongate inside the pseudopodia chord by mineral deposition at the tips of the spicule rods, which depends on ROCK activity, on F-actin polymerization and to a lesser extent, on MyoII contractility (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8D-F</xref>). F-actin is detected along the spicules and is significantly enriched at the tips of the elongating spicules, independently of ROCK activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8D, E</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>)). Under ROCK inhibition and under the inhibition of F-actin polymerization, ectopic branching is observed at the tips and in the back (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2H, J, O</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3A, I</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8E</xref>). MyoII inhibition results with ectopic branching at the tips of the rods (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, G</xref>), that is similar to the effect of late ROCK inhibition at low concertation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H, K</xref>). These correlative similarities between ROCK and the actomyosin perturbations lead us to the following speculations: the low dosage of late ROCK inhibition is perturbing mostly ROCK activation of MyoII contractility while the higher dosage affects factors that control actin polymerization (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). Further studies in higher temporal and spatial resolution of MyoIIP activity and F-actin structures in control and under ROCK inhibition will enable us to test this.</p>
<p>The participation of ROCK, F-actin and MyoII in polarized growth and vesicle exocytosis has been observed in both animals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). F-actin is used for short range myosin trafficking of vesicles toward the secretion site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). Once the secretory vesicle fuses with the membrane, it is coated with F-actin that stabilizes the vesicle and enables MyoII binding and ROCK-regulated contraction, necessary for content secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). In plant cells, F-actin accumulate at the growing tip of the cell and assists vesicle exocytosis necessary for polarized tip-growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). ROCK, F-actin and MyoII could be regulating the localized exocytosis of mineral-bearing vesicles during sea urchin skeletogenesis. The reduction of spicule growth rate and the enhanced branching could be due to impaired and misplaced vesicle trafficking and deposition under ROCK and F-actin inhibition. Detailed investigation of the kinetics and deposition of mineral-bearing vesicles and the role of actomyosin network in these processes will illuminate the regulation of vesicle exocytosis during biomineralization.</p>
<p>ROCK activity is necessary for correct spatiotemporal expression of regulatory and biomineralization genes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). ROCK inhibition downregulates the expression level of skeletogenic genes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>) and prevents the spatial progression of key skeletogenic genes toward the edges of the skeletal rods (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, S8, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8E</xref>). This implies that ROCK activity provides regulatory cues to the skeletogenic GRN required for the dynamic progression of gene expression within the skeletogenic lineage. In other systems, ROCK activity was shown to regulate gene expression through various intracellular pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Furthermore, ROCK has an important role in mechano-sensing of matrix rigidity and transducing it into changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). Relatedly, stiff substrate activates ROCK in pre-osteoblastic cells <italic>in-vitro</italic>, which activates Erk that leads to osteogenic differentiation and upregulation of osteogenic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Sea urchin ROCK could be a part of the mechano-sensing mechanism that detects the high spicule stiffness and transduces it into gene expression, providing a necessary feedback between spicule elongation and the skeletogenic GRN.</p>
<p>Overall, our findings together with the role of the actomyosin network in biomineralization, from calcifying and silicifying single cells to vertebrates’ bones and teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>), suggest that this molecular machinery is a part of the common molecular tool-kit of biomineralization. Most likely, the actomyosin network was employed independently, downstream of distinct GRNs across Eukaryotes, to control mineral growth and morphogenesis.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study addresses the role of Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) and the cytoskeleton in the initiation and growth of the calcified endoskeleton of sea urchin embryos. Perturbation by two independent approaches (a morpholino and a selective inhibitor) provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that ROCK participates both in actomyosin regulation and in the gene regulatory network that controls skeletogenesis. Exciting areas of future work will be to elucidate the mechanisms by which ROCK influences gene expression and to further dissect the role of the cytoskeleton in mineralization.</p>

<p>In their revised manuscript Hijaze et al. adequately addressed the majority of my previous concerns in a satisfactory manner. In particular, they validated their morpholino knock-down experiments by explaining how they determined the optimal concentrations and provided an immunohistological evidence for the reduction in ROCK protein abundance. The authors also added new antibody stainings providing evidence that ROCK and F-actin do not interact directly but likely through other kinases that modulate f-actin, and that the localization of f-actin at the spicule tips remains unaffected by the knock-down. In addition, the authors revised their discussion to not overstate their observations, and by focusing on the potential mechanisms by which ROCK may affect biomineralization (i.e. mechano sensing and exocytosis of vesicles). Here I would like to add, that f-actin mediated exocytosis does not necessarily target mineral baring vesicles but may also promote the exocytosis of matrix proteins that are essential for the normal formation of the spicules and that are an integral component of other biominerals, as well. I strongly encourage the authors to continue on this exciting research, including the development of methods to analyze the molecular mechanisms that control vesicular trafficking in mineralizing systems.</p>

<p>This project is on the role of ROCK in skeletogenesis during sea urchin development. That skeleton is produced by a small number of cells in the embryo with signaling inputs from the ectoderm providing patterning cues. The skeleton is built from secretion of CaCO3 by the skeletogenic cells. The authors conclude that ROCK is involved in the regulation of skeletogenesis with a role both in regulating actomyosin in the process, and in the gene regulatory network (GRN) underlying the entire sequence of events.</p>
<p>The strength of the paper is that they show in detail how perturbations of ROCK results in abnormal actomyosin activity in the skeletogenic cells, and they show alterations both in expression of transcription factors of the GRN, and expression of genes involved in assembly of the skeletal matrix. Two different approaches lead to this conclusion: morpholino perturbations and the actions of a selective inhibitor of the kinase activity. Thus, they achieved their goal which was to test the hypothesis that ROCK is involved in the process of skeletogenesis. Those tests support the hypothesis with data that was quantitatively significant.</p>
<p>The discussion was transparent regarding where the analysis ended and where the next phase of work should begin. While actomyosin involvement was altered when ROCK was perturbed, it isn't known how direct or indirect the role of ROCK might be. Also, while the regulatory input to spicule initiation and growth is affected when ROCK is inhibited, it isn't clear exactly where ROCK is involved.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>Thank you and the two reviewers for the thorough review of our manuscript. We found the reviewer’s comments highly valuable and addressed them by the following additional experiments and changes in the text and the figures:</p>
<p>(1) We measured the effect of ROCK MASO’s on the ROCK expression by immunostaining and observed a reduction in ROCK signal, supporting the downregulation of ROCK protein level under ROCK MASO’s (new Fig. S3).</p>
<p>(2) We measured the effect of lower concertation of ROCK inhibitor, Y27632 (10µM), and observe the same phenotypes of skeletal loss, skeletal reduction and ectopic branching in this concentration (Fig. 2, S4). Importantly, these phenotypes were not observed when directly inhibiting PKA and PKC, in whole sea urchin embryos (1) and in skeletogenic cell cultures (2), further supporting the specificity of ROCK inhibitor.</p>
<p>(3) We added a time course of Pl-ROCK expression and immunostaining of ROCK in the fertilized egg, that show that this gene is maternal and the protein is present in the egg Fig. 2SA-C.</p>
<p>(4) We recorded F-actin in ROCK MASO’s and demonstrate that it is still detected around the spicules and their tips, similarly to ROCK inhibited embryos (new Fig.S3).</p>
<p>(5) We revised the paper text and figures to provide a better description of our results, distinguish clearly between our data and our interpretations and emphasize the novelty of our findings.</p>
<p>This paper demonstrates that ROCK, F-actin polymerization and actomyosin contractility play critical roles in biomineral growth and in shaping biomineral morphology in the sea urchin embryo, and that ROCK activity affects skeletogenic gene expression. Our findings together with previous reports of the role of actomyosin in Eukaryotes biomineralization, suggest that this molecular machinery is a part of the common molecular tool-kit used in biomineralization. The identification of a common molecular mechanism within the diverse gene regulatory networks, organic scaffolds and minerals that Eukaryote use to build their biominerals will be of high interest to the field of biomineralization and evolutionary biology. Furthermore, our paper portrays the interplay between the cellular and the genetic machinery that drives morphogenesis. We believe it would be of great interest to the broad readership of eLife and particularly to the fields of biomineralization, cell, developmental and evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the helpful review of our paper.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the appreciation of our work the helpful comments that guided us to strengthen the experimental evidence for our conclusions and increase the paper’s clarity. Below are our responses to the specific comments:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major comments</p>
<p>One MASO led to reduced skeleton formation while the other one additionally induced ectopic branching. How was the optimum concentration for the MASOs determined? Did the authors perform a dose-response curve? What is the reason for this difference? Which of the two MASOs can be validated by reduced ROCK protein abundance? Since the ROCK antibody works, I would like to see a control experiment on Rock protein abundance in control and ROCK MO injected larvae which is the gold-standard for validating the knock-down.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We tested several MASO concentrations to identify a concentration where the control embryos injected with Random MASO were overall healthy and ROCK MASO’s showed clear phenotypes.</p>
<p>To test the effect of ROCK MASO’s on ROCK protein levels we did immunostaining experiments that are now presented in new Fig. S3. We could not do Western blot for injected embryos since ROCK antibody requires thousands of embryos for Western blot, which is not feasible for injected embryos. Therefore, we tested the effect of the two translation ROCK MASO’s on ROCK abundance compared to uninjected and Random MASO injected embryos using immunostaining. We observed a reduction of ROCK signal, supporting the downregulation of ROCK protein level in these genetic perturbations (new Fig. S3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L212 &quot;Together, these measurements show that ROCK is not required for the uptake of calcium into cells.&quot; But what about trafficking and exocytosis? As mentioned earlier, I think this is a really important point that needs to be confirmed to understand the function of ROCK in controlling calcification. In their previous study (reference 45) the authors demonstrated that they have superior techniques in measuring vesicle dynamics in vivo. Here an acute treatment with the ROCK inhibitor would be sufficient to test if calcein-positive vesicle motion, including the observed reduction in velocity close to the tissue skeleton interface, is affected by the inhibitor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the appreciation of our previous work where we studied calcium vesicle dynamics in whole embryos (Winter et al, Plos Com Biol 2021). We agree with the reviewer that the best way to test directly the effect of ROCK on mineral deposition and vesicle kinetics is to observe it in live skeletogenic cells. However, in Winter et al 2021, we found that the skeleton (spicules) doesn’t grow when the embryos are immobilized in either control or treated embryos. We have to immobilize the embryos to record live timelapses of whole embryos. Hence, this means that we can not determine the role of ROCK or any other perturbation in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis based on experiments conducted in immobilized whole embryos, since skeletogenesis is arrested. We believe that we can do it in skeletogenic cell cultures and we are currently developing this assay for vesicle tracking, but this is beyond the scope of this current work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Is there a colocalization of ROCK and f-actin in the tips of the spicules? This would support the mechano-sensing-hypothesis by ROCK.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our studies show that F-actin is localized around the spicule cavity and in the cortex of the cells (Figs. 5 and 6) while ROCK is enriched in the skeletogenic cell bodies, with some localization near the skeletogenic cell membranes (Fig. 1). To directly address the reviewer question we immune-stained ROCK and F-actin in the same embryos, and showed that their sub-cellular localizations does not show a strong overlap (Fig. S3 Q-T). However, ROCK does not bind F-actin directly: ROCK activates another kinase, LimK that phosphorylates Cofilin that interacts with F-actin. Therefore, the fact that ROCK is not colocalized with F-actin does not support nor contradicts the possible role of ROCK in mechano-sensing.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L 283. &quot;F-actin is enriched at the tips of the spicules independently of ROCK activity&quot; The results of this paragraph clearly demonstrate that ROCK inhibition has no effect on the localization of f-actin at the tips of the growing spicules. In addition, the new cell culture experiments underline this observation. Still, the central question that remains is, what is the interaction between ROCK, f-actin, and the mineralization process, that leads to the observed deformations? What does the f-actin signal look like in a branched phenotype or in larvae that failed to develop a skeleton (inhibition from Y20)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we report in Fig. 6, and now on new Fig. S3, under ROCK late inhibition or in ROCK morphants, we still detect F-actin around the spicule and enriched at the tips. When ROCK is inhibited and the embryo fails to develop a skeleton, we observe Factin accumulation in the skeletogenic cells, but the F-actin is not organized (Fig. 5). As the spicule is absent in this condition, it is hard to conclude whether the effect on F-actin organization is direct or due to the absence of spicule in this condition. We stated that explicitly in the current version in the results, lines 324-326 and in the discussion, lines 405-408.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Immunohistochemical analyses on f-actin localization and abundance should be additionally performed with ROCK knock-down phenotypes to confirm the pharmacological inhibition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did that in our new Figure S3 and showed that ROCK morphant show the same F-actin localization at the tips like control and ROCK inhibited embryos.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L 365 &quot;...supporting its role in mineral deposition...&quot; &quot;...Overall, our studies indicate that ROCK activity....is essential for the formation of the spicule cavity......which could be essential for mineral deposition...&quot; I think the authors need to do a better job in clearly separating between the potential processes impacted by ROCK perturbation. Is it stabilization and mechano-sensing in the spicule tip or the intracellular trafficking and deposition of the ACC? If the dataset does not allow for a definite conclusion, I suggest clearly separating the different possibilities combined with thorough discussion-based findings from other mineralizing systems where the interaction between ROCK and F-actin has been described.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment. We believe that ROCK and the actomyosin are involved in both, mechano-sensing of the rigid biomineral and in the transport and exocytosis of mineral-bearing vesicles. In the current version we provide explicit explanations of these two hypotheses in the discussion section. The possible role in exocytosis and the experiments that are required to assess this role are described in lines 427-439, and the possible mechano-sensing role and effect on gene expression is described in lines 440-453.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Minor comments</p>
<p>L185 &quot;These SR-µCT measurements show that the rate of mineral deposition is significantly reduced under ROCK inhibition.&quot; To correctly support this statement I would suggest to calculate the real growth rates (µm3 time-1). For example, an increase in volume from 6,850 µm3 at 48 hpf to 14,673 µm3 at 72 hpf would result in a growth rate of 7823 µm3 24h-1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We calculated the rate of spicule growth as the reviewer suggested and we added this information in lines 218-221.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L343: &quot;This implies that....within the skeletogenic lineage.&quot; This concluding sentence is very speculative and therefore misplaced in the results section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We removed this sentence from the results section into the discussion, lines 443-445.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L382: &quot;The participation of F-actin and ROCK in polarized tip-growth and vesicle exocytosis has been observed in both, animals and plants.&quot; L407-409: &quot;...F-actin could be regulating the localized exocytosis of mineral-bearing vesicles....&quot; I think this is exactly the core question that remains unresolved in this study. To reduce speculations I strongly recommend addressing the effect of ROCK inhibition on vesicle trafficking and exocytosis (Monitoring of calcein-positive Vesicles in PMCs).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that this is a critical question that we would have address, but as we explained above, is beyond the scope of this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 5: The values below the scale bars in the newly added figures U+V are extremely small. Also, the Legend for this figure sounds incorrect. Should read: &quot;...and skeletogenic cell cultures that were treated with 30µM ROCK inhibitor that was added at 48hpf and recorded at 72hpf.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We increased the font near the scale bars and corrected the figure caption. Thanks for this and your other helpful comments!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising the important issue of inhibitor concentration which led us to do additional experiments with lower concentration that were valuable and strengthen the manuscript. We also thank the reviewer for asking us to be clearer with the interpretation of the results. Below are our responses to the specific comments:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>My concerns are the interpretation of the experiments. The main overriding concern is a possible over-interpretation of the role of ROCK. In the literature that ROCK participates in many biological processes with a major contribution to the actin cytoskeleton. And when a function is attributed to ROCK, it is usually based on the determination of a protein that is phosphorylated by this kinase. Here that is not the case. The observation here is in most cases stunted growth of the spicule skeleton and some mis-patterning occurs or there is an absence of skeleton if the inhibitor is added prior to initiation of skeletal growth. They state in the abstract that ROCK impairs the organization of F-actin around the spicules. The evidence for that as a direct role is absent.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that since the spicule doesn’t form under ROCK continuous inhibition, it is unclear if the absence of F-actin around the spicule in this condition is a direct outcome of the lack of ROCK activation of F-actin polymerization, or an indirect outcome due to the lack of spicule to coat. We therefore deleted this line in the abstract and explicitly stated that we cannot conclude whether the impaired F-actin organization is directly due to ROCK effect on actin polymerization in the results, lines 324-326 and in the discussion, lines 405-408.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>They use morpholino data and ROCK inhibitor data to draw their conclusion. My main concern is the concentration of the inhibitor used since at the high concentrations used, the inhibitor chosen is known to inhibit other kinases as well as ROCK (PKA and PKC). They indicate that this inhibition is specifically in the skeletogenic cells based on the isolation of skeletogenic cells in culture and spicule production either under control or ROCK inhibition and they observe the same - stunting and branching or absence of skeletons if treated before skeletogenesis commences. Again, however, the high concentrations are known to inhibit the other kinases.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the previous version of the paper we used the range of 30-80µM Y-27632 to block ROCK activity. These concentrations are commonly used in mammalian systems and in Drosophila to block ROCK activity (3-8). The reviewer is correct stating that at high concentration, this inhibitor can block PKA and PKC. However, the affinity of the inhibitor for these kinases is more than 100 times lower than its affinity to ROCK as indicated by the biochemical Ki values reported in the manufactory datasheet: 0.14-0.22 μM for ROCK1, 0.3 μM for ROCK2, 25 μM for PKA and 26 μM for PKC.</p>
<p>Importantly, these Ki values are based on biochemistry assays where the activity of the inhibitor is tested in-vitro with the purified protein. Therefore, these concentrations are not relevant to cell or embryo cultures where the inhibitor has to penetrate the cells and affect ROCK activity in-vivo. Y-27632 activity was studied both in-vitro and in-vivo in Narumiya, Ishizaki and Ufhata, Methods in Enzymology 2000 (9). This paper reports similar concentrations to the ones indicated in the manufactory datasheet for the in-vitro experiments, but shows that 10µM concentration or higher are effective in cell cultures. We therefore tested the effect of 10µM Y-27632 added at 0hpf (continuous inhibition) and at 25hpf (late inhibition) and added this information to Figs. 2 and S3. Continuous inhibition at this concentration resulted with three major phenotypes: skeletal loss, spicule initiations and small spicules with ectopic branching. This result supports our conclusion that ROCK activity is necessary for spicule formation, elongation and prevention of branching. Late inhibition in this concentration resulted with the majority of the embryos developing branched spicules, which is very similar to the effect of MyoII inhibition with Blebbistatin. This result again, supports the inference that ROCK activity is required for normal skeletal growth and the prevention of ectopic branching. Importantly, there are two papers were PKA and PKC were directly inhibited in whole sea urchin embryos (1) and in skeletogenic cell cultures (2). In both assays, PKC inhibition resulted with mild reduction of spicule length while PKA inhibition did not affect skeletal formation. Neither skeletal loss nor ectopic branching were ever observed under PKC or PKA inhibition, supporting the specific inhibition of ROCK by Y-27362. Furthermore, both genetic and pharmacological perturbations of ROCK resulted with significant reduction of skeletal growth and with the enhancement of ectopic branching. Therefore, we believe we provide convincing evidence for the role of ROCK in spicule formation, growth and prevention of branching. We revised Fig. 2 and S3 to include the 10µM Y-27632 data and the text describing the inhibition to include the explanations and references we provided here.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>They use blebbistatin and latrunculin and show that these known inhibitors of actin cytoskeleton lead to abnormal spiculogenesis, This coincidence is suggestive but is not proof that it is ROCK acts on the actomyosin cytoskeleton given the specificity concerns.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As stated above, we believe that in the current vesion we overcame the specificity concerns and provided solid evidence that ROCK activity is necessary for spicule formation, growth and prevention of branching. Furthermore, the skeletogenic phenotypes of late 10µM Y-27632 are highly similar to those of MyoII inhibition (Blebbistatin) while the phenotypes of higher concetrations resemble the inhibition of actin polymerization by Latrunculin. We agree with the reviewer that: “This coincidence is suggestive but is not proof that ROCK acts on the actomyosin cytoskeleton” and we revise the discussion paragraph to differentiate between our solid findings and our speculations (lines 421-426): “These correlative similarities between ROCK and the actomyosin perturbations lead us to the following speculations: the low dosage of late ROCK inhibition is perturbing mostly ROCK activation of MyoII contractility while the higher dosage affects factors that control actin polymerization (Fig. 8F). Further studies in higher temporal and spatial resolution of MyoIIP activity and F-actin structures in control and under ROCK inhibition will enable us to test this.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The following areas require attention:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) You begin and end the abstract with statements on evolution in which the actomyosin cytoskeleton is associated with skeletogenesis despite different GRNs, different contributing proteins, etc. You then move to ROCK and claim to reveal that ROCK is a central player in the process. As above, in the judgement of this reviewer, you fail to establish a direct role of ROCK to the actomyosin role in skeletogenesis. Sure, the ROCK inhibitors suggest that ROCK plays some kind of role in the process but you also indicate that ROCK could act on many processes, none of which you directly associate with the necessary activity of ROCK.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that our paper provides correlative similarities between the phenotypes of ROCK and those of direct pertrubations of the actomyosin network, and lacks causal relationship. We made this point clear throughout the current version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In the abstract you report that ROCK inhibition impairs the actin cytoskeleton around the skeleton. In examining your images in Fig. 5 that is not the case. Based on Phalloidin staining, actin surrounds both the control and the ROCK-inhibited skeleton. The distribution of actin is the same in both cases. Myosin is also stained in this figure and it too shows similar staining both in experimental and control. So, to this reviewer, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the actin cytoskeleton is impaired, and there is no evidence directly relating ROCK with that cytoskeleton. I'm not questioning the observation that inhibition of ROCK causes stunting and mispatterning of the skeleton. That you show and quantify well. The issue is the precise target of ROCK. Your data does not establish the specific cause. It could be the actin cytoskeleton but your experiments do not directly address that.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Fig. 5 shows a clear difference between F-actin in control and under ROCK inhibition. In control F-actin is enriched around the spicule and under ROCK inhibition the spicule doesn’t form and disorganized F-actin is accumulated in the skeletogenic cells. Yet, as we stated above – this is not a proof for the direct effect of ROCK on F-actin polymerization, and we explain it explicitly in the results, lines 324-326 and in the discussion, lines 405-408.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In parts of the manuscript you use the term filopodia and in other parts I think you use pseudopodia to refer to the same structure. Since Ettensohn has provided the most evidence on the organization of the skeletogenic syncytia, I suggest you use the same term he used for those cellular extensions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The filopodia and the pseudopodia are two distinct structures generated by the skeletogenic cells. The filopodia is the common cellular extension described in many cells, while the term “pseudopodia cable” describes the specific structure that forms between the skeletogenic cells in which the spicule cavity forms, in agreement with Prof. Ettensohn terminology.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In trying to find relationships you cite a number of previous papers at the end of the introduction. I went back to those papers and they describe (from your work) calcium exocytosis, plus filopodia formation, plus planar cell polarity, plus CDC42, any one of which could involve an actin cytoskeleton. You even cite a paper saying that perturbations of ROCK prevent spicule formation. I went back to that paper and that isn't the case. You then summarize the Introduction by relating ROCK and the actin cytoskeleton, thereby raising reader expectation that the two will be connected. As above, in reality, your evidence here does not connect the two.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for giving us credit for all these works, but only the paper on vesicle kinetics is from our lab (winter et al 2021). As for Croce et al, 2006 that the reviewer refers to: in Fig. 9A, 75µM of Y-27632 is used to inhibit ROCK in the same sea urchin species that we use, and the phenotype is identical to what we observe – the skeletogenic cells are there, but the spicule is not formed. As mentioned above, in the current version we distinguished clearly between our solid findings and our interpretations.</p>

<p>(5) You emphasize in Fig. 1 the inhibition of ROCK in the presence of VEGFR inhibition. However, at no place in the manuscript do you say anything about how VEGFR is inhibited, when it is inhibited, or how you know it is inhibited. That oversight must be corrected. You mention axitinib but don't say anything about what it does. Some readers may know its activity but many will not.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now indicate that we use Axitinib to block VEGFR in the results section (line 104) and in the methods section (lines 470-471).</p>

<p>(6) Fig. 2. The use of Y27632 as a selective inhibitor of ROCK. According to data sheets from the manufacturer, at the levels used in your experiments, 120 µm, 80 µm and 30 µm, those levels of inhibitor also inhibit the activity of PKA and PKC (both inhibited at around 25 µm). This is concerning because of the literature indicating that activation of the VEGFR operates through PKA. Inhibition of PKA, then, would inhibit the activity of VEGF signaling. Thus, the inhibitory effects of Y27632 may actually not be attributed specifically to ROCK. Furthermore, the heading of this section states that ROCK activity controls initiation, growth, and morphology of the spicule. Yet, even in high levels of inhibitor spicule production is initiated. Yes, the growth and the morphology are compromised, but the initiation doesn't seem to be.</p>

<p>The spicule fails to form under ROCK continuous inhibition in all concentrations (Fig. 2). Also, as we explained in details above, these Ki values are based on biochemical experiments with purified proteins and are not relevant to in-vivo use of the inhibitor. Yet, these Ki values demonstrate that the affinity of the inhibitor to ROCK is 100 higher than of its affinity to PKA and PKC. Specifically to the reviewer suggestion here: direct inhibition of PKA does not have skeletogenic phenotypes, not in whole embryos (1) and not in skeletogenic cell culture (2). Since we see the same skeletogenic phenotypes at low Y-27362 concentration and the genetic and pharmacological pertrubations of ROCK reconcile, we believe that these phenotypes can be atributed directly to ROCK.</p>

<p>(7) The synchrotron study is very nice with two points that should be addressed. Again, a high concentration of Y27632 was used giving a caveat on ROCK specificity. And second, the blue and green calcein pulses are very nice but the recent paper by the Bradham group should be cited.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added a reference to Bradham recent paper on two calcein pulses (10).</p>

<p>(8) Fig. 5 is where an attempt is made to associate ROCK inhibition to alterations in actomyosin. Again, a high concentration of the inhibitor is used casting doubt on whether it specifically inhibits ROCK. However, even if the inhibition is specific to ROCK the images do not provide convincing evidence that ROCK activity normally is directed toward actomyosin. This is crucial to the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As stated above, we addressed the specificity in this version and we modified the text to emphasize the correlation and not cuasation: Fig. 5 shows a clear difference between F-actin in control and under ROCK inhibition. In control F-actin is enriched around the spicule and under ROCK inhibition the spicule doesn’t form and disorganized F-actin is accumulated in the skeletogenic cells. Yet, as we stated above – this is not a proof for the direct effect of ROCK on F-actin polymerization, and we explain it explicitly in the results, lines 324-326 and in the discussion, lines 405-408.</p>

<p>(9) Again in Fig. 6 the inhibitor is used with the same concern about whether the effects noted are due to ROCK.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Fig. 6 is now Fig. 7 – the effect of ROCK on gene expression and as explained above, we addressed the specificity in this version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) Lines 350-358. This interpretation falls apart without showing that the inhibitor is specific for ROCK as indicated above. Also, Fig. 5 is unconvincing in showing a difference in actin or myosin distribution in control vs ROCK inhibited embryos. Yes, the spicules are stunted, but whether actin or myosin have anything to do with that as a result of lack of ROCK activity is not demonstrated.</p>
