<title>Abstract</title>
<p>We present a method for direct imaging of the electric field networks in the human brain from electroencephalography (EEG) data with much higher temporal and spatial resolution than functional MRI (fMRI), without the concomitant distortions. The method is validated using simultaneous EEG/fMRI data in healthy subjects, intracranial EEG data in epilepsy patients, and in a direct comparison with standard EEG analysis in a well-established attention paradigm. The method is then demonstrated on a very large cohort of subjects performing a standard gambling task designed to activate the brain’s ‘reward circuit’. The technique uses the output from standard EEG systems and thus has potential for immediate benefit to a broad range of important basic scientific and clinical questions concerning brain electrical activity, but also provides an inexpensive and portable alternative to function MRI (fMRI).</p>

<title>1 Main</title>
<p>The human brain communicates internally through exceedingly complex spatial and temporal patterns of electrical signals. Although these signals can be measured using electrodes placed on the surface of the scalp (electroencephalography, or EEG), the ability to reconstruct the spatial and temporal patterns within the brain has been thwarted by the complexity of the inverse problem: What time- (or frequency-) dependent volumetric electrical signals throughout the brain are consistent with the signal measured on the two-dimensional surface of the scalp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>)? There is a long-standing belief that it is not possible to detect and reconstruct electrical activity in sub-cortical regions deep within the brain from EEG due to inherent limitations of “volume conduction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). However, this is not actually a physical limitation, but rather a consequence of the incomplete nature of the standard model used to characterize the EEG signal. Despite the obviously highly dynamical nature of the electrical activity that occurs within the very inhomogeneous and anisotropic composition of brain tissue, current EEG data analysis methods are still based on the assumption that the average tissue bioelectric properties (e.g., the average permittivity <inline-formula id="ID1">

</inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) which in turn leads to the assumption that the time depedence <italic>∂E/∂t</italic> can be ignored in the “typical” frequency range of brain signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). This is the ubiquitous so-called “quasi-static” approximation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>).</p>
<p>In reality, it is precisely the anisotropic and inhomogeneous nature of brain tissue that must be taken into account in order to develop an accurate physical model of brain electromagnetic behavior, as we have described in our recently developed universal theory of brain waves called <italic>weakly evanescent transverse cortical waves</italic> (WETCOW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). The surprising consequence of this theory is the existence of electric field waves generated as a consequence of the complex tissue boundaries (e.g., surface waves) that permeate throughout the brain and are in precisely the frequency range of observed brain electrical activity. This theory explains the broad range of observed but seemingly disparate brain spatiotemporal electrical phenomena from extracellular spiking to cortical wave loops, all of which are predicated on the time dependence of the electric fields within the complex architecture of anisotropic and inhomeneous tissue within the brain. This theory is necessary to provide a solution to the EEG inverse problem which, as shown below, produces a reconstruction of brain electrical activity with high temporal resolution and spatial resolution that is comparable (or even exceeding that of) functional MRI.</p>

<title>2 Methods</title>
<p>The essence of our method (detailed in the Supplementary Material) is to reconstruct the electric field potential throughout the entire brain using our recently developed WETCOW wave model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) constrained by MRI-defined tissue properties. This method is called <italic>SPatially resolved EEG Constrained with Tissue properties by Regularized Entropy (SPECTRE)</italic>. This approach solves a dynamic time-dependent construction of Maxwell’s wave equations of electromagnetism in an inhomogeneous and anisotropic medium and thus is distinctly different than standard so-called ‘source localization’ methods, as discussed in Section 6.3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3">
<title>3 Validation</title>
<p>Validation of any neuroimaging methods is problematic because it is not possible to directly measure brain activity at every location in the brain. Nevertheless, three methods are obvious candidates for assessment of SPECTRE’s validity.</p>
<p>The first is comparison with functional MRI (fMRI), the current method of choice for whole brain spatial localization of brain activity. However, association of fMRI with a “standard” for EEG is problematic because it is not measuring electrical activity, but the magnetization changes in hemoglobin as blood becomes deoxygenated during brain activity. The timescale and location of these changes can be vastly different than those produced by EEG signals. Nevertheless, its capability of spatially localizing activated brain regions merits a comparison. The most direct comparison is between fMRI and EEG data collected simultaneously, which guarantees that the brain activity measured is identical in both experiments. Such “simultaneous fMRI/EEG” experiments are not particularly common as collecting EEG data within an MRI scanner during imaging is notoriously difficult, and the MR imaging procedure significantly distorts the EEG signal. However, a recent open-source study provides such data which is sufficient for our purposes.</p>
<p>A more direct method for validating the ability of SPECTRE to reconstruct localized electrical activity can be constructed from intra-cranial EEG (iEEG) recordings collected during epilepsy studies. Such measurements consist of specially designed EEG sensors distributed linearly along a probe that is inserted deep within a brain that has been exposed by surgical removal of a portion of the skull. By selecting only these electrodes near the brain surface from the full array of electrodes, we can synthesize an artificial surface distribution of electrodes to mimic a standard non-invasive EEG experiment (albeit with a limited coverage of the brain). We have access to such data through an ongoing study which enabled this method of validation as well.</p>
<p>Lastly, a comparison with current “source localization” methods would seem to be in order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). This comparison turns out to be the most problematic as these methods all employ a very different, and quite limited, physical model for the EEG signal, and suffer from computational limitations as well. Despite attempts to make a reasonably valid comparison, it was determined that this was not possible, as described below.</p>

<title>3.1 Validation with simultaneous fMRI/EEG visual task</title>
<p>It is notoriously difficult to get high quality EEG data in simultaneous fMRI/EEG studies as the presence of the rapidly varying magnetic fields present in an fMRI acquisition distort the EEG signal. However, one recent open-source simultaneous fMRI/EEG study of a well controlled visual task (the periodic flashing checkerboard) on multiple subjects ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), available from the Nathan Kline Institute) provides important data to address this question.</p>
<p>The ability of SPECTRE to faithfully reconstruct the spatial distribution similar to fMRI is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>. Importantly, this comparison was performed on data from a single subject, since brain activity patterns can vary significantly between individual and averaging over multiple subjects obscures specific spatial variations important for validation. In the top rows of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> is shown the fMRI EFD mode that automatically detects the activation in the primary visual cortex. In the middle row are shown the SPECTRE modes reconstructed using the 2mm MNI anatomical atlas, chosen because it was closest in resolution (2mm<sup>3</sup>) to the fMRI data (~ 3mm<sup>3</sup>). The very close correspondence between the spatial patterns is evident.</p>

In both cases, the weighted sum of the power over all modes is shown. The task was a simple 8Hz flashing checkerboard with 4 on/off cycles.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>The bottom rows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> clearly demonstrate one of the most compelling, and perhaps surprising, aspects of SPECTRE - its ability to reconstruct activation at spatial resolution <italic>significantly higher</italic> than fMRI. This is a consequence of the SPECTRE reconstruction being based on the solution of the propagation of electromagnetic wave through specific tissue morphologies and bioelectric properties, provided by arbitrary resolution anatomical MRI data. The finer the resolution of the MRI scans, the more details can be available for the reconstruction. This is of course dependent upon the number and distribution of the EEG sensors, but certainly holds for the standard array configurations used in this paper.</p>
<p>Although it is an almost universally believed notion that EEG and fMRI are complementary because EEG has excellent temporal resolution but poor spatial resolution, while fMRI has poor temporal resolution but good spatial resolution, in fact SPECTRE EEG reconstructions can achieve much higher <italic>intrinsic</italic> temporal <italic>and</italic> spatial resolution. Moreover, because there are no spatial distortions in SPECTRE, this mitigates one of the aspects of fMRI that most confounds spatial localization through signal loss and non-linear geometric distortions. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>It should be noted that the ‘simple’ periodic flickering checkerboard stimulus not only activates the primary visual cortex but activates other visual and supplementary fields as well, as is evident from the activity patterns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>. A simple stimulus does not imply a simple activation pattern. This notion was a primary motivation for our development of the EFD method for fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). The activation mode reconstructions for both the fMRI and SPECTRE data are based on the EFD which detects complex non-linear interacting spatial-temporal modes of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Thus although the task is a ‘simple’ visual stimulation, our analysis is not expected to simply detect activity in only the visual cortex, as would be produced by a more standard regression approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), but in a more complex set of brain networks. Indeed, multiple EFD modes are produced, though we have only shown the one incorporating the primary visual cortex. As we have argued previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), EFD analysis is more sensitive than simple regression techniques to the complex brain activation patterns predicted by neuroscience, and less sensitive to erroneous identification of noise or non-independent modes than the independent component analysis (ICA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Indeed, one of our observations from both the fMRI and EEG data used in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) is the appearance of PFC activations associated with visual stimulation, which has been suggestive of conscious visual perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Addressing this question is beyond the scope of the current paper.</p>

<title>3.2 Validation with simultaneous fMRI/EEG attention paradigm</title>
<p>Simultaneous EEG/fMRI were collected from subjects within a standard clinical 3T MRI scanner (see Section 6.4.1 for details). The stimuli and paradigm are described in detail in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Briefly, bimodal stimuli consisting of short (~ 1s) streams of simple tones (600 and 1000 Hz) alternating at 10 Hz were delivered concurrently with phase-reversing (6Hz) checkerboard patterns presented at fixation. Participants were instructed to selectively attend to either the visual or auditory aspect of the bimodal stimulus and respond when the stream of stimuli in the attended modality ends.</p>
<p>SPECTRE processing was performed in the alpha band. The appearance of visual stimuli elicited a reduction of ongoing alpha (7–14Hz) activity (“event-related desynchronization”, ERD) over occipital cortex, believed to occur when cortical regions are brought “on-line” for information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). As in previous studies, e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), attended visual stimuli elicited increased (more negative) amplitude of the alpha ERD compared to unattended stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). In contrast, unattended, compared to attended, visual stimuli elicited a greater reduction in ongoing spectral activity within the 5–15Hz frequency range over bilateral middle frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C,D</xref>). We estimated the neural sources of these attention-related modulations of oscillatory activity across the 8–12Hz frequency band which encompassed both the occipital and frontal activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.3E</xref>). Their anatomical localization was remarkably consistent across several individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.4</xref>).</p>

<p>A direct comparison of the activation maps derived from both fMRI and EEG using SPECTRE for single study within two subjects (i.e. without any average over studies or subjects) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.5</xref>. The comparison is made by choosing specific regions of interest defined in the MNI atlas (occipital cortex and cerebellum) and correlating the activation maps derived from EFD for fMRI and SPECTRE from EEG. Comparison of the similarity of activated regions in individual subjects is generally a non-trivial problem. This is particularly true in the current case where the spatial distortions in fMRI (and lack of them in SPECTRE) make measures such as mean-squared error difficult to interpret. Therefore computation of the correlation coefficient over a predefined atlas ROI is a reasonable conservative meausure. The high correlation coefficients between the maps <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> are therefore indicative of the consistency between the fMRI and SPECTRE results in the ROI. Note that this does <italic>not</italic> imply similarity over the entire region shown. Indeed, the SPECTRE results show enhanced sensivity to activation in regions not seen in the fMRI.</p>

In each subject, two brain regions—the cerebellum and the occipital pole (top and bottom rows, respectively), were delineated based on the MNI atlas and EFD activation maps were correlated across these entire regions. Correlation coefficients were as follows: for Subject A, cerebellum=0.74, occipital pole=0.70; for Subject B, cerebellum=0.70, occipital pole=0.84. Correlations were computed only for regions exhibiting activation levels above 0.1. In contrast to fMRI, the SPECTRE technique identified robust activations in bilateral middle and inferior frontal cortex (indicated by yellow arrows) and middle temporal cortex (red arrows). It also discerned activations along the superior temporal cortex, including areas encompassing the primary auditory cortex (green arrows).</p></caption>

<title>3.3 Validation through Intra-Cranial EEG recordings</title>
<p>While comparison with fMRI can validate the correct detection of activated brain regions and networks, as shown in the previous section, it cannot inform the question of correct detection of electrical signals, since fMRI is based on a completely different contrast mechanism related to blood oxygenation. A direct validation of SPECTRE’s ability to faithfully reconstruct deep electromagnetic activity is, to our knowledge, only achievable with one type of data: intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings such as those used in medically refractory epilepsy patients for seizure onset localization where the electrodes are known to be adjacent to the site of electrical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). We analyzed an iEEG recording of a seizure localized in the left mesial temporal region acquired at Northwell Health, NY. All implanted electrodes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.6</xref> (Top row) with each yellow dot depicting one recording contact. Comparing the SPECTRE reconstruction using all of the sensor data with one using only a subset of the data comprised of only the sensors on the surface of the brain (red dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.6</xref> (Top row)) allows the quantitative assessment of how closely the results from a set of surface electrodes correspond to those produced by intra-cranial measurements recording signal very close to the sources. The results are shown for the alpha frequency band in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref> and reveal a very close correspondance between the SPECTRE mode reconstruction.</p>

<title>4 Investigation of the ‘reward circuit</title>
<p>Having validated the SPECTRE method directly with simultaneous fMRI/EEG, iEEG, and an attention paradigm, we investigated the ability of SPECTRE to faithfully reconstruct the well known neural ‘reward circuit’ that is one of the most important in understanding human cognition, emotion, and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and is of great clinical significance in the understanding of addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), mood disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), and a variety of other conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>).</p>
<p>We demonstrate that SPECTRE using standard EEG data can accurately map human reward pathways akin to results previously only seen via fMRI. Indeed, fMRI results have highlighted a reward system within the brain that includes midbrain dopamine producing regions (the substan-sia nigra pars compacta, the ventral tegmental area), the ventral striatum, and multiple regions within the human prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Other research using fMRI and source localization of EEG data suggests that the anterior cingulate cortex also plays a key role in reward processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). In a unifying theory, it has been proposed that all the aforementioned regions work together as a neural system for the optimization of reward driven behavioral change (i.e., reinforcement leaning; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>).)</p>
<p>This is of particular clinical significance because addictive behaviors have long been known to be subserved by specific brain regions operating in concert as the reward circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). The reward circuit is involved in processing rewarding stimuli of any sort and in drug addiction, substances of abuse (e.g., amphetamine) increase dopamine release in a protracted and less regulated manner as compared to typical stimuli, resulting in synaptic plasticity, and altered functioning of this circuit over time.</p>
<p>For our analysis we used large gambling task dataset that includes 500 participants available for download from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http:www.osf.io/65x4v/">www.osf.io/65x4v/</ext-link>.

Traditional methods have the option for “clustering” regions of activation <italic>post-hoc</italic> into their general class of techniques called “bootstrapping” or “permutation inference”. Cluster post-detection of an activation is incommensurate with our view of the estimation process wherein the clustering in space-time is a key component indicator of high-probability regions of space-time. Spatially and temporally coherent patterns maybe of low amplitude with apparent low significance by traditional means, but those intensities are within a mode that contains very high significance in cortical regions (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig.9</xref>) which is predicted by the WETCOW model. Thus the entire SPECTRE mode, including the somewhat diffuse lower intensity regions, is significant.</p>

<title>5 Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The ultimate goal of functional neuroimaging is to non-invasively detect and quantify the spatial and temporal variations in brain activity. Functional MRI (fMRI) and EEG have emerged as the most ubiquitous methods because they offer two important and complementary outcomes. fMRI can non-invasively detect complex spatial and relatively low frequency temporal patterns of activity related to local BOLD changes while EEG can directly detect electrical activity but without the capability of accurate spatial localization.</p>
<p>Ideally, one would measure the electrical activity of the brain at high temporal resolution, as done by EEG, but with the spatial localization capabilities of fMRI. However, there has been a long-standing belief that this is not possible, due to the ‘volume-conductance’ problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). In this paper we have shown that this is not an actual physical limitation, as it is always presented, but an artificial constraint stemming from model for how electromagnetic wave propagate within the brain that is overly simplified by neglecting local tissue anisotropy and inhomogeneity. Our recently developed WETCOW model incorporates these tissue characteristics into the electromagnetic field equations (i.e., Maxwell’s equations), which predicts the existence of previously undiscovered waves generated precisely as a consequence of the tissue anisotropy and inhomogeity. Unlike standard electromagnetic waves characterized by a frequencies <italic>w</italic> that are proportional to their spatial frequency (or wavenumber) <italic>k</italic>, (i.e., <italic>w ~ k</italic>) the WETCOW waves have an inverse relationship <italic>w</italic> ~ 1/<italic>k</italic>. This results in waves that can permeate throughout the brain, not necessarily along neuronal pathways, that are in precisely the spatial and temporal (frequency) range of observed brain electrical activity. This model provides the physical model upon which the SPECTRE is based, using tissue models derived from standard high resolution anatomical MRI data to reconstruct the modes of brain electrical activity throughout the entire brain volume.</p>
<p>The SPECTRE reconstruction of EEG data provides obvious significant advantages over fMRI in temporal resolution, since EEG data has very high intrinsic temporal resolution (~ 1<italic>ms</italic>) necessary to capture rapidly varying electric field variations. Moreover, the SPECTRE algorithm can specify what frequency ranges to interrogate, providing a highly flexible analysis framework for focussed investigation of particular frequency bands of interest. On the contrary, even rapid fMRI acquisition is intrinsically limited by the temporal evolution of the contrast mechanism, the BOLD signal, which is related to blood flow and thus of quite low frequency (~ 1<italic>Hz</italic>).</p>
<p>While the advantages of SPECTRE over fMRI in temporal resolution are clear, what is perhaps surprising is its advantages in <italic>spatial</italic> resolution. The inverse solution that estimates the electric field potential from the EEG data is based on a physical model of wave propagation from tissues whose composition and geometry are derived from high resolution anatomical MRI data. The final resolution of the SPECTRE electric field modes is that of the anatomical data which is typically significantly higher (~ .5 – 1<italic>mm</italic>)) than the resolution of an fMRI image (~ 2<italic>mm</italic>). (There are, of course, limitations depending on the number of electrodes in the EEG system.)</p>
<p>But it is also important to recognize that the question of resolution in fMRI is not just a question of the prescribed image resolution of the acquisition. The BOLD physical mechanism that generates the fMRI contrast is a subtle variation in the magnetic susceptibility which causes variations in the local magnetic field, that in turn alters the local signal. fMRI acquisitions are specifically designed to accentuate this effect in order to make is observable. Unfortunately, local magnetic field variations unrelated to the BOLD mechanism, in particular strong magnetic susceptibility variations due to air/tissue boundaries such as those in the sinus cavities, cause severe non-linear image distortions that effectively alter the location and shape of the affected image volume elements (voxels). This makes even the definition of ‘resolution’ problematic, as it is essentially a spatially non-linearly varying function. Such effects are absent from EEG, which is simply a set of receiving electrodes (albeit not without its own source of artifacts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The SPECTRE reconstruction uses high resolution MRI data acquired with techniques specifically designed to be insensitive to these magnetic susceptibility distortions and thus of very high spatial fidelity.</p>
<p>In this paper, we have successfully validated the SPECTRE method using simultaneous fMRI/EEG experiments. The results not only affirmed SPECTRE’s capability to accurately reconstruct spatial distributions of neural activity from EEG data, in alignment with the concurrently acquired fMRI data, but also revealed its efficacy in identifying robust activations across subjects that were not detectable with fMRI alone. These findings underscore SPECTRE’s potential to significantly enhance the sensitivity and scope of neuroimaging analyses. Further validation was performed using intra-cranial EEG measurements from an epilepsy study with reconstruction of data from a subset of sensors on the surface of the brain were shown to be consistent with the reconstruction from all the sensors, including those directly next to the activity source. The application of SPECTRE to high resolution EEG data during a gambling task demonstrated its ability to reconstruct a well-known and important brain circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) that has previously only been detected using fMRI. The analysis revealed significant differences in the brain networks in the alpha range 8–12<italic>Hz</italic>, consistent with previous spatially resolved fMRI experiments but the analysis is easily carried out in any user-defined frequency ranges of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), which will be the subject of future work. The SPECTRE methodology is applicable to any EEG study and thus holds promise for a wide range of ongoing studies of basic neuroscience of reward mechanisms and in clinical applications such as addiction.</p>
<p>The implications for spatially resolved EEG are important not only from a scientific perspective, but from a practical perspective as well. fMRI is a much more involved and expensive procedure, requiring highly trained research or clinical applications specialists in specially designed facilities, and subjecting the subjects to a much more claustrophobic and restricted environment, with the safety concerns always present in MRI imaging experiments. On the contrary, the portability, safety, and relative ease of EEG experiments, which can be carried out in a standard research or clinical office, makes it very attractive. The high spatial and temporal resolution capabilities provided by SPECTRE to standard EEG data offer the possibility of more detailed investigations of brain activity in a wide range of both basic research and clinical settings. This method also has important implications for the democratization of medicine worldwide where there are many populations for which advanced technologies such as fMRI are prohibitive because of cost, citing issues for large specialized equipment, and lack of highly trained personnel.</p>

<title>6.1.1 Solution to the inverse EEG problem</title>
<p>Our method for solving the inverse EEG problem can be summarized as follows. Given a standard EEG dataset from <italic>N</italic> electrodes and a high-resolution anatomical (HRA) MRI dataset with high contrast between gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), the solution to the inverse EEG problem can be formulated as an approximation for the volumetric distribution of electrostatic potential inside the complex inhomogeneous and anisotropic tissues and complicated morphology of the MRI domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). A general form of this approximation is based on Maxwell’s equations in an anisotropic and inhomogeneous medium expressed as charge continuity. This is used to derive the frequency dependent electrostatic field potential ϕ that is dependent upon the electrical properties of the tissue permittivity, permeability, and conductivity. These parameters can be estimated from the HRA data. In the Fourier (i.e., frequency) domain, the electrostatic potential satisfies the equation

<p>SPECTRE is flexible in its ability to incorporate relevant prior information from MRI data. HRA data is useful for tissue segmentation and assignment of mean values for permittivity and conductivity. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) data further allows construction of estimates of the conductivity tensor anisotropy. In the present study, only HRA data were used for the estimation procedure. One important practical point is that very often HRA data are not acquired for participants in EEG studies. In this case it is sufficient to use HRA data from a standard atlas, and spatially register the EEG data to the atlas. Indeed, this was case in the present paper, where the standard 2mm, 1mm, and 0.7mm resolution T1-weighted anatomical MRI Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) atlases were used, to which the EEG data were aligned using our non-linear registration algorithm SYMREG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>).</p>

<title>6.1.2 Mode reconstruction</title>
<p>The reconstructed volumetric time series of the estimated electrostatic potential field can be thought of as similar to the EM equivalent of an fMRI dataset, containing a multitude of correlated spatiotemporal patterns or “modes” of the system.</p>
<p>The problem then becomes one of detecting the multiple modes in complex non-linear systems. We have addressed this problem previously in our development of the <italic>entropy field decomposition</italic> (EFD) method, which is a probabilistic framework for estimating spatial-temporal modes of complex non-linear systems containing multivariate interacting fields. It is formally based on a field-theoretic mathematical formulation of Bayes’ Theorem that enables the hierarchy of multiple orders of field interactions including coupling between fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Its practical utility is enabled by incorporation of the theory of entropy spectrum pathways (ESP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), which uses the space-time correlations in each individual dataset to automatically select the very limited number of highly relevant field interactions. In short, it selects the configurations with maximum path entropy, summarized in the equilibrium (i.e., long time) distribution μ<sup>*</sup>.</p>
<p>Our terminology is as follows (see Section 6.1.3 details). The <italic>k</italic>’th EFD mode of the coupled parameters <italic><bold>α</bold></italic> = {<italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub>,…, <italic>α<sub>m</sub></italic>} is denoted <inline-formula id="ID18">

<p>A strength of the EFD method is that it uses prior information contained in individual datasets - there are no training datasets or averages across datasets - just the prior information contained within the single dataset of interest. This method has shown utility in resting state fMRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) and in meteorology in the application to severe local storms, in particular tornadic supercells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). The fact that this method uses prior information embedded within single datasets without the need for any ‘training’ is of significance to clinical studies in which important individual variations can be lost in the averaging process. It is also particularly important in the current paper where our validation necessitates comparison with single subject studies.</p>

<title>6.2 Comparison with functional MRI</title>
<p>Functional MRI (fMRI) has become the <italic>de facto</italic> neuroimaging method for spatial and temporal localization of brain activity. The contrast mechanism that forms the basis of fMRI is the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) variations in the magnetic state of hemoglobin and its influence on the local MRI signal as a function of the local metabolism and hemodynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Consequently, the spatial and temporal characteristics of the fMRI signal are related to blood flow and metabolic dynamics, rather than direct measures of electrical activity. In particular, the signal variations will be spatially localized in vascular pathways and the temporal variations, being related to blood flow effects, are very slow compared to electrical activity. In short, the spatial-temporal dynamics measured by fMRI need not (and, in fact, will not) correspond exactly to the spatial-temporal patterns of electrical activity. Numerous experimental realities also make fMRI problematic as a gold standard. In particular, fMRI is facilitated by enhancing the sensitivity of MRI to the BOLD contrast mechanism, which requires enhancing the sensitivity to local magnetic field variations through the use of T<sub>2</sub>-weighted pulse sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>) which lead to increased geometric distortions, compromising not only spatial resolution but confounding the spatial localization of the activity in a complex, non-linear fashion. Gross distortions can lead to significantly reduced signal-to-noise and even completely unrecoverable signal loss, particularly in regions near air/tissue interfaces, such as in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Moreover, the complex non-linear interactions between the magnetic fields and physiological variations such as respiration and cardiac pulsations produce a variety of complex spatiotemporal signal distortions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). While mitigating these artifacts is an area of very active research, they remain a serious problem for fMRI.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, certain very simple task-based fMRI experimental paradigms, such as finger tapping or rapidly flickering checkerboard stimuli, repeated at periodic on/off intervals, have been established as experiments that produce repeatable robust activations in known brain networks, and are commonly used as basic testbeds for assessment of analysis algorithms. When combined with simultaneous EEG acquisition, such experiments provide two different types of data that can be compared as a form of validation, with the proviso that these two methods are imaging different physical quantities.</p>

<sec id="s10-3">
<title>6.3 Comparison with state-of-the-art Source Localization methods</title>
<p>There is a long history of attempts to spatially localize EEG activity and these are generally called “source localization” methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). These methods are fundamentally different from the SPECTRE approach as they involve numerous stringent assumptions about brain electrical activity such as a fixed set of static dipole sources, an idealized geometric model of the head reduced to a few (typically 3) shells, that spatially close points are more likely synchronized, and the smoothness of the solution. (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>) and references therein).</p>
<p>These methods all implicitly assume the “quasi-static” approximation to the EM field equation which entails ignoring the time dependent terms in Maxwell’s equations, which are dependent on tissue conductivity properties which are themselves frequency dependent. The resulting solutions are therefore static, have no frequency dependence, and are insensitive to the detailed spatially variable electrical properties of the tissues. However, as discussed in detail in the development of the WETCOW model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), these assumptions are incompatible with the basic physics of brain electrical activity. The SPECTRE approach is to employ the WETCOW model and solve the actual physical problem of the complete Maxwell’s equations in an inhomogeneous and anisotropic medium. The WETCOW theory provides a comprehensive framework for characterizing the propagation of EM fields through the complex brain tissue microstructure and larger scale morphology (e.g., cortical folding), and provides the dynamic solution to the electric potential field necessary to solve the EEG inverse problem.</p>
<p>The pseudo-spectral computational approach used in SPECTRE has some important advantages over the finite/boundary element approaches typically used for electrostatic modeling of brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). It does not use surface meshes and so does not require limiting the location of sources to a small number of surfaces with fixed number of static dipole sources constrained to the surfaces. And the distribution of both electrostatic and geometric properties of the media (conductivity, permittivity, anisotropy, inhomogeneity - derived from the MRI data) are incorporated at every location throughout the volume. It is thus able to find a time dependent spatial distribution of the electrostatic potential at every space-time location of a multidimensional volume as a superposition of source inputs from every voxel of the same volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). These traits allow it to model wave-like signal propagation inside the volume and can detect and characterize significantly more complex dynamical behavior of the sources of the electrostatic activity recorded at the sensor locations than traditional methods.</p>
<p>To understand intuitively why SPECTRE is capable of reconstructing EM activity through the entire brain, including deep within subcortical structures, a simple idealized example is helpful. Consider two point current sources of different frequencies, one in the cortical layer close to the scalp, the second deep within the subcortical structures of the brain. Consider a single sensor placed on the scalp collinear with the two sources. Standard source localization methods will not see the deep source, since there is no frequency dependence, and the signal falloff is simply a function of the distance from the sensor. Therefore, the close source completely dominates the signal model. Since all tomographic imaging methods (e.g., MRI, CT, etc.) depend strongly on both the spatial and temporal sampling of the measured physical system, this effective invisibility of currents in the standard quasi-static model essentially precludes the solution of the true inverse EEG problem and necessitates the artificial construction of assumed dipole distribution on pre-chosen artificial internal structures. In contrast, in SPECTRE the sources are not dipoles, but frequency sources that extend throughout the entire brain volume subject to the boundary conditions imposed by both the tissues geometry and its spatially and frequency dependent properties. The surface electrodes are assumed to be sensing EM waves emanating from the entire brain across a broad frequency spectrum limited only by the sensors. Used in conjunction with an HRA MRI data that provides the spatial distribution of the frequencydependent tissue electrical properties that constrain the possible solution, SPECTRE can invert the wave equations to provide an estimate of the spatiotemporal distribution of the electric field potential.</p>
<p>The problem of spatially localizating the EEG signal involves estimating the most probable distribution of electric field amplitudes given an array of sensors. This is essentially a problem of correctly modeling the physics of how electromagnetic waves propagate through the complex environment of a the convoluted brain tissue morphology and the anisotropic and inhomogeneous nature of brain tissue. The current state-of-the-art approach to this problem, called ‘source localization’ such as <italic>low resolution electromagnetic tomography</italic> or LORETA algorithm with its many variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), also called ‘EEG source imaging’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>)) involves using a pre-defined brain atlas, arbitrarily placing dipole source on the surface, and calculating the contribution from these sources. Some methods propose using fMRI as a prior, which has the disadvantage of requiring fMRI acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>). The current source localization methods are based on a static model for the electric field caused by a fixed set of pre-defined dipole sources. (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) for a review of current methods). This model is inherently limited because in reality the brain’s electrical field variations are time dependent and generated by an essentially continuous distribution of sources throught the entire brain. This description is the essence of the WETCOW theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) which describes how highly coherent localized electric field phenomena, such as cortical wave loops and synchronized spiking, are produced by the complex non-linear interactions of waves across multiple spatial and temporal scales. In a typical application of the SPECTRE method, we use MNI volumetric grid with 2mm (902629 voxels), 1mm (7221032 voxels), or 0.73mm (11393280 voxels). All voxels in our models are considered sources of electromagnetic activity consistent with the local intravoxel tissue characteristics (via (1)) rather than an assumed dipolar form. In an attempt to compare SPECTRE with current state-of-the-art source localization method, we downloaded the currently available LoretaKey1 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), which uses a set of 6239 fixed dipoles. In order to make a fair comparison, we tried to use LoretaKey1 with a number of dipoles comparable to our 2mm number of voxels. We found that LoretaKey1 is not able to handle this size due to “out-of-memory” crashes. We scaled down the number of dipoles in 2, 4 , 10 and 20 times. Only with around 45K dipoles were we able to make Loreta run. It ran for approximately 24 hours, but then again crashed due to out-of-memory problems. Our processing with 2mm, requires around 650Mb of memory. At this point it was decided that it was not possible for Loreta to provide a result that would usefully inform the efficacy of the SPECTRE method. Our highest 0.73 resolution processing can be completed on a modern workstation taking 16–20Gb of memory in a matter of minutes.</p>

<title>Simultaneous EEG/fMRI acquisition:</title>
<p>Functional and structural MRI images were acquired on a Siemens 3T TIM-Trio scanner (NKI Center for Biomedical Imaging and Neuromodulation) equipped with a 32-channel phased array head coil. Structural T1 and T2 scans were collected using standard sequences. Whole-brain BOLD data was acquired with a gradient-echo EPI sequence (TR=2000ms;TE=30ms;flip angle=80°). EEG data were acquired concurrently with fMRI using an MR compatible EEG amplifier (BrainVision MR series, Brain Products, Munich, Germany) and a 64-channel MR-compatible ring electrode cap with 10–20 International System electrode placement cap. EEG data was sampled at a rate of 5 KHz EEG data were acquired at a rate of 5 KHz using BrainVision Recorder software (Brain Products). Electrocardiographic data were captured from electrodes on the backs of subjects. The reference electrode was positioned between Fz and Cz. Scanner and heartbeat artifacts were removed offline from the EEG signal using an average template subtraction procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>) and the data was resampled to 250Hz.</p>

<title>Traditional EEG analysis:</title>
<p>The single-trial EEG signal from each electrode was convolved with a 3-cycle Morlet wavelet computed over a 3 second window centered at the onset of each stimulus and averaged separately for each stimulus type. The averaged spectral amplitude at each time point was then baseline corrected by subtracting the mean spectral amplitude over the -200 to -50 pre-stimulus interval. Further details of post-processing and time-frequency analyses methods are described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>).</p>

<title>Task and Design Acquisition</title>
<p>Participants completed a simple gambling task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). On each trial, they saw a black fixation cross for 500 ms, followed by two colored squares for 500 ms, and then, the fixation cross turned gray (go cue) and participants were to select one of the two squares (square locations—left, right—were randomized on each trial) within a 2,000 ms time limit. They were then presented with a black fixation cross for 300 to 500 ms, and then, simple feedback as to their performance (“WIN” for gain, “LOSE” for loss) for 1,000 ms in black font. If the participants responded before the go cue they were instead delivered “TOO FAST” feedback and if they did not respond before the 2,000 ms time limit, it would be considered a loss. The goal of the participants was to accumulate wins by determining which of the two squares would more often lead to gains (60% vs. 10%). In this task, participants accumulated wins; however, were not paid money. They would see the same pair of colors for one block of 20 trials. They conducted six blocks of unique color pairs.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Five hundred undergraduate students were included and were recruited via the University of Victoria psychology participant pool (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) for details). The data was collected until 500 participants became available that were not characterized by one of the following a priori criteria: trial count after artifact rejection were less than 15 per condition, total artifact rejection exceeded 40% of trials rejected, FCz (electrode of interest) specific artifact rejection exceeded 40% of trials rejected, or independent component analysis based blink correction failed. These criteria were extremely strict to ensure clean data in the analyses, and as such a total of 637 participants were analyzed before reaching the goal of 500 clean participants. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and volunteered to take part in the experiment for extra course credit in a psychology course. All participants provided informed consent approved by the University of Victoria’s Human Research Ethics Board.</p>

<title>Data Acquisition and Preprocessing</title>
<p>EEG data were recorded from either a 64 or 32 electrode (Ag/AgCl) EEG system (ActiCAP, Brain Products, GmbH, Munich, Germany) using Brain Vision Recorder (Version 1.21.0004, Brain Products GmbH, Munich, Germany). During recording, electrodes were referenced to a common ground, impedances were kept below 20 kQ on average, data were sampled at 500 Hz, and an antialiasing low-pass filter of 245 Hz was applied via an ActiCHamp amplifier (Revision 2, Brain Products GmbH, Munich, Germany). Stimuli and EEG markers were temporally synced using a DataPixx stimulus synchronization unit (VPixx, Vision Science Solutions, Quebec, Canada)</p>
<p>Data were re-referenced to an average mastoid reference and filtered using a 0.1 to 30 Hz passband (Butterworth, order 4) and a 60 Hz notch filter. Correction for eye blinks was performed using EEGLAB’s independent component analysis (ICA). Components reflective of blinks were manually identified and removed via topographic maps and component loadings, and data were reconstructed. Data were then segmented from -500 to 1,500<italic>ms</italic> relative to feedback stimulus onset, baseline corrected using a -200 to 0<italic>ms</italic> window, and run through artifact rejection with 10<italic>μV/ms</italic> gradient and 100/<italic>μV</italic> maximum-minimum criteria. Data were pre-processed to identify noisy or damaged electrodes using artifact rejection trial removal rates for each electrode.</p>
<p>The 1 second of recorded sequence for each “WIN” or “LOSE” event were extracted from recordings for each participants (with 22 ms of pre-event sample and 488 ms of post-event sample) and combined together to form separate winning and loosing datasets. Each of those datasets were processed using SPECTRE to construct the approximate inverse solution for the potential ϕ across an entire 2 mm MNI brain volume.</p>

<p>This paper proposes a new source reconstruction method for electroencephalography (EEG) data and claims that it can provide far superior spatial resolution than existing approaches and even superior spatial resolution to fMRI. This primarily stems from abandoning the established quasi-static approximation to Maxwell's equations. If verified, the potential impact of the proposed method is very high indeed, but it is currently impossible to verify because the clarity of presentation and the evidence for the claims in the current version is <bold>inadequate</bold>.</p>

<p>The paper proposes a new source reconstruction method for electroencephalography (EEG) data and claims that it can provide far superior spatial resolution than existing approaches and also superior spatial resolution to fMRI. This primarily stems from abandoning the established quasi-static approximation to Maxwell's equations.</p>
<p>The proposed method brings together some very interesting ideas, and the potential impact is high. However, the work does not provide the evaluations expected when validating a new source reconstruction approach. I cannot judge the success or impact of the approach based on the current set of results. This is very important to rectify, especially given that the work is challenging some long-standing and fundamental assumptions made in the field.</p>
<p>I also find that the clarity of the description of the methods, and how they link to what is shown in the main results hard to follow.</p>
<p>I am insufficiently familiar with the intricacies of Maxwell's equations to assess the validity of the assumptions and the equations being used by WETCOW. The work therefore needs assessing by someone more versed in that area. That said, how do we know that the new terms in Maxwell's equations, i.e. the time-dependent terms that are normally missing from established quasi-static-based approaches, are large enough to need to be considered? Where is the evidence for this?</p>
<p>I have not come across EFD, and I am not sure many in the EEG field will have. To require the reader to appreciate the contributions of WETCOW only through the lens of the unfamiliar (and far from trivial) approach of EFD is frustrating. In particular, what impact do the assumptions of WETCOW make compared to the assumptions of EFD on the overall performance of SPECTRE?</p>
<p>The paper needs to provide results showing the improvements obtained when WETCOW or EFD are combined with more established and familiar approaches. For example, EFD can be replaced by a first-order vector autoregressive (VAR) model, i.e. y_t = A y_{t-1} + e_t (where y_t is [num_gridpoints x 1] and A is [num_gridpoints x num_gridpoints] of autoregressive parameters).</p>
<p>The authors' decision not to include any comparisons with established source reconstruction approaches does not make sense to me. They attempt to justify this by saying that the spatial resolution of LORETA would need to be very low compared to the resolution being used in SPECTRE, to avoid compute problems. But how does this stop them from using a spatial resolution typically used by the field that has no compute problems, and comparing with that? This would be very informative. There are also more computationally efficient methods than LORETA that are very popular, such as beamforming or minimum norm.</p>
<p>In short, something like the following methods needs to be compared:</p>
<p>(1) Full SPECTRE (EFD plus WETCOW)</p>
<p>
(2) WETCOW + VAR or standard (&quot;simple regression&quot;) techniques</p>
<p>
(3) Beamformer/min norm plus EFD</p>
<p>
(4) Beamformer/min norm plus VAR or standard (&quot;simple regression&quot;) techniques</p>
<p>This would also allow for more illuminating and quantitative comparisons of the real data. For example, a metric of similarity between EEG maps and fMRI can be computed to compare the performance of these methods. At the moment, the fMRI-EEG analysis amounts to just showing fairly similar maps.</p>
<p>There are no results provided on simulated data. Simulations are needed to provide quantitative comparisons of the different methods, to show face validity, and to demonstrate unequivocally the new information that SPECTRE can _potentially_ provide on real data compared to established methods. The paper ideally needs at least 3 types of simulations, where one thing is changed at a time, e.g.:</p>
<p>(1) Data simulated using WETCOW plus EFD assumptions</p>
<p>
(2) Data simulated using WETCOW plus e.g. VAR assumptions</p>
<p>
(3) Data simulated using standard lead fields (based on the quasi-static Maxwell solutions) plus e.g. VAR assumptions</p>
<p>These should be assessed with the multiple methods specified earlier. Crucially the assessment should be quantitative showing the ability to recover the ground truth over multiple realisations of realistic noise. This type of assessment of a new source reconstruction method is the expected standard.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript claims to present a novel method for direct imaging of electric field networks from EEG data with higher spatiotemporal resolution than even fMRI. Validation of the EEG reconstructions with EEG/FMRI, EEG, and iEEG datasets are presented. Subsequently, reconstructions from a large EEG dataset of subjects performing a gambling task are presented.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>If true and convincing, the proposed theoretical framework and reconstruction algorithm can revolutionize the use of EEG source reconstructions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There is very little actual information in the paper about either the forward model or the novel method of reconstruction. Only citations to prior work by the authors are cited with absolutely no benchmark comparisons, making the manuscript difficult to read and interpret in isolation from their prior body of work.</p>
