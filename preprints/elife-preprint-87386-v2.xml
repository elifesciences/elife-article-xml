<title>Abstract</title><p>Many cellular processes are regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Pathogens can regulate eukaryotic proteolysis through the delivery of proteins with de-ubiquitinating (DUB) activities. The obligate intracellular pathogen <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> secretes Cdu1 (ChlaDUB1), a dual deubiquitinase and Lys-acetyltransferase, that promotes Golgi remodeling and survival of infected host cells presumably by regulating the ubiquitination of host and bacterial proteins. Here we determined that Cdu1’s acetylase but not its DUB activity is important to protect Cdu1 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. We further identified three <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> proteins on the pathogen-containing vacuole (InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480) that required Cdu1‘s acetylase activity for protection from degradation and determined that Cdu1 and these Cdu1-protected proteins are required for optimal egress of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> from host cells. These findings highlight a non-canonical mechanism of pathogen-mediated protection of virulence factors from degradation after their delivery into host cells and the coordinated regulation of secreted effector proteins.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ubiquitination is a conserved and ubiquitous post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins involving the conjugation of the carboxy-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin (Ub) to lysine residues of target proteins. Poly-ubiquitination of substrates involves further conjugation of a Ub internal lysine residue or amino-terminal methionine (M1) with a second Ub molecule. Seven internal lysines in Ub (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, K63) and M1 are utilized by Ub conjugating enzymes to form homogeneous, branched, or mixed poly-ubiquitin (polyUb) chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Komander and Rape., 2012</xref>). PolyUb chains with different linkage types exhibit distinct structures and functions. For example, K48- and K11-linked polyUb chains exhibit a compact conformation and are substrates for 26S proteasome-mediated degradation (Varadan et al., 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tenno et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Eddins et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bremm et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Saeki., 2017</xref>). In contrast, K63-linked polyUb conjugates adopt more open conformations that enable the recruitment of multiprotein complexes that regulate the function of the target protein by proteolytic independent events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Komander et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Weeks et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Datta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Komander and Rape., 2012</xref>). Mixed and branched polyUb chains are also emerging as important regulators of physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Swatek and Komander., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Ohtake and Tsuchiya., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Protein ubiquitination regulates numerous eukaryotic cell processes including protein degradation, signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, selective autophagy, the DNA damage response, and programmed cell death. Ub also plays key roles in modulating host innate immune responses to bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Li et al., 2016</xref>), bacterial proteins, pathogen-containing vacuoles, and bacteria themselves by targeting them for Ub-mediated degradation by proteasomal or autophagic machineries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Because the Ub system is critical for pathogen containment, many pathogens have evolved mechanisms to counteract the impact of this PTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Vozandychova et al., 2021</xref>). For instance, bacterial deubiquitinases (DUBs) can remove Ub from ubiquitinated substrates thereby dampening inflammatory and cell-autonomous defense mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kubori et al., 2019</xref>). Many DUBs are cysteine proteases with a catalytic Cys, a nearby His and an Asn/Asp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Komander et al., 2009a</xref>). DUBs are typically dedicated to the removal of Ub moieties and are unable to hydrolyze other Ub-like (Ubl) modifications such as SUMO or NEDD8. However, the CE clan of Ubl proteases (ULPs) can catalyze the removal of both SUMO and NEDD8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Ronau et al., 2016</xref>). Bacterial pathogens also encode CE clan enzymes that function as DUBs, ULPs or both. For instance, <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium SseL<italic>, Escherichia coli</italic> ElaD, and <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> ShiCE function as Ub specific proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Rytkönen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Catic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pruneda et al., 2016</xref>) while RickCE from <italic>Rickettsia belli</italic> functions as a protease directed towards both Ub and NEDD8 as does SidE from <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> which displays mixed activities towards Ub, NEDD8, and ISG15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sheedlo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pruneda et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, XopD from <italic>Xanthamonas campestris</italic> and LotB from <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> are isopeptidases exhibiting cross reactivity towards both Ub and SUMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pruneda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Schubert et al., 2020</xref>). Some CE clan bacterial effectors display acetyltransferase activity. <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> LegCE, <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium AvrA, and YopJ from <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> function exclusively as acetyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mittal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mukherjee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pruneda et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (Ct) effector Cdu1/<italic>Chla</italic>DUB1 is a CE clan protein that exhibits both acetyltransferase and deubiquitinating activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Misaghi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pruneda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pruneda et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Ct is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen responsible for human diseases of significant clinical and public health importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Haggerty et al., 2010</xref>). Ct has a biphasic developmental cycle in which the Ct infectious propagule or elementary body (EB) invades the target host cell. Upon internalization the EB transitions to the reticulate body (RB). RBs replicate by binary fission within a pathogenic vacuole (“inclusion”) and asynchronously differentiate back to EBs. In cell culture, starting at around 48 hours-post infection (hpi) Ct will egress after lysis of the host cell or by a process termed extrusion, wherein the intact inclusion exits from the infected cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Moulder., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdelrahman and Belland., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hybiske and Stephens., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). The effector Cdu1 was originally identified as a deneddylating and deubiquitinating enzyme and subsequently shown to exhibit <italic>in-vitro</italic> isopeptidase activity towards both Lys48 and Lys63 linked di-Ub substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Misaghi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Claessen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pruneda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>). Cdu1 is unique among CE clan enzymes in that it also functions as a bona fide lysine acetylase with both is acetylase and DUB activities catalyzed by the same catalytic active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pruneda et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, Cdu1 autoacetylation is directed towards lysines unlike other CE clan acetylases that predominantly target serine and threonine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pruneda et al., 2018</xref>). In transfected cells, Cdu1 protects the NFκB cytoplasmic retention factor IκBα from ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Le Negrate et al., 2008</xref>). In infected cells, Cdu1 localizes to the inclusion membrane where it functions to stabilize the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and to promote the repositioning of Golgi ministacks around the Ct inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pruneda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kunz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Auer et al., 2020</xref>). However, the mechanism by which Cdu1 promotes redeployment of Golgi ministacks and any additional roles that Cdu1 may play during Ct infection of epithelial cells remains unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, we show that Cdu1 protects itself and three secreted Ct effectors, InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480 from targeted ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480 are members of a larger family of bacterial proteins embedded within the inclusion membrane (Inc proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bannantine et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Rockey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alzhanov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dehoux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lutter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lutter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kokes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Weber et al., 2015</xref>). We show that Cdu1-mediated protection from degradation is independent from its DUB activity but relies upon its Lys acetylase activity. We show that Cdu1 protects InaC to promote repositioning of Golgi ministacks and formation of actin scaffolds around the Ct inclusion, and CTL0480 to promote recruitment of myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1) to the inclusion. In addition, we determined that Cdu1 and Cdu1-protected Incs are required for optimal extrusion of inclusions from host cells at the late stages of infection.</p>

<title>The <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> inclusion membrane proteins InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480 are differentially ubiquitinated in the absence of Cdu1</title>
<p>Cdu1 is required for Golgi repositioning around the Ct inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pruneda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Auer et al., 2020</xref>). To understand how Cdu1 promotes Golgi redistribution, we first generated a <italic>cdu1</italic> null strain in a Ct L2 background by TargeTron mediated insertional mutagenesis (pDFTT3-<italic>aadA</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lowden et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S. Figure 1</xref>). Loss of Cdu1 expression in the resulting L2 <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII <italic>aadA</italic> (<italic>cdu1</italic>::GII) strain was verified by western blot analysis and by indirect immunofluorescence with antibodies raised against Cdu1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S. Figures 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Because <italic>cdu2</italic> resides directly downstream of the <italic>cdu1</italic> locus and encodes a second Ct DUB (Cdu2/<italic>Chla</italic>DUB2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Misaghi et al., 2006</xref>), we first determined whether the disruption of <italic>cdu1</italic> impacted the expression of <italic>cdu2</italic>. We detected <italic>cdu1</italic> and <italic>cdu2</italic> transcripts in HeLa cells infected with Ct L2 but not for the juncture between <italic>cdu1</italic> and <italic>cdu2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S. Figure 2C</xref>). In cells infected with Ct <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII we only detected <italic>cdu2</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S. Figure 2C</xref>) confirming that <italic>cdu1</italic> and <italic>cdu2</italic> are not co-expressed as part of an operon in accordance with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Albrecht et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In transfected Hela cells, Cdu1’s DUB activity has been linked to fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pruneda et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that Cdu1s’ DUB activity in infected cells promoted Golgi redistribution around inclusions and that we could identify potential targets by comparing the protein ubiquitination profile of cells infected with WT or <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII strains by quantitative mass spectrometry (MS). HeLa cell were mock infected or infected with either WT L2 or <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII strains. At 24 hpi, poly-ubiquitinated proteins were enriched from lysed cells using Tandem Ubiquitin Binding Entities (TUBEs) (LifeSensors). TUBEs consist of concatenated Ub binding associated domains (UBAs) that bind to polyUb-modified proteins with nanomolar affinities. Poly-ubiquitinated proteins of both human and Ct origin were enriched and identified by quantitative LC-MS/MS analysis.</p>
<p>Over 2,000 non-ubiquitinated proteins co-precipitated with TUBE 1 bound proteins across all three conditions (mock, L2, and <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII infected HeLa cells) and 3 biological replicates (S. Table 1). Among these, 47 human proteins were significantly enriched in mock infected HeLa cells and 50 human proteins were significantly enriched during Ct infection (L2 and <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII) (S. Table 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S. Figure 3</xref>) Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that proteins involved in RNA metabolism were overrepresented among co-precipitating proteins from mock infected cells (S. Table 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S.

We also identified 8 TUBE1 co-precipitating Ct proteins in HeLa cells infected with L2 and <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII (S. Table 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S. Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>TUBE 1 affinity capture lead to the identification of 43 ubiquitinated proteins (35 human proteins and 8 Ct proteins across all 3 conditions and replicates) based on the presence of peptides containing a di-glycine remnant motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Peng et al., 2003</xref>) (S. Tables 6-8). The lack of widespread poly-ubiquitination of either human or Ct proteins in response to Ct infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) was surprising given that wholesale changes in protein ubiquitination has been reported during infection of HeLa cells by intracellular pathogens like <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fiskin et al., 2016</xref>). It is also possible that had we conducted our analysis at different time points post-infection (hpi), we might have identified additional Cdu1 targets, such as Mcl1 and IκBα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Le Negrate et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>) which were not identified in our analysis. However, given that we observed Cdu1 at the inclusion membrane as early as 1 hpi (data not shown), we opted to focus on an earlier stage of the infection cycle. Only two human ubiquitinated proteins (ZC3H7A and DDIT4) were found to be significantly enriched in response to WT L2 infection at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>, S.

In contrast three Ct proteins, InaC (K104, K107, and K149), IpaM (K29), and CTL0480 (K115) were ubiquitinated at Lys residues in the absence of Cdu1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1D</xref>, S.

<p>InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480 are Ct effector proteins that localize to the inclusion membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alzhanov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lutter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kokes et al., 2015</xref>). These Type 3 secretion substrates belong to a family of over 36 inclusion membrane proteins (Incs) that contain a signature bi-lobal hydrophobic transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bannantine et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Rockey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dehoux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lutter et al., 2012</xref>). Incs provide many functions important for Ct intracellular replication ranging from providing structural integrity to the inclusion membrane, to regulating membrane trafficking, to mediating interactions with host organelles and cytoskeletal structures (reviewed in Bugalhão et al., 2019). InaC facilitates the activation of the small GTPase RhoA, a crucial step for the assembly of actin scaffolds around the inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Haines et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kumar and Valdivia., 2008</xref>). Additionally, InaC plays a pivotal role in the activation of Arf GTPases. This activation subsequently induces post-translational modifications of microtubules in close proximity to the inclusion membrane, which are essential for Ct to initiate the repositioning of Golgi ministacks around the inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wesolowski et al., 2017</xref>). IpaM exhibits localization to discrete patches in the inclusion termed microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alzhanov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dumoux et al., 2015</xref>). Upon ectopic expression, IpaM induces alterations in microtubule organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dumoux et al., 2015</xref>). CTL0480, facilitates the recruitment of MYPT1 (myosin phosphatase target subunit 1) to the inclusion membrane. Recrutiment of MYPT1 is required for the efficient exit of Ct from host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lutter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Shaw et al., 2018</xref>). Because Cdu1 also localizes to the inclusion membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pruneda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kunz et al., 2019</xref>) we postulated that Cdu1 directly protects InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480 from ubiquitination.</p>

<title>Cdu1 associates with InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480</title>
<p>We first determined if Cdu1 co-localized with InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480 at the inclusion membrane. HeLa cells were infected for 24 hours with WT L2 or L2 expressing CTL0480-Flag from its endogenous promoter and immunostained with antibodies against Cdu1, InaC, IpaM, or the Flag epitope. Both InaC and CTL0480-Flag localized throughout the inclusion membrane while IpaM was restricted to discrete microdomains as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alzhanov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dumoux et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).

<p>We next determined if Cdu1 can interact with InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480 by co-transfecting HEK 293 cells with vectors expressing either full length Cdu1-GFP or truncated versions of Cdu1-GFP lacking transmembrane or catalytic domains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), and vectors expressing Flag-InaC, V5-IpaM, and V5-CTL0480. Transfected cells were lysed and Cdu1-GFP was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against GFP. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates showed that Flag-InaC, V5-IpaM, and V5-CTL0480 co-precipitated with Cdu1-GFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">F</xref>). Moreover, the transmembrane domain of Cdu1 was necessary for Cdu1-GFP to interact with all three Incs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">F</xref>). The interaction between Cdu1-GFP and the three tagged Incs was specific since we did not detect interactions between Cdu1-GFP and a V5-tagged version of the inclusion membrane protein CpoS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Sixt et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). We expected these interactions to be transient at the inclusion membrane as the engagement of Cdu1 with its target(s) should mimic that of most enzymes with their substrates. Therefore, while we could capture these complexes in co-immunoprecipitations in the context of overexpression, this assay was not sensitive enough to reliably document the formation of complexes among low abundance endogenous Ct proteins. Nevertheless, our findings from transfection experiments lead us to conclude that Cdu1 can selectively interact with all three Incs even in the absence of infection, and these interactions are facilitated by the transmembrane domain of Cdu1.</p>

<title>Cdu1 protects InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480 proteins from degradation during infection</title>
<p>We next assessed if Cdu1 was required to stabilize endogenous InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480 in infected cells. HeLa cells were infected with either WT L2 or <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII strains and at various time points in the Ct infectious cycle crude cell lysates were analyzed by western blot to assess the relative abundance of Inc proteins. At 36 and 48 hpi, the levels of InaC protein were found to be undetectable in cells infected with <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII in comparison to cells infected with the WT L2 strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>).

We were not able to detect CTL0480 levels by western blot but were successful in following CTL0480 expression by indirect immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). The relative abundance of CTL0480 at inclusion membranes was not affected in <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII inclusions at 24 hpi. However, at 36 hpi, a subpopulation of cells lost CTL0480 immunoreactivity and by 48 hpi, inclusion membranes of the <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII strain were devoid of CTL0480 while CTL0480 was prominently detected at the inclusion membranes of WT L2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>). As controls for the specificity of antibodies used for western blots and for indirect immunofluorescence, we included cells infected with Ct lacking <italic>ipaM (ipaM</italic>::GII, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Meier et al., 2022</xref>), with an <italic>inaC</italic> nonsense mutant (M407, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kokes et al., 2015</xref>), and with Ct lacking <italic>ctl0480</italic> (<italic>ctl0480</italic>::GII, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Shaw et al., 2018</xref>). Overall, our results indicate that steady state protein levels of InaC and IpaM and CTL0480 localization at the inclusion membrane, especially at late stages of infection, are dependent on Cdu1, and that Cdu1 acts at different stages in the infection cycle.</p>

<title>The acetylase activity of Cdu1 is required for Cdu1 to protect itself, InaC, and IpaM from polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation</title>
<p>The crystal structures of Cdu1 bound to Ub or Coenzyme A indicated that the adenosine and phosphate groups of Coenzyme A make contact with a helix in variable region 3 (VR-3) of Cdu1 while the Ile36-patch of Ub binds to the opposite face of the same helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pruneda et al., 2018</xref>). Although Cdu1 catalyzes both of its DUB and acetylase (Act) activities with the same active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pruneda et al., 2018</xref>) the two activities of Cdu1 can be uncoupled by the amino acid substitution K268E in VR-3 which disrupts Coenzyme A binding required for Act activity and by the amino acid substitution I225A in the Ub-binding region of VR-3 required for DUB activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pruneda et al., 2018</xref>). These substitutions allowed us to test which of Cdu1’s enzymatic functions are required for the observed effects on protein stability. We generated Ct shuttle plasmids, expressing WT Cdu1, a catalytically inactive variant of Cdu1 lacking both DUB and Act activities (Cdu1<sup>C345A</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pruneda et al., 2018</xref>), a Cdu1 DUB-deficient variant (Cdu1<sup>I225A</sup>), and a Cdu1 Act-deficient variant (Cdu1<sup>K268E</sup>). All Cdu1 constructs were expressed from the <italic>cdu1</italic> endogenous promoter as 3X Flag epitope-tagged proteins.</p>
<p>Plasmids expressing each Cdu1 variant were transformed into the <italic>cdu</italic>1::GII mutant and the resulting strains used to infect HeLa cells for 36 and 48 hours. The levels of endogenous InaC and IpaM in cell extracts of infected cells were monitored by western blot analysis. At 36 hpi, InaC protein levels drastically decreased in cells infected with <italic>cdu1</italic> null strains transformed with empty vector or expressing the catalytic inactive variant of Cdu1 (Cdu1<sup>C345A</sup>-Flag) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

<p>When we monitored the stability of each Flag-tagged Cdu1 variant, we observed that the catalytically inactive variant of Cdu1 (C345A-Flag) was destabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>-Flag WB). We reasoned that Cdu1 also protects itself from being targeted for degradation in infected cells. As with InaC and IpaM, the acetylase but not the DUB activity of Cdu1 was required for Cdu1’s stability (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Although the C345A (DUB-, Act-) and K268E (Act-) amino acid substitutions in Cdu1 do not destabilize Cdu1 expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pruneda et al., 2018</xref>), it was possible that these substitutions impacted the expression and/or folding of Cdu1 in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. To determine if these Cdu1 mutants were inherently unstable, we expressed Cdu1<sup>C345A</sup>-Flag and Cdu1<sup>K268E</sup>-Flag in WT L2 in the presence of endogenous Cdu1. We found that each Flag-tagged variant was stabilized (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that endogenous Cdu1 protected the catalytically-deficient Cdu1 variants <italic>in trans</italic>. In addition, western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated Cdu1-Flag and Cdu1<sup>C345A</sup>-Flag expressed in a <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII mutant showed that while WT Cdu1-Flag was not modified by Lys48-linked poly-ubiquitination, Cdu1<sup>C345A</sup>-Flag was robustly modified by Lys48-linked polyUb in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Moreover, endogenous Cdu1 protected Cdu1<sup>C345A</sup>-Flag from Lys48-linked polyUb when Cdu1<sup>C345A</sup>-Flag was expressed in a wild type L2 background (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). These results indicate that the loss of Cdu1 activity likely leads to its Lys48-linked poly-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation.</p>
<p>Because Cdu1 autoacetylates itself and its Act activity is directed towards lysines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pruneda et al., 2018</xref>) we postulated that Cdu1 may stabilize proteins from degradation by acetylating lysine residues that are potential targets of ubiquitination. We tested this hypothesis by assessing whether Cdu1, InaC, CTL0480, and IpaM are acetylated at lysines during infection. Fractions enriched for inclusion membranes were isolated by sub-cellular fractionation from HeLa cells infected with wild-type L2 (24 hpi), and proteins acetylated at lysines were immunoprecipitated. Western blot analysis of acetyl-lysine immunoprecipitates indicated that InaC and IpaM, but not the Inc protein IncA, were acetylated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Western blot analysis of anti-acetyl-lysine immunoprecipitates of inclusion membrane-enriched membrane fractions of HeLa cells infected with L2 expressing Cdu1-Flag (24 hpi), CTL0480-Flag (40 hpi), and IpaM-Flag (40 hpi) also showed that all three Flag tagged effectors were acetylated at lysines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). We also determined that Flag-tagged InaC expressed in an <italic>inaC</italic> null (M407) background was acetylated at lysines as determined by western blot analysis of anti-acetyl-lysine immunoprecipitates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). In addition, we identified acetylated forms of Cdu1 from mass spectrometric analysis of Flag immunoprecipitates derived from extracts of HeLa cells infected with L2 expressing Cdu1-Flag, (24 hpi) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>).</p>

<p>We reasoned that the lysine acetylase activity of Cdu1 is a prominent mechanism by which Cdu1 protects client proteins (at 24 hpi), since loss of Cdu1 or expression of the acetylase deficient variant of Cdu1 (Cdu1<sup>K268E</sup>-Flag) leads to a marked increase in Ub immunostaining at or near the periphery of <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII inclusions (&gt; 80% of inclusions) compared to HeLa cells infected with <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII strains complemented with wild type or DUB deficient (I225A-Flag) Cdu1 strains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supplemental Figure 6A</xref>). Given that Cdu1 appears to localize exclusively at inclusion membranes we predicted that its activity would be spatially restricted to the inclusion periphery. We tested this premise by co-infecting HeLa cells with an <italic>incA</italic> null strain (M923 (IncA<sup>R197*</sup>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kokes et al., 2015</xref>) and the <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII strain. IncA mediates homotypic fusion of inclusion membranes and loss of IncA results in the accumulation of multiple unfused inclusions in cells infected at high MOIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hackstadt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Suchland et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Pannekoek et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). As expected, <italic>incA</italic> mutants which retain Cdu1 activity did not accumulate Ub at or near the periphery of inclusion membranes.

<p>Recently, the Ct inclusion membrane protein GarD was identified as a Ct effector that shields Ct from γ-interferon mediated ubiquitination by the IFNγ-inducible human ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF213 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Walsh et al., 2022</xref>). Because Cdu1 also protects the Ct inclusion from ubiquitination, we tested if Cdu1 also plays a role in protecting Ct from IFNγ-induced cell immunity. A549 cells were pretreated with IFNγ (100 U/mL) and infected with WT Ct, <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII, or <italic>garD</italic>::GII strains. Infections with a <italic>garD</italic>::GII strain led to an approximate 90% decrease in the number of inclusions formed relative to infections with its parental WT Ct strain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>) while infections with a <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII or its parental WT Ct strain showed a modest reduction in inclusion formation (approximately 26% and 12% respectively) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). These results suggest that Cdu1 likely does not play a role in protecting Ct from IFNγ-mediated cellular immunity.</p>
<p>We also tested whether RNF213 localizes to inclusions that lack Cdu1, as observed in IFNγ-primed A549 cells infected with <italic>garD:</italic>:GII strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Walsh et al., 2022</xref>). RNF213 did not localize to Ct inclusions when cells were infected with either WT Ct or <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII strains, regardless of whether or not the A549 cells were treated with IFNγ (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5F</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>). In contrast, RNF213 localized to approximately 37% of inclusions in cells infected with <italic>garD</italic>::GII mutants of unprimed A549 cells, and 81% in IFNγ treated cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5F</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>). Based on these results, we conclude that Cdu1 does not play a role in protecting Ct from IFNγ-induced antimicrobial activity.</p>

<p>We next quantified Golgi dispersal in infected HeLa cells at 24 hpi, a process that is also dependent on InaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kokes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wesolowski et al., 2017</xref>). In Hela cells infected with an <italic>inaC</italic> null strain (M407) Golgi dispersal was limited to approximately 26% of the Ct inclusion perimeter. In contrast, cells infected with either its parental WT L2 or with an <italic>inaC</italic> null strain (M407) complemented with wild type InaC, the Golgi is dispersed around 45% of the inclusion perimeter (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>, and Supplmental <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Similarly, Golgi dispersal around inclusions during infection with WT L2 and in <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII mutants expressing wild type Cdu1-Flag or Cdu1<sup>I225A</sup>-Flag (DUB-) was approximately 43%, 41%, and 43% respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>, and Supplmental <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).

<title>Cdu1, InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480 are required for optimal extrusion of Ct from host cells</title>
<p>In the absence of Cdu1, the levels of InaC, CTL0480, and IpaM decreased late in infection (36 hpi and 48 hpi, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) suggesting that a prominent role of Cdu1 is to protect these Incs from degradation late in infection. At the end of its developmental cycle, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> exits host cells by promoting cellular lysis or by extrusion of intact inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hybiske and Stephens., 2007</xref>). Ct host cell exit by extrusion is an active process requiring a remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and the function of Inc proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hybiske and Stephens., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lutter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Shaw et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>). CTL0480 recruits MYPT1 (an inhibitor of Myosin II motor complexes) to the inclusion membrane which prevents premature extrusion of Ct inclusions and loss of CTL0480 leads to increased rates of extrusion by Ct from infected HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lutter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Shaw et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Actin polymerization is also required for Ct extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hybiske and Stephens., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chin et al., 2012</xref>) suggesting that InaC dependent recruitment of F-actin to the inclusion may also contribute to optimal Ct extrusion. IpaM localizes to microdomains in the inclusion membrane that are proposed to function as foci for extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>). Based on these observations, we postulated that Cdu1-mediated protection of CTL0480, InaC, and IpaM regulates the extrusion of Ct inclusions. We quantified the number of extrusions released from infected HeLa cells at 52 hpi and observed a 60% reduction in the number of extrusions in HeLa cells infected with the <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII strain relative to cells infected with WT L2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). Complementation of <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII with either wild type Cdu1-Flag or Cdu1<sup>I225A</sup>-Flag (DUB-) restored extrusion production to near wild type levels. In contrast, HeLa cells infected with <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII mutants expressing Cdu1<sup>K268E</sup>-Flag (Act-), or <italic>inaC</italic> (<italic>inaC</italic>::GII, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wesolowski et al., 2017</xref>) and <italic>ipaM</italic> (<italic>ipaM</italic>::GII, Meier et al., 2020) null strains led to a 42%, 75%, and 58% reduction in extrusion production respectively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). The decrease in the number of extruded inclusions by these strains was not attributed to defects in inclusion biogenesis as they produced a comparable number of inclusions at 48 hpi relative to cells infected with WT L2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Supplemental Figure 9</xref>). Consequently, we infer that InaC, IpaM, and Cdu1 collectively contribute to the promotion of optimal extrusion of Ct inclusions from host cells, with Cdu1 playing a central regulatory role by protecting these effectors from degradation.</p>

Therefore, even though the Cdu1-mediated protection of InaC and IpaM is important for the extrusion of inclusions and <italic>cdu1</italic> mutants phenocopy the loss of InaC and IpaM, the phenotypic similarities do not extend to the increased number of extruded inclusions observed in cells infected with the <italic>ctl0480</italic>::GII mutant strain (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several <italic>Chlamydia</italic> Inc proteins regulate interactions between the pathogenic vacuole and the host cytoskeleton, organelles, and vesicular trafficking pathways. These Inc proteins also modulate host cell death programs and promote <italic>Chlamydia</italic> exit from host cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bugalhão and Mota., 2019</xref>). Given the central roles that Incs play in promoting <italic>Chlamydia</italic> intracellular infection, it is not surprising that they are targeted for inactivation by host cellular defenses. In response, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> has evolved mechanisms to protect Incs. In this study we show that the acetylase activity of the effector Cdu1 protects itself and three Inc proteins; InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480, from ubiquitination and degradation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Interestingly, all three Inc proteins play prominent roles in regulating the extrusion of inclusions from host cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Observations that the encapsulation of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> within an extruded inclusion enhances survival of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> within macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zuck et al., 2017</xref>) together with the broad conservation of extrusion as an exit strategy among <italic>Chlamydia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zuck et al., 2016</xref>) suggests that this mechanism is important for <italic>Chlamydia</italic> pathogenesis. Notably, a <italic>cdu1</italic> mutant strain (<italic>cdu1</italic>::Tn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>) displays reduced bacterial loads in a murine model of upper genital tract infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>). While neither this strain nor our <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII mutant strain shows evident growth impairments during infection of Hela cells (data not shown), the observed reduction in bacterial load in the absence of Cdu1 in animal models of infection could potentially stem from defects in extrusion production or from perturbations in Cdu1-dependent regulation of extrusion size. Thus, targeting Inc proteins that regulate extrusion for Ub-mediated destruction may be advantageous for the host. For instance, targeting InaC for degradation would limit F-actin dependent extrusions (Hybiske and Stephens., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chin et al., 2012</xref>) and InaC-dependent microtubule scaffolds around the inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wesolowski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Haines et al., 2021</xref>). CTL0480 functions as an inhibitor of extrusions through its role in modulating the activity of myosin light chain 2 (MLC<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lutter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Shaw et al., 2018</xref>). IpaM localizes to specialized microdomains in the inclusion membrane which are also sites of enrichment for over 9 inclusion membrane proteins including Ctl0480 and MrcA, both of which are required for <italic>Chlamydia</italic> extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Mital et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lutter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>). We also find that the loss of IpaM shifted the size distribution of extrusions towards larger inclusions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). We speculate that heterogeneity in the size of extrusions might facilitate uptake of some extrusions by innate immune cells at infected mucosal sites to promote <italic>Chlamydia</italic> LGV dissemination to distal sites in the genital tract and avoid clearance of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> by other immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zuck et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>A model for acetylation mediated protection of the Inc proteins InaC, IpaM, and Ctl0480 from degradation.</title>
<p>The cellular Ub machinery targets <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> effectors, including the Inc proteins InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480 for ubiquitination and subsequent protein degradation. <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> counters such defense mechanisms by translocating Cdu1 which protect itself and all three Inc proteins from being targeted for ubiquitination and degradation through its acetylase activity. Cdu1 protects InaC and enables the recruitment of F-actin scaffolds and Golgi ministacks to the inclusion perimeter and CTL0480 to recruit the Myosin II regulator MYPT1. All three inclusion proteins and Cdu1 promote extrusion and dissemination of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> inclusions late in infection.

<p>Effectors that modulate the activity of other translocated effectors are referred to as “metaeffectors”, a term coined by Kubori and colleagues after observing that the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effector LubX which functions as an E3 ligase, ubiquitinates the translocated effector SidH leading to its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kubori et al., 2010</xref>). Several other effector-metaeffector interactions have been described in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, and <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> which regulate the activity of other effectors either directly or indirectly by modifying the same host target or cellular process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kubori et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Neunuebel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jeong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Urbanus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Iyer and Das., 2021</xref>). In this context we propose that Cdu1 functions as a metaeffector in Ct to protect multiple effectors. We also observed that Cdu1 interactions with InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480 likely occur independently from each other and that the kinetics of degradation in the absence of Cdu1 varies for each Inc (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings indicate that the DUB activity of Cdu1 was not required to protect InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480 from ubiquitination. Instead we find that Cdu1’s lysine acetylase activity is required to protect these Inc proteins and Cdu1 itself from ubiquitination. Indeed, we found that all three Incs and Cdu1 are acetylated at lysines in infected cells. However, we were unable to determine if lysine acetylation in all four proteins was dependent on Cdu1s’ Act activity or if these PTMs are protective. Why the DUB activity of Cdu1 is unable to compensate for loss of its Act activity remains unknown. It is possible that Cdu1, like other DUBs, is regulated by PTMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Komander et al., 2009a</xref>). For instance, phosphorylation of human CYLD inhibits its DUB activity towards TRAF2 while phosphorylation of human USP8 inhibits its DUB activity toward EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Reiley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>). Mass spectrometry analysis of immunoprecipitated Flag tagged Cdu1 expressed in Ct revealed that Cdu1 is phosphorylated at multiple serine and threonine residues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>) as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zadora et al., 2019</xref>). We identified three PX(S/T)P MAPK phosphorylation consensus sequence motifs in the proline rich domain (PRD) of Cdu1, suggesting that MAPKs may regulate the DUB activity of Cdu1.</p>
<p>Cdu1 homologs are found in multiple <italic>Chlamydia</italic> species including <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, <italic>C. muridarum</italic>, <italic>C. suis</italic>, <italic>C. psitacci</italic>, <italic>C. abortus</italic>, <italic>C. caviae</italic>, and <italic>C. felis</italic> but is notably absent in the genomes of <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>C. pecorum</italic>. The acquisition of a second deubiquitinase paralog (Cdu2) has also occurred in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, <italic>C. muridarum</italic>, and <italic>C. suis</italic>. In the genomes of all three species, <italic>cdu2</italic> resides directly adjacent to <italic>cdu1</italic>; an arrangement that presumptively arose from a gene duplication event. Cdu2 is a dedicated ULP with deubiquitinating and deneddylating activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Misaghi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pruneda et al., 2016</xref>). New evidence suggest that both paralogues might not be functionally redundant. The crystal structure of Cdu2 has revealed differences in residues involved in substrate recognition between Cdu1 and Cdu2 and that each paralog might recognize polyUb chains differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hausman et al., 2020</xref>). The processivity rates for removal of terminal Ub from polyUb chains also differs between both isopeptidases with Cdu2 exhibiting limited trimming of polyUb as compared to Cdu1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hausman et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, Cdu2 lacks the proline rich domain found in Cdu1 which might be important for regulation of Cdu1 enzymatic activity. The presence of Cdu2 might also explain the low incidence of human and Ct proteins that were differentially ubiquitinated in the absence of Cdu1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Whereas several <italic>Chlamydia</italic> species have acquired either one or two deubiquitinase paralogs, both <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>C. pecorum</italic> have not. Instead, both species have acquired an unrelated deubiquitinase (<italic>Chla</italic>OTU) belonging to the OTU family of proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Makarova et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Furtado et al., 2013</xref>). Curiously, <italic>Chla</italic>OTU is also found in <italic>C. psitacci</italic>, <italic>C. abortus</italic>, <italic>C. caviae</italic>, and <italic>C. felis</italic> all of which encode only Cdu1 and is absent in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>muridarum</italic>, and <italic>C. suis</italic>, all of which encode Cdu1 and Cdu2. It is noteworthy that <italic>Chlamydi</italic>a species have independently acquired deubiquitinases multiple times (Cdu1, Cdu2, <italic>Chla</italic>OTU) and that some of these deubiquitinases have evolved into moonlighting enzymes reflecting the diverse strategies adopted by pathogenic <italic>Chlamydia</italic> as they adapt to their particular niche.</p>

<title>TUBE1 based global ubiquitin profiling</title>
<p>Confluent HeLa cell monolayers (5.04 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/infection) were mock infected or separately infected with WT LGV L2 434 Bu or a L2 <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII <italic>aadA</italic> strain at MOIs of 3. At 24 hpi cells were collected and spun down (700 x <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes), frozen at -80°C and shipped on dry ice to LifeSensors (Malvern, PA) for quantitative TUBE1-based Mass Spectrometry Analysis. Cell pellets from three independent biological replicates were sent to LifeSensors for analysis. Cell were subsequently lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, 1% Sodium Deoxycholate) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail, the DUB inhibitor PR-619 (Sigma-Aldrich; SML0430), and the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 (Sigma-Aldrich; 474791). Lysates were clarified by high-speed centrifugation (14,000 x <italic>g</italic>, 10 minutes, 4°C) and supernatants containing 5 mg of protein were equilibrated with magnetic TUBE-1 (LifeSensors; UM401M) and incubated overnight at 4°C under rotation.</p>
<p>TUBEs were isolated with a magnetic stand and washed sequentially with PBST and TUBE wash buffer. Poly-ubiquitinated and associated proteins were eluted with TUBE elution buffer. Eluted supernatants were neutralized with neutralization buffer and loaded onto SDS-gels and run until SDS buffer reached 0.5 cm into the gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and lanes excised, reduced with TCEP, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with Trypsin (Trypsin Gold, Mass Spectrometry Grade) (Promega; V5280). Tryptic digests were analyzed using a 150 min LC run on a Thermo Scientific<sup>TM</sup> Q Exactive HF Orbitrap<sup>TM</sup> LC-MS/MS system. MS data was searched against the UniProt human database (UniProt; Proteome ID: UP000005640) and the <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> L2 434 Bu reference database (NCBI:txid47472) using MaxQuant 1.6.2.3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.maxquant.org">https://www.maxquant.org</ext-link>). Proteins, peptides, and site identification was set to a false discovery rate of 1%. N-terminal acetylation, Met oxidation, and diGly remnant on lysine residues was also identified. All peptides and proteins identified can be found in S. Table 1. The intensities (sum of all peptide MS peak areas for a protein or ubiquitinated peptide) for each protein and ubiquitinated peptide across all three biological replicates were used to determine mean intensities and to calculate <italic>p</italic>-values based on one-way student t-tests.

<title>Inhibitors, antibodies, western blots, and densitometry analysis</title>
<p>MG-132 (25 μM) (Sigma-Aldrich; 474791) was added to infected cell monolayers 5 hours prior to extract preparations. Recombinant Cdu1 protein (LGV L2 434 Bu, amino acids 71-401) was generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pruneda et al., 2018</xref>) and kindly provided by Jonathan Pruneda (Oregon Health and Science University, OR). Recombinant Cdu1 protein was used to generate antibodies in immunized New Zealand White rabbits. Cdu1 antisera was pre-adsorbed with crude cell extracts from HeLa cells infected with a <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII <italic>aadA</italic> strain. Pre-adsorbed antisera was used for western blot analysis at a 1:500 dilution in a solution containing 5% BSA supplemented with crude extracts from HeLa cells infected with a <italic>cdu1</italic>::GII <italic>aadA</italic> strain (0.1mg/mL total protein). Antibodies, antibody dilutions, and antibody diluents used in this study are listed in S. Table 9. For western blot analysis, lysates from infected HeLa cell monolayers (2.4 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells) were prepared by incubating cell monolayers with boiling hot 1% SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5). Lysates were collected, briefly sonicated, and total protein concentration measured with a DC<sup>TM</sup> Protein Assay Kit (BIO-RAD; 5000111). 8 μg (Slc1 and alpha Tubulin blots) and 25 μg of total protein lysates (all other blots) were loaded onto 4-15% Mini-PROTEAN and TGX Stain Free<sup>TM</sup> Protein Gels (BIO-RAD; 4568084), transferred to PVDF membranes (BIO-RAD; 1620177), blocked with 5% Milk/TBSt, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Protein signals were detected with Goat anti mouse (H+L) IgG (ThermoFisher scientific; 31430) or Goat anti rabbit (H+L) IgG HRP (ThermoFisher scientific; 31460) conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000 in 5% Milk/TBSt) and SuperSignal West Femto HRP substrate (ThermoFisher scientific; 34096). Antibody bound membranes were imaged with a LI-COR Odyssey Fc Imager (LI-COR, Inc.). Varying amounts of protein extracts were used to determine the linear range of detection for InaC, IpaM, and Slc1 antibodies prior to quantification of western blot images (data not shown). Protein bands were quantified using western blot densitometry analysis with LI-COR Image Studio Software (LI-COR, Inc.). InaC and IpaM densitometry measurments were normalized to corresponding Slc1 densitometry measurments.</p>

<p>HeLa cells were grown on coverslips to 50% confluency (0.1 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells) and infected at MOIs of 0.6. At indicated times, infected cells were separately fixed with ice cold Methanol or with warm PBS containing 4% formaldehyde for 20 minutes. After fixative removal, cells were washed with PBS and formaldehyde fixed cells were incubated either in 5% BSA/PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 or in 5% BSA/PBS supplemented with 0.05% Saponin for 30 minutes with gentle rocking. Following washing with PBS, Methanol fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 5% BSA/PBS and formaldehyde fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 5% BSA/PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 or 0.05% Saponin for 1 hour with gentle rocking. Dilutions for each antibody used can be found in S. Table 9. Methanol fixed cells were washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in 5% BSA/PBS and supplemented with Hoechst 33342 (2 μg/mL) (ThermoFisher Scientific; H3570). Formaldehyde fixed cells were washed and incubated with 5% BSA/PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 and Hoechst or 0.05% Saponin and Hoechst for 1 hour protected from light and with gentle rocking. For detection of F-actin, Phalloidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor<sup>TM</sup> 488 (1:5000) (Act-Stain 488 Phalloidin; Cytoskeleton Inc.; PHDG1) was added for the last 20 minutes of incubation with the secondary antibodies. Coverslips were transferred to glass slides, mounted with 10 μL of Vectashield (Vector Labs; H-1000) and incubated over night at room temperature prior to imaging. Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse (H+L) IgG (ThermoFisher scientific; A-11001 and A-21235) and goat anti-rabbit (H+L) IgG (ThermoFisher scientific; A-11008 and A-21244) conjugated to Alexa Fluor<sup>TM</sup> 488 and Alexa Fluor<sup>TM</sup> 647. All of the antibodies used for indirect immunofluorescence analysis were analyzed under all three staining conditions (Methanol, Formaldehyde/Triton X-100, and Formaldehyde/Saponin).</p>
<p>Quantitative immunofluorescent microscopy for RNF213 was performed as previously described (Walsh et. al., 2022). Briefly, A549 cells were grown on coverslips in 24-well plates to full confluency (∼2 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells). Cells were infected with indicated <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> strains at an MOI of 2. At 3 hours post-infection, all cells were given fresh DMEM supplemented with L-tryptophan (100 µg/mL) with half of the wells given interferon-gamma (100U/mL; Millipore, IF005). At 24 hours post-infection, cells were fixed with cold, 4% PFA in PBS for 20 minutes. Cells were permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 1 minute and blocked in PBS containing 5% BSA and 2.2% glycine for 30 minutes. Antibody incubations and microscope slide mounting was performed as described. Samples were blinded using tape and imaged on a Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 epifluorescent microscope. For each sample, at least 6 separate fields of view and 100 <italic>Chlamydia</italic> inclusions were captured, saved and further blinded using the ImageJ Blind Analysis Tool plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/plugins/blind-analysis-tools">https://imagej.net/plugins/blind-analysis-tools</ext-link>). Quantification of the number of inclusions with RNF213 targeted to the inclusion membrane was performed using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). Targeted inclusions were scored as having the indicated protein signal colocalize with &gt;50% of the inclusion membrane signal (incA positive antibody staining).</p>
<p>Representative images were acquired with an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss 880) equipped with an Airyscan detector (Hamamatsu) and with diode (405 nm), argon ion (488 nm), double solid-state (561 nm) and helium-neon (633) lasers. Images were acquired with a 63x C-Apochromatic NA 1.2 oil-objective (Zeiss). Images acquired in Airyscan mode were deconvoluted using automatic Airyscan processing in Zen software (Zeiss). Image acquisition was performed at the Light Microscopy Core Facility at Duke University. Images used for quantification were captured in an inverted microscope (Ti2-Nikon instruments) equipped with an ORCA Flash 4.0 V3 sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu) and a SOLA solid-state white light illuminator (Lumencro). Images were acquired using a 60x Plan Apochromatic NA 1.40 oil objective. All images were opened with ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) and only linear adjustments were made to fluorescence intensity for the entire image.

<title>Vector construction and <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> transformation</title>
<p><italic>Constructs used in co-transfection experiments:</italic> Mammalian vectors expressing Cdu1-GFP constructs were kindly provided by Jonathan Pruneda (Oregon Health and Science University, OR). Briefly, geneblocks encoding full length Cdu1 (LGV L2 434 Bu, CTL0247) (amino acids 1-401), Cdu1 lacking its transmembrane domain (amino acids 71-401), and Cdu1 lacking its catalytic domain (amino acids 1-130) were generated and inserted into the pOPIN-GFP vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berrow et al., 2007</xref>) by In-Fusion<sup>TM</sup> cloning (Takara Bio; 638947), resulting in Cdu1 constructs with a C-terminal eGFP-His tag preceded by a 3C protease cleavage site. The Flag-InaC mammalian expression vector was derived from a Gateway<sup>TM</sup> entry clone containing the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> Serovar D/UW-3/CX CT813 (<italic>inaC</italic>) ORF (amino acids 41-264) obtained from a <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> ORFeome library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Roan et al., 2006</xref>). The entry vector was used as a donor plasmid for Gateway<sup>TM</sup> based transfer into a modified pcDNA<sup>TM</sup> DEST53 (ThermoFisher Scientific; 12288015) vector in which the cycle 3 <italic>GFP</italic> ORF was removed. A NEB Q5<sup>®</sup>-Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs; E0554S) was used to introduce a 3X Flag epitope tag at the N-terminus of the CT813 ORF and a stop codon at the end of the CT813 ORF. L2 <italic>ipaM</italic> (CTL0476), L2 CTL0480, and L2 <italic>cpoS</italic> (CTL0481) ORFs were PCR amplified from cell lysates derived from Vero cells infected with wild type L2 LGV 434 Bu with primers containing attB sequences (primers <italic>ipaM</italic> forward, <italic>ipaM</italic> reverse, CTL0480 forward, CTL0480 reverse, <italic>cpoS</italic> forward, and <italic>cpoS</italic> reverse). Primer sequences can be found in the S. Table 10. PCR amplicons were used as donors for Gateway<sup>TM</sup> BP Clonase<sup>TM</sup> based transfers into the donor vector pDONR<sup>TM</sup>221 (ThermoFisher Scientific; 12536017) to generate entry plasmids. Entry plasmids were used to transfer <italic>ipaM</italic>, CTL0480, and <italic>cpoS</italic> into the Gateway<sup>TM</sup> destination vector pcDNA<sup>TM</sup>3.1/nV5-DEST (ThermoFisher Scientific; 12290010) by Gateway<sup>TM</sup> LR Clonase<sup>TM</sup> based reactions.

<p><italic>pBOMB4-MCI based plasmids</italic>. CTL0480 and <italic>ipaM</italic> ORFs were amplified by PCR from cell extracts derived from Vero cells infected with wild type LGV L2 434 Bu. The CTL0480 ORF, 149 b.p of upstream sequence, and a 3X FLAG epitope was amplified by PCR using primers RBP628 and RBP629. The CTL0476 (<italic>ipaM</italic>) ORF, 400 b.p of upstream sequence, and a 3X FLAG epitope was amplified with primers RBP623 and RBP624. CTL0480 and <italic>ipaM</italic> amplicons were digested with Not1 and Pst1 and cloned into Not1 and Pst1 digested pBOMB4-MCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bauler and Hackstadt., 2014</xref>) to generate pBOMB4-MCI_CTL0480-3X Flag and pBOMB4-MCI_IpaM-3X Flag plasmids respectively. pBOMB4-MCI_Cdu1-3XFlag plasmids were generated by PCR amplification of 175 b.p of genomic sequence directly upstream of the L2 434 Bu CTL0247 (<italic>cdu1</italic>) ORF and the entire <italic>cdu1</italic> ORF tagged with a C-terminal 3X Flag epitope tag (primers RBP460 and RBP461).

Cdu1 catalytic variants were generated with a NEB Q5<sup>®</sup>-Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs; E0554S) using the <italic>cdu1</italic>p-<italic>cdu1</italic>-3X Flag construct cloned into pCR<sup>TM</sup>-Blunt II TOPO<sup>®</sup> as a template and following the manufacturer instructions.</p>
<p>Primers for introducing base pair changes were designed on the NEBaseChanger website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nebasechanger.neb.com">https://nebasechanger.neb.com</ext-link>).

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study combines state-of-the art proteomics and genetic manipulation of <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> to study the function of a chlamydial effector, Cdu1, with deubiquitination and acetylation activities. <bold>Solid</bold> evidence is provided to show that Cdu1 is able to protect itself and three other chlamydial effectors, which are involved in the control of chlamydial egress from host cells, from ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and that this depends on the acetylation activity of Cdu1, but not on its deubiquitination activity. This work will be of interest to microbiologists and cell biologists studying host cell-pathogen interactions.</p>

<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of the C. trachomatis effector Cdu1 on the ubiquitination of proteins in infected host cells and its correlation with the previously identified role of Cdu1 in facilitating Golgi distribution around the Chlamydia inclusion.</p>
<p>To achieve this, the authors created a cdu1-null mutant in C. trachomatis and employed proteomics to analyze ubiquitinated proteins in cells infected with Cdu1-producing and Cdu1-deficient chlamydiae, comparing them to mock-infected cells. The results revealed that, among the proteins specifically ubiquitinated after infection with Cdu1-deficient chlamydiae, three were other C. trachomatis effectors (InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480), members of a large family of Chlamydia effectors (Incs) that insert in the inclusion membrane.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the authors focused on understanding how Cdu1 shields InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480 from ubiquitination and the implications of this protection for the protein levels and functions of these Incs during infection. Data is presented showing that Cdu1 can bind to InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480, and protects these Incs and itself from ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This protective role of Cdu1 is dependent on its acetylation, but not on its deubiquitinating activity. Host cells infected by the cdu1 null mutant displayed defects resembling those observed in cells infected by inaC, ipaM, or ctl0480 null mutants.</p>
<p>Additionally, it was previously established that CTL0480 inhibits a chlamydial egress pathway involving the extrusion of the inclusion. This study now revealed that InaC and IpaM also play a role in promoting the extrusion of C. trachomatis inclusion, and the cdu1 null mutant exhibited a defect in this process. This leads to the title's conclusion that Cdu1 regulates chlamydial exit from host cells by safeguarding specific C. trachomatis effectors from degradation.</p>
<p>In summary, this work is excellent and impressive, both technically and conceptually, providing mechanistic insights into the action of Cdu1. The data provides convincing support for the proposed model, illustrating how the acetylation activity of Cdu1 protects itself and three Incs (InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480) from degradation. While the study indicates that the observed phenotypes in cells infected by the cdu1 null mutant are linked to reduced levels of InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480, these Incs are still detectable in cells infected by the cdu1 null mutant. Even if very unlikely, this leaves room for the possibility that Cdu1 directly promotes assembly of F-actin and Golgi repositioning around the inclusion, MYPT1 recruitment to the inclusion, and extrusion of the inclusion. Nevertheless, the major significance of this work lies in the integration of proteomics and chlamydial genetics to unveil a unique mechanism in which one effector controls the levels of other effectors, emphasizing the intricate relationships among bacterial effectors injected into host cells.</p>

<p>Based on the corresponding author's response, the questions I raised were not addressed for various reasons. This is not necessarily a negative. The authors indicated that most of the points raised will be addressed in a separate manuscript. Specifically, the Cdu1 targeting of IkBa. They mentioned intriguing findings regarding IkBa in cells infected with a cdu1-null strain C. trachomatis in their response to reviewers. Similar to this, there appears to be a planned manuscript that will address the question of the timing of CTL0480's function in inclusion extrusion.</p>
<p>The lack of more direct infection-related evidence of Cdu1 interaction with various type III effectors was raised; and the authors attributed this to technical difficulties and low abundance of starting materials. It was not clear if they tried other approaches to demonstrate interaction.</p>
<p>Another suggestion was the quantitation of the three target effectors of Cdu1 in wild type and cdu1-null background. The authors provided western blot data and immunofluorescence images that revealed potential differences in stability/turnover kinetics. The authors might want to discuss the implications of the different kinetics of stability/turnover. For example, if all three proteins are necessary for optimal extrusion of inclusions, and concertedly act to mediate this process, all three would need to be present at the required levels. Could this be a temporal regulation strategy? Does acetylation also regulate function, interactions, etc.?</p>
<p>In short, the response to some of the questions is forthcoming in the form of follow-up manuscripts. New observations on the different stability profiles could be elaborated in the Discussion section, with a brief discussion on functional and/or regulatory implications.</p>

<p>In this article by Bastidas et al. the authors examine the functions of the Chlamydia deubiquitinating enzyme 1 (Cdu1) during infections of human cells. First, a mutant lacking Cdu1 but not Cdu2 was constructed using targetron and quantitative proteomics was used to identify differences in ubiquitinated proteins (both host and bacterial) during infection. While they found minimal changes in host protein ubiquitination, they identified three Chlamydia effector proteins, IpaM, InaC and CTL0480 were all ubiquitinated in the absence of Cdu1. Microscopy and immunoprecipitations found Cdu1 directly interacts with these Chlamydia effectors and confirmed that Cdu1 mediates the stabilization of these effectors at the inclusion membrane during late infection time points. Surprisingly rather than deubiquitination driving this stabilization, the acetylation function of Cdu1 was required, and acetylation on lysine residues prevented degradative ubiquitination of Cdu1, IpaM, InaC and CTL0480. In line with this observation the authors show that loss of Cdu1 phenocopies the loss of single effector mutants of InaC, IpaM and CTL0480, including golgi stack formation and the recruitment of MYPT1 to the inclusion. The aggregation of changes to the Chlamydia inclusion does not alter growth but controls extrusion of chlamydia from cells with reduced extrusion in Cdu1 mutant Chlamydia infections. The strengths of the manuscript are the range of assays used to convincingly examine the biochemical and cellular biology underlying Cdu1 functions. The finding that acetylation of lysine residues is a mechanisms for bacterial effectors to block degradative ubiqutination is impactful and will open new investigations into this mechanism for many intracellular pathogens. The authors revisions to the manuscript have addressed my primary concerns and the authors present compelling arguments for remaining questions that are outside the scope of this study. Altogether this is an important series of findings that help to understand the mechanisms underpinning Chlamydia pathogenesis using orthologous methods and is an impactful study.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I think the manuscript of this excellent work can be improved, especially in writing (including a suggestion in the title) and presentation (Figure 6); Also some additional specific experiments and analyses could be important, as I suggest below,</p>
<p>1. For the title, perhaps a shorter &quot;The acetylase activity of Cdu1 protects Chlamydia effectors from degradation&quot; would be better to convey the major significance of this work. Of course, Cdu1 must regulate the function of InaC, IpaM and CTL0480. But perhaps it is speculative to think that egress is the major function of these effectors as their activity on other host cell processes during the cycle could eventually impact the extrusion process indirectly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although we concur with the insights provided by reviewer 1, we wish to underscore that a significant breakthrough presented in our study revolves around the regulation of Chlamydia exit by Cdu1. Consequently, we believe that this noteworthy discovery should be incorporated into the title.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. For the writing:</p>
<p>a. The description of ubiquitination and DUBs could be synthesized to the essential, so that space is gained to explain things that then come a bit out of the blue in the results (what are Incs, the specific functions of InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480 - at least place the citations in lines 110-112 next to the corresponding Incs -, Cdu2, etc - see specifics below)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In lines 182-196 of the revised manuscript, we have incorporated additional contextual information concerning the roles of Incs, along with descriptions of the functions of InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b. In the Results, there is a lot of Chlamydia- and maybe lab-specific jargon that could be significantly simplified for the more general reader. I detail some suggestions below in the specific issues.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have improved the readability of our manuscript for a general audience by removing Chlamydia-specific terminology from the entire text and figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. For the figures:</p>
<p>a. Figure 6, this figure could be reorganized: why two graphs in panel D? If detailed quantifications were done, perhaps in panel B just zoom on the examples of Golgi distributed/compacted? And again the labelling Rif-R L2, L2 pBOMB, M407 p2TK2, etc, simplify?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 6 has undergone restructuring. The representative images have been relocated to Supplemental Figures 5 and 6, while we have introduced sample images demonstrating F-actin assembly and Golgi repositioning. Furthermore, the quantification of Golgi dispersal has been streamlined into a single panel. Additionally, we have simplified the labeling of the strains utilized in the study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b. Figure 3, in the labelling, WT, inaC null, cdu1::GII wouldn't be enough? Leave the details to the legend and/or M&amp;M.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have simplified the labeling of Ct strains in Figure 3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>c. Figure 3C, these arrowheads should not be so symmetric (small arrows instead?) and it is unclear that the indicated cells do not show CTL0480.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have substituted arrowheads with small arrow symbols and have also revised the Figure to incorporate a new representative image that prominently illustrates the absence of CTL0480 at the inclusion membrane of some cdu1::GII inclusions within infected Hela cells at 36 hpi.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Experiments:</p>
<p>a. In Figure 7, at least extrusion should be analysed also with the Cdu1-deficient strain expressing Ac-deficient Cdu1 and the inaC and ipaM phenotypes should be complemented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have conducted additional experiments to analyze extrusion production in Hela cells infected with a cdu1 null strain expressing the acetylase-deficient Cdu1 variant. We have incorporated the relevant data into revised Figure 7, where the impact of this strain on extrusion production and size is presented. Additionally, we updated Supplemental Figure 8 to include data illustrating the number of inclusions produced by this strain. We have also addressed these new results in the revised manuscript (lines 424-432). We are currently complementing inaC and ipaM mutant strains with various InaC and IpaM constructs that will be used in a follow up manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b. Does overexpression of InaC, IpaM, or CTL0480 in a cdu1-null background prevent the degradation of these Incs and suppress the defects of cells infected by the cdu1 mutant (F-actin, Golgi, MYPT1)? This would show that the multiple phenotypes displayed by cells infected by the cdu1 null mutant are indeed related to the decreased levels of InaC, IpaM and CTL0480.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We opted not to include data from the overexpression of these effectors in a cdu1-null background due to an unexpected decrease in shuttle plasmid load during overexpression. This development prompted concerns regarding the potential detrimental effects of overexpressing these effectors in the absence of Cdu1. Data supporting this observation are not included in this report.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>c. Figures 3A and 3B should be quantified (it says it is from 3 independent experiments). It would be important to have a relative perspective of how much Cdu1 protects these Incs over time (for InaC, it would also be nice to have the 36 and 48 hpi time-point). This is in contrast with the microscopy data in Figure 5, which illustrates very clear effects, and the quantification is a bit redundant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 3, we have incorporated a new Western Blot image showing endogenous InaC protein levels in Hela cells following infection with both WT Ct and cdu1::GII strains at 24, 36, and 48 hours post-infection (hpi). Additionally, we have quantified the Western Blot signals for both InaC and IpaM, and these results are also presented in Figure 3. The quantification of MYPT1 recruitment has been relocated to a supplementary figure. We have also included details regarding the methodology employed for the quantification of Western Blot signals in the Materials and Methods section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>d. What is the subcellular localization of InaC, IpaM, CTL0480 and Cdu1 when analysed by transfection? Does Cdu1 bind to of InaC, IpaM, CTL0480 in infected cells? If this was attempted and unsuccessful it should be mentioned.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In transfected HEK cells, InaC, IpaM, CTL0480, and Cdu1 all exhibit cytoplasmic localization with a diffuse pattern (data not shown). Despite our efforts, we encountered challenges in observing co-immunoprecipitation of Cdu1 with all three Incs in infected Hela cells at 24 hpi, We have duly acknowledged this limitation in our findings, as reflected in line 221-226 of the revised manuscript.</p>

</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>In lines 140-142 of the revised manuscript, we provide clarification that the DUB activity of Cdu1 is required for Golgi fragmentation in transfected cells.

<p>We have included a discussion on non-ubiquitinated proteins, as they could potentially encompass proteins that interact with those protected by Cdu1. This perspective provides supplementary insights into the roles of proteins targeted for ubiquitination in the absence of Cdu1. The results of this analysis have been succinctly summarized in a single paragraph within the initial manuscript (lines 151-159 of the revised manuscript).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The results depicted in Figure 2, involving truncated Cdu1 proteins, illustrates that Cdu1 is capable of interacting with InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480 even in the absence of infection. This finding serves as evidence suggesting that all three Incs could potentially serve as direct targets for Cdu1 activity. As a result, we prefer to keep these findings in the manuscript.</p>

<p>In the revised Figure 3, we show InaC protein levels at 24, 36, and 48 hours post-infection, and we have incorporated quantitative data for both InaC and IpaM protein levels in the context of Hela cells infected with both WT L2 and cdu1::GII strains.

<p>The findings presented in Figure 5 demonstrate that the acetylase activity of Cdu1 plays a crucial role in enabling Ct to block all ubiquitination events taking place on or in proximity to the periphery of the inclusion membrane.

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Figure 1 describes an affinity-based purification and mass spectrometric identification of differentially ubiquitinated proteins (host and chlamydial). Through different permutations of combinations of infection (mock, wild type, and Cdu1 mutant), three effectors, IpaM, InaC, and CTL0480, were identified as putative targets of Cdu1. The authors used a high-stringency cutoff, which could explain identification of only three targets. Having said this, the localization of Cdu1 to the inclusion membrane would be expected to also narrow down the number of targets. Interestingly, Cdu2, another deubiquitinase remained active in these experiments, which could have affected identification of Cdu1 targets. The authors addressed this issue by referring to previously reported structural studies. A somewhat glaring omission is the lack of reference to NF-kB as a substrate of ChlaDub1/Cdu1. In experiments by Le Negrate et al., ChlaDub1 ectopic overexpression in cells led to the deubiquitination of IkB-alpha, thus inhibiting the nuclear translation of NF-kB. Based on the inclusion membrane localization of Cdu1 during infection, is the identification of IkB an artifact of overexpression of Cdu1, or is it still a bona fide Cdu1 target?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We conducted experiments using our cdu1 null strain to investigate whether IκBα could be a target of Cdu1 activity. While our findings are intriguing and relevant, it is not feasible to determine, at this stage, whether our findings result from a direct or indirect consequence of Cdu1 localizing to the inclusion membrane. Consequently, these findings extend beyond the scope of the current manuscript. We plan to explore the implications of our observations more deeply in a subsequent manuscript, where we intend to provide a more comprehensive and mechanistic analysis based on these preliminary findings. Additionally, we have referenced the potential targeting of IκBα by Cdu1 in lines 100-101 and 166-171 of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 2 demonstrates the individual interaction of the identified effectors with Cdu1. Interaction at the inclusion membrane is inferred from colocalization studies, while protein-protein interaction is monitored using ectopic overexpression of tagged versions of Cdu1 and the individual effectors. This is somewhat of a weakness of the manuscript because the mechanism of action of Cdu1 towards its target hinges on protein-protein interaction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Despite our efforts, we encountered challenges in co-immunoprecipitating endogenous Cdu1 with all three Incs in infected Hela cells at 24 hpi. There are multiple technical reasons as to why these interactions, which are predicted to be transient, will not be captured by bulk affinity approaches such as immunoprecipitations, especially when the starting materials are present in very low abundance. We acknowledged these limitations in our findings, as reflected in lines 221-226 of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 3 provides the first evidence in this paper of the importance of the inferred interaction of Cdu1 with the three effectors. The authors show that the loss of cdu1 has stability consequences on the three effectors. This figure would benefit from quantifying InaC- or IpaM-positive inclusions in the same manner done with CTL0480. The timepoint-dependent effect of Cdu1 loss of function is intriguing. Do InaC and IpaM retention at the inclusion show the same timepoint-dependent characteristic?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revised Figure 3, we have incorporated InaC protein levels at 24, 36, and 48 hours post-infection. Additionally, we have included quantitative data representing both InaC and IpaM protein levels in HeLa cells infected with both WT L2 and cdu1::GII strains. The quantification of CTL0480 localization to cdu1::GII inclusions has been moved to a supplementary figure.</p>
<p>This updated figure illustrates that the absence of Cdu1 has a time-dependent impact on both InaC and IpaM. However, it is noteworthy that the kinetics of degradation for these two proteins diverge significantly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For Figure 7, the authors should consider monitoring timing of inclusion extrusion to gain additional insight into the functional interactions between the effectors. For example, the loss of CTL0480 leads to increased extrusion, implying a role in delaying or suppressing extrusion. In a time-course experiment, a CTL0480 mutant could exhibit an earlier occurrence of inclusion extrusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>One of the principal discoveries of this study is that Cdu1, InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480 collaborate to facilitate optimal extrusion of Ct from host cells. These findings represent a significant contribution to our understanding of how Chlamydia controls its exit from infected cells. We are currently in the process of expanding on these results. A forthcoming follow-up manuscript will provide more detailed and comprehensive exploration of these findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Specific comments.</p>
<p>a. I have some concerns related to the time point chosen for mass spec analysis and potential caveats and alternative interpretations. This work was done relatively early (24 hours) compared to the most convincing Cdu1 functions that occur later, thus this may limit the authors global understanding of protein changes. For example, the known substrate of Cdu1, Mcl-1 was not identified but this is altered relatively late during infection. Thus, the surprise that minimal host proteins are altered in ubiquitination may be partially driven by the timing of the assay. This should be more clearly discussed as a caveat.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revised manuscript (lines 166-171), we have acknowledged that there might be additional targets of Cdu1 that remain unidentified, primarily due to the specific time point we utilized in our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b. Another caveat to these studies is while the loss of Cdu1 alters different effectors stability and function and extrusion size, these changes do not modulate bacterial growth in cells. The authors speculate that regulating extrusion size may alter interactions with innate cells to drive dissemination. However, a previous study found defects in an animal model using a Cdu1 transposon mutant found decreased bacterial load in the genital tract. It is also possible that redundancy of effectors may mask importance in growth of Cdu1, but the authors strongly argue against redundancy of Cdu1 and Cdu2 so this weakens the authors argument here. These concepts and published data should be more directly discussed in the context of the authors proposed extrusion model and the role in driving Chlamydia growth and pathogenesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our revised manuscript (lines 460-466) we propose that while we do not observe any growth impairments during Ct growth in the absence of Cdu1 in HeLa cells, the reduction in bacterial loads observed in murine models of infection with an independent cdu1 mutant strain (cdu1::Tn) may potentially be linked to defects in extrusion production or alterations in Cdu1-dependent regulation of extrusion size.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>c. Recent studies have found that IFNg activation can result in dramatic changes in ubiquitination to pathogen containing vacuoles. While some of these are blocked by the newly found GarD, it seems possible that Cdu1 may also play a role (and perhaps use its deubiquinating activity) to further protect the inclusion. In light of published results showing that Cdu1 mutants have lower IFU burst size only in IFNg activated cells, this may be an important caveat in the current studies. This should be more directly addressed in the current manuscript.</p>

<p>We have incorporated two experimental findings indicating that the presence of Cdu1 is not required for Ct to defend itself against IFN cellular immunity in human cells. These recent discoveries are now presented in the updated Figure 5 and detailed in lines 338-355 of the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>d. On lines 433-434 the authors claim that Cdu1 is atypical since it is not encoded with the metaeffector/target pairs. However, this is an oversimplification of what is known about metaeffectors. For example, there are meta-effector/effector pairs that are not encoded together in Legionella (see table 1 DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10020108">https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10020108</ext-link>). Thus, the discussion should be adjusted. It seems Cdu1 is the first meta-effector found in Chlamydia, and maybe this should be highlighted more strongly rather than its uniqueness in this aspect of meta-effector/effector functions.</p>

<p>In lines 488-489 of the revised manuscript, we have removed the assertion that Cdu1 functions as an atypical metaeffector and emphasized that it represents the initial discovery of a metaeffector within Ct.</p>
