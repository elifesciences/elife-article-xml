<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Many proteins have been recently shown to undergo a process of phase separation that leads to the formation of biomolecular condensates. Intriguingly, it has been observed that some of these proteins form dense droplets of sizeable dimensions already below the critical concentration, which is the concentration at which phase separation occurs. To understand this phenomenon, which is not readily compatible with classical nucleation theory, we investigated the properties of the droplet size distributions as a function of protein concentration. We found that these distributions can be described by a scale-invariant log-normal function with an average that increases progressively as the concentration approaches the critical concentration from below. The results of this scaling analysis suggest the existence of a universal behaviour independent of the sequences and structures of the proteins undergoing phase separation. While we refrain from proposing a theoretical model here, we suggest that any model of protein phase separation should predict the scaling exponents that we reported here from the fitting of experimental measurements of droplet size distributions. Furthermore, based on these observations, we show that it is possible to use the scale invariance to estimate the critical concentration for protein phase separation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many proteins have been shown to undergo a phase separation process into a liquid-like condensed state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. This process appears to be of physiological significance since it may lead to the formation of biomolecular condensates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. As a consequence, it is closely controlled by the protein homeostasis system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, and its dysregulation has been associated with a broad range of human diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. It is therefore important to understand the fundamental nature of this process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> to provide insights for the identification of ways of modulating it through pharmacological interventions.</p>
<p>To help understand the nature of the transition underlying protein phase separation on the basis of recent experimental observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, here we study the distribution of the size of the droplets below the value of the concentration at which the transition occurs, which here is referred to as the critical concentration, Ï<sub>c</sub>. This question appears as a promising starting point to develop new insights since it has been reported that proteins can form droplets of sizeable dimensions already well below the concentration at which phase separation occurs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. This behaviour is not predicted by classical nucleation theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, and not readily consistent with the idea that the protein phase separation process can be described as a first-order phase transition. This is because, in a first-order phase transition, nucleation takes place in a supersaturated system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, while in a subsaturated system particles can still self-assemble, but with a probability that decreases exponentially with the size of the assemblies.</p>
<p>In the present study, we asked whether the experimental data on the droplet size distributions obey scale invariance, a general characteristic of complex systems, which is often used to reveal universal patterns underlying self-assembly. We report the observation that the droplet size distributions of the proteins FUS and Î±-synuclein follow a scale-invariant log-normal behaviour. These findings are consistent with a universal behaviour resulting from the presence of an increasingly large correlation length, Î¾, as the concentration approaches the critical concentration from below. The correlation length is an emergent characteristic, and it is related to the typical spatial range over which density fluctuations are correlated. When Î¾ is sufficiently large, one can expect scale invariance and finite-size scaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> to occur within a range of lengths spanning from the molecular size to Î¾. This means that physical observables cease to depend explicitly on numerous microscopic details that are peculiar to spatial scales smaller than Î¾, thus leading to a universal behaviour characterized by quantities obtained by coarse graining over scales smaller than Î¾.</p>
<p>At a first-order phase transition, Î¾ is finite, and if it is not large enough, the length range discussed above remains too short to observe scale invariance. However, the vicinity of the spinodal line, where nucleation disappears as the dilute phase becomes unstable, to the coexistence curve, where nucleation appears as the dilute phase becomes metastable, might cause a large increase of Î¾ as the first-order phase transition is approached by increasing the concentration. If it is not preceded by a first-order phase transition, the spinodal line would correspond to a second-order phase transition, resulting in infinite Î¾, with scale invariance holding on all length scales larger than the molecular scale. Various alternative scenarios contributing to the emergence of significant correlations will be mentioned in the Discussion section. Nevertheless, our scaling analysis exhibits a high degree of generality, devoid of reliance on specific underlying models.</p>
<p>As an application of the above observations, we address the question of whether scale invariance holds for droplet size distributions near the coexistence curve. As a practical consequence, we use this observation to propose a procedure to overcome the challenge of estimating the critical concentration, Ï<sub>c</sub>, which enters explicitly into our scaling analysis. Such challenge arises from the fact that close to the critical concentration, the timescale required for the equilibration of a system grows together with Î¾, thus exceeding the timescale amenable to experimental observation.</p>
<p>Our analysis of experimental data indicates that: (i) scale invariance does indeed hold near the coexistence curve, and (ii) the droplet size distribution is log-normal. Based on the properties of the scale-invariant log-normal distribution of droplet sizes, we investigate a correlation between the moments of the distribution and the distance from Ï<sub>c</sub>.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that methods to assess the critical concentration are crucial for understanding the location of proteins in their phase diagram, their proximity to the phase boundary between the native and droplet states, and how pharmacological interventions can modify their phase behaviour. To address this problem, we report how the moments of the distribution can be used as a scale-invariant gauge to estimate the critical concentration. In this way, an accurate estimate of the critical concentration is possible because it is based on measurements carried out away from the critical point, under conditions such that fluctuations are small, and hence experimental errors are smaller than in the proximity of the transition.</p>

<title>Formulation of the scaling ansatz</title>
<p>Empirical evidence indicates that protein self-assembly into liquid-like condensates is characterized by: (i) a phase separation transition at a concentration Ï<sub>c</sub>, (ii) a formation of droplets of sizeable dimensions already below Ï<sub>c</sub>, and (iii) a droplet size distribution that, after an initial transient, does not change with the experimental observation time, although individual droplets can form, grow, shrink and dissolve. An initial analysis of droplet size distributions observed experimentally led us to ask whether the region near the transition could be described in terms of a scaling theory, as commonly done for critical phenomena (29), as summarized above. We also note that this approach is analogous to analyzing the cluster size distribution in a percolation problem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In our analysis, we called <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>&gt;</italic></sub>(<italic>s</italic>|<italic>Ï</italic>) the survival distribution function (SDF = 1-CDF, where CDF is the cumulative distribution function) corresponding to the probability to observe a droplet of size greater than <italic>s</italic>, when the concentration is <italic>Ï</italic>. The distance from the critical concentration <italic>Ï</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> is measured in terms of the dimensionless variable <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536478v3_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, which also allows to compare data from different experiments, as explained below. <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>&gt;</italic></sub>(<italic>s</italic>|<italic>Ï</italic>) in general depends separately on <italic>s, Ï</italic> and many other parameters characterizing the process, including temperature. However, if scale invariance holds in the vicinity of <italic>Ï</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, i.e. when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536478v3_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is small and the correlation length of the system is large enough, we would expect <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>&gt;</italic></sub><italic>(s</italic>|<italic>Ï)</italic> to depend on <italic>Ï</italic> and on other details pertaining to the microscopic scales only through the characteristic droplet size, <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>. The characteristic size <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> is defined, apart from a proportionality constant (see below), as the ratio of the second to the first moment of the droplet size distribution. This leads us to formulate the following scaling ansatz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="536478v3_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where, <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> depends on <italic>Ï</italic>, and it is expected to diverge at the critical concentration as<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="536478v3_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>Î±</italic> â¥ and <italic>Ï &gt;</italic> 0 are critical exponents, <italic>a</italic> is a constant and <italic>f</italic> is the so-called scaling function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Thus, the scaling of the SDF is equivalent to saying that, apart from the singular behaviour <italic>s</italic><sup><italic>â Î±</italic></sup>, the remaining <italic>s</italic> and <italic>Ï</italic> dependence occurs only through the ratio <italic>s/s</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>. All extra dependencies are encapsulated in <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> through the constant <italic>a</italic>, Ï<sub>c</sub> and, possibly, on the specific form of the scaling function <italic>f</italic>. A consequence of scaling and singular behaviour described by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref>, i.e. the divergence of the characteristic size of the droplets, is that details of any specific system may not affect the value of the critical exponents, which are therefore expected to be universal, i.e. independent of specific details of the system.</p>
<p>To determine the exponents <italic>Î±</italic> and <italic>Ï</italic>, we introduce the moments of <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>&gt;</italic></sub>(<italic>s</italic>|<italic>Ï</italic>) for k&gt;0
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="536478v3_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where the scaling ansatz <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. (1)</xref> has been used in the last step and <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> is given by
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="536478v3_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
which depends on the function <italic>f</italic> but is independent of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536478v3_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. From <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq. (3)</xref>, we deduce that
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="536478v3_eqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
If the scaling ansatz of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. (1)</xref> is correct, by plotting the ratio of moments â¨<italic>s</italic><sup><italic>k</italic>+1</sup>â©<italic>/</italic>â¨<italic>s</italic><sup><italic>k</italic></sup>â© for various values of <italic>k</italic> as a function of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536478v3_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> in a double logarithmic scale, we should obtain straight parallel lines with slope <italic>Ï</italic> and intercept <italic>ln(ac</italic><sub><italic>k+1</italic></sub><italic>/c</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub><italic>)</italic>.</p>

<title>Scaling behaviour of the droplet size distributions of FUS</title>
<p>We investigated the validity the ansatz in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref> using experimental data on the RNA-binding protein FUS, which are available for both the untagged and the SNAP-tagged protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (<bold>Table S1</bold>). We calculated the survival distribution function, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref>, and its moments, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq. (3)</xref>. We then plotted the moment ratios versus the inverse distance from the critical concentration <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536478v3_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> in double logarithmic scale (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We used the estimates of the critical concentrations, Ï<sub>c</sub> = 5.0 Î¼M for FUS and Ï<sub>c</sub> = 5.4 Î¼M for SNAP-tagged FUS, obtained below, in a self-consistency check of the validity of the scaling ansatz. We observed that the moment ratios at different distances from the critical concentration fall onto straight lines, as predicted by the scaling ansatz. In addition, the weighted average slope (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn15">Eqs.

<title>Estimation of the critical concentration of FUS using the scale invariance</title>
<p>The fact that the scaling ansatz is satisfied for different set of experiments opens a possibility to estimate the critical concentration.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although growing experimental evidence indicates the presence of protein condensates both in vitro and in vivo<sup>1-5,36</sup>, their exact nature, and the mechanisms responsible for their formation are not fully understood. For example, it is unclear whether the droplets observed below the saturation concentration and those detected above result from the same process. Here we aimed at describing phase separation using a scaling ansatz.</p>
<p>With this aim, we analyzed a series of droplet size distributions of FUS and Î±-synuclein. We found that the droplet size distributions follow a scale-invariant log-normal behaviour. Scale invariance means that the description of the behaviour of a system remains the same regardless of the scale of observation. It has been seen for example in self-similar systems like fractals, which repeat patterns at different length scales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Scale invariance is commonly observed in physics, biology, and economics, where it helps understand complex systems by identifying consistent patterns and fundamental properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. The critical exponents of the scaling model are the same for different systems. We also note the generality of the log-normal model for nucleation and grain size growth ranging from crystal seeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> to the mass size distributions in organism growth of various sea organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>It is interesting to discuss the links of the scale invariance observed here with the theoretical models that have been proposed to date to explain the phenomenon of protein phase separation. A commonly adopted framework is the Flory-Huggins theory of phase separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In its simplest form, this theory describes a first-order phase separation in a system of homopolymers, which can also be adapted to polyampholites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The Flory-Huggins theory has been extended to associative polymers, with the aim of modelling the sequence composition of proteins, by Flory and Stockmayer, who described the phase separation in terms of a third-order gelation process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Semenov and Rubinstein modified the Flory-Stockmayer theory, reporting that the gelation process is not a real phase transition, as all the derivatives of the free energy are analytical at the gelation point<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. It was also argued that another generalization of the Flory-Stockmayer theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> could describe phase transitions in cytoskeletal networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. In an older study, Î³-crystallin was reported to undergo a second-order phase separation process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, consistently with observations in lysozyme solutions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>More recently, it has been suggested that the protein phase separation process is coupled with percolation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. It is notable that percolation models exhibit a continuous transition marked by a diverging correlation length and a scale-invariant droplet size distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, resembling the general form as presented in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eqs. (1)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">(2)</xref>. However, the critical exponents for 3D percolation at the critical threshold are Î±=1.19 and Ï=2.21, and in mean-field (d&gt;6) scenarios, they are Î±=1.5 and Ï=2, as per existing literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. In contrast, our scaling analysis is consistent with Î±=0 and Ï=1. Therefore, a phase separation coupled with percolation model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> could be consistent with the scaling behavior reported here if this coupling would induce a shift in the universality class from that of standard percolation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. This possibility should be further investigated to determine whether this type of models could predict the critical exponents Î±=0 and Ï=1.</p>
<p>Scale invariance may appear to be in contrast with the Flory-Huggins theory, which characterizes droplet formation as a consequence of nucleation processes within a metastable state of a supersaturated system. In such cases, however, when the correlation length exceeds the cellular dimensions, the remnants of what should have been a first-order phase transition in an infinite system may effectively exhibit indistinguishable characteristics from a second-order phase transition. We also note that a power law distribution, but above the transition temperature, has recently been reported for nucleoli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Quite generally, the existence of scale invariance for the droplet size distribution, at least under the conditions investigated here, imposes stringent constraints on theoretical models that aim to elucidate protein phase separation. The importance of a scaling analysis lies in its ability to uncover the fundamental aspects of universal phenomena, transcending models confined solely to specific systems for which they were originally designed.</p>
<p>As a practical consequence of the scaling model, we found that the moments of the droplet size distribution can be used to obtain an estimate of the critical concentration for phase separation.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Conclusions and Perspectives</title>
<p>It has been challenging to determine critical concentrations in the study of protein phase separation, particularly in cell systems. As a consequence, it remains still largely unclear when the observed protein droplets are formed at sub-saturation concentrations, and when they represent phase-separated condensates at super-saturation concentrations. To make progress towards understanding this problem, we have analyzed the probability distributions of the droplet sizes at different concentrations. The scale-invariant log-normal behaviour that we have reported offer a tool to determine the critical concentration. This approach should enable the positioning of a system with respect to the phase boundary when experimental data could be obtained about the length (1D), area (2D), or volume (3D) of the condensates. We anticipate that this method will find applications in the study of protein condensates under cellular conditions.</p>
<p>We also note that the scale invariance of the droplet size distribution that we have reported is characteristic of critical phenomena, which tend to be highly sensitive to environmental conditions. The formation and dimensions of protein droplets could therefore be rather tunable. This feature would appear to be favourable for the control of the formation of biomolecular condensates by the protein homeostasis system, and also suggest that protein phase separation could be efficiently modulated pharmacologically.</p>

The excitation wavelength was 633 nm for all experiments. For liquid droplet size characterisation, images were captured 10 min post-liquid droplet formation. To analyse the possible time dependence of the liquid droplet size distribution, phase separation was induced, and 5 min post onset of phase separation, the glass-bottom dish containing the experiment was sealed and closed to maintain a stable and controlled environment. Subsequently, images were captured at each designated time point. All images were processed and analysed in ImageJ (NIH). Images were analysed by applying a threshold function in ImageJ that excluded the background of the image and identified the liquid droplets as having a circularity of 0.8-1.</p>

<p>We used previously published data on FUS droplets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, where the fluorescence intensity of the FUS droplets was reported to be proportional to their diameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The abundance of untagged FUS droplets formed at 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0, 2.0 Î¼M concentrations were measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis for 51 different droplet sizes with three repetitions for each measure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Similarly, the abundance of SNAP-tagged FUS droplets at 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 Î¼M concentrations were measured for 64 different sizes with 3 repetitions for each measure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. For each data point, we determined the mean droplet abundance and the standard error of the mean from the three experimental replicates. The survival distribution function was computed as P<sub>&gt;x</sub> = N<sub>&gt;x</sub>/N<sub>tot</sub>, where N<sub>&gt;x</sub> is the number of droplets above size x, and N<sub>tot</sub> is the number of droplets. The values of x were chosen according to the original data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Determination of the critical exponents for FUS</title>
<p>We computed the k-th moment of each droplet size, determined the average for each value of k and computed the ratios of the subsequent moments (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq. (4)</xref>). We tested several k values from 0.25 to 3 in 0.25 increments, determined the moment ratios in each case. We selected four k values (k=0.5, k=1.0, k=1.5 and k=2.0) where the moment ratios at each concentration provided the best linear fit for both FUS and SNAP-tagged FUS. Then we generated a log-log plot of the moments and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536478v3_inline14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, the distance from the critical concentration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). For each value of k, the points were estimated by taking the average of the computation done on the 3 independent measurements. The errors of the data points are estimated as the standard error of the mean. At each k value, we performed a linear regression between the points at each concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> determining the slope, resulting in four Ï<sub><italic>k</italic></sub> values, with an associated error from the weighted linear regression. Given the independent observations Ï<sub><italic>k</italic></sub> with variance Ï<sub><italic>k</italic></sub>, the value of the exponent was obtained as the weighted average
<disp-formula id="eqn15">
<graphic xlink:href="536478v3_eqn15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The error on the exponent Ï was computed as
<disp-formula id="eqn16">
<graphic xlink:href="536478v3_eqn16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The exponent Î± was determined based on the log-log plot of the mean of the droplet size distribution at various distances from the critical concentration <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536478v3_inline15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We performed a linear regression weighted by the inverse of the variance of the data points corresponding, as previously, to the computed mean of the three independent experiments for each concentration (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn6">Eq. (6)</xref>) using Ï =1. The error on the slope from the weighted linear regression is associated with the estimate of the exponent <italic>m</italic>. The exponent Î± is then derived using Î± = <italic>1</italic> â <italic>m</italic>.</p>
<p>At each concentration, from the distribution of ln(s) we determined s<sub>0</sub> as &lt;ln(s)&gt; =ln(s<sub>0</sub>), and Ï as the standard deviation of ln(s). At each concentration, we plotted the droplet size distribution function versus <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536478v3_inline16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn10">Eq. (10)</xref>) using the s<sub>0</sub> and Ï values determined from the corresponding droplet size distribution at the given concentration. The log-normal behaviour is demonstrated by the resulting collapse (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, the collapsed curves overlapped with a theoretical log-normal curve computed with s<sub>0</sub>=1, Ï = 1, which is the normal distribution in the rescaled log variables.</p>

<title>Determination of the critical concentration of Î±-synuclein</title>
<p>As for the critical exponents, we determined the critical concentration of Î±-synuclein using the scaling ansatz in two different ways, either using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn18">Eq. (18)</xref> or using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn19">Eq. (19)</xref> with the constrain Ï=1. We plotted the moments of the droplet size (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq.

Analogously to what happens in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, the lines plotted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> intercept the x axis on the same point, which corresponds to the critical concentration. We performed a linear regression weighted by the inverse variance, determining the intercept on the x-axis. For each value of k, we calculated the regression errors of both intercept and slopes. We estimated the critical concentration from each fit as the intercept calculated as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536478v3_inline18.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>q</italic> and <italic>m</italic> are the y-axis intercept and the slope retrieved by the fit, respectively, where the subscript <italic>i</italic> indicates each independent experiment.

<p>The authors analyse droplet size distributions of multiple protein condensates and fit to a scaling ansatz to highlight that they exhibit features of first-order and second-order phase transitions. While the experimental evidence is solid, the text lacks connection and contextualization to the well-understood expectations from the coupling of percolation and phase separation in protein condensates - a phenomenon that is increasingly gaining consensus amongst the community. The evidence supports the percolatoin+phase separation model rather than being close to a true critical point in the liquid-gas phase space. Overall, the work is useful to the community.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The experimental analysis of distinct protein condensates is very well done and the reported exponents/scaling framework provides a clear framework to help the community help deconvolve signatures of percolation in condensates.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The principal concern this reviewer has is that the reviewers adopt a framing in this paper to present a discovery of second-order features and connections to criticality - however they ignore/miss the connections to percolation (a well-understood second-order transition that is expected to play a major role in protein condensates). I believe this needs to be addressed and the paper suitably revised to help connect with these expectations.</p>
<p>- Protein condensates have been increasingly understood to be described as fluids whose assembly is driven by a connection of density (phase separation, first-order) and connectivity (percolation, second-order) transitions. This has been long known in the polymer community (Flory, Stockmayer, Tanaka, Rubinstein, Semenov and others) and recently repopularized in the condensate community (by Pappu and Mittag, in particular, amongst others). The authors make no connections to any of this frameworks - which actually seem to be the essence of what they are describing.</p>
<p>- Percolation theory, which has been around for more than half-a-century, has clear-cut scaling laws that have essentially similar forms to the ansatz adopted by the authors and the commonalities/differences are not discussed by the authors - this is essential since this provides a physical basis for their ansatz rather than an arbitrary mathematical formulation. In particular, percolation models connect size distribution exponents to factors like dimensionality, valence, etc. and if these connections can be made with this data, that would be very powerful.</p>
<p>- The connections between spinodal decomposition and second-order phase transitions are very confusing. Spindal decomposition happens when the barriers for first-order phase transitions are zero and systems can phase separate without crossing nucleation barriers. Further, the &quot;criticality&quot; discussed in the paper is confusing since it more likely refers to a percolation threshold and much less likely to a &quot;critical temperature&quot; (Tc -where spinodal and binodals become identical). I would recommend reframing this argument.</p>
<p>It's unlikely, in this reviewer's opinion, that the authors are actually discussing a &quot;first-order&quot; liquid-gas critical point - because saturation concentrations of these proteins can be much higher with temperature and the critical point would thus likely be at much higher concentrations (and ofc temperature). Further the scaling exponents don't fall in that class naturally. However, if the authors disagree, I would appreciate clear quantitative reasons (including through the scaling exponents in that universality class) and be happy to be convinced to change my mind. As provided, the data does not support this model.</p>

<p>In response to the two referee reports, the authors have made substantial improvements. Regarding my previous concerns, the new data provided in Fig.6 for demonstrating that the droplet size distribution is stable over time is particularly valuable.</p>
<p>As to several of my other previous concerns regarding possible change in droplet size distribution over time, etc., the authors responded by stating that their system was below the critical concentration and therefore the possible scenarios pointed out in my previous report were not expected. While there may be a certain degree of validity to their argument, it would be much more helpful to the readers if the authors would bring up my previous concerns briefly (as readers of the journal will likely have similar concerns) and then address them succinctly within the manuscript.</p>
<p>Apparently, as a key element in the authors' response to the referees, the term &quot;transition concentration&quot; in the originally submitted manuscript is now changed to &quot;critical concentration&quot; (including in the title and abstract). But the two terms do not have identical meaning. A transition concentration is usually recognized as the saturation concentration at which phase separation or some other transition process commences at a given temperature. The transition concentration can be lower than the critical concentration, whereas the critical concentration is associated with the critical temperature, above (or below, depending on the temperature dependence of phase separation) which phase separation is not possible. It will be best if the authors can clarify their usage of transition concentration vs. critical concentration in the version of record of their manuscript.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold>:</p>
<p>In this useful study, the authors analyze droplet size distributions of multiple protein condensates and their fit to a scaling ansatz, highlighting that they exhibit features of first- and second-order phase transitions. The experimental evidence is still incomplete as the measurements were apparently done only at one time point, neglecting the possibility that droplet size distribution can evolve with time. The text would benefit from a connection to and contextualization with the well-understood expectations from the coupling of percolation and phase separation in protein condensates - a phenomenon that is increasingly gaining consensus amongst the community and that emphasizes &quot;liquid-gas&quot; criticality.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now carried out new experiments at multiple time points to establish that the droplet size distributions are stationary below the critical concentration. We have also addressed the comments made by the reviewers about the nature of the phase transition.</p>
<p>Our analysis does not depend on a specific hypothesis on the nature of the phase transition, whether it be percolation or a gas-liquid critical transition. The scaling that we observed is an emergent property that is independent from the possible theoretical models used to describe the phase transition. In fact, our scaling analysis indicates that any theoretical model proposed for protein phase separation should predict the critical exponents that we reported.</p>

<p>We are grateful to the reviewer for these positive comments. We would like to emphasises that our contribution is not to propose a theoretical model, but rather to report a scaling behaviour in the experimentally measured droplet size distributions. The main implication of our work is that any theoretical model should predict the scaling exponents that we derived from the experimental measurements.</p>

<p>The scaling that we found is not characteristic standard percolation, since the exponents that we obtained (a=0 and f=1) are different from those of percolation (a=1.19 and f=2.21). This difference indicates that protein phase separation is not in the same universality class of standard percolation. Further studies will be required to understand whether theoretical models based on percolation could predict the observed critical exponents.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, our purpose was neither to support an existing theoretical model, nor to propose a new one. Rather, we have reported a scaling behaviour and scaling exponents not noted before. Further studies will be required to establish whether existing theoretical models could account for this scaling behaviour.</p>

<p>The scaling ansatz that we are using is commonly adopted in studies of critical phenomena, and it is not specific to percolation. The scaling exponents depends only on very few attributes like dimensionality, symmetries and if interactions are short or long range. These attributes determine the universality class. As such, scaling does not link with molecular determinants, but can distinguish different classes.</p>

<p>We cannot refer to percolation threshold as our model is not readily compatible with it. We elaborated and better explained the differences between these models.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2</bold>:</p>
<p>This is a potentially interesting study addressing a possible scale-invariant log-normal characteristic of droplet size distribution in the phase separation behavior of biomolecular condensates. Some of the data presented are valuable and intriguing. However, as it stands, the validity and utility of this study are uncertain because there are serious deficiencies in the execution and presentation of the authors' results. Many of these shortcomings are fundamental, including a lack of clarity in the basic conceptual framework of the study, insufficient justification of the experimental setup, less-than-conclusive experimental evidence, and inadequate discussion of implications of the authors' findings to future experimental and theoretical studies of biomolecular condensates. Accordingly, this reviewer considers that the manuscript should undergo a major revision to address the following. In particular, the discussion should be significantly expanded by including references mentioned below as well as other references pertinent to the issues raised.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the helpful comments. In the revised version of the manuscript we clarified that we aimed to use a well-established tool â the scaling analysis â to study phase transition and applied to the protein condensation process. This approach offers insight into a universal aspect of protein phase separation, and also provides a practical approach to determine the phase boundary. The observed fat-tailed distribution of protein droplet sizes is not what is normally observed in more standard phase separation systems in the subsaturated phase. Our contribution is not to propose a theoretical model, but rather to report the observation of a scaling behaviour.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) The theoretical analysis in this study is based on experimental data on condensed droplet size distributions for FUS and Î±-synuclein. The size data for FUS droplet is indirect as it relies on the assumption that FUS droplet diameter is proportional to fluorescence intensity of labeled FUS (page 10 of manuscript), with fluorescence data adopted from a previously published work by another group (Kar et al. &amp; Pappu, ref.27). Because fluorescence of a droplet is expected to be dependent upon the condensed-phase concentration of FUS, this proportional relationship, even if it holds, must also be modulated by FUS concentration in the droplet. Moreover, why should fluorescence be proportional to diameter but not the cross-sectional area or volume of the FUS droplet, which would be more intuitive? These issues should be clarified. A new measure by microscopy is used to determine the size distribution of condensed Î±-synuclein; but no microscopy image is shown. It is of critical importance that such raw data (for example microscopy images) be presented for the completeness and reproducibility of the experiment because the entire study relies on the soundness of these experimental measurements.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we mentioned in the article, for the scaling analysis, the droplet dimensions could be assessed in 1D (length), 2D (area) or 3D (volume). For the FUS experiments, we used the data as the authors provided in the original publication (PNAS 2022). For alpha-synuclein, we provided the data in the article.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Despite the authors' claim of a universal scaling relationship, the log-log scatter plots in Figure 1 (page 15 of the manuscript) exhibit significant deviations from linearity at low protein concentrations (Ïâ0). Given this fact, is universal scaling really valid? Discussion of this behavior is conspicuously absent (except the statement that these data points are excluded in the fit). In any case, the possible origins of these deviations should be thoroughly discussed so that the regime of universal scaling can be properly delineated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In general, one would expect the scaling ansatz to be valid close to the phase boundary. It is the feature of the ansatz, that further away from the boundary, deviations are expected because of the decreasing relevance of critical phenomena.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Droplet size distribution most likely depends on the time duration after the preparation of the sample. For Î±-synuclein, &quot;liquid droplet size characterisation images were captured 10 minutes post-liquid droplet formation&quot; (page 9 of the manuscript). Why 10 minutes? Have the authors tried imaging at different time points and, if so, do the distributions at different time points remain essentially the same? If they are different, what is the criterion for focusing only on a particular time point? Information related to these questions should be provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now determined the droplet size distribution of alpha-synuclein at different time points, finding that they are not dependent on time within experimental uncertainties (Figure 6 in the revised manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) At least two well-known mechanisms can lead to the time-dependent distribution of liquid droplet sizes: (i) coalescence of droplets in spatial proximity to form a larger droplet, and (ii) Ostwald ripening, i.e., formation of larger droplets concomitant with the dissolution of smaller droplets without fusion of droplets. The implications of these mechanisms on the authors' droplet size distributions should be addressed. Indeed, maintaining a size distribution against these mechanisms in vivo often requires active suppression [Bressloff, Phys Rev E 101, 042804 (2020)] with possible involvement of chemical reactions [Kirschbaum &amp; Zwicker, J R Soc Interface 18, 20210255 (2021)]. These considerations are central to the basic rationale of this study and therefore should be carefully tackled.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These two mechanism of growth are relevant above the critical concentration. Below the critical concentration, which is the regime that we investigated in our work, there is no need of active suppression.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) If coalescence and/or Ostwald ripening do occur, given sufficient time after sample preparation, the condensed phase may become a single large &quot;droplet&quot; or a single liquid layer. Does this occur in the authors' experiments?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we are below the critical concentration, this is unlikely to occur, as indeed supported by the experiments mentioned at point (3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) It is unclear whether the authors aim to address the kinetic phenomenon of liquid droplet formation and evolution or equilibrium properties. The two types of phenomena appear to be conflated in the authors' narrative. Clarification is needed. If this work aims to address timeindependent (or infinite-time) equilibrium properties, how are they expected to be related to droplet size distribution, which most likely is time-dependent?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our analysis focuses on the equilibrium properties of the droplet size distribution below the critical concentration, and it should guide the proposal of a theoretical model that explains the emergence of scaling. In the introductory part of our manuscript, we proposed a possible scenario that tries to extend the Flory-Hugginsâs theory to predict a scaling behaviour appropriate to a critical transition. Other scenarios are possible, and our result along with further experiments are needed to arrive at a deeper understanding of protein aggregation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The relationship between the potentially time-dependent droplet size distribution and equilibrium properties of Ït and Ïc (transition and critical concentrations, respectively) should be better spelled out. An added illustrative figure will be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are addressing equilibrium properties, not kinetic ones. See also the answers to point 6.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The authors comment that their findings appear to be inconsistent with Flory-Huggins theory because Flory-Huggins &quot;characterizes droplet formation as a consequence of nucleation ...&quot; (page 8 of the manuscript). Here, three issues need detailed clarification: (i) In what way does Flory-Huggins mandate nucleation? (ii) Why are the findings of apparent scale invariance inconsistent with nucleation? (iii) If liquid droplet formations do not arise from nucleation, what physical mechanism(s) is (are) envisioned by the authors to be underpinning the formation of condensed liquid droplets in protein phase separation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do agree that the Flory-Huggins theory does not mandate nucleation above the spinodal line. However, we are addressing the equilibrium properties below the critical concentration, so the stable phase is the dilute phase, and there is no nucleation.</p>

<p>(9) Are any of the authors' findings related to finite-system effects of phase separation [see, e.g., Nilsson &amp; IrbÃ¤ck, Phys Rev E 101, 022413 (2020)]?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our experimental system is macroscopic, so we would not expect finite size effects.</p>

<p>(10) Since the authors are using their observation of an apparent scale-invariant droplet size distribution to evaluate phase separation theory, it is important to clarify whether their findings provide any constraint on the shape of coexistence curves (phase diagrams).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are only reporting the phenomenological observation of a scaling behaviour, so we may not speculate at this stage on the constraints of the coexistence curves. This is indeed an exciting opportunity for future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) More specifically, do the authors' findings suggest that the phase diagrams predicted by Flory-Huggins are invalid? Or, are they suggesting that even if the phase diagrams predicted by Flory-Huggins are empirically correct (if verified by experimental testing), they are underpinned by a free energy function different from that of Flory-Huggins? It is important to answer this question to clarify the implications of the authors' findings on equilibrium phase behaviors and the falsifiability of the implications.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, our main conclusion is that the droplet size distribution follows a scaling behaviour.  Our contribution is not to propose a theoretical model, but rather to propose a scaling behaviour that should be accounted for by existing of future theoretical models.</p>

<p>(12) How about the implications of the authors' findings on other theories of protein phase separation that are based on interactions that are different from the short spatial range interactions treated by Flory-Huggins? For instance, it has been observed that whereas the Flory-Huggins-predicted phase diagrams always convex upward, phase diagrams for charged intrinsically disordered proteins with long spatial range Coulomb interactions exhibit a region that concave upward [Das et al., Phys Chem Chem Phys 20, 28558-28574 (2018)]. Can information be provided by the authors' findings regarding apparent scale-invariant droplet size distribution on the underlying interaction driving the protein molecules toward phase separation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting point for future studies about the type of interactions that give rise to the observed scaling behaviour.</p>

<p>(13) Table S1 (page 4) and Table S2 (page 7) are mentioned in the text but these tables are not in the submitted files.</p>

<p>We have added the Supplementary Tables as well as the source files for the figures.</p>

<p>(14) The two systems studied (FUS and Î±-synuclein) have a single intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) component. It is not clear if the authors expect their claimed scaling relation to be applicable to systems with multiple IDP components and if so, why.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>From the data that we have currently analysed, we feel that we may not speculate on this interesting point, leaving it to future studies.</p>
