<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Survival of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> within the host macrophages requires the virulence regulator PhoP, but the underlying reason remains unknown. cAMP is one of the most widely used second messengers, which impacts on a wide range of cellular responses in microbial pathogens including <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Herein, we hypothesized that intra-mycobacterial cAMP level could be controlled by the <italic>phoP</italic> locus since the major regulator plays a key role in bacterial responses against numerous stress conditions. A transcriptomic analysis reveals that PhoP functions as a represtsor of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) Rv0805, which hydrolytically degrades cAMP. In keeping with these results, we find specific recruitment of the regulator within the promoter region of <italic>rv0805</italic> PDE, and absence of <italic>phoP</italic> or ectopic expression of <italic>rv0805</italic> independently accounts for elevated PDE synthesis leading to depletion of intra-mycobacterial cAMP level. Thus, genetic manipulation to inactivate PhoP-<italic>rv0805</italic>-cAMP pathway decreases cAMP level, stress tolerance and intracellular survival of the bacilli.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, the causative agent of pulmonary tuberculosis, encounters diverse environmental conditions during infection, persistence and transmission of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ehrt <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ernst, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Russell, 2011</xref>). However, the intracellular pathogen is exceptionally capable to adjust and survive within diverse intracellular environments. Mycobacterial adaptive response to different stages of infection is achieved via fine tuning of regulation of gene expression using an extensive repertoire of more than 100 transcriptional regulators, 11 two-component systems, 6-serine-threonine protein kinases and 13 alternative sigma factors suggesting that a very complex transcriptional program is important for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> pathogenesis. While regulation of gene expression as a consequence of interaction of tubercle bacilli with its immediate environment remains critically important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rohde <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), defining these regulatory pathways represent a major challenge in the field.</p>
<p>3’, 5’-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), one of the most widely used second messengers, impacts on a wide range of cellular responses in microbial pathogens including <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">McDonough &amp; Rodriguez, 2011</xref>). The bacterial genome encodes at least 15 adenylate cyclases, including one of the adenylate cyclases (Rv0386) which is required for virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>), and multiple cAMP regulated effector proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Banerjee <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Johnson &amp; McDonough, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">McDonough &amp; Rodriguez, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Shenoy &amp; Visweswariah, 2006</xref>). cAMP levels are elevated upon infection of macrophages by pathogenic mycobacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bai <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>) and addition of exogenous cAMP was shown to influence mycobacterial protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gazdik &amp; McDonough, 2005</xref>). While intra-bacterial cAMP responds to macrophage environment and carries out specific functions like gene expression and protein function under host-related conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bai <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bai <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Johnson <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Johnson &amp; McDonough, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Knapp &amp; McDonough, 2014</xref>), secreted cAMP controls macrophage signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gazdik <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Johnson <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nambi <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Ranganathan <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rittershaus <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). cAMP signalling remains essential to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> pathogenesis. Agarwal and colleagues had shown that burst in synthesis of cAMP upon infection of macrophages, improved bacterial survival by interfering with host signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). In keeping with this, anti-tubercular compounds that interfere with mycobacterial cAMP levels also impact intracellular growth of mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bai <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Johnson <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Knapp <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nambi <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rittershaus <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">VanderVen <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wilburn <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Together, these results underscore the significance of cAMP signalling in mycobacteria.</p>
<p>cAMP signalling is controlled at the transcriptional level. Previous <italic>in silico</italic> studies had identified two out of 10 predicted nucleotide binding proteins of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> as members of the CRP/FNR superfamily of transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">McCue <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). These are CRP (cyclic AMP Receptor protein), encoded by <italic>rv3676</italic> and CMR (cAMP macrophage regulator), encoded by <italic>rv1675c</italic>, respectively. Of these two, CRP becomes activated upon cAMP binding, and functions as a global regulator of ∼100 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bai <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rickman <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Consequently, deletion of the <italic>crp</italic> locus significantly impairs mycobacterial growth and attenuates virulence of the bacilli in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rickman <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). In contrast, CMR is necessary for regulated expression of genes involved in virulence and persistence including members of the dormancy regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gazdik <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Ranganathan <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Together, these results strongly suggest that a balance between cAMP synthesis by adenylate cyclases and cAMP degradation by phosphodiesterases contributes to rapid adaptive response of mycobacteria in a hostile intracellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Johnson &amp; McDonough, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">McDonough &amp; Rodriguez, 2011</xref>). However, very little is known about the underlying mechanism of mycobacterial cAMP homeostasis.</p>
<p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> encounters a hostile environment within the host. Among the hostile conditions is the acidic pH stress and exposure to host immune effectors such as NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nathan &amp; Shiloh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Rustad <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wayne &amp; Sohaskey, 2001</xref>). A growing body of evidence connects virulence-associated mycobacterial <italic>phoP</italic> locus with varying environmental conditions, including acid stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abramovitch <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bansal <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tan <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>), heat-shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sevalkar <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Singh <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>) and integration of acid stress response to redox homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Baker <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Baker <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Goar <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Disruption of <italic>phoP,</italic> the gene encoding the response regulator of the PhoPR two-component signal transduction system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gupta <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) significantly reduces <italic>in vivo</italic> multiplication of the bacilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Walters <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), suggesting that PhoPR remains essential for virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Perez <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). Moreover, the mutant lacking this system shows a significantly lowered synthesis of cell-wall components diacyltrehaloses, polyacyltrehaloses, and sulfolipids, specific to pathogenic mycobacterial species (Gonzalo Asensio <italic>et al</italic>, 2006a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Goyal <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Walters <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). In fact, the significant attenuation of <italic>phoPR</italic> deletion strain forms the basis of the mutant being considered in trials as a vaccine strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arbues <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Recent transcriptomic analyses revealed that approximately 2% of the H37Rv genome is regulated by PhoP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Solans <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Walters <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), and mycobacterial gene expression in response to acidic pH significantly overlaps with the PhoP regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rohde <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Consistent with this, a large subset of PhoPR-regulated low-pH-inducible genes are induced immediately following <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> phagocytosis and remain induced during macrophage infection (Gonzalo Asensio <italic>et al</italic>, 2006b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Martin <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Perez <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Walters <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Additional evidences coupled with more recent results suggest that during onset of macrophage infection, PhoPR activation is linked to acidic pH and the available carbon source, suggesting a physiological link between pH, carbon source, and macrophage pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Baker <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we hypothesized that intra-mycobacterial cAMP level could be determined by the <italic>phoP</italic> locus since the major regulator has been implicated in regulation of bacterial responses against numerous stress conditions, many of which function as signals to activate cAMP synthesizing diverse adenylate cyclases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Knapp &amp; McDonough, 2014</xref>). Our results connect virulence regulator PhoP with intra-mycobacterial cAMP level. We discovered that PhoP regulates expression of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase <italic>rv0805</italic>, which hydrolytically degrades cAMP. To further probe the regulation, we demonstrate that under the condition which activates PhoP-PhoR system, PhoP in a PhoR-dependent mechanism represses transcription of <italic>rv0805</italic> through direct DNA binding at the upstream regulatory region. These observations account for a consistently lower level of cAMP in a PhoPR-deleted <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv (<italic>phoPR</italic>-KO) relative to the WT bacilli, and establishes the molecular mechanism of regulation of cAMP level, absence of which strikingly impacts phagosome maturation, and reduces mycobacterial survival within macrophages and mice. Together, the newly identified mechanism of regulation of cAMP level allows intra-phagosomal survival and growth program of mycobacteria.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Intra-mycobacterial cAMP level is regulated by the <italic>phoP</italic> locus</title>
<p>We compared cAMP levels of WT and <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO (mutant lacking both copies of <italic>phoP</italic> and <italic>phoR</italic>), grown under normal, NO stress and acid stress conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO showed a significantly lower level of cAMP relative to the WT bacilli, both under normal and stress conditions. Complementation of the mutant (Compl.) could restore cAMP to the WT level. A higher cAMP level in the complemented strain under NO stress is possibly attributable to reproducibly higher <italic>phoP</italic> expression in the complemented mutant under specific stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Khan et al., 2022</xref>). Because bacterial growth often varies under stress conditions, and growth inhibition can influence cAMP level, we compared viability of mycobacterial strains under normal and indicated stress conditions (conditions of cAMP measurements) by determining the bacterial CFU (Figure 1 - figure supplement 1). Note that for <italic>in vitro</italic> viability under specific stress conditions, indicated mycobacterial strains were grown to mid log phase (OD<sub>600</sub> 0.4-0.6) and exposed to acidic media (7H9 media, pH 4.5(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gouzy <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) for further two hours at 37°C. Likewise, for NO stress, cells grown to mid-log phase were exposed to 0.5 mM DetaNonoate for 40 minutes. Our results suggest that WT and <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO under carefully controlled stress conditions display comparable viability, indicating that variation in viable cell counts of the mutant under specific stress conditions do not account for lower cAMP level. From these results, we conclude that PhoP plays a major role in maintaining intra-mycobacterial cAMP level.</p>

<p>(A) Intra-mycobacterial cAMP levels were determined by a fluorescence-based assay as described in the Methods, and compared for indicated mycobacterial strains, grown under normal or specific stress conditions. For acid stress, mycobacterial strains were initially grown to mid-log phase (OD<sub>600</sub> 0.4 to 0.6), and then it was transferred to acidic pH (7H9 media, pH 4.5) for further 2 hours of growth at 37°C. For NO stress, cells grown to mid-log phase were exposed to 0.5 mM DataNonoate for 40 minutes. The data represent average values from three biological repeats (*P≤0.05, **P≤0.01). (B) To compare secretion of cAMP by WT and <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO, cAMP levels were also determined in the corresponding culture filtrates (CF). (C) Immunoblotting analysis of 10 µg of cell lysates (CL) and 20 µg of culture filtrates (CF) of indicated <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains. α-GroEL2 was used as a control to verify cytolysis of cells, CFP-10 detected as a secreted mycobacterial protein in the culture filtrates, and RpoB used as the loading control.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>To investigate the possibility that <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO secretes out more cAMP and therefore, shows a lower cytoplasmic level, we compared cAMP secretion of WT and the mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The WT and mutant strains were grown as described in the Methods and culture filtrates (CF) as well as cell lysates (CL) were collected as described previously (Anil Kumar <italic>et al</italic>, 2016). Our results demonstrate that the mutant reproducibly secretes lower amount of cAMP relative to the WT bacilli, and cAMP secretion is fully restored in the complemented mutant (Compl.). As the fold difference of secretion (∼ 1.25-fold) is not much different relative to the fold difference in intra-mycobacterial cAMP level (∼2-fold), we suggest that lower cAMP level of the mutant is not due to its higher efficacy of cAMP secretion. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> confirms absence of autolysis of mycobacterial cells as GroEL2 was undetectable in the culture filtrates (CF).</p>

<p>We next investigated role of the <italic>phoP</italic> locus on expression of mycobacterial adenylate cyclases (ACs) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which synthesize and degrade cAMP, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The selection of ACs and PDEs were based on two key points. First, we have chosen ACs which are activated by known signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Knapp &amp; McDonough, 2014</xref>). Second, we reasoned that the previously reported ACs were activated under environmental conditions, which are linked to mycobacterial <italic>phoP</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bansal <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Goar <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Our RT-qPCR results using gene-specific primer pairs (Supplementary file 1a) suggest that expression of adenylate cyclases including <italic>rv0386</italic>, <italic>rv1264</italic>, <italic>rv1647</italic> and <italic>rv2488c</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dass <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dittrich <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Knapp &amp; McDonough, 2014</xref>) do not appear to be regulated by the <italic>phoP</italic> locus. However, a significant activation of adenylate cyclase <italic>rv0891c</italic> (4±0.05-fold), and repression of phosphodiesterase <italic>rv0805</italic> expression (6.5±0.7-fold), respectively, were dependent on the <italic>phoP</italic> locus. Although Rv0891c was suggested as one of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv adenylate cyclases, the protein lacks most of the important residues conserved for adenylate cyclase family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zaveri <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>rv0805</italic> encodes for a cAMP specific PDE, present only in slow growing pathogenic <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Matange <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Although expression of <italic>rv0805</italic> was restored at the level of WT in the complemented mutant (Compl.), we observed poor restoration of expression of <italic>rv0891c</italic> in the Compl. strain. Further, expression of PDE <italic>rv1339</italic> which contributes to mycobacterial cAMP level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Thomson <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>) remains unaffected by the <italic>phoP</italic> locus. Therefore, we focussed our attention on the biological significance of PhoP-dependent regulation of <italic>rv0805</italic>. It should be noted that expressions of <italic>rv1357c</italic> and <italic>rv2837c</italic>, encoding PDEs for cyclic di-GMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Flores-Valdez <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) and cyclic di-AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Valadares &amp; Woo, 2017</xref>), respectively, remained unchanged in <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO.</p>

<p>As we reproducibly observed activation of <italic>rv0805</italic> expression in <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO (relative to WT), we investigated whether acidic pH conditions under which <italic>phoPR</italic> system is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abramovitch <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bansal <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>), impacts expression of <italic>rv0805</italic> in WT bacilli (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Our results show that repression of <italic>rv0805</italic> is significantly higher in WT grown under acidic conditions (pH 4.5) relative to normal conditions (pH 7.0) of growth. This observation is consistent with RNA-seq data displaying significant down-regulation of <italic>rv0805</italic> in WT bacilli grown under acidic pH conditions relative to normal conditions of growth (GEO Accession number: GSE180161). As a control, expression of PDE <italic>rv1339</italic> which also degrades cAMP, remains unaffected under acidic conditions of growth. The finding that acidic pH (pH4.5) conditions of growth promoted PhoP-dependent repression of <italic>rv0805</italic>, prompted us to investigate whether PhoP directly binds to <italic>rv0805</italic> promoter. To this end, we next examined <italic>in vivo</italic> recruitment of PhoP within the <italic>rv0805</italic> promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). In this assay, formaldehyde-cross-linked DNA-protein complexes of growing <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> cells were sheared to generate fragments of average size ≍500 bp. Next, ChIP experiments utilized anti-PhoP antibody, and IP DNA was analysed by real-time qPCR relative to a mock sample (without antibody as a control) using FPrv0805up/RPrv0805up as the primer pair (Supplementary file 1a). Our results show that under normal condition (light blue bars) rv0805up showed an insignificant enrichment of PCR signal for PhoP relative to mock (no antibody control) sample, suggesting low affinity DNA binding of PhoP under normal conditions. However, IP samples from cells grown under acidic pH showed a significantly higher enrichment of PhoP at the <italic>rv0805</italic> promoter (rv0805up; compare <italic>light blue</italic> bars with <italic>dark blue</italic> bars). As controls, promoter of <italic>msl3</italic> (msl3up) which is controlled by PhoP, and non-specific 16S rRNAup showed comparable enrichment, and no enrichment under normal and acidic conditions, respectively. Thus, ChIP data showing PhoP recruitment under acidic pH conditions is in agreement with low pH-specific impact of PhoP on <italic>rv0805</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Note that PhoP binding to msl3up was used as a positive control.</p>
<p>To examine DNA binding <italic>in vitro</italic>, we first probed for the PhoP binding site within the upstream regulatory region of <italic>rv0805</italic> (rv0805up) by MEME Bioinformatic software using the consensus PhoP binding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">He &amp; Wang, 2014</xref>). Our results suggest that the likely PhoP binding sequence spans from −127 to −110 (relative to the ORF start site) of rv0805up (Figure 2-figure supplement 1A) (p=0.000726). Next, recombinant PhoP was phosphorylated by acetyl-phosphate (AcP) and used in EMSA experiments as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pathak <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Consistent with the presence of a PhoP binding site, EMSA results demonstrate that P∼PhoP binds to radio-labelled rv0805up to form a complex stable to gel electrophoresis (Figure 2-figure supplement 1B).</p>

Note that a comparable expression of PDE <italic>rv1339</italic> was observed in both strains regardless of growth conditions.

<p>(A-B) To determine the impact of PhoR (the cognate sensor kinase of PhoP), expression of <italic>rv0805</italic> was compared in indicated <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv strains: (A) <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO<italic>::phoP</italic> (<italic>phoPR</italic> mutant complemented with <italic>phoP</italic>) and (B) <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO<italic>::phoPR</italic> (<italic>phoPR</italic> mutant complemented with <italic>phoP-phoR</italic>) under normal and acidic conditions of growth. As expected, <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO<italic>::phoPR</italic> (Compl.) shows a significant repression of <italic>rv0805</italic> (but not <italic>rv1339</italic>) under acidic pH (***P&lt;0.001). However, <italic>rv0805</italic> expression remains comparable in <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO<italic>::phoP</italic> under normal as well as acidic conditions of growth.

(C) To determine the effect of ectopic expression of <italic>rv0805</italic> on intra-mycobacterial cAMP level, WT and mutant Rv0805 proteins (Rv0805M, defective for phosphodiesterase activity) were expressed in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv (to construct WT-Rv0805, and WT-Rv0805M, respectively) as described in the Methods section. Similar to <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO, WT-Rv0805 (but not WT-Rv0805M) showed a considerably lower level of cAMP relative to WT bacteria.

<p>To examine the effect of Rv0805 on mycobacterial cAMP level, we next expressed a copy of <italic>rv0805</italic> in WT bacteria (referred to as WT<bold><italic>-</italic></bold>Rv0805) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). <italic>rv0805</italic> ORF was cloned within the multicloning site of pSTki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Parikh <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>) between the EcoRI and HindIII sites under the control of P<sub>myc1</sub><italic>tetO</italic> promoter, and expression of <italic>rv0805</italic> under non-inducing condition was verified by determining the mRNA level (Figure 3 - figure supplement 1A). Although copy number of episomal vectors with pAl5000 origin of replication (<italic>oriM</italic>) have been reported to be 3 by Southern hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ranes <italic>et al</italic>, 1990</xref>), in this case wild-type and mutant Rv0805 proteins were expressed from single-copy chromosomal integrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Parikh <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). We then assessed the impact of Rv0805 on intra-mycobacterial cAMP level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), WT-Rv0805 showed a significant depletion (2.1± 0.7-fold) of intra-mycobacterial cAMP relative to WT bacteria. To confirm that the reduced level of mycobacterial cAMP is attributable to <italic>rv0805</italic> expression, we also expressed <italic>rv0805M</italic>, a mutant Rv0805 lacking phosphodiesterase activity. As structural data coupled with biochemical evidences reveal that Asn-97 at the enzyme active site plays a key role in phosphodiesterase activity of Rv0805 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), the mutant Rv0805M was constructed by changing the conserved Asn-97 to Ala. WT-Rv0805M showed an insignificant variation of cAMP level relative to WT, suggesting that depletion of intra-mycobacterial cAMP in WT-Rv0805 is indeed attributable to phosphodiesterase activity of Rv0805. The corresponding mRNA levels of PDEs (wild-type and the mutant) are over-expressed approximately 4.5-6-fold relative to the genomic <italic>rv0805</italic> level of WT-H37Rv (Figure 3-figure supplement 1A). In contrast, other PDE encoding genes (<italic>rv1357</italic> and <italic>rv2387</italic>), under identical conditions, demonstrate comparable expression levels in WT-H37Rv and <italic>rv0805</italic> over-expressing strains. Over-expression of these PDEs did not influence bacterial growth under normal conditions (Figure 3 - figure supplement 1B).</p>
<p>To further probe regulation of Rv0805 expression and its control of intra-mycobacterial cAMP level, we utilized a previously reported CRISPRi based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Singh <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>) to construct <italic>rv0805</italic> and <italic>phoP</italic> knockdown (<italic>rv0805</italic>-KD, and <italic>phoP-KD</italic>, respectively) mutants. Consistent with <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO, <italic>phoP</italic>-KD shows a significantly higher <italic>rv0805</italic> expression in the presence of ATc relative to its absence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). However, despite a significant down regulation of <italic>rv0805</italic> expression in presence of ATc, a comparable <italic>phoP</italic> expression was observed in <italic>rv0805</italic>-KD mutant both in the absence or presence of ATc. As a control, we observed a comparable expression of 16S rRNA in both knock-down mutants. Next, we determined intra-mycobacterial cAMP of the mutants as described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). cAMP level of <italic>phoP</italic>-KD (showing activation of Rv0805) was significantly lower relative to WT bacteria. In contrast, <italic>rv0805</italic>-KD mutant demonstrated a significantly higher level of cAMP relative to WT. We speculate that effective knocking down of <italic>phoP</italic> or <italic>rv0805</italic> is not truly reflected in the extent of variation of cAMP levels possibly due to the presence of numerous other mycobacterial PDEs. Together, these data represent an integrated view of our results suggesting that PhoP-dependant repression of <italic>rv0805</italic> regulates intra-mycobacterial cAMP level. In keeping with these results, activated PhoP under acidic pH conditions significantly represses <italic>rv0805</italic>, and intracellular mycobacteria most likely utilizes a higher level of cAMP to effectively mitigate stress for survival under stressful environment of the phagosome.</p>

As expected, <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO showed a significant growth inhibition relative to WT under low pH (pH 4.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bansal <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). WT<italic>-</italic> Rv0805, but not WT<italic>-</italic>Rv0805M displayed a comparable susceptibility to acidic pH as that of <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO. However, all four mycobacterial strains showed comparable growth at pH 7.0. Next, to compare growth of WT-Rv0805 and WT under oxidative stress, cells were grown in presence of increasing concentrations of diamide, a thiol-specific oxidant, and examined by microplate-based Alamar Blue assays (Figure 4 - figure supplement 1A). We have recently shown that <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO is significantly more sensitive to diamide relative to WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Goar <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Here, we uncovered that similar to <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO, WT-Rv0805, but not WT-Rv0805M was significantly more susceptible to diamide stress as compared to WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). A previous study had reported that <italic>phoP</italic>-deleted mutant strain was more sensitive to Cumene Hydrogen Peroxide (CHP), suggesting a role of PhoP in regulating mycobacterial stress response to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Walters <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). To compare sensitivity to CHP, we grew mycobacterial strains in presence of 50 µM CHP for 24 hours and determined their survival by enumerating CFU values (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In this case we were unable to perform Alamar Blue-based survival assays requiring a longer time because of the bactericidal property of CHP. Our CFU data highlight that WT-Rv0805, but not WT-Rv0805M, displayed a significantly higher growth inhibition relative to WT in the presence of CHP. Together, these results reveal similar behaviour of <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO, and WT-Rv0805 by demonstrating a comparably higher susceptibility of these strains to acidic pH and oxidative stress relative to WT bacteria and indicate a link between intra-mycobacterial cAMP level and bacterial stress response. Collectively, these data suggest that at least one of the mechanisms by which PhoP contributes to global stress response is attributable to maintenance of cAMP level A previous study showed that <italic>rv0805</italic> over-expression in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> influences cell wall permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Podobnik <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). Having shown a significantly higher sensitivity of WT-Rv0805 to low pH and oxidative stress (relative to WT), we sought to investigate whether altered cell wall structure/properties of the mycobacterial strain contribute to elevated stress sensitivity. We compared expression level of lipid biosynthetic genes, which encode part of cell-wall structure of the bacilli (Gonzalo Asensio <italic>et al</italic>., 2006a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Walters <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Our results suggest that in contrast to <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO, both WT-Rv0805 and WT-Rv0805M share a comparable expression profile of complex lipid biosynthesis genes as that of WT (Figure 4 - figure supplement 1B). Together, these results suggest that both strains expressing wild type or mutant PDEs share a largely similar cell-wall properties and are consistent with (a) a recent study reporting no significant effect of cAMP dysregulation on mycobacterial cell wall structure/permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wong <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>), and (b) role of PhoP in cell wall composition and complex lipid biosynthesis (Gonzalo Asensio <italic>et al</italic>., 2006a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Goyal <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Walters <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Together, our findings facilitate an integrated view of our results, suggesting that higher susceptibility of WT-Rv0805 to stress conditions, is attributable to its reduced cAMP level.</p>

(B) Microplate-based assay using Alamar Blue was utilized to examine mycobacterial sensitivity to increasing concentrations of diamide. In this assay, reduction of Alamar Blue correlates with the change of a non-fluorescent blue to a fluorescent pink appearance, which is directly proportional to bacterial growth. Survival of indicated mycobacterial strains, under normal conditions and in presence of 5 mM diamide, were determined by plotting fluorescence intensity. The data is normalized relative to WT grown in presence of 5 mM diamide.

In presence of CHP, WT-Rv0805 (red column) but not WT-Rv0805M (green column), shows a significant growth defect [relative to WT (empty column)] in striking similarity to <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO (grey column).

However, for WT-Rv0805, the CFU recovered from infected lungs 4 weeks post-infection declined by ≍218-fold relative to the lungs infected with WT bacteria (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). In contrast, the CFU recovered from infected lungs after 4 weeks of infection by WT-Rv0805M marginally declined by ≍7-fold relative to the lungs infected with WT bacilli.

Note that <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO, under the conditions examined, showed a ≍ 246-fold lower lung burden compared to WT.

<p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv persists within granulomas where it is protected from the anti-mycobacterial immune effectors of the host. Histopathological evaluations showed that WT bacilli - infected lung sections displayed aggregation of granulocytes within alveolar spaces which degenerate progressively to necrotic cellular debris. In contrast, <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO and WT-Rv0805 showed less severe pathology as indicated by decreased tissue consolidation, smaller granulomas, and open alveolar space (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Together, these results suggest that ectopic expression of <italic>rv0805</italic> in WT bacilli is somewhat functionally equivalent to deletion of <italic>phoP</italic>, suggesting that failure to maintain cAMP level most likely accounts for attenuated phenotype of the bacilli and absence of immunopathology in the lungs of infected mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A number of studies suggest that conditions associated with host environment like low pH, and macrophage interactions often influence mycobacterial cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bai <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gazdik &amp; McDonough, 2005</xref>). Although many bacterial pathogens modulate host cell cAMP levels as a common strategy, the mechanism of regulation of mycobacterial cAMP-level remains unknown. In this study, we sought to investigate whether PhoP, a master regulator implicated in controlling diverse mycobacterial stress response, is connected to mycobacterial cAMP level. We find that under normal conditions as well as under carefully controlled single stress conditions, <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO shows a significantly lower level of cAMP relative to the WT bacilli (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), and complementation of the mutant restored cAMP level. To investigate the mechanism, we next probed regulation of adenylate cyclases and PDEs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) and demonstrated that PhoP functions as a major repressor of <italic>rv0805</italic>, encoding cAMP specific PDE. Indeed, this newly-identified <italic>rv0805</italic> regulation, coupled with a very recent discovery that phosphodiesterase activity of Rv0805 controls propionate detoxification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">McDowell <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>), fits well with and explains, the previously puzzling <italic>in vivo</italic> observation by Abramovitch et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abramovitch <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) that PhoP-controlled <italic>aprABC</italic> locus is associated with the regulation of genes of carbon and propionate metabolism.</p>
<p>Although a large number of ACs are present in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genome, a class III metallo-phosphoesterase Rv0805 was earlier considered the only PDE, specific for mycobacterial cAMP. However, a recent study has identified an atypical class II PDE Rv1339, which upon overexpression reduces cAMP level and contributes to antibiotic sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Thomson <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). While, the functional role of Rv1339 in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is yet to be understood, crystal structure and biochemical evidence suggest that dimeric Rv0805 is stabilized by the presence of a divalent cation, and remains catalytically active on a broad range of linear and cyclic PDE substrates <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Keppetipola &amp; Shuman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). More recently, cyclic nucleotide hydrolytic activity of mycobacterial Rv0805 has been implicated in propionate detoxification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">McDowell <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). However, the mechanisms of regulation of Rv0805 and maintenance of mycobacterial cAMP level remain unknown.</p>
<p>To examine biological significance of PhoP-dependent Rv0805 expression, we studied <italic>rv0805</italic> expression under acidic conditions of growth as <italic>phoPR</italic> system is induced under acidic pH both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abramovitch <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bansal <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). A significantly higher repression of <italic>rv0805</italic> expression under acidic pH relative to normal conditions is consistent with activation of PhoP and subsequent repression of <italic>rv0805</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). These results further suggest that effective mitigation of stress by mycobacteria possibly requires a higher cAMP level for survival under intra-phagosomal environment. In keeping with these results, we find that (a) P∼PhoP binds to <italic>rv0805</italic> regulatory region (Fig. 2-figure supplement 1), and (b) PhoP-dependent <italic>rv0805</italic> expression requires PhoR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A-B</xref>), the cognate kinase which activates PhoP in a signal-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gupta <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Singh <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). These results account for a consistently lower level of cAMP in <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO relative to the WT bacilli. Notably, except recently reported PDE Rv1339, Rv0805 has been known as the only cAMP-specific PDE present in the slow growing pathogenic mycobacteria and its closely related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Matange, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), and Rv1339 expression does not appear to be regulated by the <italic>phoP</italic> locus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, the above results showing PhoP-dependent repression of <italic>rv0805</italic> activity likely represents the most critical step of regulation of mycobacterial cAMP level. In this connection, our recent results that PhoP interacts with cAMP receptor protein, CRP and a complex of two interacting regulators control expression of virulence determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Khan <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>), invite speculation of a complex regulatory control of cAMP-responsive mycobacterial physiology.</p>
<p>As one might argue that PhoP deletion and <italic>rv0805</italic> over-expression could be unrelated and independent events, we constructed <italic>phoP</italic> and <italic>rv0805</italic> knock-down mutants to further investigate the PhoP-Rv0805-cAMP pathway. Our objective was to probe regulation of expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) and examine the impact on mycobacterial cAMP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). <italic>phoP</italic>-KD significantly elevated <italic>rv0805</italic> expression; however, <italic>phoP</italic> expression remains unaffected in <italic>rv0805</italic>-KD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). While elevated <italic>rv0805</italic> expression in <italic>phoP</italic>-KD reduces cAMP level, understandably cAMP level is elevated in <italic>rv0805</italic>-KD mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). These results integrate PhoP-dependent <italic>rv0805</italic> repression with mycobacterial cAMP level, suggesting how <italic>phoP</italic>-deletion or knock-down, at least in part, mimics Rv0805 over-expression. These considerations take on more significance given the fact that these two events have similar consequences on relevant strains with respect to stress tolerance, and survival in cellular and animal models. Thus, our results suggest that ectopic expression of <italic>rv0805</italic> is functionally equivalent to deletion of the <italic>phoP</italic> locus. This observation is in apparent conflict with a previous work by Matange and collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Matange <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>), suggesting a cAMP-independent transcriptional response in <italic>rv0805</italic> over-expressing <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv. Although both studies were performed with <italic>rv0805</italic> over-expressing bacilli, the fact that important differences in the expression of PDEs in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Matange <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>) and in our assays – yielding significantly different levels of <italic>rv0805</italic> expression - most likely account for this discrepancy. While we cannot completely rule out the possibility of cleavage of other cyclic nucleotide(s) by Rv0805 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Keppetipola &amp; Shuman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) impacting our results, consistent with a previous study our results correlate <italic>rv0805</italic> expression with intra-mycobacterial cAMP level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Further, our data on the effect of expression of cyclic nucleotide-specific PDE Rv0805 or its inactive mutant (Rv0805M) correlate well with enzyme activities of the corresponding PDEs on mycobacterial cAMP levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Thus, we infer that PhoP-dependent regulation of <italic>rv0805</italic> is a critical regulator of intra-mycobacterial cAMP level.</p>
<p>Our experiments to understand physiological significance of PhoP-dependent repression of <italic>rv0805</italic> expression uncovers a comparable stress tolerance of WT-Rv0805 and <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO (significantly reduced relative to WT) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). These results are consistent with the notion that cAMP level, at least in part, accounts for mycobacterial stress response. Along the line, WT-Rv0805 displayed a reduced ability to inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion like <italic>phoPR-</italic>KO (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Further, we show that WT-Rv0805, unlike the WT bacilli or WT-Rv0805M, shows a significantly reduced intracellular growth in mice as that of <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, these results are of fundamental significance to establish that PhoP contributes to maintenance of cAMP level and integrates it to mechanisms of mycobacterial stress tolerance and intracellular survival. Together, we identify a novel mycobacterial pathway as a therapeutic target and provide yet another example of an intimate link between bacterial physiology and intracellular survival of the tubercle bacilli.</p>
<p>The results reported here are presented schematically in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>. In summary, upon sensing low acidic pH as a signal PhoR activates PhoP, P∼PhoP binds to <italic>rv0805</italic> upstream regulatory region and functions as a specific repressor of Rv0805. Therefore, we observed (a) a reproducibly lower level of cAMP in <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO relative to WT-H37Rv, (b) a significantly reduced expression of <italic>rv0805</italic> in WT-H37Rv, grown under acidic pH relative to normal conditions, and (c) comparable cAMP levels in <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO and WT-Rv0805. This is why the two strains remain ineffective to mount an appropriate stress response, most likely due to their inability to coordinate regulation of gene expression because of dysregulation of intra-mycobacterial cAMP level. However, without uncoupling regulatory control of PhoPR and <italic>rv0805</italic> expression, we cannot confirm that dysregulation of cAMP level accounts for virulence attenuation of <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO. Given the fact that <italic>rv0805</italic>-depleted <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is growth attenuated <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">McDowell et al., 2023</xref>), paradoxically ectopic expression of <italic>rv0805</italic> leads to dysregulated metabolic adaptation, thereby resulting in reduced stress tolerance and intracellular survival.</p>

<caption><title>Increased cAMP level and effective stress response versus decreased cAMP level and reduced stress tolerance of mycobacteria.</title>
<p>In this model, upon activation by an appropriate signal via the cognate sensor PhoR, P∼PhoP binds to <italic>rv0805</italic> regulatory region and functions as a specific repressor by preventing access for mycobacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) to bind to the promoter and initiate transcription. In keeping with PhoP-dependent <italic>rv0805</italic> repression, our results demonstrate a reproducibly lower level of cAMP in <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO relative to WT bacilli. Thus, <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO (or WT-Rv0805) remains ineffective to mount an appropriate stress response most likely due to its inability to coordinate regulated gene expression because of dysregulation of cAMP level, accounts for their reduced stress tolerance. Together, these molecular events suggest that failure to maintain cAMP <bold>level</bold> accounts for attenuated phenotype of the bacilli.</p></caption>

Cells were independently infected with titrated cultures of WT, WT-Rv0805, WT-Rv0805M and <italic>phoPR</italic>-KO strains at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1:5 for 3 hours at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, followed by 1X PBS washes thrice. The macrophages were further incubated for 3 hours at 37°C. After infection, extracellular bacteria were removed by washing thrice with PBS. To visualize trafficking of the tubercle bacilli, mycobacterial strains were stained with phenolic auramine solution (which selectively binds to mycolic acids) for 15 minutes followed by washing with acid alcohol solution and finally with 1X PBS. The cells were stained with 150 nM LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Invitrogen) for 30 minutes in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Next, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes, washed thrice with PBS, the coverslips were mounted in Slow Fade-Anti-Fade (Invitrogen) and analysed using laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon) equipped with Argon (488 nm excitation line; 510 nm emission detection) and LD (561 nm excitation line; 594 nm emission detection) laser lines. Digital images were processed with IMARIS imaging software (version 9.20). Details of the experimental methods and the laser/detector settings were optimized using macrophage cells infected with WT-H37Rv as described previously (Anil Kumar <italic>et al</italic>., 2016). A standard set of intensity threshold was made applicable for all images, and percent bacterial co-localization was determined by analyses of at least 50 infected cells originating from 10 different fields of each of the three independent biological repeats.</p>

<title>Mouse infections</title>
<p>All experiments pertaining to mice were in accordance with Institutional regulations after review of protocols and approval by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC/17/05, and IAEC/19/02). Mice were maintained and bred in the animal house facility of CSIR-IMTECH. Animal infection studies and subsequent experiments were carried out in the Institutional BSL-3 facility as per institutional biosafety guidelines. Briefly, the experiments were conducted with 8-10 weeks old C57BL/6 mice, infected intranasally and euthanized post-infection for evaluation of bacterial load in lungs and spleens. Infections were given through the respiratory route using an inhalation exposure system (Glass-col) with passaged <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv cultures of mid log phase. The actual bacterial load delivered to the animals was enumerated from 3-5 aerogenically challenged mice, 1day post aerosol challenge. The animals were found to achieve a bacillary deposition of 100 to 200 CFU in the lungs for each strain. Four weeks post infection, the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, lungs and spleens were isolated aseptically from the euthanized animals, homogenized in sterile 1X PBS and plated after serially diluting the lysates on 7H11 agar plates, supplemented with 10% OADC and antibiotics (50 μg/ml carbenicillin, 30 μg/ml polymyxin B, 10 μg/ml vancomycin, 20 μg/ml Trimethoprim, 20 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 20 μg/ml Amphotericin B) to enumerate CFU. For histopathology, left lung lobes were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin and stained with haematoxylin and eosin for visualization under the microscope. The level of pathology was scored by analysing perivascular cuffing, leukocyte infiltration, multinucleated giant cell formation and epithelial cell injury.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study describes how PhoP regulates cyclic-AMP production in the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that PhoP acts as a repressor of the cyclic-AMP-specific phosphodiesterase, Rv0805, which can degrade cyclic-AMP. The work will be of interest to bacteriologists and whilst the revised manuscript has been substantively improved, there are some outstanding points that could improve clarity and presentation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper provides a straightforward mechanism of how mycobacterial cAMP level is increased under stressful conditions and shows that the increase is important for the survival of the bacterium in animal hosts. The cAMP level is increased by decreasing the expression of an enzyme that degrades cAMP.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper shows that under different stresses the response regulator PhoP represses a phosphodiesterase (PDE) that degrades cAMP specifically. Identification of</p>
<p>
PhoP as a regulator of cAMP is significant progress in understanding Mtb pathogenesis, as increase in cAMP apparently increases bacterial survival upon infection. On the practical side, reduction of cAMP by increasing PDE can be a means to attenuate the growth of the bacilli. The results have wider implications since PhoP is implicated in controlling diverse mycobacterial stress responses and many bacterial pathogens modulate host cell cAMP level. The results here are straightforward, internally consistent, and of both theoretical and applied interests. The results also open considerable future work, especially how increases in cAMP level help to increase survival of the pathogen.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is not clear whether PhoP-PDE Rv0805 is the only pathway to regulate cAMP level under stress.</p>

<p>Summary: In the manuscript, the authors have presented new mechanistic details to show how intracellular cAMP levels are maintained linked to the phosphodiesterase enzyme which in turn is controlled by PhoP. Later, they showed the physiological relevance linked to altered cAMP concentrations.</p>
<p>Strengths: Well thought out experiments. The authors carefully planned the experiments well to uncover the molecular aspects of it diligently.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: Some fresh queries were made based on the author's previous responses and hope to get satisfactory answers this time.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Review:</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper reports how mycobacterial cAMP level is increased under stressful conditions and that the increase is important in the survival of the bacterium in animal hosts.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors show that under different stresses the response regulator PhoP represses a phosphodiesterase (PDE) that degrades cAMP specifically. Identification of a PDE specific to cAMP is significant progress in understanding Mtb pathogenesis. An increase in cAMP apparently increases bacterial survival upon infection. On the practical side, the reduction of cAMP by increasing PDE can be a means to attenuate the growth of the bacilli. The results have wider implications since PhoP is implicated in controlling diverse mycobacterial stress responses and many bacterial pathogens modulate host cell cAMP level. The results here are straightforward, internally consistent, and of both theoretical and applied interests.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewers for these extremely encouraging comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Repression of PDE promoter by binding of phosphorylated PhoP could have been shown at higher precision. The binding is now somewhere along a roughly 500 bp region. Although the regulation of PDE is shown to be by transcriptional repression only, it has been described as a homeostatic mechanism. The latter would have required a demonstration of both repression and activation by negative feedback.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. We have now performed EMSA (Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay) experiments and included the data showing DNA binding of PhoP to the upstream regulatory region of rv0805 (rv0805up) as a supplemental figure (see Figure 2-figure supplement 1). The supplemental figure, figure caption, and the relevant results have been adjusted accordingly in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Further, as recommended by the reviewer we have now removed the term ‘homeostatic mechanism’ and rephrased it with ‘maintenance of cAMP level’ in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Response to Reviewers’ comments</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>The authors have used homeostasis inappropriately. Homeostasis usually requires negative feedback (a clear example is the regulation of Lambda prm promoter). Here, there is no feedback from changes in PDE or cAMP level to their synthesis. Homeostasis does not belong to this paper anywhere.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As recommended by the reviewer, we have now removed “homeostasis” from the manuscript and mostly replaced it with “maintenance of cAMP level” in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors have frequently used adverbs at the beginning of a sentence, such as Notably (l.240, 272, 376), Importantly (l.66, 213), More importantly (l.134), Remarkably (l.264), Interestingly (l.115,301), Intriguingly (l.344), unambiguously (l.347), etc. The use of these words is generally counter-productive. The authors should scan the ms. to eliminate them as far as possible. The sentences would read more clearly and become more impactful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following reviewer’s recommendation, we have now eliminated most of the adverbs, mostly used at the beginning of sentences, in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Specific comments</p>
<p>(1) L.1: &quot;maintenance of homeostasis&quot; or increasing cAMP level.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have now replaced “maintenance of cAMP homeostasis” with “maintenance of cAMP level”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) L.27: mechanism or reason; varying or various.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As recommended by the reviewer, we have now replaced “mechanism” with “reason” and the word “varying” is deleted while incorporating suggested changes in the abstract.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) L.28-29: The logic of connecting PhoP to cAMP doesn't follow well. The logic is much better in l.54, l.112-5 and l.130.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now modified the statement within the ‘abstract’ in the revised manuscript (duplicated below):</p>
<p>“cAMP is one of the most widely used second messengers which impacts on a wide range of cellular responses in microbial pathogens including M. tuberculosis. Herein, we hypothesized that intra-mycobacterial cAMP level could be controlled by the phoP locus since the major regulator plays a key role in bacterial response against numerous stress conditions.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) L.30: discovers or reveals (?). Also, in l.101.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As recommended by the reviewer, we have now replaced ‘discovers’ with ‘reveals’ in the Abstract and ‘uncovered’ with ‘revealed’ in the Introduction section of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) L.31: Delete &quot;The most - - derived&quot;. It is not obvious what most fundamental means here. I suggest: We find that PhoP-dependent ---involves specific binding of the regulator---PDE gene.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As recommended by the reviewer, we have modified the statement (duplicated below):
“In keeping with these results, we find specific recruitment of the regulator within the promoter region of rv0805 PDE, and absence of phoP or ectopic expression of rv0805 independently accounts for elevated PDE synthesis leading to depletion of intra-mycobacterial cAMP level.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) L.36: --pathway decreases cAMP level, stress tolerance, and survival of the bacilli.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As recommended by the reviewer, we have now modified the statement (duplicated below):
“Thus, genetic manipulation to inactivate PhoP-Rv0805-cAMP pathway decreases cAMP level, stress tolerance, and intracellular survival of the bacilli.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) L.41: 'keeps encountering&quot; or encounters?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have replaced ‘keeps encountering’ with ‘encounters’ in the ‘Introduction’ section of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) L.61: responds, carries.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our apologies for the embarrassing grammatical mistakes. We have rectified these errors in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) L.67: you mean burst in synthesis level, not burst of cAMP itself.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To improve clarity, we have now modified the statement in the revised manuscript (duplicated below):
“Agarwal and colleagues had shown that burst in synthesis of bacterial cAMP upon infection of macrophages, improved bacterial survival by interfering with host signalling pathways (Agarwal et al., 2009)”</p>

<p>(11) L.83: Did not discuss &quot;degradation&quot; earlier.</p>

<p>Following reviewer’s recommendation, we have now modified the statement in the revised manuscript (duplicated below).</p>
<p>“Together, these results strongly suggest that a balance between cAMP synthesis by adenylate cyclases and cAMP degradation by phosphodiesterases contributes to rapid adaptive response of mycobacteria in a hostile intracellular environment (Johnson and McDonough, 2018; McDonough and Rodriguez, 2011).”</p>

<p>(12) L.95: Isn't PhoPR a two-component signal transduction system, the terminology that is more specific than a two-protein regulatory system?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As recommended by the reviewer, we have replaced “two protein regulatory system” with more specific “two-component signal transduction system” in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) L.124: check-point prevents things from happening. Here the mechanism you found allows growth and survival.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. As recommended by the reviewer, we have now modified the sentence in the revised manuscript (duplicated below).</p>
<p>“Together, the newly identified mechanism of regulation of cAMP level allows intraphagosomal survival and growth program of mycobacteria.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(14) L.132: why not say directly-&quot;---under normal, and NO and acid stress conditions (Fig. 1A).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As recommended by the reviewer, we have now deleted the first part of the sentence and directly stated that “we compared cAMP levels………. under normal, NO and acidic stress conditions” (duplicated below).</p>
<p>“We compared cAMP levels of WT and phoPR-KO (lacking both phoP and phoR), grown under normal, NO stress and acid stress conditions (Fig. 1A).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(15) L.134: The complementation is quite variable. Also true in Fig. 2A. If no simple answer, you can say- cAMP values increased in complemented cells, although to a variable extent, for reasons unknown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer. We have now incorporated new text in the ‘Results’ section of the revised manuscript (duplicated below):</p>
<p>“A higher cAMP level in the complemented strain under NO stress is possibly attributable to reproducibly higher phoP expression in the complemented mutant under specific stress conditions (Khan et al., 2022).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(16) L.154: You rather not say &quot;conclude&quot; and &quot;most likely&quot; at the same time. How about replacing &quot;we conclude&quot; with suggests? In that case, no need to say &quot;most likely&quot;. Also, in l.306-7 &amp; l.322-3.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. We have now modified the statements in the revised manuscript (duplicated below).</p>
<p>“We suggest that lower cAMP level of the mutant is not due to its higher efficacy of cAMP secretion.”</p>
<p>Following reviewer’s recommendation, we have incorporated similar changes in two other places of the ‘Results’ section of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>(19). Fig. 2C: There are no black and white bars. This is an important figure because the results appear in the abstract. The signal change from pH 7 to 4.5 is not much. An independent approach would have been desirable. If it were E. coli, I would have suggested beta-gal assay or in vivo footprints. Is a PhoP binding site recognizable in the promoter region of rv0805?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the inaccuracy. We have corrected it in the revised manuscript. Also, we have now carried out DNA binding assays, and included the EMSA data of rv0805 upstream regulatory region binding to phosphorylated PhoP (P~PhoP) as a supplemental figure (Figure 2-figure supplement 1A-B). In this figure, we have also incorporated our results on the likely PhoP binding site within rv0805up. The new figure, figure caption and the relevant results have been adjusted accordingly in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. Following reviewer’s recommendations, we have made numerous changes and rewritten the paragraph in the revised manuscript (duplicated below):</p>
<p>“In summary, upon sensing low acidic pH as a signal PhoR activates PhoP, P~PhoP binds to rv0805 upstream regulatory region and functions as a specific repressor of Rv0805. Therefore, we observed (a) a reproducibly lower level of cAMP in phoPR-KO relative to WT-H37Rv, (b) a significantly reduced expression of rv0805 in WT-H37Rv, grown under acidic pH relative to normal conditions, and (c) comparable cAMP levels in phoPR-KO and WT-Rv0805. This is why the two strains remain ineffective to mount an appropriate stress response, most likely due to their inability to coordinate regulation of gene expression because of dysregulation of intra-mycobacterial cAMP level. However, without uncoupling regulatory control of PhoPR and rv0805 expression, we cannot confirm that dysregulation of cAMP level accounts for virulence attenuation of phoPR-KO. Given the fact that rv0805-depleted M. tuberculosis is growth attenuated in vivo (McDowell et al., 2023), paradoxically ectopic expression of rv0805 leads to dysregulated metabolic adaptation, thereby resulting in reduced stress tolerance and intracellular survival.”</p>
<p>Also, the suggested changes have been incorporated in Fig. 6 and the figure caption.</p>

<p>(1) Rephrase this sentence in the abstract: “Because growing evidence connects PhoP with varying stress response, we hypothesized that the level of 3’,5’ cAMP, one of the most widely used second messengers, was regulated by the phoP locus, linking numerous stress responses with cAMP production”.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As recommended by the reviewer, we have now rewritten the sentence. The modified text is incorporated in the revised manuscript (duplicated below):</p>
<p>“cAMP is one of the most widely used second messengers, which impacts on a wide range of cellular responses in microbial pathogens including M. tuberculosis. Herein, we hypothesized that intra-mycobacterial cAMP level could be controlled by the phoP locus since the major regulator plays a key role in bacterial responses against numerous stress conditions.”</p>
<p>Also, please see our response to specific comments #1-3 of Reviewer 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Line 134: please describe the complementation strain features as it is mentioned for the first time (plasmid, copy number, promoter etc.) in the manuscript. Especially under NO stress what could be the authors' justification regarding the high cAMP concentration in the complementation strain?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As recommended by the reviewer, the details of construction of the complemented strain have been incorporated in the ‘Materials and Methods’ section of the revised manuscript (duplicated below):</p>
<p>“To complement phoPR expression, pSM607 containing a 3.6- kb DNA fragment of M. tuberculosis phoPR including 200-bp phoP promoter region, a hygromycin resistance cassette, attP site and the gene encoding phage L5 integrase, as detailed earlier (Walters et al., 2006) was used to transform phoPR mutant to integrate at the L5 attB site.”</p>
<p>To address the reviewer’s other concern, we have now included the following sentence in the ‘Results’ section of the revised manuscript (duplicated below):</p>
<p>“A higher cAMP level in the complemented strain under NO stress is possibly attributable to reproducibly higher phoP expression in the complemented mutant under specific stress condition (Khan et al., 2022).”</p>

<p>(3) In Figure 1C, it is a bit confusing to see the numbers 1,2,3 and 4 and nothing is referred to these numbers in the figure legend so it's better to remove them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer. We have now removed the lane numbers from the figure (Fig. 1C) in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(4) Line 852: rephrase it &quot;insignificantly different&quot;.</p>

<p>The suggested change has been made to the text. The modified text is incorporated in the manuscript (duplicated below):</p>
<p>“Note that the difference in expression levels of rv0805 between WT and phoPR-KO was significant (p&lt;0.01), whereas the fold difference in mRNA level between WT and the complemented mutant (Compl.) remains nonsignificant (not indicated).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Line198-200: There are no open/black bars, they all are coloured bars. Correct the same. The significance test should be done for the same gene (suppose rv0805 up) in different pH conditions. Right now, it is not revealing anything and misleading.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the inaccuracy. We have now rectified the error. As recommended by the reviewer, Fig. 4C was modified, and the significance tests were carried out between samples involving identical promoter enrichments under different pH conditions. The modified figure, figure legend, and the relevant results have been adjusted accordingly in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>The same complemented mutant strain, which has been described in the ‘Materials and Methods’ section of the revised manuscript, was used in the experiments described in Fig. 1A, Fig.1B and Fig. 2A.</p>

<p>As recommended by the reviewer, we have now mentioned the promoter of the vector and incorporated new text with regard to copy number of the expression vector in the revised manuscript (duplicated below).</p>
<p>“Although copy number of episomal vectors with pAl5000 origin of replication (oriM) have been reported to be 3 by Southern hybridization  (Ranes et al, 1990), in this case wild-type and mutant Rv0805 proteins were expressed from single-copy chromosomal integrants  (Parikh et al., 2013).”</p>

<p>(8) Figure 3 - Figure Supplement 1: not sure why the authors measured mRNA levels of rv1357 and rv2387? These genes were not overexpressed!</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The mRNA levels of rv1357 and rv2387 were measured to show that overexpression of either the wild-type or mutant Rv0805 did not influence expression of other PDEs like Rv1357 and Rv2387. We have now mentioned it explicitly in the revised manuscript (duplicated below).</p>
<p>“In contrast, other PDE encoding genes (rv1357 and rv2387), under identical conditions, demonstrate comparable expression levels in WT-H37Rv and rv0805 over-expressing strains.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Line 234: Wrong interpretation it should be PDE mRNA levels in WT-Rv0805 and WT-Rv0805M.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As recommended by the reviewer, we have now modified the statement to improve clarity (duplicated below).</p>
<p>“The corresponding mRNA levels of PDEs (wild-type and the mutant) are over-expressed approximately 4.5-6 -fold relative to the genomic rv0805 level of WT-H37Rv (Figure 3-figure supplement 1A).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) Line 237: Remove the sentence &quot;Thus, we conclude......identical expression strategy&quot;, you have already talked about why phosphodiesterase activity is crucial for cAMP concentration and it is well understood.</p>

<p>(11) Figure 3E: Authors should comment on why the cAMP concentration is not significantly changed even though the mRNA level changes are drastic (~90%). How do you correlate that? Is it because of other PDEs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. As suggested by the reviewer, we have now incorporated new text in the revised manuscript (duplicated below).</p>
<p>“We speculate that effective knocking down of phoP or rv0805 is not truly reflected in the extent of variation of cAMP levels possibly due to the presence of numerous other mycobacterial PDEs.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) Line 505,506: Is it the translation start site or the transcription start site? Because mRNA level changes are reported.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is the translational start sites, and gene-specific small guide RNAs were designed to inhibit mRNA expression.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) Line 292: There is a difference between red and green bars. Authors should do statistical analysis and then comment on whether overexpression of WT and mutant pde are different or similar, to me they are different; also, explain why the WT-Rv0805 strain is different than the phoPR-KO strain in the context of cell wall metabolism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As recommended by the reviewer, we have now included statistical significance of the data in the revised version, and modified the text accordingly in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Also, we included text explaining why WT-Rv0805 is different compared to phoPR-KO strain in the context of cell wall metabolism (duplicated below).</p>
<p>“Together, these results suggest that both strains expressing wild type or mutant PDEs share a largely similar cell-wall properties and are consistent with (a) a recent study reporting no significant effect of cAMP dysregulation on mycobacterial cell wall structure/permeability (Wong et al., 2023), and (b) role of PhoP in cell wall composition and complex lipid biosynthesis (Walters et al., 2006; Asensio et al., 2006; Goyal et al., 2011).”</p>
