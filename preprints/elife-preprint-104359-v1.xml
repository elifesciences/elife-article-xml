<title>Abstract</title><p>Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is an antiviral interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) that has several known anti-influenza functions such as interfering with viral nuclear import, regulating toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 and potentiating the expression of other ISGs. However, the exact mechanisms of anti-flu activity of PLSCR1 in relation to its expression compartment and enzymatic activity, and the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved have not been completely explored. Moreover, only limited animal models have been studied to delineate its role at the tissue level in influenza infections. We hypothesize that PLSCR1 protects hosts against IAV infection by regulating type 3 interferon (IFN-λ) signaling pathways. Our results showed that Plscr1 expression was highly induced by IAV infection <italic>in vivo</italic> and in epithelial cells treated with IFN-λ. We found that <italic>Plscr1</italic> knockout (KO) mice exhibited exacerbated body weight loss, decreased survival rates, heightened viral replication, and increased lung damage. Interestingly, transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that Plscr1 was required for type 3 interferon receptor (Ifn-λr1) expression, and impaired expression of Ifn-λr1 and downstream ISGs may be responsible for delayed viral clearance in Plscr1 KO mice. In addition, Plscr1 interacted with Ifn-λr1 within the epithelial compartment following IAV infection, suggesting Plscr1 may modulate IFN-λ signaling via protein-protein interactions. Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing data indicated that <italic>Plscr1</italic> expression was significantly upregulated in ciliated airway epithelial cells in mice following IAV infection. Consistently, <italic>Plscr1<sup>floxStop</sup>Foxj1-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice with ciliated epithelial cell-specific Plscr1 overexpression showed reduced susceptibility, less inflammation and enhanced Ifn-λr1 expression in IAV infection. Our research will elucidate virus-host interactions and pave the way for the development of novel anti-influenza drugs that target human elements like PLSCR1, thereby mitigating the emergence of drug-resistant IAV strains.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) is highly contagious and causes acute respiratory infectious disease transmitted by virus-containing droplets. Its segmented gene and wide host range facilitate frequent antigenic shift during coinfection, posing a significant threat to human health. IAV has caused several pandemics in human history, and seasonal flu remains a major health burden in present days, despite annual vaccination efforts[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Existing anti-flu drugs mainly target influenza virus proteins: 1) penetration and shelling inhibitors, such as Gocovri (amantadine) and Flumadine (Rimantadine); 2) neuraminidase inhibitors, such as Relenza (zanamivir), Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate), Rapivab (peramivir) and Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. However, the emergence of drug-resistant variant strains is common. Moreover, these direct antivirals have a short therapeutic window and are the most effective only if given within the first 48 hours after the initial infection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. In addition, IAV-induced acute inflammation could persist, leading to severe complications such as life-threatening pneumonia, immunopathology, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, there is a pressing need to understand host immune responses and develop anti-influenza drugs targeting host factors.</p>
<p>At the center of anti-flu immunity are the interferon pathways. Discovered a mere two decades ago, type 3 interferons were initially perceived as redundant to type 1 interferons, given their shared intracellular signaling pathways and antiviral activities. However, recent studies have revealed their unique properties, notably their signaling through a pair of heterodimer receptors (IFN-λR1/IL-10R2) distinct from type 1 interferon receptor complex (IFN-αR1/IFN-αR2)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. First of all, IFN-λ exhibits a constrained expression pattern compared to type 1 interferons. While type 1 interferons are expressed almost by all cells, IFN-λ is primarily secreted by cells at barrier surfaces, such as respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelial cells, dendritic cells and macrophages[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Moreover, their receptor distributions are vastly different. IFN-αR1/IFN-αR2 complex is present on nearly all cell types, but IFN-λR1/IL-10R2 complex is expressed exclusively on epithelial cells and few immune cells, including neutrophils and subsets of dendritic cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Most importantly, IFN-λ is produced earlier than type 1 interferons in IAV infection and can elicit effective antiviral responses without inflammation such as the release of tissue-damaging mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1β from neutrophils. In fact, only under a high dose of IAV are type 1 interferons detected, contributing to tissue immunopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Another exclusive anti-flu mechanism of IFN-λ is its role in preventing viral transmission from the upper airways to the lungs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Taken together, IFN-λ provides a non-redundant front-line shield against influenza virus.</p>
<p>PLSCR1 is the most studied member of the phospholipid scramblase protein family. It is a type II transmembrane protein generally located on the cell membrane, but can be imported into the nucleus and act as a transcriptional factor to regulate several gene expressions by directly binding to their promoter regions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. PLSCR1 is detected in all tissues and has a relatively high expression in lung. Although it is universally expressed across various cell types in the lung including alveolar epithelial cells and lymphocytes, macrophages have the highest expression, followed by endothelial cells and respiratory ciliated cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. The main function of PLSCR1 is to catalyze Ca2+ dependent, ATP independent, bidirectional and non-specific translocation of phospholipids between inner &amp; outer leaflet of plasma membrane. Scrambling of membrane phospholipids results in the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS), which acts as a docking site for many biological processes including coagulation, apoptosis, and activation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Intriguingly, PLSCR1 is also an antiviral ISG, as its expression can be highly induced by type 1 and 2 interferons in various viral infections[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. However, whether its expression can be similarly induced by type 3 interferon has not been studies yet.</p>
<p>Previous studies have described some critical anti-influenza activities of PLSCR1. For example, PLSCR1 interacts with the nucleoprotein (NP) of IAV, impairing its nuclear import and thereby suppressing virus replication in A549 cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. In addition, Plscr1 competes with immunoglobulin-like domain-containing receptor 1 (ILDR1) for NP binding, inhibiting swine influenza virus (SIV) infection in mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Besides direct interactions with the virus, PLSCR1 interacts with TLR9 and regulates its trafficking and ability to induce type I interferon production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, PLSCR1 is required to potentiate the expression of numerous other ISGs in response to IFN-β in Hey1B cells, including p56, ISG15 and OAS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. The goals of this project are to determine the roles of Plscr1 in an IAV-infected mouse model, to implicate its involvement in IFN-λ signaling, and to elucidate the cell types responsible for Plscr1-mediated anti-influenza activities.</p>
<p>To address this knowledge gap, we have employed a systematic approach, leveraging both global and cell type-specific <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Plscr1</italic> knock-in overexpression mice infected with mouse-adapted human IAV. Human respiratory epithelial cell lines harboring PLSCR1 mutations have also been used to elucidate the subcellular roles of PLSCR1. Our findings demonstrate that Plscr1 is an IFN-λ-stimulated gene, and it protects mice against IAV Infection by regulating <italic>IFN-λR1</italic> gene expression in the nucleus and interacting with IFN-λR1 protein on the cell membrane. Our research will aid in the understanding of virus-host interactions and the development of novel anti-influenza therapeutics targeting human components, preventing the emergence of drug-resistant IAV strains.</p>

<title>Plscr1 Suppresses Viral Replication and Protects Mice in IAV Infection</title>
<p>To uncover any anti-influenza functions of Plscr1 in mice, we employed <italic>Wt</italic> and <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and exposed them to IAV infection. We pursued a systematic approach including multiple endpoints and parameters to monitor mouse health, viral replication and dissemination, antiviral and inflammatory responses, and tissue damage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We established 300 plaque-forming unit (pfu) of IAV as the sublethal dose, and 900 pfu as the lethal dose resulting in ∼50% mortality in <italic>Wt</italic> mice (LD50). Significantly higher <italic>Plscr1</italic> expression was observed in <italic>Wt</italic> infected mice at 3 days post infection (dpi) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that Plscr1 is induced and potentially functions as an antiviral ISG in IAV infection <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<p>Weight loss generally started at 3 dpi for both mouse strains. <italic>Wt</italic> infected mice reached their lowest weights around 8 dpi, while <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> infected mice experienced continued weight loss for an additional 2 days. <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited significantly greater weight loss compared to <italic>Wt</italic> mice with both sublethal and lethal dose infection at multiple timepoints (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Moreover, upon infection with 900pfu lethal dose of IAV, <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice had a significantly lower survival rate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In fact, 100% of <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice died with 900 pfu of IAV in our experiment by 10 dpi.</p>
<p>To visualize IAV burden and spread from upper respiratory tract, paraffin-embedded lung sections were stained for H1N1-FITC. In contrast to <italic>Wt</italic> lungs where IAV infection was mostly local and restricted to major airways, <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> lungs had viral dissemination extending from bronchioles to alveoli, with ∼50% of lungs infected. Moreover, <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> lungs had significantly higher corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) than <italic>Wt</italic> lungs at 3 dpi, suggesting an overall higher viral burden during acute infection in the absence of Plscr1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). This observation was further supported by qRT-PCR analysis using cryopreserved lungs, as IAV M gene segment mRNA was significantly higher in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> lungs at 3 dpi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>

<p>Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was harvested for inflammatory cell counts using Cytospin followed by Diff-Quik stain. Immune cells infiltrated the lungs starting at 3 dpi and persisted at least until 10 dpi. <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice had significantly higher total BAL cell counts at 7 dpi compared to <italic>Wt</italic> mice, indicating a heightened inflammatory environment in alveoli during acute infection in the absence of Plscr1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). IAV attracted neutrophils in early infection (3-7 dpi) and lymphocytes in late infection (7-10 dpi).

<p>Lung sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) and histopathology was assessed. <italic>Plscr1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> lungs showed minor and localized tissue damage as early as at 3 dpi, when <italic>Wt</italic> lungs appeared normal. Consistently, aggravated immunopathology was evident in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>lungs at 7 and 10 dpi compared to <italic>Wt</italic> lungs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). These observations included increased thickening and collapse of alveolar walls, pulmonary edema surrounding alveolar walls, inflammatory cell infiltration in peri-bronchial and parenchymal areas, and hyperemia in the absence of Plscr1, suggesting its role in maintaining tissue homeostasis in IAV infection.</p>
<p>To assess the role of Plscr1 as an ISG, IFN expressions in whole lungs were measured by qRT-PCR. We found significantly elevated levels of <italic>IFN-α</italic>, <italic>β</italic>, <italic>γ</italic> and <italic>λ</italic> expression in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, particularly in early infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). This upregulation was associated with heightened production of Tnf-α at 3 dpi, as assessed by ELISA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). These cytokines may implicate in hyperactive feedforward inflammatory circuits during early IAV infection leading to acute lung injury in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], consistent with worsened histopathology. On the contrary, the expressions of these mediators in <italic>Wt</italic> mice were well controlled, facilitating virus elimination without inciting excessive inflammation. These findings underscore the antiviral and potentially immunoregulatory role of Plscr1.</p>

<title>Plscr1 Binds to <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic> Promoter and Activates <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic> Transcription in IAV Infection</title>
<p>To determine if IFN signaling pathways are regulated by Plscr1 during IAV infection, RNA sequencing was performed using pooled samples from <italic>Wt</italic> and <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse lungs infected with 300 pfu of IAV. A comprehensive examination of interferons and their receptors revealed that <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic> expression was significantly lower in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, despite high expression of <italic>Ifn-λ</italic> at both 3 and 7 dpi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic> was the only IFN receptor exhibiting this pattern, as the expression of its coreceptor <italic>Il10-rβ</italic> and other IFN receptors remained unaltered. The RNA sequencing result was further validated by qRT-PCR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). At a more fundamental level, we also observed alternations in ISG expressions, especially at 7 dpi. Many ISGs failed to be transcribed when <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic> function was impaired, including <italic>Fas, FasL</italic> and <italic>Bcl2</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). As a result, disrupted type 3 interferon signaling due to impaired expression of <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic> may underlie the delayed viral clearance and exacerbated immunopathology observed in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>].</p>

<p>To corroborate the cell-specific localization of Ifn-λr1 expression, <italic>Wt</italic> IAV-infected mouse lungs were probed with immunofluorescent antibodies to detect Ifn-λr1 and Foxj1 (a marker for ciliated epithelial cells), Uteroglobin (a marker for club cells) or Sftpc (a marker for type 2 alveolar epithelial (AT2) cells). Consistent with previous studies, Ifn-λr1 was present on all of these epithelial cell types (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). We further quantified Ifn-λr1 expression in selected airways by measuring mean intensity to disregard the differences in airway areas. Ifn-λr1 expression in alveoli were measured using Corrected Total Cell Fluorescence (CTCF), so that all fluorescent signals within the same size of alveolar areas were analyzed. Expression of Ifn-λr1 was significantly reduced in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse lungs, in both airways and alveoli regions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Calu-3 epithelial cells were then used to investigate if <italic>PLSCR1</italic> expression can be regulated by IFN-λ. Using qRT-PCR, we found <italic>PLSCR1</italic> transcription was significantly increased when stimulated with IFN-λ, and this effect was attenuated by pre-incubation with α-hIFNLR1 neutralizing antibody (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Additionally, IFN-λ could directly stimulate the expression of its receptor, <italic>IFN-λR1</italic>, thereby establishing a positive feedback loop to further drive the expression of <italic>PLSCR1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). These studies demonstrate that <italic>PLSCR1</italic> is an ISG that can be directly stimulated by IFN-λ in airway epithelial cells.</p>
<p>We subsequently investigated the mechanism underlying Plscr1’s transcriptional regulation of <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic> in airway epithelial cells. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by standard PCR in IAV-infected Calu-3 cells unveiled that Plscr1 physically bound to the promoter region of <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic>, with this binding becoming more evident in IAV-infected cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). These results were further validated using real-time quantitative PCR, suggesting that Plscr1 translocated into the nucleus of lung epithelial cells upon IAV infection to activate <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic> transcription (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>).</p>
<p>To further determine the regulation of Ifn-λr1 by Plscr1 in response to Ifn-λ signaling without the complexities associated with live virus infection, high molecular weight poly(I:C) was administered intranasally to mice daily for 6 days at 2.5mg/kg of body weight, and mice were sacrificed on the following day (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>). We observed an increase in total BAL cell counts with poly(I:C) administration, although there was no difference between <italic>Wt</italic> and <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1B</xref>). However, <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited a significantly higher number of lymphocytes in BAL (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that repetitive poly(I:C) administration might activate adaptive immune responses rather than the innate immune system in an acute IAV infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). All interferon expressions were elevated following poly(I:C) administration, with comparable levels observed between <italic>Wt</italic> and <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1D</xref>). Consistently, lung histopathology exhibited similar levels of inflammation or tissue damage in both <italic>Wt</italic> and <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1E</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Plscr1</italic> expression was significantly induced by poly(I:C) (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1F</xref>). Notably, although no other phenotypical or genotypical variances were observed in poly(I:C)-treated <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic> expression was significantly lower in these mice, further affirming the requirement of Plscr1 for <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic> expression in response to IFN-λ (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1G</xref>).</p>

<title>Plscr1 Interacts with Ifn-λr1 on Pulmonary Epithelial Cell Membrane in IAV Infection</title>
<p>We employed a combination of multiple biophysical approaches to fully assess the potential protein interaction between Plscr1 and Ifn-λr1. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) followed by western blot demonstrated that Plscr1 successfully pulled down Ifn-λr1 in both uninfected and IAV-infected <italic>Wt</italic> mouse lungs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistently, using proximity ligation assay (PLA, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), we detected direct interactions between Ifn-λr1 and Plscr1 on airway and alveolar epithelial cells in <italic>Wt</italic> mouse lungs. Noteworthily, significantly more and stronger PLA signals per area were detected in IAV-infected lungs compared to uninfected lungs. In agreement with the PLA, in unpermeablized Calu-3 cells, Plscr1 and Ifn-λr1 colocalized on the cell membrane after IAV infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, neither colocalization nor clear expression of Plscr1 or Ifn-λr1 was evident without infection, implying an infection-specific interaction in human airway epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Hence, Plscr1 may regulate Ifn-λr1 expression and IFN-λ signaling in airway epithelial cells through both gene transcription and protein interaction in IAV infection.</p>

<title>Both Cell Surface and Nuclear PLSCR1 Regulates IFN-λ Signaling and Limits IAV Infection Independent of Its Enzymatic Activity</title>
<p>PLSCR1 mutants with specific PLSCR1 cellular distribution were employed to determine the relative contributions of cell surface and nuclear PLSCR1 in regulating IFN-λ signaling and IAV infection. PLSCR1 contains a 5-cysteine palmitoylation motif (C<sup>184</sup>CCPCC<sup>189</sup>), where substitution of these cysteines with alanine (labeled 5CA) completely abolishes its membrane localization, leading to exclusive localization in the cytosol and nucleus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. On the other hand, a single amino acid mutation of histidine<sup>262</sup> to tyrosine (labeled H262Y) in the non-classical nuclear localization signal of PLSCR1 completely abates its nuclear localization, leaving PLSCR1 exclusively in the cytosol and on the cell membrane[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. In addition, given that PS externalization plays a role in cell death regulation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], we asked whether the enzymatic activity of PLSCR1 interferes with IFN-λ signaling. Phenylalanine<sup>281</sup> in the β-barrel hydrophobic loop region of PLSCR1 has been shown to be important for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PS exposure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], and a substitution with alanine (labeled F281A) renders PLSCR1 enzymatically inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>PLSCR1(WT), PLSCR1(5CA), PLSCR1(H262Y) and PLSCR1(F281A)</italic> plasmids built on PLV-EF1a-IRES-Hygro backbone were amplified in DH5α competent cells, co-transfected with HIV lentivector into 293T cells, and transduced into <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> A549 cells. After a 10-day hygromycin selection, transduction efficiency and subcellular locations of PLSCR1 were analyzed using flow cytometry (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>PLSCR1(WT)</italic> exhibited higher PLSCR1 expression than <italic>Plscr1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cells, indicating overexpression resulting from transduction (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2B</xref>). Consistent with previous findings, <italic>PLSCR1(5CA)</italic> exhibited low surface expression, and <italic>PLSCR1(H262Y)</italic> had low nuclear expression of PLSCR1. <italic>PLSCR1(F281A)</italic> showed a similar distribution compared to <italic>PLSCR1(WT)</italic>, confirming that the loss of enzymatic activity did not restrict the subcellular localization. Transduction efficiency ranged between 37% to 70% (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Upon IAV infection, <italic>PLSCR1</italic> was robustly induced in <italic>PLSCR1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cells or cells transduced with all PLSCR1 constructs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), consistent with previous <italic>in vivo</italic> data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).

We found that PLSCR1 nuclear import was required for <italic>IFN-λR1</italic> transcription, as <italic>IFN-λR1</italic> transcription was not induced in cells transduced with <italic>PLSCR1(H262Y)</italic> or in <italic>PLSCR1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).

<p>When compared to <italic>PLSCR1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cells, <italic>PLSCR1(WT)</italic>, <italic>PLSCR1(5CA)</italic> and <italic>PLSCR1(F281A)</italic> similarly protected against IAV infection, but <italic>PLSCR1(H262Y)</italic> only exhibited a partial viral clearance, shown by viral copy numbers extracted from cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). This is further validated with a cell coverage assay when a high dose IAV was used for infection. Since the proliferation between differently transduced cell lines was similar and all cells were grown to full confluency before infection, the cell coverage represented resistance to infection and survival of cells. While <italic>PLSCR1(5CA)</italic> and <italic>PLSCR1(F281A)</italic> had a high surface coverage comparable to <italic>PLSCR1(WT)</italic>, <italic>PLSCR1(H262Y)</italic> lost about half of the coverage (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).

<p>Within the epithelial populations, <italic>Plscr1</italic> was mainly expressed by ciliated epithelial cells, mesothelial epithelial cells, Epcam+Pecam1+ cells, club cells and AT1 cells (in decreasing order of aggregated expression, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Conversely, AT2 cells, epithelial-mesenchymal transitional cells and Krt8+ cells exhibited very low levels of <italic>Plscr1</italic> expression. Among the various epithelial populations, ciliated epithelial cells not only had the highest aggregated expression of <italic>Plscr1</italic>, but also were the only epithelial cell population in which significantly more <italic>Plscr1</italic> was induced in response to IAV infection. Moreover, the increased expression of Plscr1 persisted for at least 21 days in ciliated epithelial cells, suggesting that Plscr1 may primarily exert its anti-flu activities in these cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>).</p>
<p>For the predominant ciliated epithelial cell cluster, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the differentially expressed genes to compare potentially distinct functions before and after infection (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). We found that the most upregulated pathways at 1 dpi were related to protein folding and localization, indicating a rapid cellular response to infection by altering their protein profile. At 21 dpi, ciliated epithelial cells were characterized by adaptive immune regulation, such as antigen presentation and memory cell generation. At 3 and 6 dpi, ciliated epithelial cells exhibited similar innate immune and inflammatory signatures dominated by interferon signaling. As expected, <italic>Plscr1</italic> participated in all of the top 10 enriched pathways, implying that it could facilitate robust antiviral responses in ciliated epithelial cells as an ISG during acute infection.</p>
<p>Gene expression levels of the most differentially expressed genes at individual timepoints in ciliated epithelial cells were shown in a heatmap (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Signature genes for cells at homeostasis included <italic>Jund</italic> (JunD proto-oncogene), <italic>mt-Nd3</italic> (mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase 3) and <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C), which are regulators of cell metabolism and proliferation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Signature genes enriched at 1 dpi were <italic>Hspa5</italic> (heat shock protein family A member 5), <italic>Hsph1</italic> (heat shock protein family H member 1) and <italic>Clu</italic> (clusterin), which play critical roles in protein folding and assembly[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Consistent with the GO analysis, ciliated cells at 3 and 6 dpi had very similar signature genes associated with interferon pathways, namely a large component of ISGs, such as <italic>Isg15</italic> (interferon-stimulated gene 15), <italic>Oasl2</italic> (2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthetase like 2) and <italic>Irf7</italic> (interferon regulatory factor 7). Importantly, Plscr1 is required to potentiate the expressions of many of these ISGs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], highlighting its potentially multifunction in anti-flu responses of ciliated epithelial cells. Signature genes for 21 dpi largely overlapped with those for 10 dpi, containing many histocompatibility 2, class II antigen proteins, which are mediators of MHC class II antigen processing and presentation.</p>
<p>In contrast to epithelial clusters, immune populations had low levels of <italic>PLSCR1</italic>, with relatively high expressions observed in alveolar macrophages, NK cells and regulatory T cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). However, we did not observe any significant difference in PLSCR1 levels before and post-infection in macrophages and neutrophils (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6H</xref>), the two immune populations that express IFN-λR1 besides dendritic cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We are the first group to demonstrate the roles of Plscr1 in a mouse-adapted human IAV-infected mouse model, to implicate its IFN-λ signaling-related mechanisms, and to elucidate the cell types that are responsible for Plscr1-mediated anti-influenza activities. We established <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and found them more susceptible to IAV (WSN) compared to <italic>WT</italic> mice, as evidenced by greater weight loss in both sublethal and lethal infection and poorer survival in a lethal infection. Further examination of infected lungs provided the first <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence demonstrating that Plscr1 suppressed human IAV replication. This observation aligns with previous report indicating that PLSCR1 interacts with the IAV NP, thereby impairing its nuclear import <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Notably, while differences in viral copy numbers were only observed at the early stages of infection, coinciding with a significant increase in <italic>Plscr1</italic> transcription, these changes had profound implications for host fitness. Therefore, as one of the earliest induced ISGs, Plscr1 constitutes the frontline defense against influenza infection.</p>
<p>While the only previously published <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse flu model focused on an H1N1 SIV infection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], our data showed both similarities and discrepancies. First, while both studies observed that Plscr1 promoted survival during IAV infection, SIV-infected <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited weight loss similar to <italic>Wt</italic> mice. Furthermore, while both models attributed the lower survival rate in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice to increased viral replication, SIV-infected <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> lungs exhibited higher viral titers across all examined time points, from 1 to 7 dpi. Intriguingly, contrary to our observations, <italic>Plscr1</italic> expression was markedly decreased in SIV infection. Given previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies demonstrating PLSCR1 induction by IAV (WSN)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] and type 1 IFNs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], we propose that the contradictory trend observed by Liu et al. may be attributed to distinct properties of SIV, such as viral replication rate, both the cellular tropism and the tissue tropism (proximal or distal lung), or antigen variation which may affect direct interaction with PLSCR1, innate sensing of the infection, or recognition by the adaptive immune response.</p>
<p>The delicate balance between immunity and immunopathology plays a pivotal role in determining host fitness during viral infections. To interrogate immunopathology in the lungs, we accessed the BAL, histology and interferon expressions. BAL from <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were highly enriched with inflammatory neutrophils and lymphocytes, which were likely attracted by robust IFNs and other chemokines. Consistently, <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited more severe lung damage and a greater extent of affected areas. These findings indicate that Plscr1 not only enhances immunity but also mitigates immunopathology. Importantly, regardless of excessive production of antiviral IFNs in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, they failed to effectively control the initial viral infection. This suggests that the absence of Plscr1 impairs the IFN signaling pathway, highlighting the crucial role of Plscr1 in facilitating effective antiviral responses.</p>
<p>Although type 1 and 3 IFNs may share similar downstream pathways, they rely on distinct receptors for signaling. Consistent with previous findings[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], Ifn-λr1 was detected in respiratory epithelium, including ciliated epithelial cells, club cells and AT2 cells during infection. Loss of Plscr1 exclusively impaired <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic> transcription in early IAV infection, with this transcriptional difference translating into protein expression. IFN-λ is crucial for early viral control within the initial days of infection without igniting unnecessary inflammation and compromising host fitness[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. With limited Ifn-λr1 expression, <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were unable to mount a robust type 3 IFN response to control early viral infection. Instead, they relied largely on type 1 interferons, which succeeded in eliminating IAV at later time points, but led to exaggerated immunopathology. Furthermore, our observations of enhanced neutrophilia, lung injury and lethality in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice align with findings reported in <italic>Ifn-λr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice in IAV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>].</p>
<p>PLSCR1 expression was increased in response to IFN-λ in human airway epithelial cells, consistent with previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. While PLSCR1 typically localizes on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm, it translocates into nucleus to bind the <italic>IFN-λR1</italic> promoter upon IAV infection, thereby regulating <italic>IFN-λR1</italic> transcription. The nuclear localization and functions of PLSCR1 have been extensively documented in previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Relevantly, IFN-α promotes the nuclear translocation of PLSCR1 in breast cancer cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Therefore, it is highly plausible that the nuclear trafficking of PLSCR1 in airway epithelial cells is similarly stimulated by IFN-α produced during IAV infection, but further evidence is demanded. Additionally, the precise binding site for PLSCR1 within the <italic>IFN-λR1</italic> promoter and the binding motif on PLSCR1 remain unknown. Previous bioinformatics predictions revealed that the −430∼-421 segment of <italic>IFN-λR1</italic> promoter likely contains binding sites for a number of transcription factors (TFs) with important regulatory functions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Further mutagenesis studies, such as truncations or single nucleotide mutations within these sequences, could be done to identify the specific motif for PLSCR1 binding. Finally, it is not clear whether PLSCR1 directly activates <italic>IFN-λR1</italic> expression by acting as a TF, or as a co-factor enhancing other TF’s transcriptional activity. Coimmunoprecipitations could be pursued in future to explore the binding potential between PLSCR1 and other known TFs for <italic>IFN-λR1</italic>, such as NF-Y[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to activities in the nucleus, PLSCR1 has been shown to interact with multiple proteins on the plasma or endosomal membrane[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Here we reported a novel interaction between PLSCR1 and IFN-λR1 on airway epithelial cell membrane <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, confirmed with both coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. Since their interaction was significantly enhanced after IAV infection, we speculate that membrane-bound PLSCR1 is a positive regulator of IFN-λR1 signaling. One plausible mechanism is that PLSCR1 facilitates the intracellular trafficking of IFN-λR1, akin to its role in assisting the trafficking of other membrane receptors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>].</p>
<p>The subcellular location of PLSCR1 is vital not only for interactions with host components, but also for direct viral control. We found that nuclear PLSCR1 is both necessary and sufficient for viral control in airway epithelial cells, whereas membrane PLSCR1 provides only partial protection against IAV infection. These findings are not surprising, as the previously reported anti-flu mechanism of PLSCR1 also relies on its nuclear localization signal to restrict the import of IAV NP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, besides <italic>IFN-λR1</italic>, PLSCR1 enhances the expression of a select subset of ISGs in IAV infection as well, a mechanism potentially mediated by nuclear PLSCR1 on ISG gene transcription[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. On the other hand, membrane PLSCR1 may modulate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, thereby augmenting the optimal anti-viral activity of these ISGs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. We found that membrane PLSCR1 interacts with IFN-λR1 protein in IAV infection, suggesting that it could facilitate viral elimination to some extent.</p>
<p>PLSCR1 is most well-known for its scramblase activity that favors PS exposure, apoptosis and phagocytosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Using an enzymatically inactive mutant of PLSCR1, we uncoupled its lipid scramblase activity from anti-influenza activity. There are several potential explanations for this finding. First, our epithelial cell culture lacked phagocytes, therefore the impact of apoptosis followed by phagocytosis induced by PLSCR1 is minimal. Future studies using mice that harbor <italic>Plscr1(F281A)</italic> mutation would be needed to verify the role of lipid scramblase activity and epithelial cell apoptosis in the presence of phagocytes. Second, PLSCR1 exhibits only weak enzymatic activities compared to other members of lipid scramblase family, possibly due to its vastly different central β-barrel structure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. PS externalization may be compensated by other more potent scramblases. Importantly, the lipid scramblase activity of PLSCR1 has been shown to be dispensable for its anti-SARS-CoV-2 function in a similar manner[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], suggesting a general lack of significance for its enzymatic activity in viral infections.</p>
<p>While scRNA-seq analysis revealed that endothelial cells express Plscr1 most abundantly in the lung, they are not the major target of IAV infection, and IAV does not efficiently replicate in them[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Instead, airway epithelial cells are the frontline defense against respiratory pathogens, with ciliated epithelial cells being the only cell type that express α2,3-linked SA, the primary influenza virus receptor in the mouse airway[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Coincidently, our scRNA-seq results showed that ciliated epithelial cells not only had the highest aggregated expression of <italic>Plscr1</italic>, but also were the only epithelial cell population in which significantly more <italic>Plscr1</italic> was induced in response to IAV infection. Experiments with <italic>Plscr1<sup>floxStop</sup>Foxj1-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice further supported ciliated epithelial cell-dependent protection against IAV, with improved immunity and viral clearance, and dampened immunopathology at as early as 3 dpi. These findings suggest that as a result of enhanced Ifn-λr1 due to Plscr1 overexpression, type 3 interferons were able to exert their advantages being the earliest produced interferon, mounting both antiviral and anti-inflammatory responses in ciliated epithelial cells.</p>
<p>Taken together, our findings highlight the essential role of PLSCR1 in the regulation of IFN-λR1 transcription in nucleus and expression on plasma membrane, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These mechanisms are crucial for inhibiting viral spread, reducing inflammation, and enhancing overall host fitness during IAV infection. Further, we found that the enzymatic activity of PLSCR1 is dispensable for its anti-influenza function. Finally, ciliated airway epithelial cells are the primary cell type in the lung for mounting PLSCR1-mediated anti-influenza responses. The potential of PLSCR1 agonists that target ciliated airway epithelial cells as therapeutic treatments for influenza holds promise for future medical interventions. Moreover, our results have the potential to impact the classical yet evolving field of IFN signaling. Not only do these findings elucidate and expand our understanding of newly discovered IFN-λ signaling, but they also shed light on the specific cell types and conditions under which IFN-λ signaling is modulated. Given the significance of IFN-λ signaling in various infectious diseases, these insights may pave the way for innovative therapeutics approaches targeting corresponding regulatory molecules in the treatment of other microbial infections in addition to influenza.</p>

Brightfield images were converted to 8-bit and the threshold was adjusted using a dark background in ImageJ[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Areas of interest were selected using oval selection. Cell coverages were quantified by measuring mean grey values of each well.</p>

<title>Bulk RNA sequencing</title>
<p>Selected RNA isolated from mouse lungs in the same treatment group were pooled together into one sample. Pooled RNA concentrations were measured using a Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific). Quality control, library preparation, bulk RNA sequencing and data analysis was performed by Azenta Genomics/GENEWIZ. Heatmaps were made with expressions of selected genes in Morpheus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus">https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus</ext-link>).</p>

<p>Single cell RNA sequencing dataset were generated from uninfected or IAV-infected mouse lungs at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 21 dpi as previously described[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. The 10X gene-expression data were processed and normalized using CellRanger (v.3.0.2, 10X Genomics)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>].

<title>Quantitation and statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed on GraphPad Prism software. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare survival rates. Ordinary two-way ANOVA tests were used to compare weight losses. Statistical significance of differences was assessed using the parametric Student’s two-tailed t tests for all other normally distributed data. Differences were considered significant when p &lt; 0.05. Outlier tests with the ROUT method (Q = 1%) were used to identify and remove any outliers.</p>

<p>This manuscript by Yang et al. presents a potentially novel mechanism by which Plscr1 defends against influenza virus infection. Using a global knockout (KO) and a tissue-specific overexpression mouse model, the authors demonstrate that Plscr1-KO mice exhibit increased susceptibility and inflammation following IAV infection. In contrast, overexpression of Plscr1 in ciliated epithelial cells protects mice from infection. Through transcriptomic analysis in mice and mechanistic studies in cell culture models, the authors reveal that Plscr1 transcriptionally upregulates Ifnlr1 expression and physically interacts with this receptor on the plasma membrane, thereby enhancing IFN-λ-mediated viral clearance.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a well-performed study, however, causality between Plscr1 and Ifnlr1 expression needs to be more firmly established. This is because two recent studies of PLSCR1 KO cells infected with different viruses found no major differences in gene expression levels compared with their WT controls (Xu et al. Nature, 2023; LePen et al. PLoS Biol, 2024). There were also defects in the expression of other cytokines (type I and II IFNs plus TNF-alpha) so a clear explanation of why Ifnlr1 was chosen should also be given.</p>
<p>While Plscr1 has long been recognized as a cell-intrinsic antiviral restriction factor, few studies have explored its broader physiological role. This study thus provides interesting insights into a specific function of Plscr1 in IAV-permissive airway epithelial cells and its contribution to whole-body anti-viral immunity. There are three important issues that should be addressed, and several minor points should also be considered.</p>
<p>(1) The authors propose that Plscr1 restricts IAV infection by regulating the type III IFN signaling pathway. While the data show a positive correlation between Ifnlr1 and Plscr1 levels in both mouse and cell culture models, additional evidence is needed to establish causality between the impaired type III IFN pathway, and the increased susceptibility observed in Plscr1-KO mice. To strengthen this conclusion, the following experiments could be undertaken: (i) Measure IAV titers in WT, Plscr1-KO, Ifnlr1-KO, and Plscr1/ Ifnlr1-double KO cells. If the antiviral activity of Plscr1 is highly dependent on Ifnlr1, there should be no further increase in IAV titers in double KO cells compared to single KO cells; (ii) over-express Plscr1 in Ifnlr1-KO cells to determine if it still inhibits IAV infection. If Plscr1's main action is to upregulate Ifnlr1, then it should not be able to rescue susceptibility since Ifnlr1 cannot be expressed in the KO background. If Plscr1 over-expression rescues viral susceptibility, then there are Ifnlr1-independent mechanisms involved. These experiments should help clarify the relative contribution of the type III IFN pathway to Plscr1-mediated antiviral immunity.</p>
<p>(2) Transcriptional activation of IFNLR1 by Plscr1 is a central mechanistic conclusion of this manuscript. A ChIP assay was used to demonstrate direct binding between Plscr1 and the Ifnrl1 promoter region. This single evidence does not sufficiently prove the role of Plscr1 in transcriptional activation. Other forms of evidence would help make this mechanistic explanation more compelling. For example, nuclear un-on experiments would demonstrate Ifnrl1 mRNA synthesis in addition to promoter binding.</p>
<p>(3) In Figure 4, the authors demonstrate the interaction between Plscr1 and Ifnlr1. They suggest that this interaction modulates IFN-λ signaling. However, Figures 5C-E show that the 5CA mutant, which lacks surface localization and the ability to bind Ifnlr1, exhibits similar anti-flu activity to WT Plscr1. Does this mean the interaction between Plscr1 and Ifnlr1 is dispensable for Plscr1-mediated antiviral function? Can the authors compare the activation of IFN-λ signaling pathway in Plscr1-KO cells expressing empty vector, WT Plscr1, and 5CA mutant? This could be done by measuring downstream ISG expression or using an ISRE-luciferase reporter assay upon IFN-λ treatment.</p>

<p>This nice study explores the role of phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) in regulating antiviral immunity and host morbidity during influenza A virus (IAV) infection. The authors identify PLSCR1 as a critical regulator of interferon-lambda receptor 1 (IFNLR1) expression, acting through enzymatic-independent mechanisms. Using PLSCR1-deficient and conditional overexpression mouse models, the study demonstrates that PLSCR1 enhances antiviral responses and mitigates inflammation, potentially through modulating type III interferon (IFN-λ) signaling. While the findings underline the importance of PLSCR1 in early viral control and tissue homeostasis, they also highlight its cell-specific functions, particularly in ciliated airway epithelial cells. This work contributes to understanding the interplay between host factors and antiviral pathways, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting host proteins.</p>
<p>Specific Comments:</p>
<p>(1) The statement that type I interferons are expressed by &quot;almost all cells&quot; is inaccurate (line 61). Type I IFN production is also context-dependent and often restricted to specific cell types upon infection or stimulation.</p>
<p>(2) The antiviral response is assessed solely through flu M gene expression. Incorporating infectious virus titers (e.g., TCID50 or plaque assay) would provide a more robust and direct measure of antiviral activity.</p>
<p>(3) While mRNA expression of interferons is measured, protein levels (e.g., through ELISA) should also be quantified to establish the functional relevance of IFN expression changes.</p>
<p>(4) It is unclear whether reduced IFNLR1 expression translates to defective downstream signaling or antiviral responses after IFN-λ treatment in PLSCR1-deficient cells. This is particularly pertinent given the increase in IFN-λ ligand in vivo, which might compensate for receptor downregulation.</p>
<p>(5) Detailed gating strategies for immune cell subsets are absent and should be included for clarity and reproducibility.</p>
<p>(6) The study does not definitively establish that reduced IFN-λ signaling causes the observed in vivo phenotype. Increased morbidity and mortality in PLSCR1-deficient mice could also stem from elevated TNF-α levels and lung damage, as proinflammatory cytokines and/or enhanced lung damage are known contributors to influenza morbidity and mortality. This point warrants detailed discussions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Yang et al. have investigated the role of PLSCR1, an antiviral interferon-stimulated gene (ISG), in host protection against IAV infection. Although some antiviral effects of PLSCR1 have been described, its full activity remains incompletely understood.</p>
<p>This study now shows that Plscr1 expression is induced by IAV infection in the respiratory epithelium, and Plscr1 acts to increase Ifn-λr1 expression and enhance IFN-λ signaling possibly through protein-protein interactions on the cell membrane.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study sheds light on the way Ifnlr1 expression is regulated, an area of research where little is known. The study is extensive and well-performed with relevant genetically modified mouse models and tools.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are some issues that need to be clarified/corrected in the results and figures as presented.</p>
<p>Also, the study does not provide much information about the role of PLSCR1 in the regulation of Ifn-λr1 expression and function in immune cells. This would have been a plus.</p>
