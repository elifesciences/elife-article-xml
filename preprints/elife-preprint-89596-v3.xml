<title>Abstract</title><p>In pancreatic islet β cells, molecular motors use cytoskeletal polymers microtubules as tracks for intracellular transport of insulin secretory granules. The β-cell microtubule network has a complex architecture and is non-directional, which provides insulin granules at the cell periphery for rapid secretion response, yet to avoid over-secretion and subsequent hypoglycemia. We have previously characterized a peripheral sub-membrane microtubule array, which is critical for the withdrawal of excessive insulin granules from the secretion sites. Microtubules in β cells originate at the Golgi in the cell interior, and how the peripheral array is formed is unknown. Using real-time imaging and photo-kinetics approaches in clonal mouse pancreatic β cells MIN6, we now demonstrate that kinesin KIF5B, a motor protein with a capacity to transport microtubules as cargos, slides existing microtubules to the cell periphery and aligns them to each other along the plasma membrane. Moreover, like many physiological β-cell features, microtubule sliding is facilitated by a high glucose stimulus. These new data, together with our previous report that in high glucose sub-membrane MT array is destabilized to allow for robust secretion, indicate that MT sliding is another integral part of glucose-triggered microtubule remodeling, likely replacing destabilized peripheral microtubules to prevent their loss over time and β-cell malfunction.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The precise level of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from pancreatic β cells is crucial for glucose homeostasis. On one hand, insufficient insulin secretion decreases glucose uptake by peripheral tissues, leading to diabetes. On the other hand, excessive secretion causes glucose depletion from the bloodstream and hypoglycemia. Not surprisingly, multiple levels of cellular regulation control the amount of insulin secretory granules (IGs) released on every stimulus. One level of this control is facilitated by microtubules (MTs), intracellular polymers that serve as tracks for intracellular transport of IGs and define how many IGs are positioned at the secretion sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Desai and Mitchison 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Varadi et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Heaslip et al. 2014</xref>). Thus, the architecture and dynamics of the MT network is instrumental for secretion control.</p>
<p>The findings in the last decade have uncovered that the organization and regulation of the β-cell MT network are quite unusual. As in several other eukaryotic cells, MTs in β cells are nucleated at MT-organizing centers (MTOCs) in the cell interior, partially at the centrosome and to a large extent at the Golgi membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhu et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Trogden et al. 2019</xref>). Conventionally, this should be followed by MT plus-end polymerization toward the cell periphery, resulting in a radial MT array with high MT density in the center rather than in the periphery. However, the β cell lacks such MT polarity, well-characterized in mesenchymal cells in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bracey et al. 2022</xref>). Instead, interior β-cell MTs are twisted and interlocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Varadi et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhu et al. 2015</xref>), while peripheral MTs are arranged in a prominent array of co-aligned and often bundled MTs underlying the cell membrane, hereafter called the sub-membrane MT array or the peripheral MT array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bracey et al. 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Like other features on β-cell physiology, MTs in β cells are regulated by glucose metabolism. As protein polymers, MTs are capable of regulated polymerization and depolymerization, which allows for fine-tuning of their organization. Under basal glucose conditions, β-cell MTs are stable and undergo little turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhu et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ho et al. 2020</xref>). Sub-membrane MT arrays are especially highly stabilized by a MT-associated protein (MAP) tau, well-known for its neuronal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ho et al. 2020</xref>). Upon a high glucose stimulus, tau is phosphorylated and sub-membrane MTs undergoes destabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ho et al. 2020</xref>) and fragmentation, possibly via a MT-severing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Muller et al. 2021</xref>). MT destabilization is accompanied by facilitated formation of new MTs at the main β-cell MTOC, the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Trogden et al. 2019</xref>), and increased MT polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Heaslip et al. 2014</xref>), which are thought to replace destabilized MTs and restore the MT network.</p>
<p>Such complex, glucose-dependent organization of MT networks in β cells is thought to underly a multi-faceted involvement of MT transport in insulin secretion regulation: MTs regulate the availability of IGs for secretion in both positive and negative fashion. Firstly, Golgi-derived MTs are necessary for efficient IG generation at the trans Golgi network (TGN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Trogden et al. 2019</xref>). Secondly, interior MTs are to a large extent responsible for IG transportation throughout the cell, which occurs predominantly in the non-directional, diffusion-like manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tabei et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhu et al. 2015</xref>), likely due to the interlocked configuration of the interior MT network. In addition, directional MT-dependent runs of secretion-competent granules toward the cell periphery have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hoboth et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Muller et al. 2021</xref>). These processes contribute to the positive regulation of GSIS by preparing and distributing IG. At the same time, sub-membrane MT arrays serve for withdrawal of excessive peripheral IGs from the secretion sites, which prevents IG docking and acute over-secretion upon a given stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhu et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bracey et al. 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hu et al. 2021</xref>). The latter process provides a negative MT regulation of secretion.</p>
<p>During GSIS, the above-mentioned glucose-dependent destabilization of the sub-membrane MT array must reduce IG withdrawal and downplay the negative MT-dependent regulation of secretion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bracey et al. 2020</xref>). At the same time, new MTs polymerizing off the Golgi facilitate IG biogenesis and provide material to rebuild destabilized network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Trogden et al. 2019</xref>). This is likely preparing cells for the next round of stimulation. Thus, existing data provide at least initial understanding of the mechanisms whereby β-cell MT architecture allows for fine-tuning of GSIS levels.</p>
<p>However, it is yet unclear how the complex β-cell MT network forms. Being nucleated at MTOCs in the cell interior, it is puzzling that the resulting β-cell MTs are not organized in conventional radial arrays and rather form a prominent peripheral array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bracey et al. 2020</xref>). The goal of this study is to uncover the mechanisms underlying development of β-cell-specific MT network.</p>
<p>One of the established ways to modify the MT network without changing the location of MTOCs is to relocate already polymerized MTs by active motor-dependent transport. This phenomenon is called “MT sliding” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Straube et al. 2006</xref>). Several MT-dependent molecular motors have been implicated in driving MT sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lu and Gelfand 2017</xref>). In some cases, a motor facilitates MT sliding by walking along a MT while its cargo-binding domain is stationary being attached to a relatively large structure, e.g. plasma membrane. This causes sliding of a MT which served as a track for the stationary motor. This mechanism has been described for dynein-dependent MT sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">He et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Grabham et al. 2007</xref>). MTs can also be efficiently slid by motors which have two functional motor assemblies, such as a tetrameric kinesin-5/Eg5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Acar et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Vukusic et al. 2021</xref>), or which carry a MT as a cargo while walking along another MT. For the latter mechanism, a motor needs a non-motor domain with a capacity to bind either a MT itself, or a MT-associated protein as an adapter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kurasawa et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cao et al. 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Vukusic et al. 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Out of these MT sliding factors, kinesin-1 is known to be critical for organizing unusual MT architecture in specialized cells. In oocytes, kinesin-1-dependent MT sliding empowers cytoplasmic streaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barlan et al. 2013</xref>). In differentiating neurons, kinesin-1 moves organelles and MTs into emerging neurites, which is a defining step in developing branched MT networks and long-distance neuronal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jolly et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lu et al. 2013</xref>). With these data in mind, kinesin-1 presents itself as the most attractive candidate for organizing MTs in β cells. This motor is highly expressed in β cells and is well known to act as a major driving force in IG transport and GSIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Meng et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Varadi et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Varadi et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cui et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we show that KIF5B, being the major variant of kinesin-1 in β cells, actively slides MTs in this cell type. We show that this phenomenon defines MT network morphology and supplies MTs for the sub-membrane array. Moreover, we find that MT sliding in β cells is a glucose-dependent process and thus likely participates in metabolically driven cell reorganization during each secretion cycle.</p>

<title>Identification of KIF5B as the MT sliding motor in β cells</title>
<p>To address the factors that shape the configuration of MT networks in β cells, we tested for a potential involvement of motors-dependent MT sliding. Not surprisingly, analysis of existing RNA-sequencing data in functional mouse islet β cells highlighted kinesin-1 KIF5B as the highest expressing β-cell motor protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sanavia et al. 2021</xref>). Since this kinesin has been reported to have MT sliding activity in many types of interphase cells, we tested its potential ability to slide MTs in β cells.</p>

</fig>
<p>Efficient depletion of KIF5B was achieved by utilizing two independent lentiviral-based shRNA against mouse KIF5B in mouse insulinoma cell line MIN6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, Fig. 1-Suppl. Fig. 1A). To visualize MT sliding, shRNA-treated MIN6 cells expressing mEmerald-tubulin were imaged by live-cell spinning disk confocal microscopy. We photobleached MTs in two large cell regions leaving a thin unbleached band (“fluorescent belt”) and analyzed relocation of MTs from the “fluorescent belt” into the bleached areas over time. To minimize the effects of plausible MT polymerization and to reduce photobleaching, MTs were imaged for short time periods (5 mins). Strikingly, in control cells (treated with scrambled control shRNA) MTs were efficiently translocated from the “fluorescent belt” into the photobleached area, indicating that MT sliding events are prominent in this cell type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C,D</xref>). In contrast, MIN6 cells expressing either KIF5B shRNA variants displayed a significant loss of MT sliding ability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C,E,F</xref>, Fig.1-Video 1 “MT Sliding FRAP”), indicating that the loss of KIFB leads to the loss of MT sliding.</p>
<p>While the assay described above provides an easy visualization of MT sliding, it allows for visualization of only a subset of the MT network. To further corroborate the above findings, we used a less photodamaging system to visualize MT sliding that does not involve photobleaching and allows for evaluation of displacements within the whole MT network. To this end we applied a MT probe of fiducial marks, K560Rigor<sup>E236A</sup>-SunTag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tanenbaum et al. 2014</xref>) in MIN6 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G-I</xref>). This probe contains the human kinesin-1 motor domain (residues 1–560) with a rigor mutation in the motor domain (K560Rigor<sup>E236A</sup>) and fused to 24 copies of a GCN4 peptide. The rigor mutation in the motor domain causes it to bind irreversibly to MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Rice et al. 1999</xref>). When co-expressed with a pHalo-tagged anti-GCN4 single-chain antibody (ScFv-GCN4-HaloTag-GB1-NLS), K560Rigor<sup>E236A</sup> can recruit up to 24 of the Halo ligands to a single position on a MT. The pHalo-tagged anti-GCN4 construct also contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which lends itself to reduce the background of the unbound dye. This enables visualization of MT sliding events via single molecule tracking of the fiducial marks along the MT lattice, allowing us to analyze MT sliding behavior within the whole network with high temporal and spatial resolution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G-K</xref>, <xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1-Supplemental Fig. 1B</xref>, Fig.1-Video 2 “MT Sliding Suntag”).</p>
<p>Our data indicate that in cells treated with scrambled control shRNA, a subset of K560Rigor<sup>E236A</sup>-SunTag fiducial marks underwent rapid directional movements, interpreted as MT sliding events (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G, K</xref>). In contrast, in cells expressing KIF5B-specific shRNAs the fraction of rapidly moving fiducial marks was significantly reduced, while the fraction of stationary fiducial marks increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H, I, J</xref>), indicating the suppression of MT sliding. Collectively, these results indicate that KIF5B is necessary for MT sliding in MIN6 cells.</p>

<title>KIF5B is required for β-cell MT organization</title>
<p>Because MT sliding mediated by KIF5B is a prominent phenomenon in β cells, we sought to test whether it has functional consequences for MT networks in these cells. Tubulin immunostaining revealed striking differences in MT organization between MIN6 cells treated with scrambled control shRNA versus KIF5B-specific shRNAs. While control cells had convoluted non-radial MTs with a prominent sub-membrane array, typical for β cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), KIF5B-depleted cells featured extra-dense MTs in the cell center and sparse receding MTs at the periphery (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, C</xref>). Significant reduction of tubulin staining intensity at the cell periphery (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) confirms the robustness of this phenotype in MIN6 cells.</p>

<p>We proceeded to investigate MT organization within primary β cells of the KIF5B KO mouse line (Kif5B<sup>fl/−:</sup>RIP2-Cre, <xref rid="fig2-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2-Supplemental Fig. 1</xref>). These mice exhibit a β-cell-specific deletion of Kif5B, as previously outlined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cui et al., 2011</xref>). Our examination revealed a consistent presence of a significant peripheral array in the C57BL/6J control mice, while the KO counterparts exhibited a partial loss of this peripheral bundle. Specifically, the measured tubulin intensity at the cell periphery was significantly reduced in the KO mice compared to their wild-type counterparts (<xref rid="fig2-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2-Supplemental Fig. 1A-C</xref>). Distinct extra-dense MTs were not common in islet β cells, possibly due to the 3D shape of a beta cell in tissue and/or compensatory mechanisms in organisms. Thus, our results indicate that loss of KIF5B leads to a strong defect in MT location to the cell periphery in both a β-cell culture model and primary β cells within intact islets, which could be a direct consequence of disrupted sliding of MTs from the cell center to the periphery.</p>
<p>An alternative explanation for the loss of peripheral MTs would be the loss of the mechanical modification of the MT lattice by the force provided by moving kinesin motors. In cells with radial MT organization, this mechanism was shown to promote MT rescues and growth toward the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andreu-Carbo et al. 2022</xref>). To test the contribution of kinesin motor movement at MTs to MT density at the cell periphery, we have attempted to rescue the KIF5B-depletion phenotype by re-expressing kinesin-1 motor (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which is capable of moving along MT but is unable to bind MTs as cargos. Neither in KIF5B-depleted nor in wild-type MIN6 cells, peripheral MTs were affected by the motor re-expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig2-2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>), indicating that kinesin-dependent MT growth does not noticeably contribute to the formation of the peripheral MT array in this cell type.</p>

<title>KIF5B is required for β-cell sub-membrane MT array alignment</title>
<p>Given the known significance of the peripheral MT array, which normally consists of well-organized MTs parallel to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bracey et al. 2020</xref>), we have further analyzed directionality of MTs remaining at the cell periphery after KIF5B depletion. Previously we published a custom image analysis algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bracey et al. 2020</xref>) allowing for detailed quantitative characterization of MTs directionality in relation to the nearest cell border (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> <xref rid="fig2-3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 3</xref>). Here, we applied the same computational analysis to MT imaging data in MIN6 cells with perturbed KIF5B level and/or function. After deconvolution for increased signal-to-noise ratio, single 2D slices of MT images were subjected to thresholding. Two thresholding options were analyzed for the unbiased approach. A threshold specifically optimized (perfect) for the peripheral MT array in each cell was considered along with a standard threshold across the analyzed cell population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> <xref rid="fig2-4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 4</xref>). Thereafter, the directionality of MTs with respect to the cell border was determined. Every pixel of the image was analyzed with inconclusive pixels disregarded. MT directionality was quantified as a function of the distance from the cell border and directionality of peripheral MTs within 1µm of the cell border quantified. Across the analysis, two thresholding conditions provided similar outputs. Our results indicate that in MIN6 cells treated with non-targeting control shRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>), the distribution of MT angles in the cell periphery are vastly parallel and co-aligned with the cell boundary, as previously reported for primary islet β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bracey et al. 2020</xref>). In contrast, the loss of KIF5B via shRNA depletion resulted in a significant loss of parallel MTs at the periphery as compared to control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E-H</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the MT directionality analysis in β cells within islets from the KIF5B KO mice revealed a significant decrease in MT alignment to the cell periphery as compared to the wt mice, closely mirroring our findings from the KIF5B knockdown in MIN6 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> <xref rid="fig2-2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 2 D-G</xref>). Collectively, our data suggest that KIF5B-mediated MT sliding serves to facilitate MT transport to the cell periphery and align them at this cellular location in both a β-cell culture model and primary β cells within intact islets.</p>
<p>Combined, our data demonstrate a distinct effect of KIF5B perturbation on both the distribution of MTs to the cell periphery and their orientation along the cell boundary. These data suggest that KIF5B-driven MT sliding is a decisive mechanism of the sub-membrane MT array generation, likely via redistribution of centrally nucleated MTs and subsequent aligning them at the cell edge. Thus, MT sliding is likely a critical component in functional MT organization in β cells.</p>

<title>β-cell kinesin-1 drives MT sliding through the C-terminal MT-binding domain</title>
<p>While membrane cargo transport by KIF5s requires association of the heavy chain with the kinesin light chains (KLCs) and/or other adaptors, transportation of MTs as cargos occurs due to direct binding of KIF5 to MTs through the ATP-independent MT binding domain in heavy chain tail (C-terminus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jolly et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Seeger and Rice 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>To specifically establish the role of MT sliding by KIF5B in β cells, we sought to evaluate the effects of suppressing the binding of KIF5B tail to MTs. To this end we used a previously generated construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ravindran et al. 2017</xref>), which is a motor-less version of wild-type (WT) kinesin-1 motor KIF5B containing the cargo-binding and ATP-independent MT binding domain and tagged with mCherry (mCh) at the amino terminus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). When overexpressed, this construct acts as a dominant-negative (DN) tool preventing the association of the tail of endogenous KIF5B with MTs. This tool is referred to as KIFDN<sup>wt</sup> (KIF5B dominant negative wild-type) moving forward (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm that KIF5B tail domain binds to MTs in MIN6 and acts a dominant negative we co-expressed KIFDN<sup>wt</sup> and mEmerald-tubulin. When subjected to the FRAP assay we detected a complete loss of MT sliding events as compared to a control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-D</xref>). To prevent tail engagement of the MT lattice through the ATP-independent binding domain we opted to make point mutations in the tail domain to change the residues 892-DRKRYQ to 892-DAAAYA, thus generating KIFDN<sup>MUT</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Photobleaching assay in cells co-expressing of the KIFDN<sup>MUT</sup> with mEmerald-tubulin indicated that the MT sliding activity was not blocked in the presence of the mutated construct (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, E</xref>, Fig.3-Video 1 KFDN FRAP), confirming that KIF5B tail domain binding to MTs is needed for MT sliding in β cells.</p>
<p>The dominant negative constructs are also tagged with the FK506-rapamycin-binding protein (FKBP), as indicated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>. This allows to heterodimerize them with a motor domain fused with the FKBP-rapamycin binding (FRB) domain using A/C Heterodimerizer (rapalog) and reconstitute a functional motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Inobe and Nukina 2016</xref>). We restored kinesin-1 activity by connecting the motor-less KIF5B, KIFDN<sup>wt</sup>, to kinesin-1 motor domain as a way to rescue the effects of DN approach of KIF5B tail overexpression. To this end, we co-expressed MIN6 cells with the tail domain, mEmerald-tubulin, and the KIF5C motor domain fused to FRB domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Once the tail and motor domain were dimerized with rapalog, we saw that the once blocked MT sliding events of the KIFDN<sup>wt</sup> tail alone were now reversed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, F</xref>, Fig.3-Video 2 KFDN + Motor FRAP). In contrast, under conditions of heterodimerization of KIFDN<sup>MUT</sup> with the motor, MT sliding was greatly impaired (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, G</xref>, Fig.3-Video 2 KFDN + Motor FRAP), indicating that the motor with the mutated ATP-independent binding domain cannot use MTs as cargos. Interestingly, the endogenous motor in this case was unable to efficiently transport MTs, suggesting that the endogenous motor pool engaged in MT sliding was significantly smaller than the overexpressed non-functional motor.</p>
<p>Overall, the results of the DN approach confirm that MT sliding in β cells is driven by KIF5B through direct kinesin-1 tail binding to cargo MTs.</p>

<title>Effects of C-terminal MT-binding of kinesin-1 on β-cell MT organization</title>
<p>Keeping in mind that KIF5B has additional major functions in addition to MT sliding, we sought to test the consequence of MT sliding more directly by turning to overexpression of the DN constructs. Thus, we took advantage of our heterodimerization approach to analyze MT patterns in cells with active kinesin-1, which is able or unable to slide MTs (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3F</xref> vs <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3G</xref>).

</fig>
<p>Interestingly, expression of heterodimerized kinesin motors led to impaired MT network configurations compared to NT control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Specifically, blocking of MT sliding by overexpression KIFDNmut heterodimerized with the motor, led to the decrease in peripheral tubulin intensity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C,D</xref>) and impaired MT aligning along the cell border (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E,G</xref>). These data indicate that KIF5B-driven relocation of centrally nucleated MTs to β-cell periphery requires kinesin tail domain binding to “cargo” MTs. Strikingly, overexpression of functional heterodimerized motor, which was capable of MT sliding and populating of the cell periphery with MTs as detected by tubulin intensity readings (KIFDNwt heterodimerized with the motor, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,D</xref>), also led to a deficient MT aligning at the periphery (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E,H</xref>). This can be interpreted as a result of unregulated sliding in these experimental conditions, since excessive kinesin-1-dependent sliding can lead to MT bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Straube et al. 2006</xref>). This suggests that proper organization of MTs within the sub-membrane array requires fine tuning of MT sliding activity.</p>
<p>Collectively, this indicates that regulated KIF5B activity is essential for redistributing MTs to the cell border and sustaining an aligned peripheral MT array.</p>

<title>Exaggerated MT sliding leads to defects in peripheral array alignment</title>
<p>Our data discussed above suggest that overexpression of functional kinesin-1 disrupts MT alignment at the cell periphery, inducing their bending and buckling (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, G</xref>). To test if this defect is a result of excessive MT sliding, we employed a small molecule, kinesore, which is known to dramatically promote MT sliding by kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Randall et al. 2017</xref>). Kinesore targets kinesin cargo adaptor function, by impairing KLC from binding kinesin heavy chain.

Further analysis of the peripheral bundle indicated that MT alignment was strongly impaired upon kinesore-driven MT remodeling as compared with vehicle (DMSO) treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-G</xref>).

<title>MT sliding in β cells is activated by glucose stimulation</title>
<p>It has previously been reported that kinesin-1 switches activity level in the presence of glucose stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Donelan et al. 2002</xref>). We predicted that, as KIF5B activity modulates the MT sliding events, they would also change depending on the glucose concentration. To test this, we pre-incubated MIN6 cells with media containing a low concentration of 2.8mM glucose (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). We applied the photobleaching assay under these conditions and detected little to no MT sliding events. When switching glucose to a high concentration of 20mM, MT sliding and remodeling events were significantly increased (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, Fig.6-Video 1 “FRAP Low and High Glucose”). Quantification of the sliding events demonstrated that MIN6 displaced MTs via MT sliding significantly more efficiently upon glucose stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). We then turned to single-molecule tracking of MT lattice fiducial marks (K560Rigor<sup>E236A</sup>-SunTag) to further investigate this observation. Consistent with the photobleaching assay, the fiducial marks were predominantly stationary in cells pre-incubated in 2.8mM glucose (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>) but frequently underwent directed relocation events indicative of MT sliding in cells after being stimulated with 20mM glucose (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>, Fig.6-Video 2 “SunTag Low and High Glucose).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Since the first description of the convoluted MT network in MIN6 cells by the Rutter group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Varadi et al. 2003</xref>), our views on the regulation, function, and dynamics of the pancreatic β-cell MT network have been gradually evolving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bracey et al. 2022</xref>). However, the field is still far from understanding the mechanisms underlying the network architecture. Here, we show that MT sliding is a prominent phenomenon in β cells and that it is driven by kinesin KIF5 B. This kinesin-1-dependent MT sliding is a critical mechanism needed for the formation and long-term maintenance of β-cell MT networks. In addition, we show that MT sliding activity is facilitated by glucose stimulation, suggesting that this process is involved in the regulation of GSIS and/or providing β-cell fitness during the response to glucose. Overall, our study establishes MT sliding as an essential regulator of β-cell architecture and function.</p>
<p>As we reviewed in the introduction, the β-cell MT network consists of an interlocked meshwork and peripheral MT arrays co-aligned with the cell border. We find that blocking kinesin has two major effects on MT organization: one, receding of MTs at the cell periphery and increased MT density in the cell center, and two, lack of alignment of remaining peripheral MTs with the cell border. We interpret that the first phenotype arises from the lack of MT sliding from the cell center to the periphery, and the second phenotype arises from the lack of MT sliding along pre-existing peripheral MTs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>
<p>In cultured mesenchymal cells, the kinesin motor was reported to populate the cell periphery with MTs via promoting rescues and elongation of radially-arranged dynamic MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andreu-Carbo et al. 2022</xref>). Our data indicate that this mechanism does not noticeably contribute to kinesin-dependent MT organization in β cells, leaving MT sliding the only known mechanism underlying the phenotype observed here. This difference in kinesin action could be due to basic differences in MT network properties in these cell types: in a mostly non-radial, highly-stabilized MT network in β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhu et al. 2015</xref>), modulation of MT plus end rescue efficiency is not likely to be a significant factor.</p>
<p>Interestingly, blocking kinesin results in a striking accumulation of MT in the cell center where they are normally nucleated at MTOCs, which include the centrosome and the Golgi, in differentiated β cells the latter being the main MTOC. Thus, sliding MTs originate from the MTOC area. At the same time, FIB-SEM analysis did not detect many MTs associated with MTOCs in physiologically normal β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Muller et al. 2021</xref>). This implies that MTs are typically rapidly dissociated from MTOCs so that they become available for transport by sliding. It is worth mentioning that for long-distance transport by sliding, cargo MTs must be short, otherwise MT buckling and not long-distance transport will occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Straube et al. 2006</xref>). Interestingly, shorter MTs have been observed in high glucose conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Muller et al. 2021</xref>) when MT are nucleated more actively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Trogden et al. 2019</xref>) and transported more frequently (this paper). Possibly, nucleated MTs are detached from MTOCs before they achieve a length that would prevent their transport. An intriguing possibility has been proposed, indicating that in high glucose conditions, MTs might undergo severing by katanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Muller et al. 2021</xref>). This process could generate MT fragments, potentially facilitating their role as cargos with increased ease of transport. It is also possible that sliding MT subpopulation has some additional specific features that make them preferred cargos, since it is becoming increasingly clearer in the field that there is immense heterogeneity among MTs. Post-translational modifications and MT associated proteins, which vastly alter stability and coordination of motor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hammond et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yu et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">McKenney et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Monroy et al. 2018</xref>), might also influence which MTs serve as cargos versus transportation tracks in β cells.</p>
<p>Importantly, we observe a prominent effect of peripheral MT loss only after a long-term kinesin depletion (three-four days). This is consistent with our observation that only a minor subset of MT is being moved within each experimental time frame. We postulate that the absence of a peripheral MT array in KIF5B-depleted cells is a consequence of prolonged lack of sliding. We hypothesize that MT sliding must contribute to β-cell specific peripheral MT bungle formation during β-cell differentiation. We also found that increasing MT sliding does not yield a properly configured MT array: kinesore-treated cells lack aligned peripheral MTs, consistently with kinesore-induced MT looping reported in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Randall et al. 2017</xref>). This indicates that, similar to other parts of β-cell physiology, the dose of MT sliding has to be precisely tuned to achieve physiologically relevant architecture. It was shown before that exaggerated kinesin-dependent MT sliding causes MT bundling and buckling into aberrant configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Straube et al. 2006</xref>). We predict that a fine-tuning regulatory pathway must exist to restrict the number of MT sliding events to the cell needs.</p>
<p>Consistent with this idea, MT sliding is sensitive to metabolic regulation: our data indicate that MT sliding is activated on a short-term basis after glucose stimulation. While the deep understanding of the role on MT sliding in GSIS requires further studies, it is plausible to suggest two potential functions for this process in glucose-stimulated cells. One, given that peripheral MTs are destabilized in high glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ho et al. 2020</xref>), we suggest that a long-term function for MT sliding, needed to replace MT population at the cell periphery and restore the pre-stimulus MT organization (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Because the amount of MT polymer on every glucose stimulation changes only slightly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhu et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Muller et al. 2021</xref>) and we detect MT loss from the periphery only after a prolonged blocking of sliding, we reason that this function could be essential to maintain long-term β-cell fitness and prepare cells for repeated rounds of stimulation. Two, as a potential short-term function at each stimulation round, MT sliding within the peripheral bundle itself could rearrange fragmented MTs within this array suppressing its role in IG withdrawal from specific secretion sites (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). In this scenario, MT sliding would tilt the balance between positive and negative MT-dependent regulation of GSIS toward enhanced secretion at each stimulation.</p>
<p>Our finding provides an example of a phenomenon where a slight change in MT configuration is physiologically significant. This is not an exception because subtle MT defects often have dramatic consequences. For example, in mitotic spindles, a tiny overgrowth of MT ends during metaphase, which causes them to attach to both kinetochores rather than just one, is very significant for the efficiency of chromosome segregation, causing aneuploidy and cancer. The changes in β-cell MT networks that we are reporting are much stronger: the effect on the peripheral MT network accumulated over three days of KIF5B depletion is dramatic (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2 B, C</xref>). Short-term gross MT network configurations after a single glucose stimulation are harder to detect, but is consistent with previous reports that MTs at the cell periphery are destabilized and fragmented upon high glucose stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ho et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Muller et al 2021</xref>), and that preventing this MT rearrangement completely blocks GSIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhu et al 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ho et al 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the most fascinating features of insulin secretion regulation is that the amount of generated insulin granules significantly exceeds the normal physiological needs for insulin secretion (∼100 times more than needed). At the same time, even slightly facilitated glucose depletion can be devastating for the human body. Accordingly, the excessive insulin content of a β cell resulted in the development of multiple levels of control, preventing excessive secretion. Our previous data suggest that the peripheral MT array provides one of those mechanisms. This study indicates that MT sliding is necessary to form the proper peripheral network in the long term. Short-term glucose-induced changes in the peripheral MT array likely need to be subtle to prevent over-secretion. Thus, we are not surprised that a dramatic effect of sliding inhibition is only detectable by our approaches after the changes in the MT network accumulate over time.</p>
<p>On a final note, it is important to evaluate the phenomenon reported here in light of the dual role of KIF5B as IG transporter and MT transporter and the coordination of those two roles in IG transport and availability for secretion. Our results indicate that KIF5B is needed for the formation of the peripheral MT bundle, which we have shown to restrict secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bracey et al. 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ho et al. 2020</xref>). At the same time, it is well established that KIF5B transports IGs and KIF5B loss of function impairs GSIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Meng et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Varadi et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cui et al. 2011</xref>). After a prolonged KIF5B inactivation, a loss of peripheral readily-releasable IG should be expected due to two factors: because there is no MT bundle to prevent over-secretion and IG depletion, and because there is no new IGs being transported from the Golgi area. In contrast, physiological activation of kinesin by glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Donelan et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Varadi et al. 2003</xref>) would both promote replenishment of IG through non-directional transport through the cytoplasm and restoration of the peripheral MT array to prevent over-secretion.</p>
<p>In conclusion, here we add another very important cell type to the list of systems that employ KIF5B-dependent MT sliding to build functional cell-type-specific MT networks. This system is unique because in this case MT sliding is metabolically regulated and activated on a single-minute time scale by nutrition triggers.</p>

<title>Sun Tag Rigor Kinesin Tracking Analysis</title>
<p>The acquired image was processed through Imaris Microscopy Image Analysis Software (Oxford Instruments), where the fiducial marks were tracked. Utilizing the spot tracking feature, we filtered the fiducial marks based on intensity and employed the integrated Autoregressive Motion algorithm. Both the Max Distance and Gap sizes were enabled to precisely calibrate the tracks. Subsequently, we refined the tracks by filtering them based on intensity, thereby eliminating noise and particles that intermittently enter and exit focus. We sought to normalize the behaviors by comparing the MT movements over 5-second intervals and calculated the displacement of a given fiducial mark (see MATLAB scripts below). In total over 60,000 tracks were detected, and the segmented displacement of ∼25,000 of those tracks were calculated. The 5 second displacement was binned at 0.05um intervals and the % of distribution for each bin was calculated for each cell and summarized in histograms (<xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1 - Supplemental Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Displacements of less than 0.15µm/5sec (below the resolution limit) were considered indicative of stationary MTs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Displacements of greater than 0.3µm/5sec were considered significant displacements indicative of motile MTs.

<p>The position of all tracked fiducial spots were exported from Imaris to excel. The MSDanalyzer was developed by Nadine Tarantino et al, and adapted by Kai Bracey, Pi’Illani Noguchi, and Alisa Cario (Vanderbilt University) to normalize the tracks in time. Tracks were segmented into displacements over 5s and binned as shown in the results.</p>

<title>MATLAB Script: MT Directionality</title>
<p>Oversampled images were deconvolved using the Richardson and Lucy Deconvolution algorithm. Images were masked and thresholded (IsoData) in ImageJ. The MT directionality script was applied in MATLAB. Only the outer 1µm of MTs were taken for binning and quantification purposes.</p>

<title>KIF5B depletion quantification</title>
<p>Single focal plane laser scanning confocal images were quantified in ImageJ. Cell outlines were used as masks, and cells positive and negative for GFP expression (shRNA marker) were analyzed. Mean KIF5B immunostaining intensity per cell was measured. To avoid bias of potential staining fluctuation between data points, the intensity of each GFP-positive cell was normalized to the averaged intensity of GFP-negative cells in the same field of view.</p>

<p>In their <bold>valuable</bold> study, Bracey et al. investigate how microtubule organization within pancreatic islet beta cells supports optimal insulin secretion. Using a combination of live imaging and photo-kinetic assays in an in vitro culture system, they provide <bold>compelling</bold> evidence that kinesin-1-mediated microtubule sliding, which plays critical roles in neurons and embryos, also plays a critical role in forming the sub-membranous microtubule band in response to glucose in beta cells. This work will be of interest to cell biologists studying cytoskeletal dynamics and organelle trafficking, as well as to translational biologists focused on diabetes.</p>

<p>This elegant study provides important insights into the organization of sub-membrane microtubules in pancreatic β-cells, highlighting a key role for the motor protein KIF5B. The authors propose that KIF5B drives microtubule sliding and alignment along the plasma membrane, a process enhanced by high glucose levels. This precise microtubule arrangement is essential for regulated secretion in β-cells. Supporting this model, the authors show that KIF5B is more highly expressed than other kinesins in MIN6 cells, and its depletion via shRNA disrupts sub-membrane microtubule density and organization. In contrast, KIF5A knockdown alters overall microtubule architecture. Using a dominant-negative approach, they further demonstrate that KIF5B-mediated microtubule sliding relies on its tail domain and is stimulated by glucose, paralleling known glucose-dependent increases in kinesin-1 activity.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>(1) It is difficult to appreciate that there is a &quot;peripheral sub-membrane microtubule array&quot; as it is not well defined in the manuscript. This reviewer assumes that this is in the respective field clear. Yet, while it is appreciated that there is an increased amount of MTs close to the cytoplasmic membrane, the densities appear very variable along the membrane. Please provide a clear description in the Introduction what is meant with &quot;peripheral sub-membrane microtubule array&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A definition has been added to the Introduction.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors described a &quot;consistent presence of a significant peripheral array in the C57BL/ 6J control mice, while the KO counterparts exhibited a partial loss of this peripheral bundle.</p>
<p>Specifically, the measured tubulin intensity at the cell periphery was significantly reduced in the KO mice compared to their wild-type counterparts&quot;. In vitro &quot;control cells had convoluted nonradial MTs with a prominent sub-membrane array, typical for β cells (Fig. 2A), KIF5B-depleted cells featured extra-dense MTs in the cell center and sparse receding MTs at the periphery (Fig. 2B,C)&quot;. Please comment/discuss why in vivo there are no &quot;extra-dense MTs in the cell center&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now add a discussion of this point, which we believe could be a manifestation of 3D shape of a beta cell in tissue and/or compensatory mechanisms in organisms.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Authors should include in the Discussion a paragraph discussing the fact that small changes in MT configuration can have strong effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A paragraph added to the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Figure 1: Even though the reviewer appreciates that minor changes of MT configuration have severe effects, still the overall effects appear minor (40 vs. &lt;50% or 35% vs. around 28%). Notably, there are no statistically significant differences in the different groups in Fig. 1Suppl-Fig.1 D. This reviewer is not sure if the combination of many not significantly different data points can result in significant changes and this should be checked by a statistician. Authors should include in the Discussion a paragraph discussing the fact that small changes in MT configuration can have strong effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now added the requested paragraph to the discussion. Indeed, the differences are small, and the significance is only detected in a data set with a large sample size in Fig. 1J,K (combined data sets with smaller sizes from Fig. 1-Suppl-Fig.1 D), consistent with the fact that a larger sample size generally provides more power to detect an effect.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Unfortunately, the authors cannot block kinesin-1 resulting in microtubule accumulation in the cell center and then release the block (best inhibiting microtubule formation), to show that the MTs accumulated in the cell center will be transported to the periphery.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is indeed the case at the moment, yes.</p>
