<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, the causative agent of tuberculosis, remains a major global health challenge. Nucleomodulins, bacterial effectors that target the host cell nuclei, are increasingly recognized as key virulence factors, but their roles in mycobacterial pathogenesis remain incompletely elucidated.

MmpE utilizes two nuclear localization signals, RRR<sup>20–22</sup> and RRK<sup>460–462</sup>, to enter the host cell nucleus, where it binds to the promoter region of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene, thereby inhibiting host inflammatory gene expression.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), the etiological agent of tuberculosis, has posed a persistent global health burden for centuries. Despite significant advances in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of its pathogenesis, current research has largely focused on effector proteins that modulate host cell membrane and cytoplasmic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nisa <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nasiri and Venketaraman, 2025</xref>). In contrast, investigations into effector proteins that target the host cell nucleus, the central hub for gene regulation and cellular control, remain comparatively limited.</p>
<p>Nucleomodulins are a class of bacterial effector proteins that can translocate into the host nucleus, where they modulate nuclear processes to promote pathogen survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chai <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bierne and Cossart, 2021</xref>). These proteins affect host gene expression by directly interacting with chromatin or by mimicking transcription factors, chromatin modifiers, or other nuclear regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rolando <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mitra <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hanford <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>). For instance, LntA from <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> directly binds the chromatin repressor BAHD1, disrupting its function and derepressing interferon-stimulated genes in a type III interferon-dependent manner, ultimately promoting bacterial persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lebreton <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lebreton <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014</xref>). Similarly, Ank1 and Ank6 from <italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic> localize to the host nucleus and facilitate the export of the NF-κB p65 subunit via exportin 1, thereby suppressing the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Evans <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Steiert and Weber, 2025</xref>). Although bacterial nucleomodulins utilize diverse strategies to manipulate host nuclear functions, the identity and functional characterization of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> nucleomodulins remain poorly defined.</p>
<p>Nucleomodulins employ various strategies to enter access to the host cell nucleus, including passive diffusion, hijacking host proteins that contain nuclear localization signals (NLSs), or using of their own NLSs to interact with the nuclear pore complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hanford <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>). Among these mechanisms, NLSs play a particularly important role. Based on their amino acid composition, NLSs are broadly classified into classical (cNLS), non-classical (ncNLS), and other types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lange <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lu <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>). Classical NLSs are further divided into monopartite (MP) and bipartite (BP) forms. Monopartite NLSs consist of a single cluster of 4–8 basic residues, primarily lysine (K) or arginine (R), with a typical consensus motif of K-K/R-X-K/R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fontes <italic>et al.,</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kosugi <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cautain <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>). Nuclear localization enables these effectors to manipulate host gene expression, disrupt immune signaling, and reprogram cellular processes to promote pathogen survival. For example, EspF from enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> contains an N-terminal NLS that directs it to the nucleolus, where it interferes with ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dean <italic>et al.,</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Singh <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>). NUE, a SET domain-containing nucleomodulin secreted by <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, also possesses an NLS that mediates its nuclear localization, where it functions as a histone lysine methyltransferase (HKMTase) targeting host histones H2B, H3, and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pennini <italic>et al.,</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jermy, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond their nuclear localization capabilities, some nucleomodulins directly affect host immunity through intrinsic enzymatic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwal <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012</xref>). For example, the nucleomodulin PtpA promotes Mtb survival within macrophages by dephosphorylating host cytoplasmic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>). NleC from <italic>E. coli</italic>, a Zn-dependent metalloprotease, suppresses host immune responses by cleaving the p65 subunit of NF-κB in the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting its nuclear translocation, and can enter the nucleus to reduce nuclear p65 levels, blocking NF-κB-dependent transcription of pro-inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baruch <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hodgson <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>). Among these enzymatically active nucleomodulins, purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) represent a distinct and functionally significant, yet underexplored, subclass within the metallophosphatase superfamily. PAPs are characterized by a conserved β-α-β-α-β fold and five signature motifs (DxG, GDXXY, GNH[D/E], VXXH, GHXH), which coordinate seven metal-ligating residues at a binuclear metal center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rodriguez <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bhadouria <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhadouria and Giri, 2022</xref>). These enzymes have been extensively studied in plants and mammals, where they are involved in key biological processes such as phosphorus metabolism and the generation of reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Comba <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Feder <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Liu <italic>et al.,</italic> 2025</xref>). In contrast, only a few bacterial PAPs have been identified, such as BcPAP from <italic>Burkholderia cenocepacia</italic>, and their functions remain largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yeung <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009</xref>). Notably, in Mtb, MmpE is the only identified PAP protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Schenk <italic>et al.,</italic> 2000</xref>), but its specific contribution to infection and pathogenesis remain elusive.</p>
<p>In this study, we characterized MmpE as a conserved nucleomodulin in mycobacteria and demonstrated its nuclear translocation mediated by two NLSs, RRR<sup>20–22</sup> and RRK<sup>460–462</sup>. Upon entering the nuclear, MmpE binds to the promoter region of the VDR gene, a key regulator of antimicrobial responses, resulting in transcriptional repression of pro-inflammatory genes. In addition, MmpE inhibits phagosome maturation by suppressing the expression of genes in the PI3K–Akt–mTOR signaling pathway. These actions collectively facilitate increased intracellular survival in both macrophage and mouse. Beyond its nuclear function, MmpE functions as a Fe³⁺/Zn²⁺ metallophosphatase, with enzymatic activity reliant on the conserved residues His<sup>348</sup> and Asp<sup>359</sup>, and partially contributes to intracellular survival. Taken together, our findings identify MmpE as a bifunctional effector that integrates immune modulation and enzymatic catalysis, underscoring its role in mycobacterial pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target.</p>

<title>NLSs are required for the nuclear translocation of MmpE</title>
<p>In the prior study, we systematically identified some conserved nucleomodulins in mycobacterium. Among them, the hypothetical protein Rv2577 (MmpE) was identified as a candidate exhibiting strong nuclear localization in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen <italic>et al.,</italic> 2025</xref>). Based on these findings, we transfected HEK293T cells with a C-terminal EGFP-tagged MmpE (MmpE-EGFP) and monitored its transcriptional level and nuclear localization at different time points. As a result, a time-dependent increase in the MmpE-EGFP content was observed in the host nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, upper panel; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). Nuclear–cytoplasmic fractionation assays further confirmed these results, showing a progressive enrichment of MmpE in the nuclear compartment over the course of transfection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom panel). Collectively, these results indicate that MmpE possesses intrinsic nuclear translocation ability.</p>

<p>MmpE contains two putative NLSs, N-terminus (RRR<sup>20–22</sup>, NLS1) and C-terminus (RRK<sup>460-462</sup>, NLS2) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). To evaluate the structural contribution of these motifs, we utilized AlphaFold to model the impact of NLS truncations on the overall conformation of MmpE. The predicted structures indicated that deletion of either NLS1, NLS2, or both did not obviously alter the the protein fold (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>). Based on this analysis, we generated a series of NLS-deleted mutants, including MmpE<sup>ΔNLS1</sup>, MmpE<sup>ΔNLS2</sup>, and MmpE<sup>ΔNLS1-2</sup>, to assess the functional relevance of each motif in nuclear localization. Subcellular localization of wild-type MmpE-EGFP and NLS deletion mutants was examined in HEK293T cells by fluorescence microscopy at 36 hpt (hours post-transfection). Deletion of either NLS1 or NLS2 alone significantly reduced the nuclear accumulation of MmpE-EGFP, with the effect of NLS2 deletion being more pronounced than that of NLS1. Simultaneous deletion of both NLS motifs (MmpE<sup>ΔNLS1-2</sup>) completely abolished nuclear localization, resulting in exclusive cytoplasmic distribution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). These findings were further validated by immunoblotting of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Under the similar transfection conditions, wild-type MmpE-EGFP was detected in both compartments, whereas MmpE<sup>ΔNLS1</sup> and MmpE<sup>ΔNLS2</sup> exhibited substantially reduced nuclear abundance. By contrast, MmpE<sup>ΔNLS1-2</sup> was exclusively localized to the cytoplasmic fraction, suggesting that both NLS motifs are required for efficient nuclear import (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Taken together, our findings identify MmpE as a nucleomodulin, with nuclear import mediated by the N- and C-terminal NLS motifs.</p>

<title>Deletion of NLSs does not alter the phosphatase activity of MmpE</title>
<p>Bioinformatic analyses identified MmpE as a Fe<sup>3+</sup>/Zn<sup>2+</sup>-metallophosphatase containing a purple acid phosphatase (PAP) motif (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>). Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that MmpE is highly conserved among mycobacterial species and harbors canonical motifs characteristic of metallophosphatases, including GD, GNHX, and GHXH (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>). These motifs are typically associated with enzymes that catalyze phosphate hydrolysis via a binuclear metal ion-dependent mechanism, wherein residues such as Asp, His, and Asn coordinate essential metal cofactors, commonly Fe³⁺, Mn²⁺, or Zn²⁺, at the active site.</p>

<p>To identify key amino acid residues of MmpE involved in metal coordination, AlphaFold was used to predict the structure of MmpE, followed by the molecular docking using PyMOL. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, H<sup>348</sup> and N<sup>359</sup> were identified as candidate residues likely involved in metal ion coordination within the predicted active site. Subsequently, recombinant MBP-tagged MmpE deleting the Tat signal peptide (MmpE<sup>ΔTat</sup>) was subjected to <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphatase assays using <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl phosphate (<italic>p</italic>-NPP) as the substrate. Reactions were supplemented with varying concentrations of Fe³⁺ and Zn²⁺ to evaluate their individual effects on MmpE enzymatic activity. The results demonstrated that, at equivalent concentrations, Fe³⁺ significantly enhanced MmpE activity compared to Zn²⁺, with maximal enzymatic activity was observed at 50 μM Fe³⁺ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Next, a double mutant (MmpE<sup>ΔTat</sup>-H<sup>348</sup>AN<sup>359</sup>A) was generated via site-directed mutagenesis to validate the functional importance of these residues. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, the addition of 50 μM Fe³⁺ significantly increased the <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphatase activity of MmpE<sup>ΔTat</sup> compared to reactions without metal ions. However, the enzymatic activity of the MmpE<sup>ΔTat</sup>-H<sup>348</sup>AN<sup>359</sup>A in the presence of 50 μM Fe³⁺ was markedly reduced and nearly indistinguishable from that of MmpE<sup>ΔTat</sup> under metal-free conditions. These results confirm that residues H<sup>348</sup> and N<sup>359</sup> are essential for Fe³⁺ binding and catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Given that MmpE relies on NLSs to enter the host nucleus, we examined whether deletion of NLS affects its phosphatase activity. Compared to wild-type MmpE, the NLS-deleted mutant showed no significant change in enzymatic activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), which is consistent with the structural comparison results (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that MmpE is a highly conserved Fe³⁺/Zn²⁺-dependent metallophosphatase in mycobacteria, and its enzymatic activity is independent of NLS.</p>

<title>The nuclear translocation and phosphatase activity of MmpE are essential for <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG survival in macrophage cells</title>
<p>To investigate the role of MmpE during infection, we first generated recombinant <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG strains expressing C-terminally Flag-tagged Ag85B (positive control) and MmpE. Immunoblot analysis confirmed high levels of Ag85B-2×Flag and MmpE-2×Flag in bacterial lysates, and both proteins were also detected in the culture supernatants (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>), indicating that MmpE is indeed a secreted protein.</p>

Meanwhile, the load of the Comp-MmpE<sup>ΔNLS2</sup> strain displayed significantly lower compared to Comp-MmpE in both THP-1 and RAW264.7 macrophages, indicating that nuclear localization mediated by NLS2 is critical for MmpE function.

<title>MmpE modulates host transcription network involved in inflammation response and lysosomal maturation</title>
<p>To investigate the role of the nucleomodulin MmpE on host gene expression, we performed RNA-seq assays on THP-1 macrophages infected with either wild-type (BCG/wt) or MmpE-deleted (Ko<italic>mmpE</italic>) strains at 20 hpi (hours post-infection). As a result, a total of 175 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, with 142 genes upregulated and 33 genes downregulated in Ko<italic>mmpE</italic>-infected macrophages compared to those infected with BCG/wt (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, Table S1).

Further analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) revealed that the DEGs were primarily involved in immune and inflammatory signaling pathways, including cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, TNF signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, chemokine signaling, NF-κB signaling, JAK–STAT signaling, and the PI3K−Akt signaling pathway. Additionally, several DEGs were enriched in pathways related to cell survival and apoptosis. Another group of DEGs was associated with host defense mechanisms, as evidenced by their enrichment in the lysosome pathway (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).

<p>To gain further insight into the functional relevance of the 175 differentially expressed genes, we performed protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, focusing on protein-coding genes, which accounted for 38% of the total (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>). A tightly connected network centered around key immune regulatory, including IL23A, IL12B, CSF2, CD69, IDO1, and CEACAM1, which are critically involved in inflammatory cytokine production (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Consistently, these genes expression was upregulation in Ko<italic>mmpE</italic>-infected macrophages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Given that inflammatory signaling and lysosomal function are both essential for macrophage-mediated host defense against mycobacterial infection, we further examined the expression of representative inflammatory cytokines and key lysosomal maturation markers under the same experimental conditions, such as <italic>TFEB</italic>, <italic>LAMP1</italic>, <italic>LAMP2</italic>, and several V-ATPase subunit genes (<italic>ATP6V0A1</italic>, <italic>ATP6V0C</italic>, <italic>ATP6V1A</italic>, <italic>ATP6V1B2</italic>, and <italic>ATP6V1E1</italic>).

<title>MmpE suppresses the expression of <italic>VDR</italic> and inhibits activation of the PI3K– Akt–mTOR signaling pathway</title>
<p>To elucidate the mechanism by which MmpE modulates host gene expression, we performed ChIP-seq in HEK293T cells transfected with EGFP-MmpE. 2,903 potential MmpE-binding sites (Table S2) were identified, with 18.49% (537) in intergenic regions and 39.44% (1145) in intragenic regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Chromosomal distribution revealed significant enrichment on chromosomes 1 and 2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Notably, 99.7% (2894) of these binding sites were associated with protein-coding regions.

Four transcription factors were identified, including CREBBP, VDR, GREB1, and FOXP4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).

To validate the hypothesis, we examined <italic>VDR</italic> expression in macrophages infected with recombinant strains. Compared to the BCG/wt, <italic>VDR</italic> expression was significantly downregulated in THP-1 cells infected with the Ko<italic>mmpE</italic> strain (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5D</xref>). To further test whether MmpE directly binds the <italic>VDR</italic> promoter, we cloned the <italic>VDR</italic> promoter region (−100 bp to +50 bp) and performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in HEK293T cells. While both <italic>VDR</italic> and <italic>GAPDH</italic> (control) sequences were present in input samples, <italic>VDR</italic> promoter DNA was detected exclusively in ChIP samples from EGFP-MmpE transfected cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). Furthermore, the DNA-binding capacity of MmpE was unaffected by its phosphatase activity (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5E</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">F</xref>).

<p>To further characterize the transcriptional programs regulated by MmpE, we performed an integrative analysis of CUT&amp;Tag and RNA-seq datasets. This analysis identified 298 DEGs with direct or proximal MmpE binding sites (Table S3; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Notably, genes such as <italic>RHEX</italic>, <italic>PLXDC1</italic>, and <italic>GAS6</italic> exhibited significant expression changes and were enriched in pathways associated with cell differentiation and small GTPase-mediated signaling (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6C</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>MmpE Functions as a Bifunctional Protein with Nuclear Localization and Phosphatase Activity</title>
<p>In this study, we identified two independent NLSs within the MmpE protein, RRR²⁰<sup>−</sup>²² (NLS1) and RRK⁴⁶⁰<sup>−</sup>⁴⁶² (NLS2), which together form a bipartite NLS motif that is rarely observed in bacterial effector proteins. Loss of a single NLS significantly reduced the nuclear accumulation of MmpE, with NLS2 deletion causing a more pronounced effect than that of NLS1. Simultaneous deletion of both motifs completely abolished nuclear localization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-E</xref>). These findings indicate that NLS1 and NLS2 function in a synergistic manner, with NLS2 likely playing a dominant role in nuclear import. Further sequence analysis revealed that NLS1 (RRR²⁰<sup>−</sup>²²) is embedded within the conserved twin-arginine translocation (Tat) signal motif (S/TRR-X-FLK), a well-characterized determinant of Tat-dependent secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gimenez <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>). The adjacent twin-arginine residues are critical for recognition by the Tat translocase, and mutations in this motif have been shown to significantly impair or abolish secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Ulfig <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>). Accordingly, the Comp-MmpE<sup>ΔNLS1</sup> strain likely exhibits impaired secretion, and the Comp-MmpE<sup>ΔNLS2</sup> strain is deficient in nuclear localization. Consistent with this, both the Comp-MmpE<sup>ΔNLS1</sup> and Comp-MmpE<sup>ΔNLS2</sup> strains exhibited lower intracellular survival than the Comp-MmpE strain and higher than that of the ΔMmpE strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-D</xref>), suggesting that the nuclear localization ability of MmpE indeed contributes to bacterial survival. Interestingly, MmpE also functions as a Fe³⁺/Zn²⁺-dependent metallophosphatase, with residues H<sup>348</sup> and N<sup>359</sup> being essential for its catalytic activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). The mutant strain (Comp-MmpE-H<sup>348</sup>AN<sup>359</sup>A) showed markedly reduced intracellular survival Compared to Comp-MmpE (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), indicating that the phosphatase activity of MmpE is also required for intracellular survival. This explains why the intracellular survival of the Comp-MmpE<sup>ΔNLS1-2</sup> strain is significantly lower than that of the Comp-MmpE strain, yet obviously higher than that of the ΔMmpE strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings suggest that MmpE is a dual-function effector protein that promotes intracellular survival during infection through the coordinated action of its nuclear localization signal and phosphatase activity.</p>

<p>VDR is a critical nuclear receptor that controls the expression of numerous genes involved in host immune defense, including antimicrobial peptides and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Usategui-Martín <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022</xref>). For example, Mtb suppresses the expression of the host gene <italic>CYP27B1</italic> to reduce active vitamin D synthesis, thereby limiting VDR activation and downstream antimicrobial responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Liu <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Salmonella</italic> downregulates <italic>VDR</italic> through miRNA-mediated mechanisms, weakening mucosal immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014</xref>). In this study, we found that MmpE directly binds to the promoter of the <italic>VDR</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F–J</xref>) and attenuates the expression of VDR-regulated inflammatory genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-E</xref>), ultimately promoting bacterial intracellular survival (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). This mode of action represents a novel strategy employed by bacterial pathogens to evade host defenses through the direct manipulation of host gene promoters by nucleomodulins. Although previous studies have reported that bacterial nucleomodulins interfere with the host transcriptional machinery, these effects have typically occurred indirectly, such as through epigenetic modifications or inhibition of signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jose <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Singh <italic>et al.,</italic> 2023</xref>). Direct promoter binding by a nucleomodulin, however, remains relatively uncommon and represents a distinct mechanism of host gene regulation.</p>

<title>MmpE regulates the expression of host genes involved in phagosome maturation</title>
<p>As an intracellular pathogen, Mtb employs multiple strategies to evade phagolysosomal degradation, a process essential for bacterial clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chandra <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Singh and Nagaraja, 2025</xref>). Improtantly, approximately 70% of phagosomes harboring Mtb fail to fuse with lysosomes, in part due to the activity of secreted phosphatases such as PtpA, PknG, and SapM, which disrupt vesicular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wong <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ge <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alsayed and Gunosewoyo, 2024</xref>). MmpE has also been shown to contribute to the arrest of phagosome maturation in human cells, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Forrellad <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>). In this study, we identify a potential mechanism by which MmpE inhibits phagosome maturation. Deletion of <italic>mmpE</italic> led to significant upregulation of lysosome-associated genes, including <italic>TFEB</italic>, <italic>LAMP1</italic>, <italic>LAMP2</italic>, and V-ATPase subunit genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). Among these, TFEB is a master transcriptional regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jeong <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2024</xref>). Furthermore, ChIP-seq analysis revealed that MmpE directly binds to promoter regions of host genes within the PI3K–Akt–mTOR signaling pathway (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref>), a key upstream regulator of TFEB activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gounis <italic>et al.,</italic> 2025</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that MmpE may act as a transcriptional regulator that targets the PI3K–Akt–mTOR–TFEB axis, thereby inhibiting lysosomal maturation.</p>

<title>MmpE is a Fe<sup>3+</sup>/Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent metallophosphatase that is essential for mycobacterial intracellular survival</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that phosphatases play critical roles in host–pathogen interactions by modulating phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sajid <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bonne Køhler <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>). In bacterial pathogens, these enzymes frequently contribute to immune evasion and intracellular survival. For example, the tyrosine phosphatase YopH from <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> disrupts phagocytic signaling in host macrophages, thereby impairing oxidative burst responses and promoting bacterial persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Davicino <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shaban <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>). Similarly, PpzA, a phosphatase from <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, has been implicated in fungal adaptation to immune pressure under iron-replete conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Manfiolli <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kurucz <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>). In this study, we found that MmpE contains a predicted purple acid phosphatase (PAP)-like domain and exhibits phosphatase activity that requires Fe<sup>3+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions as cofactors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Through site-directed mutagenesis, we identified His<sup>348</sup> and Asn<sup>359</sup> as critical residues for Fe<sup>3+</sup> coordination. Substitution of these residues (H<sup>348</sup>AN<sup>359</sup>A) significantly impaired phosphatase function in the presence of Fe<sup>3+</sup>, leading to a marked reduction in bacterial intracellular load (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). However, the precise molecular mechanism by which MmpE interacts with Fe<sup>3+</sup> remains to be elucidated in future studies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study identifies MmpE as a novel bifunctional virulence factor of mycobacteria, combining Fe³⁺/Zn²⁺-dependent phosphatase activity with nuclear translocation capability. MmpE translocates into the host nucleus and directly binds to the promoters of some key host genes, such as <italic>VDR</italic>, thereby inhibiting the expression of the downstream targets implicated with the inflammation responses and lysosomal maturation, thereby promoting mycobacterial survival in macrophages and in mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). These findings reveal a sophisticated mechanism by which bacterial pathogen manipulates host gene transcription and signaling pathway to promote intracellular persistence.</p>

<title>AlphaFold Predicted Structural Modeling of MmpE with NLS Truncations</title>
<p>The structural models of MmpE with NLS truncations were generated using AlphaFold version 2.2.0. The full-length MmpE sequence was used as the input to predict the reference structure. To assess the impact of NLS deletions, modified sequences were prepared by removing the residues corresponding to NLS1 (RRR<sup>20–22</sup>), NLS2 (RRK<sup>460–</sup> <sup>462</sup>), or both motifs. Structural prediction was performed for each sequence using the default AlphaFold parameters, which include the application of the pre-trained model and multiple sequence alignment (MSA) generation using the UniRef90 and MGnify databases. The confidence of the predictions was evaluated using the predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) scores provided by AlphaFold.

Paraffin-embedded tissue samples were sectioned into 2–3 µm thick slices using a microtome. Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated through a graded ethanol series, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). Stained tissue sections were examined using an Olympus BX53 light microscope. For digital analysis and annotation, scanned slides were visualized using CaseViewer software (version 2.0; 3DHISTECH).</p>

<p>This manuscript is <bold>useful</bold> as it demonstrates that Rv2577, a Fe³⁺/Zn²⁺-dependent metallophosphatase, is secreted by Mycobacterium bovis BCG and localizes to the nucleus of mammalian cells, altering transcriptional and inflammatory responses. However, the study is <bold>incomplete</bold> as it lacks activity validation in macrophage cells and with virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. It is necessary to confirm Rv2577 secretion from a virulent strain and to clarify the direct or indirect role of MmpE in modulating host pathways, together with mechanistic insight into how MmpE influences lysosomal biogenesis and trafficking.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors have characterized Rv2577 as a Fe3+/Zn2+ -dependent metallophosphatase and a nucleomodulin protein. The authors have also identified His348 and Asn359 as critical residues for Fe3+ coordination. The authors show that the proteins encode for two nuclease localization signals. Using C-terminal Flag expression constructs, the authors have shown that the MmpE protein is secretory. The authors have prepared genetic deletion strains and show that MmpE is essential for intracellular survival of M. bovis BCG in THP-1 macrophages, RAW264.7 macrophages, and a mouse model of infection. The authors have also performed RNA-seq analysis to compare the transcriptional profiles of macrophages infected with wild-type and MmpE mutant strains. The relative levels of ~ 175 transcripts were altered in MmpE mutant-infected macrophages and the majority of these were associated with various immune and inflammatory signalling pathways. Using these deletion strains, the authors proposed that MmpE inhibits inflammatory gene expression by binding to the promoter region of a vitamin D receptor. The authors also showed that MmpE arrests phagosome maturation by regulating the expression of several lysosome-associated genes such as TFEB, LAMP1, LAMP2, etc. These findings reveal a sophisticated mechanism by which a bacterial effector protein manipulates gene transcription and promotes intracellular survival.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>The authors have used a combination of cell biology, microbiology, and transcriptomics to elucidate the mechanisms by which Rv2577 contributes to intracellular survival.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>The authors should thoroughly check the mice data and show individual replicate values in bar graphs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript titled &quot;Mycobacterial Metallophosphatase MmpE Acts as a Nucleomodulin to Regulate Host Gene Expression and Promote Intracellular Survival&quot;, Chen et al describe biochemical characterisation, localisation and potential functions of the gene using a genetic approach in M. bovis BCG and perform macrophage and mice infections to understand the roles of this potentially secreted protein in the host cell nucleus. The findings demonstrate the role of a secreted phosphatase of M. bovis BCG in shaping the transcriptional profile of infected macrophages, potentially through nuclear localisation and direct binding to transcriptional start sites, thereby regulating the inflammatory response to infection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate using a transient transfection method that MmpE when expressed as a GFP-tagged protein in HEK293T cells, exhibits nuclear localisation. The authors identify two NLS motifs that together are required for nuclear localisation of the protein. A deletion of the gene in M. bovis BCG results in poorer survival compared to the wild-type parent strain, which is also killed by macrophages. Relative to the WT strain-infected macrophages, macrophages infected with the ∆<italic>mmpE</italic> strain exhibited differential gene expression. Overexpression of the gene in HEK293T led to occupancy of the transcription start site of several genes, including the Vitamin D Receptor. Expression of VDR in THP1 macrophages was lower in the case of ∆<italic>mmpE</italic> infection compared to WT infection. This data supports the utility of the overexpression system in identifying potential target loci of MmpE using the HEK293T transfection model. The authors also demonstrate that the protein is a phosphatase, and the phosphatase activity of the protein is partially required for bacterial survival but not for the regulation of the VDR gene expression.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While the motifs can most certainly behave as NLSs, the overexpression of a mycobacterial protein in HEK293T cells can also result in artefacts of nuclear localisation. This is not unprecedented. Therefore, to prove that the protein is indeed secreted from BCG, and is able to elicit transcriptional changes during infection, I recommend that the authors (i) establish that the protein is indeed secreted into the host cell nucleus, and (ii) the NLS mutation prevents its localisation to the nucleus without disrupting its secretion.</p>
<p>Demonstration that the protein is secreted: Supplementary Figure 3 - Immunoblotting should be performed for a cytosolic protein, also to rule out detection of proteins from lysis of dead cells. Also, for detecting proteins in the secreted fraction, it would be better to use Sauton's media without detergent, and grow the cultures without agitation or with gentle agitation. The method used by the authors is not a recommended protocol for obtaining the secreted fraction of mycobacteria.</p>
<p>Demonstration that the protein localises to the host cell nucleus upon infection: Perform an infection followed by immunofluorescence to demonstrate that the endogenous protein of BCG can translocate to the host cell nucleus. This should be done for an NLS1-2 mutant expressing cell also.</p>
<p>(2) In the RNA-seq analysis, the directionality of change of each of the reported pathways is not apparent in the way the data have been presented. For example, are genes in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction or TNF signalling pathway expressed more, or less in the ∆<italic>mmpE</italic> strain?</p>
<p>(3) Several of these pathways are affected as a result of infection, while others are not induced by BCG infection. For example, BCG infection does not, on its own, produce changes in IL1β levels. As the authors did not compare the uninfected macrophages as a control, it is difficult to interpret whether ∆<italic>mmpE</italic> induced higher expression than the WT strain, or simply did not induce a gene while the WT strain suppressed expression of a gene. This is particularly important because the strain is attenuated. Does the attenuation have anything to do with the ability of the protein to induce lysosomal pathway genes? Does induction of this pathway lead to attenuation of the strain? Similarly, for pathways that seem to be downregulated in the ∆<italic>mmpE</italic> strain compared to the WT strain, these might have been induced upon infection with the WT strain but not sufficiently by the ∆<italic>mmpE</italic> strain due to its attenuation/ lower bacterial burden.</p>
<p>(4) CHIP-seq should be performed in THP1 macrophages, and not in HEK293T. Overexpression of a nuclear-localised protein in a non-relevant line is likely to lead to several transcriptional changes that do not inform us of the role of the gene as a transcriptional regulator during infection.</p>
<p>(5) I would not expect to see such large inflammatory reactions persisting 56 days post-infection with M. bovis BCG. Is this something peculiar for an intratracheal infection with 1x107 bacilli? For images of animal tissue, the authors should provide images of the entire lung lobe with the zoomed-in image indicated as an inset.</p>
<p>(6) For the qRT-PCR based validation, infections should be performed with the MmpE-complemented strain in the same experiments as those for the WT and ∆<italic>mmpE</italic> strain so that they can be on the same graph, in the main manuscript file. Supplementary Figure 4 has three complementary strains. Again, the absence of the uninfected, WT, and ∆<italic>mmpE</italic> infected condition makes interpretation of these data very difficult.</p>
<p>(7) The abstract mentions that MmpE represses the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, which arrests phagosome maturation. There is not enough data in this manuscript in support of this claim. Supplementary Figure 5 does provide qRT-PCR validation of genes of this pathway, but the data do not indicate that higher expression of these pathways, whether by VDR repression or otherwise, is driving the growth restriction of the ∆<italic>mmpE</italic> strain.</p>
<p>(8) The relevance of the NLS and the phosphatase activity is not completely clear in the CFU assays and in the gene expression data. Firstly, there needs to be immunoblot data provided for the expression and secretion of the NLS-deficient and phosphatase mutants. Secondly, CFU data in Figure 3A, C, and E must consistently include both the WT and ∆<italic>mmpE</italic> strain.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment and agree that identification of the substrate of MmpE is important to fully understand its role in mycobacterial infection.</p>
<p>MmpE is a putative purple acid phosphatase (PAP) and a member of the metallophosphoesterase (MPE) superfamily. Enzymes in this family are known for their catalytic promiscuity and broad substrate specificity, acting on phosphomonoesters, phosphodiesters, and phosphotriesters (Matange et al., Biochem J., 2015). In bacteria, several characterized MPEs have been shown to hydrolyze substrates such as cyclic nucleotides (e.g., cAMP) (Keppetipola et al., J Biol Chem, 2008; Shenoy et al., J Mol Biol, 2007), nucleotide derivatives (e.g., AMP, UDP-glucose) (Innokentev et al., mBio, 2025), and pyrophosphate-containing compounds (e.g., Ap4A, UDP-DAGn) (Matange et al., Biochem J., 2015). Although the binding motif of MmpE has been identified, determining its physiological substrates remains challenging due to the low abundance and instability of potential metabolites, as well as the limited sensitivity and coverage of current metabolomic technologies in mycobacteria.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The study does not explore whether the phosphatase activity of MmpE is dependent on the NLS within macrophages, which would provide critical insights into its biological relevance in host cells. Conducting experiments with double knockout/mutant strains and comparing their intracellular survival with single mutants could elucidate these dependencies and further validate the significance of MmpE's dual functions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. In our study, we demonstrate that both the nuclear localization and phosphatase activity of MmpE are required for full virulence (Figure 3D–E). Importantly, deletion of the NLS motifs did not impair MmpE’s phosphatase activity in vitro (Figure 2F), indicating that its enzymatic function is structurally independent of its nuclear localization. These findings suggest that MmpE functions as a bifunctional protein, with distinct and non-overlapping roles for its nuclear trafficking and phosphatase activity. We have expanded on this point in the Discussion section “MmpE Functions as a Bifunctional Protein with Nuclear Localization and Phosphatase Activity”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The study does not provide direct experimental validation of the MmpE deletion on lysosomal trafficking of the bacteria.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. The role of Rv2577/MmpE in phagosome maturation has been demonstrated in M. tuberculosis, where its deletion increases colocalization with lysosomal markers such as LAMP-2 and LAMP-3 (Forrellad et al., Front Microbiol, 2020). In our study, we found that mmpE deletion in M. bovis BCG led to upregulation of lysosomal genes, including TFEB, LAMP1, LAMP2, and v-ATPase subunits, compared to the wild-type strain. These results suggest that MmpE may regulate lysosomal trafficking by interfering with phagosome–lysosome fusion.</p>
<p>To further validate MmpE’s role in phagosome maturation, we will perform fluorescence colocalization assays in THP-1 macrophages infected with BCG/wt, ∆mmpE, complemented, and NLS-mutant strains. Co-staining with LAMP1 and LysoTracker will allow us to assess whether the ∆mmpE mutant is more efficiently trafficked to lysosomes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The role of MmpE as a mycobacterial effector would be more relevant using virulent mycobacterial strains such as H37Rv.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. Previously, the role of Rv2577/MmpE as a virulence factor has been demonstrated in M. tuberculosis CDC 1551, where its deletion significantly reduced bacterial replication in mouse lungs at 30 days post-infection (Forrellad et al., Front Microbiol, 2020). However, that study did not explore the underlying mechanism of MmpE function. In our work, we found that MmpE enhances M. bovis BCG survival in both macrophages (THP-1 and RAW264.7) and mice (Figure 2A-B, Figure 6A), consistent with its proposed role in virulence. To investigate the molecular mechanism by which MmpE promotes intracellular survival, we used M. bovis BCG as a biosafe surrogate and this model is widely accepted for studying mycobacterial pathogenesis (Wang et al., Nat Immunol, 2025; Wang et al., Nat Commun, 2017; Péan et al., Nat Commun, 2017).</p>

The authors have also identified His348 and Asn359 as critical residues for Fe3+ coordination. The authors show that the proteins encode for two nuclease localization signals. Using C-terminal Flag expression constructs, the authors have shown that the MmpE protein is secretory. The authors have prepared genetic deletion strains and show that MmpE is essential for intracellular survival of M. bovis BCG in THP-1 macrophages, RAW264.7 macrophages, and a mouse model of infection. The authors have also performed RNA-seq analysis to compare the transcriptional profiles of macrophages infected with wild-type and MmpE mutant strains. The relative levels of ~ 175 transcripts were altered in MmpE mutant-infected macrophages and the majority of these were associated with various immune and inflammatory signalling pathways. Using these deletion strains, the authors proposed that MmpE inhibits inflammatory gene expression by binding to the promoter region of a vitamin D receptor. The authors also showed that MmpE arrests phagosome maturation by regulating the expression of several lysosome-associated genes such as TFEB, LAMP1, LAMP2, etc. These findings reveal a sophisticated mechanism by which a bacterial effector protein manipulates gene transcription and promotes intracellular survival.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>The authors have used a combination of cell biology, microbiology, and transcriptomics to elucidate the mechanisms by which Rv2577 contributes to intracellular survival.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>The authors should thoroughly check the mice data and show individual replicate values in bar graphs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We kindly appreciate the reviewer for the advice. We will update the relevant mice data in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript titled &quot;Mycobacterial Metallophosphatase MmpE Acts as a Nucleomodulin to Regulate Host Gene Expression and Promote Intracellular Survival&quot;, Chen et al describe biochemical characterisation, localisation and potential functions of the gene using a genetic approach in M. bovis BCG and perform macrophage and mice infections to understand the roles of this potentially secreted protein in the host cell nucleus. The findings demonstrate the role of a secreted phosphatase of M. bovis BCG in shaping the transcriptional profile of infected macrophages, potentially through nuclear localisation and direct binding to transcriptional start sites, thereby regulating the inflammatory response to infection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate using a transient transfection method that MmpE when expressed as a GFP-tagged protein in HEK293T cells, exhibits nuclear localisation. The authors identify two NLS motifs that together are required for nuclear localisation of the protein. A deletion of the gene in M. bovis BCG results in poorer survival compared to the wild-type parent strain, which is also killed by macrophages. Relative to the WT strain-infected macrophages, macrophages infected with the ∆mmpE strain exhibited differential gene expression. Overexpression of the gene in HEK293T led to occupancy of the transcription start site of several genes, including the Vitamin D Receptor. Expression of VDR in THP1 macrophages was lower in the case of ∆mmpE infection compared to WT infection. This data supports the utility of the overexpression system in identifying potential target loci of MmpE using the HEK293T transfection model. The authors also demonstrate that the protein is a phosphatase, and the phosphatase activity of the protein is partially required for bacterial survival but not for the regulation of the VDR gene expression.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1)   While the motifs can most certainly behave as NLSs, the overexpression of a mycobacterial protein in HEK293T cells can also result in artefacts of nuclear localisation. This is not unprecedented. Therefore, to prove that the protein is indeed secreted from BCG, and is able to elicit transcriptional changes during infection, I recommend that the authors (i) establish that the protein is indeed secreted into the host cell nucleus, and (ii) the NLS mutation prevents its localisation to the nucleus without disrupting its secretion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We kindly appreciate the reviewer for the advice and will include the relevant experiments in the revised manuscript. The localization of WT MmpE and the NLS mutated MmpE will be tested in the BCG infected macrophages.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Demonstration that the protein is secreted: Supplementary Figure 3 - Immunoblotting should be performed for a cytosolic protein, also to rule out detection of proteins from lysis of dead cells. Also, for detecting proteins in the secreted fraction, it would be better to use Sauton's media without detergent, and grow the cultures without agitation or with gentle agitation. The method used by the authors is not a recommended protocol for obtaining the secreted fraction of mycobacteria.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and we will further validate the secretion of MmpE using the tested protocol.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Demonstration that the protein localises to the host cell nucleus upon infection: Perform an infection followed by immunofluorescence to demonstrate that the endogenous protein of BCG can translocate to the host cell nucleus. This should be done for an NLS1-2 mutant expressing cell also.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will add this experiment in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(2) In the RNA-seq analysis, the directionality of change of each of the reported pathways is not apparent in the way the data have been presented. For example, are genes in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction or TNF signalling pathway expressed more, or less in the ∆mmpE strain?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and fully agree that conventional KEGG pathway enrichment diagrams do not convey the directionality of individual gene expression changes within each pathway. While KEGG enrichment analysis identifies pathways that are statistically overrepresented among differentially expressed genes, it does not indicate whether individual genes within those pathways are upregulated or downregulated.</p>
<p>To address this, we re-analyzed the expression trends of DEGs within each significantly enriched KEGG pathway. The results show that key immune-related pathways, including cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, TNF signaling, NF-κB signaling, and chemokine signaling, are collectively upregulated in THP-1 macrophages infected with ∆mmpE strain compared to those infected with the wild-type BCG strain. The full list of DEGs will be provided in the supplementary materials. The complete RNA-seq dataset has been deposited in the GEO database, and the accession number will be included in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Several of these pathways are affected as a result of infection, while others are not induced by BCG infection. For example, BCG infection does not, on its own, produce changes in IL1β levels. As the author s did not compare the uninfected macrophages as a control, it is difficult to interpret whether ∆mmpE induced higher expression than the WT strain, or simply did not induce a gene while the WT strain suppressed expression of a gene. This is particularly important because the strain is attenuated. Does the attenuation have anything to do with the ability of the protein to induce lysosomal pathway genes? Does induction of this pathway lead to attenuation of the strain? Similarly, for pathways that seem to be downregulated in the ∆mmpE strain compared to the WT strain, these might have been induced upon infection with the WT strain but not sufficiently by the ∆mmpE strain due to its attenuation/ lower bacterial burden.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We will update qRT-PCR data with the uninfected macrophages as a control in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Wild-type Mycobacterium bovis BCG strain still has the function of inhibiting phagosome maturation (Branzk et al., Nat Immunol, 2014; Weng et al., Nat Commun, 2022). Forrellad et al. previously identified Rv2577/MmpE as a virulence factor in M. tuberculosis and disruption of the MmpE gene impairs the ability of M. tuberculosis to arrest phagosome maturation (Forrellad et al., Front Microbiol, 2020). In our study, transcriptomic and qRTPCR data (Figures 4C and G, S4C) show that deletion of mmpE in M. bovis BCG leads to upregulation of lysosomal biogenesis and acidification genes, including TFEB, LAMP1, and vATPase. To further validate MmpE’s role in phagosome maturation, we will perform fluorescence colocalization assays in THP-1 macrophages infected with BCG/wt, ∆mmpE, complemented, and NLS-mutant strains. Co-staining with LAMP1 and LysoTracker will assess whether the ∆mmpE mutant is more efficiently trafficked to lysosomes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, CFU assays demonstrated that the ∆mmpE strain exhibits markedly reduced bacterial survival in both human THP-1 and murine RAW264.7 macrophages, as well as in mice, compared to the wild-type strain (Figures 4A and C, 6A). These findings suggest that the loss of MmpE compromises bacterial survival, likely due to enhanced lysosomal trafficking and acidification. This supports previous studies showing that increased lysosomal activity promotes mycobacterial clearance (Gutierrez et al., Cell, 2004; Pilli et al., Immunity, 2012).</p>

<p>(4) CHIP-seq should be performed in THP1 macrophages, and not in HEK293T. Overexpression of a nuclear-localised protein in a non-relevant line is likely to lead to several transcriptional changes that do not inform us of the role of the gene as a transcriptional regulator during infection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We performed ChIP-seq in HEK293T cells is based on the fact that this cell line is widely used in ChIP-based assays due to its high transfection efficiency, robust nuclear protein expression, and well-annotated genome (Lampe et al., Nat Biotechnol, 2024; Marasco et al., Cell, 2022). These features make HEK293T an ideal system for the initial identification of genome wide chromatin binding profiles of novel nuclear effectors such as MmpE.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we validated the major observations in THP-1 macrophages, including (i) RNAseq of THP-1 cells infected with either WT BCG or ∆mmpE strains revealed significant transcriptional changes in immune and lysosomal pathways (Figure 4A); (ii) Integrated analysis of CUT&amp;Tag and RNA-seq data identified 298 genes in infected THP-1 cells that exhibited both MmpE binding and corresponding expression changes. Among these, VDR was validated as a direct transcriptional target of MmpE using EMSA and ChIP-PCR (Figures 5E-J, S5D-F). Notably, the signaling pathways associated with MmpE-bound genes, including PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling and lysosomal function, substantially overlap with those transcriptionally modulated in infected THP-1 macrophages (Figures 4B-G, S4B-C, S5C-D), further supporting the biological relevance of the ChIP-seq data obtained from HEK293T cells.</p>

<p>(5) I would not expect to see such large inflammatory reactions persisting 56 days postinfection with M. bovis BCG. Is this something peculiar for an intratracheal infection with 1x107 bacilli? For images of animal tissue, the authors should provide images of the entire lung lobe with the zoomed-in image indicated as an inset.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. The lung inflammation peaked at days 21–28 and had clearly subsided by day 56 across all groups (Figure 6B), consistent with the expected resolution of immune responses to an attenuated strain like M. bovis BCG. This temporal pattern is in line with previous studies using intravenous or intratracheal BCG vaccination in mice and macaques, which also demonstrated robust early immune activation followed by resolution over time (Smith et al., Nat Microbiol, 2025; Darrah et al., Nature, 2020).</p>
<p>In this study, the infectious dose (1×10⁷ CFU intratracheally) was selected based on previous studies in which intratracheal delivery of 1×10⁷CFU produced consistent and measurable lung immune responses and pathology without causing overt illness or mortality (Xu et al., Sci Rep, 2017; Niroula et al., Sci Rep, 2025). We will provide whole-lung lobe images with zoomed-in insets in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(6) For the qRT-PCR based validation, infections should be performed with the MmpEcomplemented strain in the same experiments as those for the WT and ∆mmpE strain so that they can be on the same graph, in the main manuscript file. Supplementary Figure 4 has three complementary strains. Again, the absence of the uninfected, WT, and∆mmpE infected condition makes interpretation of these data very difficult.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. As suggested, we will conduct the qRT-PCR experiment including the uninfected, WT, ∆mmpE, Comp-MmpE, and the three complementary strains infecting THP-1 cells. The updated data will be provided in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The abstract mentions that MmpE represses the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, which arrests phagosome maturation. There is not enough data in this manuscript in support of this claim. Supplementary Figure 5 does provide qRT-PCR validation of genes of this pathway, but the data do not indicate that higher expression of these pathways, whether by VDR repression or otherwise, is driving the growth restriction of the ∆mmpE strain.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. The role of MmpE in phagosome maturation was previously characterized. Disruption of mmpE impairs the ability of M. tuberculosis to arrest lysosomal trafficking (Forrellad et al., Front Microbiol, 2020). In this study, we further found that MmpE suppresses the expression of key lysosomal genes, including TFEB, LAMP1, LAMP2, and ATPase subunits (Figure 4G), suggesting MmpE is involved in arresting phagosome maturation. As noted, the genes in the PI3K–Akt–mTOR pathway are upregulated in ∆mmpE-infected macrophages (Figure S5C).</p>
<p>To functionally validate this, we will conduct two complementary experimental approaches:</p>
<p>(i) Immunofluorescence assays: We will assess phagosome maturation and lysosomal fusion in THP-1 cells infected with BCG/wt, ∆mmpE, Comp-MmpE, and NLS mutant strains. Colocalization of intracellular bacteria with LAMP1 and LysoTracker will be quantified to determine whether the ∆mmpE strain is more efficiently trafficked to lysosomes.</p>
<p>(ii) CFU assays: We will perform CFU assays in THP-1 cells infected with BCG/wt or ∆mmpE in the presence or absence of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway inhibitors (e.g., Dactolisib), to assess whether activation of this pathway contributes to the intracellular growth restriction observed in the ∆mmpE strain.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The relevance of the NLS and the phosphatase activity is not completely clear in the CFU assays and in the gene expression data. Firstly, there needs to be immunoblot data provided for the expression and secretion of the NLS-deficient and phosphatase mutants. Secondly, CFU data in Figure 3A, C, and E must consistently include both the WT and ∆mmpE strain.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We will provide immunoblot data for the expression and secretion of the NLS-deficient and phosphatase mutants. Additionally, we will revise Figure 3A, 3C, and 3E to consistently include both the WT and ΔmmpE strains in the CFU assays.</p>
