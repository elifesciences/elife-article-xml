<title>Abstract</title><p>Mutations in the human <italic>PURA</italic> gene cause the neuro-developmental PURA syndrome. In contrast to several other mono-genetic disorders, almost all reported mutations in this nucleic acid binding protein result in the full disease penetrance. In this study, we observed that patient mutations across PURA impair its previously reported co-localization with processing bodies. These mutations either destroyed the folding integrity, RNA binding or dimerization of PURA. We also solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal PUR domains of human PURA and combined them with molecular dynamics simulations and NMR measurements. The observed unusually high dynamics and structural promiscuity of PURA indicated that this protein is particularly susceptible to mutations impairing its structural integrity. It offers an explanation why even conservative mutations across PURA result in the full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PURA syndrome.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The family of purine-rich element binding (PUR) protein is highly conserved from plants to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Molitor <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Amongst the three vertebrate paralogs PURA, PURB, and PURG, the best-studied family member is PURA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bergemann &amp; Johnson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Haas <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Haas <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). It is ubiquitously expressed and has been implicated in several cellular processes, including transcriptional and translational gene regulation as well as mRNA transport in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Chepenik <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Gallia <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Haas <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Haas <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Johnson <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kobayashi <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mitsumori <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Tretiakova <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). Results from two independent knock-out mouse models demonstrated that PURA is important for postnatal brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hokkanen <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Khalili <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Accordingly, PURA has been implicated as a modulator of neurodegenerative disorders, such as fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), and the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Swinnen <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). PURA was reported to be present in the pathological RNA foci of both disorders and to protect against RNA toxicity upon ectopic overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mori <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Rossi <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Shen <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Swinnen <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). In addition, PURA was shown to co-localize with an ALS-causing mutant variant of the FUS protein in stress granules of ALS patients. Importantly, overexpression of PURA reduced the toxicity of mutant FUS by preventing its mis-localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Daigle <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2014, two studies reported that a monogenetic neurodevelopmental disorder is caused by sporadic mutations in the <italic>PURA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hunt <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lalani <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Hallmarks of this so-called PURA syndrome are developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, epileptic seizures, and feeding difficulties, amongst others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Reijnders <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Johannesen <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Mutations causing PURA syndrome are often frame-shift events but also point mutations distributed over the entire sequence.</p>
<p>Based on the crystal structures of PURA from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<italic>dm</italic>PURA), three conserved sequence regions termed PUR repeats I, II, and III were identified to fold into globular domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Graebsch <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Graebsch <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Weber <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Whereas PUR repeat I and II assemble into an N-terminal PUR domain via intramolecular interactions, two C-terminal PUR repeats III from different molecules interact with each other and thus mediate dimerization of PURA. All these PUR domains belong to the class of the PC4-like protein family, which mainly bind single-stranded nucleic acids and can unwind double-stranded DNA and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Janowski &amp; Niessing, 2020</xref>). Although both PUR domains possess the typical PC4-like β-β-β-β-α-(linker)-β-β-β-β-α topology, the N-terminal domain has been suggested to be the main RNA/DNA interaction entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Weber <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). In a previous study, homology models based on the <italic>dm</italic>PURA crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Graebsch <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Weber <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>) were used to predict <italic>in silico</italic> the effects of PURA syndrome-causing mutations on the structural integrity of the human PURA protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Reijnders <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). While these mutations could be classified into groups that likely either do or do not impair the structural integrity of PURA, these predictions remained speculative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Reijnders <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Surprisingly, in contrast to phenotypically related genetic diseases such as the Rett syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lombardi <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>), no hot-spot regions could be identified in the protein sequence that trigger the PURA syndrome. With the exception of the unstructured N-terminal region and the very C-terminus, almost all mutations across the protein sequence appear to result in the full disease spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Johannesen <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Reijnders <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). To date, we fail to understand why there is such an underrepresentation of mild phenotypes in patients with PURA syndrome.</p>
<p>In this study, we experimentally assessed the structure and function of human PURA as well as the impact of representative PURA syndrome-causing mutations on the protein’s integrity. When studying the impact of patient mutations on PURA’s subcellular localization, we observed impaired processing body (P-body) association but normal localization to stress granules, indicating a potential importance of P-bodies for PURA-syndrome pathology. Two particularly interesting disease-causing mutations, K97E and R140P, were further analyzed by structural means. The results indicated that the N-terminal PUR domain is unusually flexible in its fold and prone to misfolding upon mutation. In summary, we provide a structure-based explanation for the underrepresentation of mutations with mild symptoms in patients and a rational approach for predicting and functionally testing mutations of uncertain significance.</p>

<title>Effect of the mutations in <italic>hs</italic>PURA on stress granules association</title>
<p>Several patient-related mutations are frame-shift events and thus predictably destroy the integrity of PURA. In addition, a number of point and indel mutations have been reported for which the pathology-causing effects are less easy to predict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Johannesen <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Reijnders <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). To understand the functional impact of such mutations, we decided to first study the effect of three known patient mutations, K97E, I206F, and F233del (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hunt <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lalani <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Reijnders <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref></bold>), on the subcellular localization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA.</p>

<p>Previous studies in human cell cultures indicated that <italic>hs</italic>PURA localizes to stress granules upon cellular stress and may be essential for their formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Daigle <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Markmiller <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). To analyze whether the afore-mentioned patient-related mutations affect the localization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA to stress granules, the mutant and wild-type versions of full-length FLAG-tagged <italic>hs</italic>PURA were overexpressed in HeLa cells using a doxycycline-inducible expression cassette and cells were stressed for one hour with 500 µM sodium arsenite (<bold>Appendix Fig S1</bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref></bold>). To find out whether stress-granule localization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA depends on its nucleic-acids binding properties, we also utilized an RNA-binding deficient version of <italic>hs</italic>PURA bearing eleven structure-guided point mutations (m11) as a control (for rationale and design of this mutant, see <bold>Appendix Fig S2</bold>). Using an anti-FLAG tag antibody, we observed wild-type <italic>hs</italic>PURA to be distributed within the cytoplasm and accumulated in stress-granule structures, as seen by co-staining with the stress-granule marker G3BP1 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref></bold>). In contrast, the nucleic acid-binding deficient mutant <italic>hs</italic>PURA m11 failed to co-localize to G3BP1-positive granules, indicating that RNA-binding by <italic>hs</italic>PURA is necessary for its co-localization with stress granules. Furthermore, all three versions of <italic>hs</italic>PURA bearing patient-derived mutations localized to stress granules upon cellular stress (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref></bold>). In all three patient-related mutations, no significant reduction of PURAs stress granule association was seen when compared to the wild-type control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess the previously reported influence of <italic>hs</italic>PURA on stress-granule formation at endogenous PURA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Daigle <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>), we performed an siRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>hs</italic>PURA in HeLa cells and stained with the stress-granule marker G3BP1 and PURA. Efficient knockdown of endogenous PURA levels was validated with western blot experiments, showing a significant reduction of PURA protein upon knockdown (S3A-C). As expected, endogenous <italic>hs</italic>PURA co-localized with G3BP1 upon stress treatment with 500 µM arsenite PURA (<bold>Appendix Fig S4A</bold> and <bold>S4B</bold>) and thus behaved similarly to overexpressed <italic>hs</italic>PURA. A PURA knockdown did not alter the total number of microscopically visible stress granules but resulted in a greater ratio of smaller stress granules (<bold>Appendix Fig S4C</bold>). Although this finding suggests that PURA is not essential for stress granule formation, it should be noted that the knockdown did not completely eliminate PURA levels and hence a stronger effect on stress granules could occur in a complete knockout of PURA. However, PURA-syndrome patients bear a heterozygous mutation, suggesting that an incomplete knockdown likely resembles the pathogenic situation more closely than a full knockout. Together these findings suggest that (i) reduced stress-granule association of mutant <italic>hs</italic>PURA variants may not be a core feature of the PURA syndrome and (ii) impaired stress-granule formation is not very likely to be directly responsible for the etiology of this disorder.</p>

<title>Localization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA to P-bodies is impaired by PURA syndrome-causing mutations</title>
<p>To assess the localization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA to cytoplasmic granules in unstressed conditions, we first recapitulated its recently reported localization to P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Molitor <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Co-staining with the marker DCP1A indeed confirmed a co-localization of overexpressed <italic>hs</italic>PURA in P-bodies of HeLa cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref></bold>). As for stress granules, the PURA m11 mutant failed to accumulate in P-bodies, indicating that RNA binding of PURA contributes to its P-body localization. In addition, the K97E and F233del mutants of <italic>hs</italic>PURA showed significantly reduced co-localization to P-bodies (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref></bold>). In summary, these experiments indicate that P-body localization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA requires its RNA-binding activity, and that the majority of tested patient mutations result in impaired P-body localization. Furthermore, since F233del mutant has been predicted to have impaired dimerization properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Reijnders <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>), these findings suggest dimerization to be important for PURA’s P-body association.</p>

<title><italic>hs</italic>PURA does not readily undergo RNA-driven phase separation <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p><italic>hs</italic>PURA accumulates in an RNA-dependent fashion to stress granules as well as to P-bodies. Both types of granules are liquid-phase separated entities, indicating that the recruitment to such granules might occur via phase separation of RNA-bound <italic>hs</italic>PURA. Since <italic>hs</italic>PURA was recently shown to be required for P-body formation in HeLa cells and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Molitor <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), PURA-dependent liquid phase separation could potentially also directly contribute to the formation of these granules. Furthermore, a loss of such a function could potential contribute to the etiology of PURA syndrome. In order to test this hypothesis, we used a microscope-based approach to visualize the ability of RNA-bound <italic>hs</italic>PURA to phase separate <italic>in vitro</italic>. As a positive control for RNA-mediated liquid-phase separation, the protein FUS RGG3 was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hofweber <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). In contrast to this control, no indication of phase separation was observed for <italic>hs</italic>PURA either in the presence or absence of total HeLa cell RNA (<bold>Appendix Fig S5</bold>). These results indicate that <italic>hs</italic>PURA does not readily phase separate with total cellular RNA under the tested experimental conditions. Of note, this observation does not exclude the possibility that <italic>hs</italic>PURA can undergo phase separation under different experimental conditions, for instance in presence of additional co-factors. However, when putting this observation in perspective with previous reports, it seems unlikely that P-body formation directly depends on phase separation by <italic>hs</italic>PURA, but rather on its recently reported function as gene regulator of the essential P-body core factors LSM14a and DDX6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Molitor <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>).</p>

R140P was initially reported to be a disease-causing mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>) but later re-interpreted as a mutation for which it is unclear if it can trigger PURA Syndrome, i.e. of uncertain significance (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/192343/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/192343/</ext-link>).

Hence, R140P was chosen in this study to explore the diagnostic potential of our approach, whereas R199P and R245P served as a reference point for pathology-inducing mutations.</p>
<p>Even after extensive optimization, recombinantly expressed <italic>hs</italic>PURA fragments with the mutations R199P and I206F (full-length variant and N-terminal PUR domain consisting of repeats I-II; PURA I-II) as well as F233del and R245P (full-length variant and C-terminal PUR domain consisting of two repeats III; PURA III) could not be purified due to protein insolubility (<bold>Appendix Table S1</bold>). In contrast, N-terminal PUR domains (PURA I-II) with either of the two remaining mutations K97E and R140P were soluble and could be purified to near homogeneity. The observed solubility of recombinant <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II K97E is also in agreement with the previous <italic>in silico</italic> prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Reijnders <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>) as K97 has a surface-exposed side chain that is unlikely to cause folding issues upon mutation into another flexible, polar side chain.

<title>Dimerization domain of <italic>hs</italic>PURA shows nucleic acid binding and unwinding activities</title>
<p>PUR repeats III adopt a classical PC4-like fold, suggesting that it might also bind to nucleic acids. Analysis of the crystal structure of the <italic>hs</italic>PURA III homodimer revealed electrostatic surface potentials favorable for interactions with nucleic acids (<bold>Appendix Fig S6B</bold>). When performing gel electrophoresis mobility shift <italic>assays</italic> (EMSAs) we indeed observed RNA binding (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>It had been previously reported that PURA can separate double-stranded (ds) nucleic acids in an ATP-independent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Darbinian <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Weber <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). This so-called unwindase activity has also been reported for several other PC4-like domains from different organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Janowski &amp; Niessing, 2020</xref>). For <italic>dm</italic>PURA it had already been suggested that dsDNA strands are melted by intercalation of the β-ridge between both strands, followed by binding of both single strands to the cavities formed by the curved β-sheets on both sides of the β-ridge (<bold>Appendix Fig S7</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Weber <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Since we had already observed RNA binding by PUR repeats III (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>)</bold>, we examined its potential unwindase activity by utilizing a previously reported <italic>in vitro</italic> unwinding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Darbinian <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Weber <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>) with dsDNA 5’-end labelled with a FAM fluorophore and 3’-end labelled with Dabcyl quencher (<bold>Appendix Fig S8).</bold> In this assay, double-stranded DNA results in low fluorescence signal due to the proximity of the quencher to the fluorophore. Upon strand separation their distance and fluorescence signal increase. We indeed observed strand separation in presence of the <italic>hs</italic>PURA III fragment (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref></bold>). Of note, RNA binding as well as dsDNA strand separation by full-length <italic>hs</italic>PURA was much more efficient than by the PUR III domain (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref></bold>), indicating potential cooperativity of the N- and C-terminal PUR domains in unwinding double-stranded nucleic acids.</p>

<title>PURA syndrome-causing mutations in the C-terminal PUR domain impair dimerization</title>
<p>Next, we used the <italic>hs</italic>PURA III structure (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref></bold> and <bold>Table S2</bold>) to perform an <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of the impact of patient-derived mutations F233del and R245P on the structural integrity of the C-terminal PUR domain. While failure to obtain soluble recombinant PURA with F233del mutation prevented a direct biophysical assessment of its dimerization state <italic>in vitro</italic> (<bold>Appendix Table S1</bold>), this observation already indicated a misfolding of the C-terminal PUR domain upon mutation. Consistent with this observation is also the interpretation from homology modeling based on the previously published <italic>dm</italic>PURA III structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Reijnders <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). There, the mutation was predicted to impair the structural integrity of the C-terminal <italic>hs</italic>PURA dimerization domain. F233 is part of the β-sheet and interacts with the α-helix of the other PUR repeat III within the PUR domain, contributing to dimerization (<bold>Appendix Fig S9A</bold>). Since in the PURA F233del variant, one residue is deleted, the orientation of all subsequent amino acids in the β-strand adopt the opposite orientation, likely resulting in a fold disruption of the β-sheet and possibly in impaired dimerization. In the case of R245P mutation (<bold>Appendix Fig S9B</bold>), the exchange into proline also likely impairs β-strand folding by introducing a kink, which could also impact dimerization.</p>
<p>To provide direct proof for impaired dimerization upon the introduction of patient-derived F233del and R245P mutations, we utilized the FRET-based NanoBRET assay in HEK293 cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref></bold>). With this assay, we assessed the ability of <italic>hs</italic>PURA bearing the F233del and R245P patient mutations to dimerize with wild-type <italic>hs</italic>PURA by measuring corresponding milli BRET Units (mBU). Of note, this combination of wild-type and mutant PURA protein is likely to recapitulate the heterozygous situation in patients. As a control for background signal, non-dimerizing <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II was measured (negative control). As a control for positive interaction, <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-III was used. While for <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-III the signal intensities above the background level clearly indicated dimerization (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref></bold>), protein fragments with either the F233del or the R245P mutation showed strongly reduced signal intensities. This observation implies impairment of PURA dimerization in patients bearing either of these heterozygous mutations.</p>

<title>N-terminal PUR domain shows great flexibility in its domain fold</title>

<title><italic>hs</italic>PURA bearing mutation R140P with uncertain clinical significance shows wild-type-like domain folding</title>
<p>The mutation R140P had been previously described to be of uncertain clinical significance and it remained to be shown if this mutation affects the protein’s domain folding. CD spectra had already suggested that this mutation has no dramatic effect on the overall domain folding (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref></bold>). To assess if this mutation has a rather local effect on the structural integrity of PURA that may not be detectable by CD spectroscopy, we solved the crystal structure of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II R140P at 2.15 Å resolution (<bold>Appendix Fig S11A, S11B</bold> and <bold>Table S2</bold>). The crystals of R140P mutant protein exhibited the same space group, unit cell parameters, and crystal packing as the wild-type protein (<bold>Appendix Table S2</bold>). The R140P mutation is located at the end of the flexible linker between PUR repeat I and II connecting helix α1 to the strand β5 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref></bold>, <bold>Appendix Fig S11A</bold> and <bold>S11B</bold>). Because of its position in a flexible region, the mutated residue is partially visible only in one out of four PURA chains in the asymmetric unit. The overlap of the R140P mutant structure with the PURA I-II WT fragment confirmed our previous observation about the unusually high flexibility of the strands β4 and β8 forming the β-ridge (<bold>Appendix Fig S11A</bold> and <bold>S11B</bold>). Since no major structural differences were visible between <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II WT and R140P mutant (average r.m.s.d. of 0.89 Å for 133 Cα atoms aligned, <bold>Appendix Fig S11C</bold>), we concluded that this mutation is unlikely to impair the structural integrity of <italic>hs</italic>PURA.</p>

<title><italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II with the patient mutation K97E reveals promiscuous domain folding</title>
<p>To understand how exactly the surface-exposed K97E mutation alters the domain folding of PURA (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref></bold>), we solved the crystal structure of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II K97E (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B-E</xref></bold>, <bold>Appendix Table S2)</bold>. The asymmetric unit of the crystal contained two molecules of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II K97E and showed good overall fold similarity to the <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II structure (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref></bold>). However, an overlay of both molecules of the K97E-mutant protein from the asymmetric unit also revealed unusual differences between them with r.m.s.d of 1.48 Å for 125 superimposed Cα atoms. While one of these molecules (chain A, <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref></bold>) showed a fold very similar to <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II (average r.m.s.d. 1.09 Å, <bold>Appendix Fig S12A</bold>), the second molecule (chain B) displayed much greater structural changes (average r.m.s.d. 1.61 Å, <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref></bold> and <bold>Appendix Fig S12A</bold>). These differences were especially pronounced in PUR repeat II (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D-E</xref></bold>), where we observed a shift of register in the β-sheet by one amino acid in strand β5 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref></bold>) and by two amino acids in strand β6 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref></bold>). More C-terminally, the loop linking β6 and β7 is shorter by two residues, thereby correcting again the sequence register within the next β-strands (β7 and β8).</p>
<p>Already the different molecules of wild-type <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II in the crystal unit cell revealed considerable conformational freedom (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref></bold>, <bold>Appendix Fig S12B</bold> and <bold>S12C</bold>), not only for narrow movements of the loops but also in the folding of the β-strands. For instance, in some of the molecules in the asymmetric unit of the wild-type <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II crystal, β4 and β8 strands formed bulges (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref></bold>, <bold>Appendix Fig S12B</bold> and <bold>S12C</bold>). From all the areas of the structure, the β-ridge appears to be structurally the most divergent part. It is surprising that the K97E point mutation, which is located on the β4 strand of the β-ridge, induces the observed unusual change in the β-sheet arrangement (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C-E</xref></bold>) without destroying the domain’s overall scaffold. Together these findings indicate great structural flexibility of the N-terminal PUR domain and promiscuity in folding, which results in misfolding upon mutation of a surface-exposed residue. While CD measurements suggest a difference in folding between wild-type and K97E mutated PURA (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref></bold>) and the crystal structure of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II K97E indicates folding promiscuity (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C-E</xref></bold>), these data do not fully exclude unfolding of the domain in solution. To distinguish between a mutation-induced unfolding and an altered folded state, we performed NMR measurements with the <sup>15</sup>N-isotope-labeled samples of wild-type and K97E mutant <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II (E57-E212 fragment). First, <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-correlation spectra (HSQC) of both wild-type and K97E constructs showed a clear presence of the structured core, as evidenced by the well-dispersed resonances, with a significant number of residues adopting strand conformation (<sup>1</sup>H 8.5 - 9.5 ppm) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref></bold>). Next, we carefully compared the two HSQC spectra for individual resonances/residues. When the two spectra were overlaid, we observed that a significant number of resonances, especially in the region corresponding to the β-strand, were perturbed, which is clearly more extensive than just affecting the residues adjacent to the mutational site of residue 97 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref></bold>). Finally, we performed the <sup>15</sup>N-heteronuclear NOE experiment on the K97E mutant to measure the residue-level backbone dynamics (<bold>Appendix Fig S13A</bold>). The overlaid spectra of the absence (control) and presence (NOE) of <sup>1</sup>H-saturation shows most resonances retaining their signal intensities (rigid, hetNOE ∼ 0.8), while the resonances corresponding to the dynamic regions, likely N-/C-terminal &amp; loop regions, with significantly reduced signal intensities or even negative (flexible). Importantly, all the resonances perturbed upon K97E mutation remained in the presence of <sup>1</sup>H-saturation, confirming that the structural rearrangement does not induce protein unfolding. Together, this shows that the K97E mutation does not induce global unfolding of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II, but rather triggers structural rearrangements mostly in the β-strand region.</p>
<p>To obtain a better understanding of the intrinsic dynamics of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II we performed <italic>in silico</italic> molecular dynamics simulations. The <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II WT and K97E showed a similar overall profile (<bold>Appendix Fig S13B</bold>), where most of the flexibility or fluctuations are concentrated in the loops connecting strands β3 with β4 and β7 with β8. However, there are some statistically significant differences between the two proteins. The most significant differences concentrate on the two ends of the α1 helix, as well as the β5, β6, and β7 segments. In these regions, the K97E mutant shows higher flexibility than the WT, with the N-terminal part of the α1 helix and the C-terminal end of β5 and β6 having the greatest gap between the two variants. The movie (S1 for <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II WT and S2 for <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II K97E) of the simulation confirms a large degree of fluctuation in this area, which can adopt many different conformations in both WT and mutant. Finally, there is one region where the WT displays a higher flexibility than the mutant, the loop connecting β7 with β8 (residues 175 to 185), although only a few of those differences are significant. Of note, while these simulations are consistent with the increased flexibility suggested by the crystal structure, the time window of these simulations was too short to observe alterations between the two folding states as seen in this experimental structure.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Currently, more than 270 different pathogenic mutations in the <italic>PURA</italic> gene have been identified in over 600 patients with confirmed PURA syndrome (personal communication: PURA Foundation Australia). The aim of this study was to understand how mutations causing this neurodevelopmental disorder affect the functional and structural integrity of the <italic>hs</italic>PURA protein. Towards this goal, we performed cellular, biophysical, and structural analysis with wild-type <italic>hs</italic>PURA as well as with versions of <italic>hs</italic>PURA bearing representative patient-derived mutations.</p>
<p>To understand how PUR-syndrome-causing mutations affect the subcellular localization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA, we performed immunofluorescence microscopic analyses in HeLa cells by overexpressing full-length <italic>hs</italic>PURA as well as variants bearing a disease-causing mutation in each of the three PUR repeats, i.e. K97E, I206F, and F233del. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Daigle <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Markmiller <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>), we observed that <italic>hs</italic>PURA co-localizes to stress granules in HeLa cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref></bold>). As we did not observe significant changes in the association of patient-related mutations of hsPURA to stress granules, it is suggested that this feature may not constitute a major hallmark of the PURA syndrome. It should be noted however that this interpretation must be considered with some caution as the experiments were performed in a PURA wild-type background.</p>
<p>What is more, the knockdown of PURA resulted in reduced sizes of those stress granules (<bold>Appendix Fig S4</bold>), indicating that PURA indeed does have an influence on these granules. Future experiments will be necessary to unambiguously clarify the importance of PURA’s localization to stress granules for the etiology of PURA syndrome.</p>
<p>Very recently, <italic>hs</italic>PURA was reported to localize to P-bodies and that a PURA knockdown leads to a significant reduction in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Molitor <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). While we recapitulated co-localization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA to P-bodies (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref></bold>), <italic>hs</italic>PURA K97E and F233del mutants failed to fully localize to P-bodies. Since the F233del mutation impairs the dimerization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref></bold>), this finding suggests the requirement of dimerization for efficient P-body association.</p>
<p>To address the question of what drives <italic>hs</italic>PURA accumulation in these phase-separated granules, we utilized a <italic>hs</italic>PURA version lacking RNA-binding activity (m11, <bold>Appendix Fig S2</bold>). This mutant failed to localize to stress granules or P-bodies, indicating that RNA binding is essential for both co-localization events. A potential RNA-dependent mechanism to recruit <italic>hs</italic>PURA into stress granules or P-bodies could be liquid phase separation of <italic>hs</italic>PURA when bound to RNAs. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments testing this potential property of <italic>hs</italic>PURA failed to yield phase-separated droplets. In summary, these findings indicate that RNA binding of <italic>hs</italic>PURA is important for its co-localization into stress granules and P-bodies, while we have no evidence that phase separation of <italic>hs</italic>PURA plays a role.</p>
<p>In a recent study, it was shown that a <italic>hs</italic>PURA knock-down in HeLa and in fibroblast cells resulted in down-regulation of the essential P-body proteins LSM14a and DDX6 and, most likely as a direct consequence, in strongly impaired P-body formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Molitor <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). In light of this report, our finding that patient-derived mutations impair the P-body association of <italic>hs</italic>PURA (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref></bold>) provide further evidence for a potential role of P-body localization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA for the etiology of PURA syndrome.</p>
<p>It has been reported that protein domains with PC4-like fold interact with RNA and DNA and are responsible for the separation of the double-stranded nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Darbinian <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Weber <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>) (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Janowski &amp; Niessing, 2020</xref>). In this study, we show that both, the N- and C-terminal PUR domains of human PURA can separate double-stranded nucleic acids (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref></bold>, <bold>4F</bold> and <bold>3D</bold>) and to bind single-stranded nucleic acids (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref></bold>, <bold>4D, 3B</bold> and <bold>3C</bold>). We also tested patient-derived mutant versions of <italic>hs</italic>PURA to find out whether they exhibit impaired interaction with nucleic acids. For the K97E mutated version, we observed in EMSAs a reduced affinity to RNA (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref></bold>). Similar behavior of the K97E mutant was observed in the strand-separation assay where it showed an almost complete loss of activity (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref></bold>). The latter is of interest since previous experiments had demonstrated that strand separation contributes to the neuroprotective activity of PURA in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> FXTAS disease model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Weber <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). It is therefore also probable that loss of strand-separation activity contributes to cellular abnormalities in <italic>hs</italic>PURA patients harboring the K97E mutation.</p>
<p>To establish a structural framework for these observations, we solved the crystal structures of <italic>hs</italic>PURA III (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref></bold>) and of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). These human structures were overall very similar to previously published crystal structures from <italic>dm</italic>PURA (<bold>Appendix Fig S6A</bold> and <bold>S10</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Graebsch <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Weber <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Based on the crystal structures of <italic>hs</italic>PURA III (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref></bold>) we were able to predict folding defects in the C-terminal PUR domain (<italic>hs</italic>PUR III) that are caused by the patient-derived mutations F233del and R245P (<bold>Appendix Fig S9</bold>). Deletion of phenylalanine 233 within the β2-strand changes the orientation of all subsequent side chains within the β-sheet and likely destroys the interaction network required for the assembly of this secondary structure. A mutation of arginine 245 into proline likely disrupts β-strand folding by introducing a kink. Since repeat III mediates homodimer formation through swapping of its α-helices, the dimerization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA is potentially affected by folding defects induced by either the F233del or the R245P mutation. Indeed, we could experimentally confirm by nanoBRET measurements in HEK293 cells that dimerization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-III F233del and <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-III R245 is impaired when compared to wild-type <italic>hs</italic>PURA (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Determination of the crystal structure of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II revealed larger flexible regions than the previously reported invertebrate structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Graebsch <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Graebsch <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Weber <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>), with considerable differences in the four molecules of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II in the asymmetric unit of the crystals (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref></bold>, <bold>Appendix Fig S12B</bold> and <bold>S12C)</bold>. These observations provide clear evidence that in particular strands β4 and β8 of the N-terminal PUR domain are dynamic and can adopt considerable local differences within the β-sheet. This flexibility already suggests structural promiscuity of PUR domains. It also indicates that they can at least partially compensate for structural perturbance by mutations, resulting in folded domains of mutant proteins. However, since these mutations were reported to cause PURA syndrome, such modest structural alterations must nevertheless result in functional impairment.</p>
<p>The interpretation of structural flexibility and folding promiscuity of PUR domains found experimental support from the crystal structure of its K97E variant, whose mutated residue has a solvent-exposed side chain (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B-E</xref></bold>). The corresponding structure shows in the β5 strand a shift by one (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref></bold>) and in the β6 strand by two amino acids (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref></bold>) in one of the molecules of the asymmetric unit. Surprisingly, these structural distortions did not result in major unfolding events of this PUR domain. Furthermore, NMR measurements with the <sup>15</sup>N- and <sup>1</sup>H-labeled N-terminal PUR domain yielded many spectral differences between the wild-type and K97E variants in particular within their β-sheets (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref></bold> and <bold>Appendix Fig S13A</bold>). Despite these considerable structural changes, the NMR data also confirmed that the K97E-mutant protein remains folded in solution and indicates that PUR domains may be able to partially compensate for mutations by folding promiscuity. These findings were further supported by molecular dynamics simulations, indicating high intrinsic motions of the N-terminal PUR domain (<bold>Appendix Fig S13B</bold>).</p>
<p>Instead of hot-spot regions for disease-causing mutations, as reported for other genetic disorders such as neurodevelopmental Rett syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lombardi <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), mutations of PURA-syndrome patients are found along the entire protein sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Johannesen <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Reijnders <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Also, in contrast to disorders such as the Rett syndrome, most of these mutations cause the full spectrum of disease symptoms. Our findings suggest that the flexibility and promiscuity of <italic>hs</italic>PURA domain folding render this protein particularly susceptible to mutations, even when amino-acid substitutions impose only moderate changes to the local charge and stereochemistry. This property of PUR domains might offer a structural explanation for why so many mutations across the sequence of <italic>hs</italic>PURA result in the full disease spectrum.</p>
<p>Not in all cases is the pathogenic effect of a given mutation as clear as in the case of K97E. For instance, the replacement of arginine 140 by proline in <italic>hs</italic>PURA was initially reported to cause PURA syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Even though the corresponding patient did show symptoms, the severity and type of symptoms raised doubts about this initial diagnosis. In our assessment, neither the functional <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments nor the structural assessment of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I-II R140P yielded any significant differences from the wild-type protein (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C-F</xref></bold> and <bold>Appendix Fig S11</bold>). These experimental findings are consistent with R140P being rather a benign mutation. Furthermore, after the initial description of R140P to be causative for PURA Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>), subsequent genomic assessment of a relative of this patient uncovered that this person had the same mutation without any clear symptoms. Consequently, the R140P mutation is now listed in the NCBI ClinVar database to be of “uncertain significance” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/192343/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/192343/</ext-link>). Our data clearly suggest that this mutation is rather benign. In summary, an assessment of the different mutations in <italic>hs</italic>PURA indicates a clear correlation between defects observed in <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses and the reported pathogenicity in patients. Hence, in future such <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses may serve as a diagnostic tool to distinguish pathogenic from benign mutations.</p>
<p>Recently, two publications resorted to <italic>in silico</italic> predicted, AI-based structures to model the potential impact of PURA-syndrome mutations on the structural integrity of <italic>hs</italic>PURA. Instead of assessing the physiologically correct dimer consisting of two PUR repeats, both publications analyzed <italic>in silico</italic>-predicted <italic>hs</italic>PURA half-structure consisting of a single PUR repeat III with incomplete dimerization domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Dai <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lopez-Rivera <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Such half PURA structures are very unlikely to exist in solution and hence predictions based on them are of very limited value or worse, prone to yield wrong interpretations. We expect that our experimentally determined structures of the human N-and C-terminal PUR domains offer more physiological structural reference points for future assessments of novel <italic>hs</italic>PURA mutations and their potential pathogenicity in patients.</p>
<p>In summary, this study provides the first functional and experimental structural assessment of the effects of PURA-syndrome causing mutations on folding, nucleic-acid binding, and unwinding, as well as on subcellular localization to stress granules and P-bodies. Some of the selected patient variants of <italic>hs</italic>PURA were previously predicted to have folding defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Reijnders <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Of note, for all these cases expression tests with recombinant proteins resulted in insoluble samples, indicating that these mutant proteins indeed have impaired folding (<bold>Appendix Table S1</bold>). Whereas predictions of such misfolding events appear reliable, the examples of R140P (benign) and K97E (pathogenic) indicate that structural predictions of surface-exposed residues seem more complicated. In fact, the observed great promiscuity of folding of PUR domains indicates that also moderate surface mutations such as K97E can result in promiscuous folding and the full spectrum of disease symptoms. Our study may serve as proof-of-principle that <italic>in vitro</italic> and structural studies are suitable tools to classify mutations in the <italic>hs</italic>PURA gene as potentially pathogenic or benign.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study addresses the mechanisms by which mutations in the PURA protein, a regulator of gene transcription and mRNA transport and translation, cause the neurodevelopmental PURA syndrome. Based on <bold>convincing</bold> evidence from structural biology, molecular dynamics simulation, biochemical, and cell biological analyses, the authors show that the PURA structure is very dynamic, rendering it generally sensitive to structure-altering mutations that affect its folding, DNA-unwinding activity, RNA binding, dimerization, and partitioning into processing bodies. These findings are of substantial importance to cell biology, neurogenetics, and neurology alike, because they provide first insights into how very diverse PURA mutations can cause similar and penetrant molecular, cellular, and clinical defects.</p>

<p>The present study focuses on the structure and function of human PURA, a regulator of gene transcription and mRNA transport and translation whose mutation causes the neurodevelopmental PURA syndrome, characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, epileptic seizures, a.o. deficits. The authors combined structural biology, molecular dynamics simulation, and various cell biological assays to study the effects of disease-causing PURA mutations on protein structure and function. The corresponding data reveal a highly dynamic PURA structure and show that disease-related mutations in PURA cause complex defects in folding, DNA-unwinding activity, RNA binding, dimerization, and partitioning into processing bodies. These findings provide first insights into how very diverse PURA mutations can cause penetrant molecular, cellular, and clinical defects. This will be of substantial interest to cell biologists, neurogeneticists, and neurologists alike.</p>
<p>A particular strength of the present study is the structural characterization of human PURA, which is a challenging target for structural biology approaches. The molecular dynamics simulations are state-of-the-art, allowing a statistically meaningful assessment of the differences between wild-type and mutant proteins. The functional consequences of PURA mutations at the cellular level are fascinating, particularly the differential compartmentalization of wild-type and mutant PURA variants into certain subcellular condensates.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Review</bold></p>
<p>[...] A particular strength of the present study is the structural characterization of human PURA, which is a challenging target for structural biology approaches. The molecular dynamics simulations are state-of-the-art, allowing a statistically meaningful assessment of the differences between wild-type and mutant proteins. The functional consequences of PURA mutations at the cellular level are fascinating, particularly the differential compartmentalization of wild-type and mutant PURA variants into certain subcellular condensates.</p>
<p>Weaknesses that warrant rectification relate to
(i) The interpretation of statistically non-significant effects seen in the molecular dynamic simulations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We removed from the manuscript the sentence which indicated that we analyzed statistically non-significant effects. Therefore, the above statement has been resolved.</p>
<p>(ii)    The statistical analysis of the differential compartmentalization of PURA variants into processing bodies vs. stress granules, and</p>
<p>We re-analyzed all cell-biological data and adjusted the statistical analysis of P-bodies and Stress-granule intensity analysis. The new, and improved statistics have replaced the original analyses in the corresponding figures (Figs. 1C and 2B).</p>
<p>(iii) Insufficient documentation of protein expression levels and knock-down efficiencies.</p>
<p>Quantification of protein expression levels by Western blotting is shown in Appendix Figure S1. Quantification of knock-down efficiencies by Western blot experiments (Appendix Figure S3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors: Reviewer #1</bold></p>
<p>Concerns and Suggested Changes</p>
<p>(a) I have only one concern about the computational part and that is about statements such as &quot;There are also large differences in the residue surrounding the mutation spot (residues 90 to 100), where the K97E mutant also shows much greater fluctuation. However, these differences are not significant due to the large standard deviations.&quot; If the differences are not statistically significant, then I would suggest either removing such a statement or increasing the statistics.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer’s comment. We removed this sentence from the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors: Reviewer #2</bold></p>
<p>General Comments</p>
<p>This is a challenging structural target and the authors have made considerable efforts to determine the effect of several mutations on the structure and function. Many of the constructs, however, could not be expressed and/or purified in bacteria. However, it is not clear to what extent other expression systems (e.g. <italic>Drosophila</italic> or human) were considered and if this would have been beneficial.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not use other expression systems because the wild-type protein is well-behaved when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In case a mutant variant cannot be expressed or does not behave well in <italic>E. coli</italic>, this constitutes a clear indication that the respective mutation impairs the protein’s integrity. Thus, by using *E. coli *as a reference system for all the variants of PURA protein, we could assess the influence of the mutations on the structural integrity and solubility. Only for the variants that did not show impairment in E. coli expression, we continued to assess in more detail why they are nevertheless functionally impaired and cause PURA Syndrome.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Concerns and Suggested Changes</p>
<p>(a) The schematic in Figure 3A would have been helpful for interpreting the mutations discussed in Figures 1 and 2. I would suggest moving it earlier in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We changed the figure according to the Reviewer’s suggestion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) I believe the RNA used for binding studies in Figures 3C and D was (CGG)8. Are the two &quot;free&quot; RNA bands a monomer and a dimer (duplex?)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although we do not know for certain, it is indeed likely that the two free RNA bands represent either different secondary structures of the free RNA or a duplex of two molecules. Of note, PURA binds to both “free” RNA bands, indicating that it either does not discriminate between them or melts double-stranded RNA in these EMSAs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There also seems to be considerable cooperativity in the binding, so I wonder if a shorter RNA oligonucleotide might facilitate the measurement of Kds.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The length of the used RNA was selected based on the estimated elongated size of the full-length PURA and the presence of 3 PUR repeats. Assuming that one PUR repeat interacts with about 6-7 bases (data from the co-structure of Drosophila PURA with DNA; PDB-ID: 5FGP) and that full-length PURA forms a dimer consisting of three PUR repeats, the full-length protein in its extended form should cover a nucleic-acid stretch of about 24 bases.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, it is not clear how the affinities were measured particularly for hsPURA III since free band is never fully bound at the highest protein concentration.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It was not our goal to measure Kds for the interaction of PURA variants with RNA. The EMSA experiments were conducted to detect relative differences in the interaction between PURA variants and RNA. To estimate the differences, we measured total intensity of the bound (shifted) and unbound RNA. The intensities of the bands observed on the scanned EMSA gels were quantified with FUJI ImageJ software. We calculated the percentage of the shifted RNA and normalized it. hsPURA III fragment shows much lower affinity therefore it does not fully shift RNA with the highest protein concentration when compared to the full-length PURA and to PURA I-II.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(c) Do the human PURA I+II and dmPURA I+ II crystallize in the same space group and have similar packing? Can the observed structural flexibility be due to crystal contacts?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>hsPURA I+II and dmPURA I+II crystallize in different space groups with different crystal packing. In both cases, the asymmetric unit contains 4 independent molecules with the flexible part of the structure composed of the β4 and β8 (β ridge) exposed to solvent. In the case of the Drosophila structure, we do not observe any flexibility of both β-strands. In contrast, for the human PURA structure the β ridge exhibits lots of flexibility and it adopts different conformations in all 4 molecules of the asymmetric unit. We observe similar flexibility of the β4 and β8 (β ridge) in the structure of K97E mutant which contains 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit. We would like to add that we expect crystal contacts to rather stabilize than destabilize domains.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Similarly, can the conformations observed for the K97E mutant be partially explained by packing?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding the sequence shift observed for the β5 and β6 strands in hsPURA I+II K97E variant: although the β5 strand with shifted amino acid sequence is involved in the contact with the symmetry-related molecule with another β5 strand we don’t consider this interaction as a source of the shift. To be sure that the shift is not forced by the crystallization, we had performed NMR measurement which confirmed that in solution there is a strong change in the β-stands comparing WT and K97E mutant. This is an unambiguous indication that the structural changes observed in the crystal structure are also happening in solution. In addition, the MD simulations provide additional confirmation of our interpretation that K97E destabilizes the corresponding PUR domain. Taken together, we provide proof from three different angles that the observed differences indeed affect the integrity and hence function of the protein.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(d) Perhaps, it is my misunderstanding, but I find the NMR data on the Arg sidechains for the K97E confusing. If they are visible for K97E and not WT, doesn't this indicate that there is an exchange between two conformations or more dynamics in the WT structure? This does not seem to be the opposite of the expectation if K97E is thought to have more conformational flexibility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Due to a technical issue (peak contour level), arginine side chain resonances were not clearly visible in the WT spectrum. The figure 5F has been updated. Now, they do correspond to those seen in the mutant spectrum. However, to prevent any confusion or mis/overinterpretation, we removed the sentence regarding arginine side chain: &quot;Intriguingly, arginine side chain resonances Nε-Hε were only visible in the K97E variant, while they were broadened out in the wild-type spectrum.&quot;</p>

<p>(e) The most speculative part of the paper is the interpretation of SG and PB localization of PURA in Fig 1 and 2. There is an important issue with the statistics that must be clarified because it would appear that statistical significance was determined using each SG or PB as an independent measurement. This is incorrect and significance should be measured by only using the means of three biological replicates. This is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rupress.org/jcb/article/219/6/e202001064/151717/SuperPlots-Communicating-reproducibility-and">well described here</ext-link>. It is not clear at this time if the reported P values will be confirmed upon reanalysis, and this may require reinterpretation of the data.</p>

<p>We are grateful for this clarifying comment and agree that the statistical analysis of P-body and stress granule was misleading. Of note, while the figures depicted all the values independent of the biological repeats, the statistical analyses were done on the mean value of each replicate of each cell line and not all raw data points.</p>
<p>We prepared new Plots, only showing the mean value of each replicate, and also re-calculated P-values. The values have changed only slightly in this new analysis because we now also included the previously labeled outliers (red points) to better demonstrate that significance still exists even when considering them.</p>
<p>In the new analysis of stress-granule association, only the value of the K97E mutant lost its significance, indicating that its association to stress granules is not lost. Therefore, we adjusted the following sentences in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Results:</p>
<p>Original: &quot;While quantification showed a reduced association of hsPURA K97E mutant with G3BP1-positive granules (Fig 1B), the two other mutants, I206F and F233del, showed the same co-localization to stress granules as the wild type control.&quot;</p>
<p>Corrected: &quot;In all the patient-related mutations, no significant reduction in stress granule association was seen when compared to the wild type control (Fig 1C).&quot;</p>
<p>Original: &quot;The observation that only one of the patient-related mutations of hsPURA, K97E, showed reduced stress granule association indicates that this feature may not constitute a major hallmark of the PURA syndrome. It should be noted however that this interpretation must be considered with some caution as the experiments were performed in a PURA wild-type background.&quot;</p>
<p>Corrected: &quot;As we did not observe significant changes in the association of patient-related mutations of hsPURA to stress granules, it is suggested that that this feature may not constitute a major hallmark of the PURA syndrome. It should be noted however that this interpretation must be considered with some caution as the experiments were performed in a PURA wild-type background.&quot;</p>

<p>(f) A western blot showing the level of overexpression of the PURA proteins should be shown in Figure 1 as well as the KD of endogenous PURA for Figure S2?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As requested, a Western blot showing the level of overexpression of the different PURA proteins has been added as Appendix Figure S1.</p>
<p>A Western blot of the siRNA-mediated knock-down experiments of PURA and their corresponding control has been added to Appendix Figure S3. Quantification of three biological repeats showed a significant reduction of PURA protein levels upon knock down.</p>

<p>(g) While I appreciate that rewriting is time-consuming, I would recommend considering restructuring the manuscript because I think that it would aid the overall clarity. I think the foundation of the work is the structural characterization and would suggest beginning the paper with this data and the biochemical characterization. The co-localization with SGs and PBs and how this may be relevant to disease is much more speculative and is therefore better to present later. While I appreciate that the structural interpretation of why some mutants localize to PBs differently is not entirely clear, I do think that this would provide some context for the discussion.</p>

<p>In the initial version of the manuscript we first presented the structural characterization of PURA and afterwards the co-localization with SGs and PBs. As this reviewer stated him-/herself in (e), we also noticed that the SG and PB interpretation is the most speculative part of this manuscript. We felt that having this at the end of the results section would weaken the manuscript. On the other hand, we consider that the structural interpretation of mutations is much stronger and has a greater impact for future research. After long discussion we decided to swap the order to leave the most important results for the end of the manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors: Reviewer #3</bold></p>
<p>Concerns and Suggested Changes:</p>
<p>(a) For the characterization of G3BP1-positive stress granules in HeLa cells upon depletion of PURA, it remains unclear what is the efficiency of siRNA? The authors should provide a western blot to indicate how much the endogenous levels were reduced.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We completely agree with the stated concern and addressed it accordingly. We had performed this experiment prior to submission but for some unknown reason it was not included in the manuscript.</p>
<p>The Western blot of siRNA-mediated knock-down experiments of PURA and their corresponding control is now shown in Appendix Figure S3. Quantification of three biological repeats, showed a significant reduction of PURA protein levels upon knock down.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) How does knocking down PURA affect DCP1A-positive structures in HeLa cells? Would P bodies be formed even in the absence (or reduction) of total PURA?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, the stated question is very interesting. In fact, we have already shown in our recent publication (Molitor et al., 2023) that a knock down of PURA in HeLa and NHDF cells leads to a significant reduction of P-bodies. We actually referred to this finding on page 6:</p>
<p>&quot;Since hsPURA was recently shown to be required for P-body formation in HeLa cells and fibroblasts (Molitor et al. 2023), PURA-dependent liquid phase separation could potentially also directly contribute to the formation of these granules.&quot;</p>
<p>On the same page, we also refer to the underlying molecular mechanism:</p>
<p>&quot;However, when putting this observation in perspective with previous reports, it seems unlikely that P-body formation directly depends on phase separation by hsPURA, but rather on its recently reported function as gene regulator of the essential P-body core factors LSM14a and DDX6 (Molitor et al., 2023).&quot;</p>
