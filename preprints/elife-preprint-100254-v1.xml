<title>Abstract</title><p>Here we report our attempt to replicate reports of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Published results from multiple laboratories show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> adults and their F1 embryos exposed to the pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> show pathogen aversion behavior and a pathogen exposure-dependent increase in <italic>daf-7/TGF</italic>β reporter gene expression. However, results from one group show persistence of the aversion behavior and elevated <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the F2, F3, and F4 generations. In contrast, we failed to consistently detect either the pathogen avoidance response or elevated <italic>daf-7</italic> expression beyond the F1 generation. The experimental methods are well-described, the source materials are readily available, including samples from the reporting laboratory, and we explored a variety of environmental conditions likely to account for lab-to-lab variability. None of these adjustments altered our results. Thus, we conclude that this example of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance lacks the robustness required for reliable experimental replication and investigation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>C. elegans</italic> worms exposed to the pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (strain PA14) learn to avoid this specific pathogen upon subsequent exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). PA14 exposure also induces the expression of a reporter (<italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic>) for the cytokine TGF-β in the ASI neurons of PA14-exposed animals (Meisel and Kim, 2014). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Moore et al. (2019)</xref> and three follow-up papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Moore et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Sengupta et al., 2024</xref>) Murphy and colleagues report that <italic>C. elegans</italic> adults trained to avoid PA14 transmit this learned avoidance and elevated <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> expression in ASI neurons to four generations of progeny (F1-F4). They further reported that numerous RNA interference (RNAi) associated genes, including the dsRNA transport proteins SID-1 and SID-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Winston et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Feinberg 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Winston et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">McEwan et al., 2012</xref>), are required for the inheritance of the behavioral response and elevated <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Moore et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>). To date, no follow-up reports by independent groups have been published on the transgenerational character of this response. We were keen to reproduce these results and investigate in detail the contributions of the dsRNA transport proteins SID-1 and SID-2 to transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI).</p>
<p>We readily reproduced learned behavior and elevated <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> expression in trained parents (P0) and their F1 progeny, but after many attempts, and numerous protocol adjustments, we failed to reproducibly replicate inheritance among F2 progeny. While we have been unable to identify a specific methodological cause for our different results, we conclude that this example of TEI is insufficiently robust for experimental investigation.</p>

<title>The reported PA14 training conditions failed to produce an avoidance response or elevated <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> expression in ASI neurons among F2 progeny</title>
<p>PA14-exposed animals (P0) and their progeny (F1) avoid PA14 in subsequent choice assays and show elevated <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> expression in ASI neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Moore et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Pereira et al., 2020</xref>; Sengupta et al., 2023). The Murphy group has reported that both responses are transgenerationally inherited by F2-F4 generation worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Moore et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>; Sengupta et al., 2023). To investigate the mechanisms for intergenerational (F1) and transgenerational (F2-F4) inheritance, we first attempted to replicate these results in wild-type animals. The choice assay and <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> expression assay experiments were performed as described in the published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Moore et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Moore et al., 2021b</xref>) with minor adjustments from the latest training protocol (Coleen Murphy personal communication, see Document S2). The pathogen avoidance response in the trained animals (P0 generation) was robust and often detected among their F1 progeny fertilized during parental exposure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A-1C</xref>). However, the transgenerational (F2) response was not detected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A-1C</xref>). In contrast, while the magnitude and significance of the elevated <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> expression in the ASI neurons in the P0 generation was variable, the response in the F1 generation was strong and statistically highly significant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D-1I</xref>). Unlike the results reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Moore et al. (2019)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kaletsky et al. (2020)</xref>, we did not observe a <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> response in the F2 generation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D-1I</xref>).</p>

<p>Motivated to reproduce the reported results, we obtained and tested independent isolates of the bacterial strains PA14 and OP50. We obtained and used a PA14 isolate from the Balskus lab (Harvard University) and both PA14 and OP50 isolates from the Murphy lab (Princeton University). Similar results were obtained using these reagents (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

<title>Modifying training and growth conditions did not result in more reliable detection of transgenerational responses to PA14 exposure</title>
<p>We then explored procedural and environmental variations in our attempts to replicate these key observations. To train animals to recognize and avoid PA14, gravid wild-type (N2) adults grown on high growth (HG) plates seeded with <italic>E. coli</italic> strain OP50 were treated with sodium hypochlorite (bleach) to prepare aseptic P0 embryos, which were hatched and grown on HG OP50 plates at 20°C for 48-52 hours. Larval stage 4 (L4) animals were then gently washed from these plates and placed on normal growth (NG) plates seeded with either OP50 (control) or PA14 (training) for 24 hours and then similarly recovered for testing and bleach isolation of F1 embryos. Because the 24-hour training period on PA14 limits reproduction and therefore recovery of F1 progeny, the published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Moore et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Moore et al., 2021b</xref>) suggests plating four times more animals on PA14 than on OP50 to compensate for the reduced fertility. We found this insufficient to reliably produce sufficient embryos for multigenerational experiments, and instead delayed the start of training by an additional eight hours (56-60 hours), when most animals are young adults. We note that the latest protocol for transgenerational avoidance training also introduces a similar delay prior to training on PA14 (C. Murphy personal communication). These young adults produced comparable P0 and F<sub>1</sub> results (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) and greatly improved F1 egg recovery, allowing for more reliable testing of F1 and F2 progeny. Importantly, at the end of the 24-hour training period (80-84 hours since embryo isolation, 20°C) the naïve and trained worm populations had laid many eggs, ensuring that the recovered in utero F1 eggs were fertilized after exposure to PA14. This change in training time usually produced sufficient F1 and F2 animals for measurement of <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> expression levels in the ASI neurons and learned avoidance assays. However, the trained and control F2 progeny remained nearly indistinguishable (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition to using the latest training protocol (C. Murphy personal communication), we also tested variations to the protocol, including worm growth temperature (15°C, 20°C, 25°C) before training (husbandry), during training, and in the F1-F2 generations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, Table S1, and Table S2). Increased cultivation temperature (25°C) is known to increase <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Tan et al., 1999</xref>), and the experiments that identified the <italic>daf-7p:::gfp</italic> response to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> were performed at 25°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Meisel, et al., 2014</xref>). In line with this, we observed more robust <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> expression in ASI neurons in P0 animals exposed to PA14 at 25°C (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). However, none of these adjustments resulted in robust elevated <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> expression in F2 progeny (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and Table S1). While 25°C growth enhanced PA14-induced <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> expression in P0 animals, the effect at the F2 generations was an apparent increase in variability, as the F2 progeny of PA14 and OP50 trained animals were more likely to show statistically significant differences in <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> expression, but in either direction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Similarly, modified training and growth conditions to enable inheritance of learned avoidance behavior did not result in significant changes to P0 and F1 inheritance results and did not result in robust detection of learned avoidance in the F2 progeny (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and Table S2).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Using a single-copy <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> reporter strain did not result in elevated <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> expression in ASI neurons among F2 progeny</title>
<p>The strain FK181 contains an integrated multi-copy <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> reporter and the co-injection marker <italic>rol-6(su1000)</italic> [pRF4] tandem array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Murakami et al., 2001</xref>). We noticed sporadic loss of both the Rol-6 phenotype and <italic>gfp</italic> expression from the line, suggesting either spontaneous transgene silencing or changes in the <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> reporter copy number. To characterize this in greater detail, we established and maintained nine independent FK181 lines and observed co-incident loss of the Roller phenotype and <italic>gfp</italic> expression in all nine lines, and in six of nine lines this loss of array phenotypes was heritable (Table S3). It is known that growth conditions and mutations that modulate small RNA pathways can affect transgene expression levels from multi-copy tandem arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">MacMorris et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cui et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Fischer et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we obtained QL296, a strain containing an integrated single-copy <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> reporter that does not include a co-injection marker with a morphological or growth phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhan et al., 2015</xref>). The QL296 fluorescent readout was less bright than FK181 but reproduced the elevated <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> fluorescence in P0 and F1 progeny. Encouragingly, the coefficient of variation was reduced to about 0.27 (Figure S1), which should increase sensitivity to detect differences in <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> expression. However, measured <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> levels in F2 animals carrying the single-copy reporter were usually indistinguishable between trained and control animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Performing the learned avoidance assay in light or dark conditions did not produce heritable F2 avoidance</title>
<p>A recent report indicates that visible light contributes to <italic>C. elegans</italic> ability to detect and avoid PA14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ghosh et al., 2021</xref>). We found that choice assays performed in the light (on benchtop) or in the dark (in a closed cabinet) both readily produced learned (P0) and inherited (F1) PA14 avoidance but that F2 inheritance of learned avoidance was not reliably detected in either assay condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The choice index ([number of animals choosing OP50 - number of animals choosing PA14] / Total number of choices) for assays performed in the light for both trained and control animals were frequently higher than the choice index for assays performed in the dark, however the learning indexes (the relative differences) were indistinguishable. Thus, ambient lighting conditions can impact the measured choice index between control and PA14, but they do not detectably disrupt the learning index. Overall, none of the environmental adjustments were sufficient to reproduce the reported results; the summary analysis of the learning indexes for all experiments showed highly significant P0 training results, modest F1 intergenerational inheritance, and insignificant F2 transgenerational inheritance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>).</p>

<title>OP50 growth conditions strongly affect OP50 aversion</title>
<p>Naïve (OP50 grown) worms can show a bias towards <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> in choice assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ha et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Moore et al., 2019</xref>). This is likely caused by the fact that <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 is a mild <italic>C. elegans</italic> pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Garigan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Garsin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>) and the naïve worms presented with a choice between a recently experienced mild pathogen (OP50) and a novel food choice (PA14) initially choose the novel food instead of the known mild pathogen (OP50 aversion). Because the difference in the choice between trained and naïve animals in the P0 generation is highly significant, while the difference in the F1 generation is much reduced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), even a slight reduction in naïve aversion to OP50 could affect the ability to detect PA14 avoidance in F1 and F2 animals. Indeed, in our experiments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), the control worms frequently showed a choice index score higher and more variable than that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Moore et al. (2019)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kaletsky et al. (2020)</xref>. Furthermore, because OP50 pathogenicity is enhanced by increased <italic>E. coli</italic> nutritive conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Garsin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shi et al., 2006</xref>), the growth of F1-F4 progeny on High Growth (HG) plates immediately prior to the F1-F4 choice assays may further contribute to OP50 aversion among the control animals. We note that in each aversion assay experiment that produced a significant F1 result, the average F1 control choice index score was lower than that detected in the preceding P0 generation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, changes in growth conditions that enhance OP50 aversion (lower choice index score) could magnify the difference between trained and control animals.</p>
<p>To test the effect of OP50 growth conditions on OP50 aversion we plated young adult N2 animals from HG OP50 plates on either HG OP50 or NG OP50 plates prepared exactly as for control training plates. After 24 hours the HG OP50 “trained” and NG OP50 “control” animals were tested on standard OP50 vs PA14 choice assay plates. In four experiments the magnitude of the differences in mean choice index (Learning Index, LI) exceeded 0.4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). However, the inter-experiment variability was also high, with two experiments failing to detect a difference and two experiments showing an inverse result to the other four. We note that when analyzing the sum of all worm choices across all choice assay plates by Fisher’s exact test (Figure S5), five of eight experiments show that HG OP50 growth conditions induce OP50 avoidance. Although the results in the majority of experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that HG OP50 exposure enhances OP50 aversion (negative learning index), due to the variability between experiments we interpret the results as inconclusive. However, the results do highlight the sensitivity of the choice assay to environmental differences and demonstrate the not inconsequential difference between NG OP50 and HG OP50 conditions. Although the experimental design implicitly controls for the difference between P0 and F1 generation growth conditions, the magnitude of the NG OP50 vs HG OP50 response, which can exceed the magnitude of the OP50 vs PA14 F1 response but in the opposite direction, suggests that this experimental variable may contribute to the irreproducibility of the published results. Indeed, any enhanced OP50 aversion that results from growing worms on HG OP50 plates likely increases the ability to detect lingering PA14 aversion.</p>

<p>While these observations do not explain our inability to replicate the published results, they do illustrate the sensitivity of the choice assay to differences in bacterial growth conditions, supporting the conjecture that non-obvious growth condition differences, beyond what we have explicitly tested, may contribute to the discrepancy between our results and the previously published results.</p>

<title>Reanalysis of small RNA seq data identifies candidate siRNA-regulated pathogen response genes</title>
<p>The RNAi mutant analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) confirmed the results by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Moore et al. (2019)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kaletsky et al. (2020)</xref> that some RNAi pathways are important for intergenerational inheritance of PA14 avoidance. Since anti-sense endo-siRNAs have been implicated in heritable gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Minkina and Hunter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Duempelmann et al., 2020</xref>), PA14 induced changes in small RNAs targeting mRNAs that respond to PA14 exposure may identify heritable RNAi-regulated pathogen response pathways. To investigate the contribution of regulatory small RNAs to heritable pathogen avoidance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Moore et al. (2019)</xref> sequenced mRNAs and small RNAs from control and PA14 trained P0 animals. The assembled small RNA sequencing libraries contain both sense-strand (piRNAs or 21U-RNAs and miRNAs) and anti-sense strand (endogenous siRNAs) small RNAs, yet the published work appears to have presented only findings on the sense-strand small RNAs. To determine whether PA14-induced changes in antisense RNA levels may contribute to heritable pathogen responses, we reanalyzed the sequencing data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Moore et al. (2019)</xref>. We detected sense strand small RNAs that correspond to 2041 genes that increased (1429) or decreased (612) by 2-fold or more (Padj. ≤ 0.05) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), which, using our pipeline, is similar to the mapping data published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Moore et al. 2019</xref> (1252 up and 450 down). We also mapped differentially expressed anti-sense small RNAs to over 4000 genes (3928 up &gt; 2-fold and 171 down &gt; 2-fold) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We then plotted the predicted mRNA targets that changed by 2-fold or more (P adj. ≤ 0.05) against the anti-sense small RNAs that changed by 2-fold or more (P adj. ≤ 0.05), identifying 116 mRNAs that are putatively regulated by the endogenous RNAi pathway in response to PA14 exposure (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Curiously, the <italic>maco-1</italic> gene (red dot in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), identified as the regulatory target for the piRNA mediated multi-generational response to PA14 exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kaletsky et al. 2020</xref>), is not targeted by many differentially expressed anti-sense endo-siRNAs. Thus, the effect of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-expressed small RNA P11 on <italic>maco-1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>) is not likely to be directly mediated by the endogenous RNAi pathway.</p>

<p>We then analyzed gene ontology descriptions of the detectably expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Schindelman et al., 2011</xref>) to determine whether any of the subset of genes potentially regulated by the endo-RNAi pathways are likely to contribute to the heritable pathogen aversion. We found that 257 of the 14,194 detected expressed genes are annotated as either innate immune response or defense response against bacteria (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Eight of the 116 genes putatively regulated by endo-siRNAi pathways (blue dots in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>; 3.8 fold enrichment) are so annotated (Table S4). This analysis demonstrates that small RNA regulated genes are differentially expressed in response to pathogen exposure. While the identified genes are candidates for mediating a heritable pathogen aversion, it will be necessary to determine whether they and their candidate small RNA regulators are differentially regulated in the F1 and F2 progeny of pathogen exposed animals.</p>

<title>Summary of thoughts and concerns regarding the potential causes of the irreproducibility</title>
<p>Likely causes for the discrepancy between our results and the published reports include uncontrolled environmental variables or genetic drift (microbes or worms). To control for this, we included in our investigation independent isolates of OP50 and PA14, we cultured worms at different growth temperatures, and we prepared bacterial samples under different growth regimes (aeration vs standing liquid cultures). We also performed a PA14 killing assay to confirm that our PA14 growth conditions induced strong pathogenicity (Figure S3); notably PA14-B and PA14-M both tested more lethal than previously reported results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Moore et al., 2019</xref>). We also showed that OP50 control culture conditions can dramatically affect naïve worm behavior in the PA14-OP50 choice assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Some environmental differences may be systemic and rooted to laboratory or geographical constraints, including humidity, which could affect salinity levels, lysogen activation, or the presence of other, potentially contaminating bacteria in the environment reflecting adjacent laboratory activities. If these potential environmental differences are sufficient to obscure the detection of the transgenerational effect, then the robustness and ecological significance of the transgenerational effect in a natural setting must be minor.</p>
<p>The imaging-based assay measures the expression of a multicopy <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> transgene. We noted that although this transgene array is integrated, the FK181 strain must be monitored for maintenance of the Rol phenotype which correlates with detection of <italic>gfp</italic>. Similar observations have been made by the Murphy group (C. Murphy personal communication). The instability of the FK181 strain may reflect sporadic transgene silencing or transgene-array rearrangements resulting in lower transgene expression. These observations illustrate that this key reagent is not reliable. To control for this, we obtained the published single-copy non-Rol <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> strain QL296 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhan et al., 2015</xref>). Using this single-copy <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> reporter we detected robust difference in the P0 and F1 generations, but did not detect significant differences in the F2 generation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, Table S1).</p>
<p>We also note that none of the raw data for the published figures and unpublished replicate experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Moore et al., 2019</xref>) is available on the publisher’s website and, although requested from the corresponding author, has not been provided. This has hampered our ability to fully compare all our results with theirs and to identify additional experimental parameters for further investigation.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>Although we cannot explain the cause of the differences between our results and the published results, we can confidently conclude that this example of TEI is insufficiently robust for experimental investigation of the mechanisms of multi-generational inheritance. Our attempts to troubleshoot the protocol eliminated some variables, including growth temperature, developmental timing, genetic drift of either WT (N2) or reporter strains (FK181 and QL296) or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14 (all refreshed from independent stocks). In addition, we determined that some environmental differences associated with the choice assay (light), although potentially altering the choice index, had similar relative effects on trained and control animals (the learning index). PA14 is a lethal pathogen and OP50 is a mild pathogen, thus the most likely cause for the discrepant results is subtle differences in OP50 physiology in the post P0 generations that affects the magnitude of OP50 aversion. Indeed, we showed that 24 hour exposure to slightly more pathogenic OP50 dramatically enhanced OP50 aversion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, in choice assays between OP50 and the strong pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas vranovensis,</italic> naïve worms strongly avoid OP50 and even the <italic>P. vranovensis</italic> trained animals display moderate OP50 aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Sengupta et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>The heritable behavioral and physiological plasticity induced by pathogens is likely to reveal fundamental evolutionarily and ecologically relevant pathways. However, the history of heritable epigenetic research has frequently been hobbled by the difficulty of controlling all environmental factors and the lack of reproducible phenotypic assays. Thus, independent reproducibility is of paramount concern, and can only be helped by complete transparency, including the publication of data for all complete replicates.</p>

<p>Wild-type (N2, FK181, QL296) and mutant worms (Table S5) were grown on NG or HG OP50 plates without starvation, crowding, or contamination for a minimum of three generations before hypochlorite treatment to obtain P0 embryos. Fresh hypochlorite solution was prepared immediately prior to each use. Adult worms were pelleted or allowed to settle (15 mL tube), resuspended in 5-10 mL of hypochlorite solution, and mixed continuously by nutating or vortexing, to minimize contact time with the hypochlorite solution. In some experiments as the adults were initially breaking open (~3-5 minutes) and the solution began to acquire a yellow tint, the worms and released embryos were pelleted, resuspended in fresh hypochlorite solution, and mixed for an additional 2-3 minutes, until less than 5% of adult body parts were visible. The embryos were pelleted and washed 4-5X in 5-15 mL of M9 buffer. The last M9 wash optionally contained 0.01% Triton X100 to inhibit embryos from sticking to the plastic. We note that the published protocols emphatically assert that worms must not be centrifuged immediately prior to bleach treatment and that bleach-treated embryos must be handled gently. Empirical evidence does not support this assertion as the adult worms bleached to prepare P0, F1, and F2 embryos for experiments 5.1 and 5.2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, Table S2) were treated gently or centrifuged and vortexed during bleaching respectively and showed no meaningful differences between the results.</p>
<p>In all experiments animals from one or several pooled training plates were treated as a single biological replicate, with a portion of the animals assayed and a portion used for propagation for the next generation. We note that experiments performed in parallel from independent training plates showed statistical variation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), thus using one set of training plates forassays and a separate set of training plates for propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Moore et al., 2021b</xref>) likely introduces uncontrolled variation.</p>

<title>Measuring <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> levels in ASI neurons</title>
<p>Both wild-type <italic>daf-7p::gfp</italic> strains (FK181, QL296) and QL296-derived RNAi pathway mutants (HC1218, HC1221, HC1222, and HC1223) were maintained and trained on OP50 or PA14 as described above. Immediately before each respective imaging session approximately 30-40 trained or control animals were transferred by platinum wire directly to 5 uL of 2.5-10mM levamisole in M9 on 10% agarose pads. A coverslip was added and adhered to the slide by application of beeswax to the corners. For the brighter FK181 animals, GFP z-stacks were collected at 1 μm intervals at 63x magnification on a Zeiss spinning disc confocal microscope. For QL296 strains, GFP z-stacks were collected at 0.5 μm intervals at 63x magnification on a Zeiss LSM 980 confocal microscope (Harvard Center for Biological Imaging). For data analysis, a maximum intensity projection (MIP) was generated for each z-stack and MIPs across all conditions and generations were then blinded. If the ASI neurons overlapped, then MIPs were generated from subsets of levels in the z-stacks without overlap and scored separately. Each ASI neuron was manually selected from each MIP using the ImageJ polygon selection tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). The mean pixel intensity was recorded from each and normalized to nearby background for each MIP. We noted bimodality in the distributions of ASI <italic>gfp</italic> expression levels in our data, which likely reflects the position of the bilateral ASI neurons relative to the objective. To compensate for this, we used the average GFP level per pair of neurons in each worm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). We note that measured GFP expression levels in each ASI neuron within an animal are not independent, thus using the average avoids the artifactual bimodal distribution and reports the actual sample size for statistical purposes. We also note that coefficient of variation values using the average ASI level per worm were 20% lower for FK181 and 50% lower for QL296 (Figure S1) which should increase the ability to detect differences between trained and control animals. Using the average for each neuron pair or treating each neuron as an independent sample altered the statistical significance of some experiments but did not reverse any result (Figure S2). Z-scores were calculated from normalized intensity values for all samples within a data set, and any data point with a |Z| &gt; 3 was removed. Unpaired, two-tailed Welch’s t-test was performed to generate all reported p-values. Statistics and figures were prepared using R Studio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wickham, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Posit Team, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">R Core Team, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wickham, 2023</xref>).</p>

<title>Choice assay conditions, sample size, statistical analysis, and multigenerational propagation</title>
<p>Sodium Azide is historically used to preserve transient worm choices in arena chemotaxis assays. In the food choice assay the effect of the sodium azide can paralyze worms before they enter the bacteria lawn, possibly interfering with their choice. To determine whether sodium azide may influence worm choice, we performed some assays without sodium azide. We found that independent of the application of azide, most worms had made a choice within 15 minutes and that essentially no worm left their initial food choice during the first hour (data not shown). These no-azide assay plates were moved to 4°C after 30-60 minutes to preserve their initial food choice spot while individual assay plates were returned to room temperature for counting. Individual worms were removed as counted to ensure complete and accurate counts. The addition of azide had no discernable effect on the choice assay results.</p>
<p>For comparison to published results, we present the choice assay results in quartile box plots and report a Wilcoxon unpaired P-value for choice assays. We used a one-sample two-tailed T-test to calculate the P-value associated with the summary figure plotting the learning indices for each experiment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). The reporting of individual choice assay results as single data points in quartile box plots assumes that there are differences between choice plates that need to be included in significance tests and are independent of the number of worms assayed, limiting the power of the statistical analysis by the number of choice plates. However, under the assumption that there are no meaningful environmental differences between choice assay plates, the relevant outcome for the experimental design is the overall sum of choices across all choice plates. Here, the null model is that, independent of training condition, each worm chooses OP50 over PA14 with a probability preference p. Testing n worms, independent of the number of animals per choice plate or number of choice plates, the number that choose OP50 is X=pn, with X being binomially distributed. These results can be analyzed by a 2 × 2 contingency table: two conditions (OP50 vs PA14 training) and two outcomes (OP50 or PA14 choice). In this analysis, Fisher’s exact test can be used to test the effect of training on the probability preference p. The results of this alternative analysis of our data are presented in Figure S4, Figure S5, and Figure S6.</p>
<p>While Moore et al., did not publish their raw choice data, details in this and subsequent reports suggest that their sample sizes in some choice assays may have been unreasonably small (as few as 10-20 worms per assay plate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Moore et al., 2021b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Moore et al. (2021b)</xref> cautioned that crowding may influence choice, but we found no difference between choice index scores and sample size (Figure S7).

<title>RNA-seq data analysis</title>
<p>PRJNA509938 RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Moore et al., 2019</xref>) were re-analyzed from the level of raw sequence reads. The reads were trimmed of universal adaptors using <italic>cutadapt</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Martin, 2011</xref>) and aligned to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> WBcel235 genome using <italic>bowtie</italic> aligner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) with no more than 2 mismatches allowed (v=2). Aligned reads were counted using <italic>HTSeq-count</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anders et al., 2015</xref>) (union mode) with settings <italic>stranded=no</italic> for mRNA-seq data, and <italic>stranded=yes</italic> (for reads mapped to the same strand as the genomic feature) or <italic>stranded=reverse</italic> (for reads mapped to the opposite strand as the genomic feature) for small RNA data. Differential expression analysis was carried out using DESeq2 R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Absolute value of log2FC≥1 and Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value ≤0.05 were used to define significant changes in gene expression or small RNA levels. Volcano plots were built with EnhancedVolcano (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Blighe, 2023</xref>) and ggpubr R packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kassambra, 2023</xref>).</p>

<title>Pathogenicity assay</title>
<p>The Balkus and Murphy isolates of the PA14 strain were cultured at 37°C for 14 or 18 hours. OP50 was similarly cultured for 18 hours. Each culture was diluted in LB to OD 1.0 and 0.75 ml spread to cover the entire agar surface of NG plates which were then incubated at 25°C for 48 hours before addition of N2 adults. To prepare the N2 adults HG OP50 grown worms (20°C) were bleached and their embryos were placed on HG OP50 plates for 72 hours (20°C). A single population of adults were washed from the plates with M9, allowed to settle, washed once with M9, resuspended at 4-5 worms/µl and 20 µl spotted onto three technical replicate plates for each condition. The plates were then incubated at 20°C and scored at 24 hours and at 12-hour intervals thereafter until all the PA14 grown animals were dead. Corpses were counted and removed at each interval. Approximately 15-30% of the PA14 cultured worms were found desiccated on the walls of the plates at the 24-hour time point and were not included in the count. All living worms were transferred to freshly prepared plates at 48 and 96 hours. The fraction of surviving worms was determined by (1 – (cumulative number of dead worms at each scoring interval/sum of the number of living and cumulative dead worms at 120 hours)). All PA14 cultured animals were dead by 120 hours.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors report an inability to reproduce a transgenerational memory of avoidance of the pathogen PA14 in C. elegans. Instead, the authors demonstrate intergenerational inheritance for a single F1 generation, in embryos of mothers exposed to OP50 and PA14, where embryos isolated from these mothers by bleaching are capable of remembering to avoid PA14 in a manner that is dependent on systemic RNAi proteins sid-1 and sid-2. This could reflect systemic sRNAs generated by neuronal daf-7 signaling that are transmitted to F1 embryos. The authors note that transgenerational memory of PA14 was reported by the Murphy group at Princeton, but that environmental or strain variation (worms or bacteria) might explain the single generation of inheritance observed at Harvard. The Hunter group tried different bacterial growth conditions and different worm growth temperatures for independent PA14 strains, which they showed to be strongly pathogenic. However, the authors could not reproduce a transgenerational effect at Harvard. This important data will allow members of the scientific community to focus on the robust and reproducible inheritance of PA14 avoidance transmitted to F1 embryos of mothers exposed to PA14, which the authors demonstrate depends on small RNAs in a manner that is downstream of or in parallel to daf-7. This paper honestly and importantly alters expectations and questions the model that avoidance of PA14 is mediated by a bacterial ncRNA whose siRNAs target a C. elegans gene. Instead, endogenous C. elegans sRNAs that affect pathogen response may be the culprit that explains sRNA-mediated avoidance.</p>
<p>Overall, this is an important paper that demonstrates that one model for transgenerational inheritance in C. elegans is not reproducible. This is important because it is not clear how many of the reported models of transgenerational inheritance reported in C. elegans are reproducible. The authors do demonstrate a memory for F1 embryos that could be a maternal effect, and the authors confirm that this is mediated by a systemic small RNA response. There are several points in the manuscript where a more positive tone might be helpful.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors note that the high copy number daf-7::GFP transgene used by the Murphy group displayed variable expression and evidence for somatic silencing or transgene breakdown in the Hunter lab, as confirmed by the Murphy group. The authors nicely use single copy daf-7::GFP to show that neuronal daf-7::GFP is elevated in F1 but not F2 progeny with regards to the memory of PA14 avoidance, speaking to an intergenerational phenotype.</p>
<p>The authors nicely confirm that sid-1 and sid-2 are generally required for intergenerational avoidance of F1 embryos of moms exposed to PA14. However, these small RNA proteins did not affect daf-7::GFP elevation in the F1 progeny. This result is unexpected given previous reports that single copy daf-7::GFP is not elevated in F1 progeny of sid mutants. Because the Murphy group reported that daf-7 mutation abolishes avoidance for F1 progeny, this means that the sid genes function downstream of daf-7 or in parallel, rather than upstream as previously suggested.</p>
<p>The authors studied antisense small RNAs that change in Murphy data sets, identifying 116 mRNAs that might be regulated by sRNAs in response to PA14. Importantly, the authors show that the maco-1 gene, putatively targeted by piRNAs according to the Kaletsky 2020 paper, displays few siRNAs that change in response to PA14. The authors conclude that the P11 ncRNA of PA14, which was proposed to promote interkingdom RNA communication by the Murphy group, is unlikely to affect maco-1 expression by generating sRNAs that target maco-1 in C. elegans. The authors define 8 genes based on their analysis of sRNAs and mRNAs that might promote resistance to PA14, but they do not further characterize these genes' role in pathogen avoidance. The Murphy group might wish to consider following up on these genes and their possible relationship with P11.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This very thorough and interesting manuscript is at times pugnacious.</p>
<p>Please explain more clearly what is High Growth media for E. coli in the text and methods, conveying why it was used by the Murphy lab, and if Normal Growth or High Growth is better for intergenerational heritability assays.</p>

<p>This paper examines the reproducibility of results reported by the Murphy lab regarding transgenerational inheritance of a learned avoidance behavior in C. elegans. It has been well established by multiple labs that worms can learn to avoid the pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14) after a single exposure. The Murphy lab has reported that learned avoidance is transmittable to 4 generations and dependent on a small RNA expressed by PA14 that elicits the transgenerational silencing of a gene in C. elegans. The Hunter lab now reports that although they can reproduce inheritance of the learned behavior by the first generation (F1), they cannot reproduce inheritance in subsequent generations.</p>
<p>This is an important study that will be useful for the community. Although they fail to identify a &quot;smoking gun&quot;, the study examines several possible sources for the discrepancy, and their findings will be useful to others interested in using these assays. The preference assay appears to work in their hands in as much as they are able to detect the learned behavior in the P0 and F1 generations, suggesting that the failure to reproduce the transgenerational effect is not due to trivial mistakes in the protocol. An obvious reason, however, to account for the differing results is that the culture conditions used by the authors are not permissive for the expression of the small RNA by PA14 that the MUrphy lab identified as required for transgenerational inheritance. It would seem prudent for the authors to determine whether this small RNA is present in their cultures, or at least acknowledge this possibility. The authors should also note that their protocol was significantly different from the Murphy protocol (see comments below) and therefore it remains possible that protocol differences cumulatively account for the different results.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>It has been previously reported in many high-profile papers, that C. elegans can learn to avoid pathogens. Moreover, this learned pathogen avoidance can be passed on to future generations - up to the F5 generation in some reports. In this paper, Gainey et al. set out to replicate these findings. They successfully replicated pathogen avoidance in the exposed animals, as well as a strong increase in daf-7 expression in ASI neurons in F1 animals, as determined by a daf-7::GFP reporter construct. However, they failed to see strong evidence for pathogen avoidance or daf-7 overexpression in the F2 generation. The failure of replication is the major focus of this work.</p>
<p>Given their failure to replicate these findings, the authors embark on a thorough test of various experimental confounders that may have impacted their results. They also re-analyze the small RNA sequencing and mRNA sequencing data from one of the previously published papers and draw some new conclusions, extending this analysis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors provide a thorough description of their methods, and a marked-up version of a published protocol that describes how they adapted the protocol to their lab conditions. It should be easy to replicate the experiments.</p>
<p>(2) The authors test the source of bacteria, growth temperature (of both C. elegans and bacteria), and light/dark husbandry conditions. They also supply all their raw data, so that the sample size for each testing plate can be easily seen (in the supplementary data). None of these variations appears to have a measurable effect on pathogen avoidance in the F2 generation, with all but one of the experiments failing to exhibit learned pathogen avoidance.</p>
<p>(3) The small RNA seq and mRNA seq analysis is well performed and extends the results shown in the original paper. The original paper did not give many details of the small RNA analysis, which was an oversight. Although not a major focus of this paper, it is a worthwhile extension of the previous work.</p>
<p>(4) It is rare that negative results such as these are accessible. Although the authors were unable to determine the reason that their results differ from those previously published, it is important to document these attempts in detail, as has been done here. Behavioral assays are notoriously difficult to perform and public discourse around these attempts may give clarity to the difficulties faced by a controversial field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Although the &quot;standard&quot; conditions have been tested over multiple biological replicates, many of the potential confounders that may have altered the results have been tested only once or twice. For example, changing the incubation temperature to 25{degree sign}C was tested in only two biological replicates (Exp 5.1 and 5.2) - and one of these experiments actually resulted in apparent pathogen avoidance inheritance in the F2 generation (but not in the F1). An alternative pathogen source was tested in only one biological replicate (Exp 3). Given the variability observed in the F2 generation, increasing biological replicates would have added to the strengths of the report.</p>
<p>(2) A key difference between the methods used here and those published previously, is an increase in the age of the animals used for training - from mostly L4 to mostly young adults. I was unable to find a clear example of an experiment when these two conditions were compared, although the authors state that it made no difference to their results.</p>
<p>(3) The original paper reports a transgenerational avoidance effect up to the F5 generation. Although in this work the authors failed to see avoidance in the F2 generation, it would have been prudent to extend their tests for more generations in at least a couple of their experiments to ensure that the F2 generation was not an aberration (although this reviewer acknowledges that this seems unlikely to be the case).</p>

<p>We would like to correct the statement made in the second to last sentence. The demonstration of an F1 response to PA14 was first reported by Moore et al., (2019) and then by Pereira et al., (2020) using a different behavioral assay. We merely confirmed these results in our hands, and confirmed the observation, first reported by Kaletsky et al., (2020), that sid-1 and sid-2 are required for this F1 response; although we did find that sid-1 and sid-2 are not required for the PA14-induced increase in daf-7p::gfp expression in ASI neurons in the F1 progeny of trained adults, which had not been addressed in the published work.</p>
<p>Yes, the intergenerational F1 response could be a maternal effect, but the in utero F1 embryos and their precursor germ cells were directly exposed to PA14 metabolites and toxins (non-maternal effect) as well as any parental response, whether mediated by small RNAs, prions,  hormones, or other unknown information carriers. While the F1 aversion response does require sid-1 and sid-2, we would not presume that the substrate is therefore an RNA molecule, particularly because the systemic RNAi response supported by sid-1 and sid-2 is via long double-stranded RNA. To date, no evidence suggests that either protein transports small RNAs, particularly single-stranded RNAs.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors note that the high copy number daf-7::GFP transgene used by the Murphy group displayed variable expression and evidence for somatic silencing or transgene breakdown in the Hunter lab, as confirmed by the Murphy group. The authors nicely use single copy daf-7::GFP to show that neuronal daf-7::GFP is elevated in F1 but not F2 progeny with regards to the memory of PA14 avoidance, speaking to an intergenerational phenotype.</p>
<p>The authors nicely confirm that sid-1 and sid-2 are generally required for intergenerational avoidance of F1 embryos of moms exposed to PA14. However, these small RNA proteins did not affect daf-7::GFP elevation in the F1 progeny. This result is unexpected given previous reports that single copy daf-7::GFP is not elevated in F1 progeny of sid mutants. Because the Murphy group reported that daf-7 mutation abolishes avoidance for F1 progeny, this means that the sid genes function downstream of daf-7 or in parallel, rather than upstream as previously suggested.</p>
<p>The authors studied antisense small RNAs that change in Murphy data sets, identifying 116 mRNAs that might be regulated by sRNAs in response to PA14. Importantly, the authors show that the maco-1 gene, putatively targeted by piRNAs according to the Kaletsky 2020 paper, displays few siRNAs that change in response to PA14. The authors conclude that the P11 ncRNA of PA14, which was proposed to promote interkingdom RNA communication by the Murphy group, is unlikely to affect maco-1 expression by generating sRNAs that target maco-1 in C. elegans. The authors define 8 genes based on their analysis of sRNAs and mRNAs that might promote resistance to PA14, but they do not further characterize these genes' role in pathogen avoidance. The Murphy group might wish to consider following up on these genes and their possible relationship with P11.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This very thorough and interesting manuscript is at times pugnacious.</p>

<p>We reiterate that we never claimed that Moore et al., (2019) did not obtain their reported results. We simply stated that we could not replicate their results using the published methods and then failed in our search to identify variable(s) that might account for our results. We will do better when revising the manuscript to make clear, unmuddied statements of facts and state that future investigations may provide independent evidence that supports the original claims and explains our divergent results.</p>

<p>Please explain more clearly what is High Growth media for E. coli in the text and methods, conveying why it was used by the Murphy lab, and if Normal Growth or High Growth is better for intergenerational heritability assays.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used the standard recipes as described in Moore et al., (2021), and will include the recipes and some of the relevant commentary from the paragraphs below to the methods and text as appropriate.</p>
<p>Normal Growth (NG) media minimally supports OP50 growth, resulting in a thin lawn that minimally obscures viewing larvae and embryos. High Growth (HG) media contains 8X more peptone, which supports much higher OP50 growth, resulting in a thick bacterial lawn that supports larger worm populations. The thicker bacterial lawn can also compromise agar integrity, and the higher worm density encourages worm burrowing behavior, thus the HG plates also have 75% more agar to inhibit worm burrowing.</p>
<p>Our results (Figure 4) show that worms grown on OP50 seeded NG or HG plates show different choice responses (PA14 vs OP50). As for experimental “advice”, we would caution our colleagues to not assume that OP50 is a neutral food and to be aware that how you grow and store OP50 (or any bacterial culture that is to be used as food for worms) may have a significant effect on the phenotype you are studying.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This paper examines the reproducibility of results reported by the Murphy lab regarding transgenerational inheritance of a learned avoidance behavior in C. elegans. It has been well established by multiple labs that worms can learn to avoid the pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14) after a single exposure. The Murphy lab has reported that learned avoidance is transmittable to 4 generations and dependent on a small RNA expressed by PA14 that elicits the transgenerational silencing of a gene in C. elegans. The Hunter lab now reports that although they can reproduce inheritance of the learned behavior by the first generation (F1), they cannot reproduce inheritance in subsequent generations.</p>
<p>This is an important study that will be useful for the community. Although they fail to identify a &quot;smoking gun&quot;, the study examines several possible sources for the discrepancy, and their findings will be useful to others interested in using these assays. The preference assay appears to work in their hands in as much as they are able to detect the learned behavior in the P0 and F1 generations, suggesting that the failure to reproduce the transgenerational effect is not due to trivial mistakes in the protocol. An obvious reason, however, to account for the differing results is that the culture conditions used by the authors are not permissive for the expression of the small RNA by PA14 that the MUrphy lab identified as required for transgenerational inheritance. It would seem prudent for the authors to determine whether this small RNA is present in their cultures, or at least acknowledge this possibility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We note that Kaletsky et al., (2020) (Figure 3L) showed that PA14 ΔP11 bacteria failed to induce an F1 avoidance response. Thus, the fact that we observed F1 avoidance implies that our culture conditions successfully induced P11 expression. We believe that this addresses the concern raised here. We thank the reviewer for raising this issue and we will add a statement to this effect in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors should also note that their protocol was significantly different from the Murphy protocol (see comments below) and therefore it remains possible that protocol differences cumulatively account for the different results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We disagree. Our adjustments to the core protocol were minor and, where possible, were explicitly tested in side-by-side experiments. To discover the source(s) of discrepancy between our results and the published results we subsequently introduced variations to this core protocol to exclude likely variables (worm and bacteria growth temperatures, assay conditions, worm handling methods, bacterial culture and storage conditions, and some minor developmental timing issues). To substantiate these assertions, we will, upon revision, add the precise protocol we followed for the aversion assay to the supplemental documents, provide some additional experimental results supporting these claims, and further clarify which presented experiments included protocol variations (e.g. sodium azide or cold immobilization). It remains possible that we misunderstood the published protocol, but we were highly motivated to replicate the results and read every published version with extreme care.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>It has been previously reported in many high-profile papers, that C. elegans can learn to avoid pathogens. Moreover, this learned pathogen avoidance can be passed on to future generations - up to the F5 generation in some reports. In this paper, Gainey et al. set out to replicate these findings. They successfully replicated pathogen avoidance in the exposed animals, as well as a strong increase in daf-7 expression in ASI neurons in F1 animals, as determined by a daf-7::GFP reporter construct. However, they failed to see strong evidence for pathogen avoidance or daf-7 overexpression in the F2 generation. The failure of replication is the major focus of this work.</p>
<p>Given their failure to replicate these findings, the authors embark on a thorough test of various experimental confounders that may have impacted their results. They also re-analyze the small RNA sequencing and mRNA sequencing data from one of the previously published papers and draw some new conclusions, extending this analysis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors provide a thorough description of their methods, and a marked-up version of a published protocol that describes how they adapted the protocol to their lab conditions. It should be easy to replicate the experiments.</p>
<p>(2) The authors test the source of bacteria, growth temperature (of both C. elegans and bacteria), and light/dark husbandry conditions. They also supply all their raw data, so that the sample size for each testing plate can be easily seen (in the supplementary data). None of these variations appears to have a measurable effect on pathogen avoidance in the F2 generation, with all but one of the experiments failing to exhibit learned pathogen avoidance.</p>
<p>(3) The small RNA seq and mRNA seq analysis is well performed and extends the results shown in the original paper. The original paper did not give many details of the small RNA analysis, which was an oversight. Although not a major focus of this paper, it is a worthwhile extension of the previous work.</p>
<p>(4) It is rare that negative results such as these are accessible. Although the authors were unable to determine the reason that their results differ from those previously published, it is important to document these attempts in detail, as has been done here. Behavioral assays are notoriously difficult to perform and public discourse around these attempts may give clarity to the difficulties faced by a controversial field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your support. Choosing to pursue publication of these negative results was not an easy decision, and we thank members of the community for their support and encouragement.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Although the &quot;standard&quot; conditions have been tested over multiple biological replicates, many of the potential confounders that may have altered the results have been tested only once or twice. For example, changing the incubation temperature to 25{degree sign}C was tested in only two biological replicates (Exp 5.1 and 5.2) - and one of these experiments actually resulted in apparent pathogen avoidance inheritance in the F2 generation (but not in the F1). An alternative pathogen source was tested in only one biological replicate (Exp 3). Given the variability observed in the F2 generation, increasing biological replicates would have added to the strengths of the report.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that our study was not exhaustive in our exploration of variables that might be interfering with our ability to detect F2 avoidance. We also note that some of these variables also failed (with many more independent experiments) to induce elevated daf-7p::gfp expression in ASI neurons in F2 progeny. Our goal was not to show that variation in some growth or assay condition would generate reproducible negative results, the exploration was designed to tweak conditions to enable detection of a robust F2 response. Given the strength of the data presented in Moore et al., (2019) we expected that adjustment of the problematic variable would produce positive results apparent in a single replicate, which could then be followed up. If we had succeeded, then we would have documented the conditions that enabled robust F2 inheritance and would have explored molecular mechanisms that support this important but mysterious process.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) A key difference between the methods used here and those published previously, is an increase in the age of the animals used for training - from mostly L4 to mostly young adults. I was unable to find a clear example of an experiment when these two conditions were compared, although the authors state that it made no difference to their results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We can state firmly that the apparent time delay did not affect P0 learned avoidance or, as documented in Table S1, daf-7p::gfp expression in ASI neurons. In our experience, training mostly L4’s on PA14 frequently failed to produce sufficient F1 embryos for both F1 avoidance assays or daf-7p::gfp measurements in ASI neurons and collection of F2 progeny. Indeed, in early attempts to detect heritable PA14 aversion, trained P0 and F1 progeny were not assayed in order to obtain sufficient F2’s for a choice assay. These animals failed to display aversion, but without evidence of successful P0 training or an F1 intergenerational response this was deemed a non-fruitful trouble-shooting approach. We will add to our supplemental figures P0 choice results from experiments using younger trained animals that failed to produce sufficient F1’s to continue the inheritance experiments.</p>
<p>The different timing between the two protocols may reflect the age of the recovered bleached P0 embryos. It is reasonable to assume that bleaching day 1 adults vs day 2 adults from the P-1 population could shift the average age of recovered P0 embryos by several hours. The Murphy protocol only states that P0 embryos were obtained by bleaching healthy adults. Regardless, if the hypothesis entertained here is true, that a several hour difference in larval/adult age during 24 hours of training affects F2 inheritance of learned aversion but does not affect P0 learned avoidance, then we would argue that this paradigm for heritable learned avoidance, as described in Moore et al, (2019, 2021), is not sufficiently robust for mechanistic investigations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The original paper reports a transgenerational avoidance effect up to the F5 generation. Although in this work the authors failed to see avoidance in the F2 generation, it would have been prudent to extend their tests for more generations in at least a couple of their experiments to ensure that the F2 generation was not an aberration (although this reviewer acknowledges that this seems unlikely to be the case).</p>
