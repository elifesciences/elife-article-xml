<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Juvenile hormone (JH) is a key regulator of insect metamorphosis. To understand its role before metamorphosis originated, we studied JH action in the ametabolous firebrat, <italic>Thermobia domestica</italic>. JH levels peak late in embryogenesis and are low through early juvenile stages. Chemical suppression of embryonic JH synthesis by 7-ethoxyprecocene blocks embryonic differentiation, but the latter is restored with exogenous JH. Premature exposure of younger embryos to JH suppresses growth and morphogenesis and the expression of morphogens, such as myoglianin. These embryos switch to premature differentiation as shown by muscle formation and synthesis of cuticle like that of later embryonic stages.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that this ancestral role of JH in supporting tissue differentiation was later exploited for the evolution of metamorphosis. In embryos, the temporal separation of morphogen signaling and JH secretion results in morphogenesis preceding differentiation. With the evolution of metamorphosis, embryonic morphogen systems were redeployed during juvenile growth for morphogenesis of imaginal primordia. JH was also redeployed, but it now occurred with morphogen signaling. This co-occurrence resulted in JH maintaining a juvenile quality to the bud, which the morphogens positive allometric growth. The disappearance of JH late in growth then allowed the unantagonized morphogens to drive the primordia into metamorphosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The evolution of insects from an obscure group of soil arthropods to the dominant meso-sized group in terrestrial and freshwater environments was accompanied by profound changes in their life histories. The first life history change involved modifications to postembryonic growth that supported the evolution of wings and power flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Kukalová-Peck, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Belles, 2019</xref>). These modifications brought about a hemimetabolous lifestyle that included the molt to the adult becoming a terminal molt and metamorphic changes during this adult molt when the articulated, functional wings were finally manifest. The subsequent step to complete metamorphosis involved a redirection of embryogenesis so that the insect that hatched from the egg was not a miniature version of the adult, but had a modified, larval body that was adapted to feeding and growth. The transition from larva to adult then occurred through a transitional stage, the pupa, thereby providing the three-part life history diagnostic of the “complete metamorphosis” exhibited by holometabolous insects (reviews: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jindra, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Truman &amp; Riddiford, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Classically, juvenile hemimetabolous stages were called nymphs and juvenile holometabolous instars were called larvae. Although this terminology is somewhat controversial, we will use it throughout this paper. Both nymphs and larvae depend on a sesquiterpene hormone, juvenile hormone (JH), to maintain their respective forms. JH has two essential functions: (1) it is required at the start of an ecdysteroid-induced molt to maintain the insect in its current stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Riddiford, 1976</xref>), and (2) its presence during the intermolt periods ensures that imaginal discs and primordia remain dormant and to not begin premature morphogenesis to the adult stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Truman <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Besides its effects in regulating metamorphosis, JH is also involved in shaping polymorphisms such as those seen in the castes of social insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Nijhout and Wheeler, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Although JH has profound postembryonic functions in maintaining the juvenile form in the more derived insect orders, its function in insects of the two ametabolous orders, the Archaeognatha (jumping bristletails) and the Zygentoma (silverfish), is poorly understood. JH is clearly involved in egg production in the firebrat <italic>Thermobia domestica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Bitsch <italic>et al.,</italic> 1985</xref>). Its only reported effect on postembryonic development, though, is the ability of JH application to suppress scale formation during the molt from the third to the fourth juvenile stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Watson, 1967</xref>). In crustaceans, the immediate precursor to JH, methyl farnesoate (MF), regulates ovarian maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Laufer, <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). Since insects and other Hexapoda (i.e. Collembola, Protura and Diplura) evolved from crustaceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Regier et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">von Reumont et al. 2012</xref>), it has been proposed that MF and JH may have originally been involved in regulating reproduction and were subsequently captured to control metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Goodman and Granger, 2005</xref>)</p>
<p>While JH has only mild effects on postembryonic development in <italic>Thermobia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Watson, 1967</xref>), treatment of eggs with JH produces severe developmental abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Rohdendorf and Sehnal, 1973</xref>). These severe developmental effects suggest that the developmental role of JH in insects was initially confined to the embryonic domain and it only later became involved in postembryonic development as life histories became more complex. Out study focuses on the role of JH during embryogenesis of the <italic>Thermobia domestica</italic>. By detailed examination of the effects of JH agonists and an antagonist on <italic>Thermobia</italic> embryos, we find that JH has an essential role of supporting terminal differentiation and maturation of the embryo. This ancient ability of JH to promote and maintain cellular differentiation during embryogenesis, then appears to have been extended into postembryonic life where it acts to antagonize morphogenic and allow the maintenance of a juvenile state until the animal has undergone sufficient growth to permit metamorphosis.</p>

<title>The time-course of embryogenesis in Thermobia</title>
<p>The embryogenesis of <italic>Thermobia domestica</italic> is summarized in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. At 37°C, the time from egg deposition to hatching is about 11.5 days. A developmental timetable was constructed using 12 hr egg collections and determining the distribution of developmental stages at half day intervals from the midpoint of each collection window (see Methods). Ages are given in days after egg laying (# d AEL). As with other insects from ametabolous orders, <italic>Thermobia</italic> embryos undergo short germ band development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Jura, 1972</xref>). A small embryonic rudiment forms at the posterior pole of the egg and consists of head and thoracic segments with a terminal growth zone. As abdominal segments are then progressively specified, the abdominal ventral midline invaginates into the yolk causing the abdomen to fold onto itself and opposing the ventral surfaces of the anterior and posterior abdominal segments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). By about 1.5 d AEL, the forming embryo is evident as a cleared slot at the posterior pole of the egg, and by a half day later abdomen formation is finished and buds for the segmental appendages are appearing. At this point the dorsal surface of the embryo is completely open to the yolk and the embryo has an overall S-shape (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

By the onset of katatrepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Panfilio, 2008</xref>), dorsal closure along the abdomen (red arrow) has moved the abdomen ventrally (solid black arrow) and the contraction of the serosa pulls the sides of the embryo towards the anterior pole (dashed black arrows). After katatrepsis the expanding lateral edges of the embryo displace cells of the amnion, gradually zipping up the dorsal thoracic midline (red arrow) until definitive dorsal closure is accomplished. <bold>(B)</bold> Summary of the progression of embryonic development at various times after egg deposition.

<p>The embryo then begins “zipping up” its dorsal midline starting at the end of the abdomen and progressing to the juncture of the abdomen with the thorax. This dorsal closure of the abdomen pushes the abdominal tip ventrally and forward as the embryo with its yolk assumes a “comma” shape. Appendage buds are growing but have not yet reached half of their final extension by this time. Extraembryonic membrane growing up from the lateral sides of the embryo envelop the yolk mass and then, during katatrepsis, they contract to pull the head of the embryo towards the anterior pole and the embryo rotates to achieve a C-shape. The complete enclosure of the yolk by the extraembryonic membranes is termed “provisional dorsal closure” and for the next four days the lateral margins of the embryo gradually extend dorsally, replacing the cells of the amnion and achieving “definitive dorsal closure” when the embryo is finally completely enclosed in its own epidermis (about 7.5 d AEL). The period between katatrepsis and dorsal closure involves organogenesis, tissue growth, and cell determination. The embryo reaches its full size at definitive dorsal closure and then undergoes terminal differentiation and maturation during the last 4 days of embryogenesis.</p>
<p>Embryogenesis is accompanied by two bouts of cuticle production. The E1 cuticle is deposited after the formation of the segmented germ band. It contains little chitin (see below) and has a fibrous structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Klag 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Konopová and Zrzavý, 2005</xref>) that presumably allows it to stretch to accommodate the subsequent growth of the embryo. The E2 cuticle starts to be deposited around dorsal closure as the embryo reaches its full size. The E2 procuticle has the lamellar structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Konopová and Zrzavý, 2005</xref>) typical of insect cuticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Neville, 1975</xref>) and it becomes a rigid covering for the hatchling. The latter is also called the first juvenile (J1) stage. It does not feed and sheds its E2 (=J1) cuticle a day after hatching to start its J2 stage. Feeding does not begin until it molts to the J3 stage.</p>

<title>Endocrine events during embryogenesis of Thermobia domestica</title>
<p>As in most insects, <italic>Thermobia domestica</italic> produces JH III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Baker <italic>et al.,</italic> 1984</xref>). Using the Mass Spectrometric method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Ramirez <italic>et al</italic>. (2020)</xref>, we measured JH III levels during <italic>Thermobia</italic> embryogenesis at daily intervals starting at 5 d AEL and extending through hatching and the first 10 days of postembryonic life (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Detectable levels of JH III were found at 6 d AEL, and the titer slowly ramped up until an abrupt peak on days 10 and 11. After hatching JH III levels then fell to a low, but detectable, level through the start of the fourth juvenile instar.</p>

</fig>
<p>Ecdysteroid titers through embryogenesis and the early juvenile instars were measured using the enzyme immunoassay method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Porcheron <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>) that is optimized for detecting 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). As seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, there was a shallow, transient rise in ecdysteroid from 2.5 to 4 d AEL, associated with the time of deposition of the first embryonic (E1) cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Konopová and Zrzavý, 2005</xref>). If <italic>Thermobia</italic> is like locusts (Lagueux <italic>et al</italic>., 1977), then this first ecdysteroid peak would be expected to contain ecdysone, but no 20E. Ecdysone is poorly detected by the assay that we used and this low sensitivity for ecdysone likely explains the shallow nature of this first peak. A prominent peak of 20E then occurred around the time of dorsal closure, coordinated with the production of the E2 cuticle (= first juvenile cuticle), followed by another 20E peak just before hatching. This late embryonic peak is responsible for producing the J2 cuticle, that is seen when ecdysis occurs at 24 hours after hatching. The subsequent molt to the J3 stage is accompanied by an increase in 20E at about three days after hatching.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> summarizes the expression of some endocrine-related transcripts. Using RT-PCR (and the comparative Ct method; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Schmittgen and Livak, 2008</xref>), we measured transcript levels at half-day intervals through the first half of embryogenesis and then at daily intervals thereafter. Transcripts for the JH receptor, <italic>Methoprene-tolerant</italic> (<italic>Met</italic>), appeared around the time of formation of the segmented germ band and extended through dorsal closure. <italic>Met</italic> transcript levels were reduced when the JH III titer spiked. <italic>Krüppel homolog 1</italic> (<italic>Kr-h1</italic>) is a highly conserved gene that responds to JH exposure (Konopova et al., 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Smykal <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Belles, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">He and Zhang, 2022</xref>). Low levels of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> transcripts were present at 12 hr after egg deposition, but then were not detected until about 6 d AEL when JH-III first appeared. <italic>Kr-h1</italic> transcripts then spiked with the prominent peak of JH III at the end of embryogenesis. Members of the <italic>Transforming growth factor-β</italic> (<italic>TGF-β</italic>) family of morphogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Upadhyay <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>), notably myoglianin (myo), have become prominent as agents that promote the competence and execution of metamorphosis in holometabolous and hemimetabolous insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">He <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Awasaki <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011</xref>). We find that <italic>myo</italic> transcripts become abundant in <italic>Thermobia</italic> embryos after formation of the segmented germ band and as the limb buds are undergoing rapid growth and patterning but then decline to low levels by dorsal closure.</p>

<title>Effects of suppression of the late embryonic peak of JH</title>
<p>Peak levels of JH occur towards the end of embryogenesis as tissues are undergoing maturation and terminal differentiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). To examine the role of this JH peak, we treated embryos with 7-ethoxyprecocene (7EP), a drug that suppresses JH production in many insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Bowers and Martinez-Pardo, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aboulafia-Baginsky <italic>et al.,</italic> 1984</xref>). As seen in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, treatment of young juvenile <italic>Thermobia</italic> with 7EP markedly suppressed their production of JH III. Also, application of 7EP to embryos at 6 d AEL, prior to the onset of JH secretion, prevented the JH-induced appearance of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> transcripts, but the latter could be induced by subsequent treatment with a JHm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Therefore, 7EP is effective in suppressing JH synthesis in <italic>Thermobia</italic>.</p>

<p>The effect of preventing JH production was first examined by treating embryos with 1 μg of 7EP at 3.5d AEL and then tracking aspects of subsequent development that could be viewed through the egg shell (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Solvent control and 7EP-treated embryos acquired eye pigment and underwent dorsal closure (not shown) at the same time, but the 7EP group failed to resorb their extraembryonic fluid and did not hatch. The latter two events, though, were restored to 7EP-treated embryos by application of JHm shortly after dorsal closure.</p>
<p>Dissection of the 7EP-treated embryos showed that they usually did not shed their E1 cuticle or expand their E2 cuticle. After dorsal closure, the foregut normally lengthens as the midgut is displaced posteriorly to the anterior abdomen, but these events did not occur after the 7EP treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). On a tissue level, the eye primordium produces all the cell types for its twelve ommatidia by dorsal closure. These cell types attain their mature sizes by hatching and the overlying E2 (=J1) cuticle detaches in preparation for making the cuticular lenses of the J2 stage. This maturational growth of the eye and detachment of the cuticle was suppressed after the 7EP treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). The normal maturation of both the eye and the midgut was restored in 7EP treated embryos by subsequent application of JHm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D, E</xref>).</p>
<p>Sensitivity to the suppression of JH synthesis by 7EP treatment did not end in an all-or-none fashion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). Development up through dorsal closure was unaffected, regardless of time of 7EP treatment, resorption of the extraembryonic fluid was suppressed by treatment up until about 8 d, and hatching was blocked until about 9 d AEL. This progressive loss of effectiveness of suppressing JH biosynthesis, suggests that JH does not provide a phasic signal, but rather acts tonically through the end of embryogenesis to bring about terminal differentiation and hatching.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> shows that the timing of JHm application was essential for rescuing the development block imposed by 7EP treatment. We recorded the time of the resorption of the extraembryonic fluid and of hatching for embryos treated with 7EP on 3.5 d AEL and then with a standard dose of JHm (1 ng of pyriproxyfen) at various days thereafter. Embryos that were treated with JHm at 6.5 d AEL (prior to definitive dorsal closure) were still in a phase of JH sensitivity (see below) and failed to complete dorsal closure. Day 7.5 AEL is about the midpoint for embryos undergoing dorsal closure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Half of the embryos treated at 7.5 d, did not complete dorsal closure and did not hatch. The remaining half had presumably undergone dorsal closure by the time of treatment and these subsequently resorbed their extraembryonic fluid and hatched. Essentially all the 7EP treated embryos given JHm on 8.5 d and 9.5 d AEL also showed fluid resorption and hatched. Importantly, the time of fluid resorption and hatching was time-locked to the time of the JHm treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). Those treated at 7.5 d AEL hatched a day earlier than controls, those treated at 8.5 d hatched along with the controls, and those treated at 9.5 d showed a day delay in their hatching.</p>

<p>As expected, manipulation of JH levels had a marked effect on the levels of Kr-h1 transcripts. Suppression of JH production blocked induction of Kr-h1, while application of JHm to blocked embryos reinstated elevated Kr-h1 expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Transcripts for <italic>Met</italic>, the JH receptor, show a mild down-regulation when JH III appears late in embryogenesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). This down-regulation was blunted when JH synthesis is suppressed by 7-EP treatment, but then enhanced by application of a JHm. Compared to their peak abundance at mid-embryogenesis, levels of <italic>myo</italic> transcripts are quite low going into the terminal stages of embryogenesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). These levels are largely unaffected by late manipulations of JH, although there may be a slight inductive effect of JH evident at 9 d AEL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects of early treatment with juvenile hormone</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Rohdendorf and Sehnal (1973)</xref> first showed that treating <italic>Thermobia</italic> embryos with natural JHs and a wide array of synthetic analogs produced a range of embryonic derangements. We initially tested the effectiveness of JH III and its precursor, methyl farnesoate (MF), as well as three commonly used JH mimics, methoprene, hydroprene, and pyriproxyfen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Goodman and Cusson, 2012</xref>). When applied at 3 d AEL, all produced a full range of embryonic abnormalities, depending on dosage (data not shown). Between the naturally occurring compounds, JH III was about 8-fold more potent than MF, with an ED<sub>50</sub> for topical application of 60 ng/egg while MF had an ED<sub>50</sub> of 480 ng/egg. The synthetic JH mimics were about 100 times more potent than JH III and were used for subsequent experimental treatments. We used pyriproxyfen (referred to as JHm) for all the experiments detailed below –the JH receptor was shown to have higher affinity for pyriproxifen than for JH III or methoprene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Charles <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Jindra <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>).</p>
<p><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> examines the response of embryos to treatment of different doses of JHm at 1.5 d AEL, when the forming germ band can first be seen at the posterior pole of the egg. The embryos were then dissected at 4.5d AEL, a time after the completion of katatrepsis by control embryos. Embryos treated with the highest doses of JHm (1 to 10 ng/egg) always formed a complete segmented germband, with its various appendage primordia. However, the embryos retained an S-shaped posture and stayed at the posterior pole of the egg. Their growth was suppressed, and the embryos remained open dorsally from the head to the end of the abdomen. The cells of the amnion did not extend to enclose the yolk and these embryos often later sunk back into the yolk. Despite their early arrest, they secreted a cuticle over their ventral surface (chitin staining in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Embryos exposed to intermediate doses of JHm (0.3 to 0.03 ng pyriproxifen) were able to subsequently “zip up” the dorsal midline of their abdomen, which pushed the end of the abdomen ventrally and forward, causing the embryo to assume a “comma” shape just prior to the start of katatrepsis. Although the abdomen was able to undergo its dorsal closure, the subsequent morphogenesis of the head and thorax was suppressed. Cuticle that contained chitin covered the entire abdomen but only the ventral surface of the head and thorax. In many cases, the amnion did not spread dorsally to enclose the yolk and establish provisional dorsal closure. In cases in which provisional dorsal closure did occur, the arrested development of the embryo’s head and thorax prevented their lateral margins from being pulled laterally around the yolk, and the yolk ended up in a rounded dorsal lobe with the embryo hanging ventrally in a fluid-filled space (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Embryos treated with low doses of JHm (below 0.01 ng pyriproxifen) underwent normal katatrepsis and their amnion spread to cover the yolk to provide provisional dorsal closure. We did not track the development of this experimental group beyond 4.5 d AEL.</p>
<p>The phenotypes of JHm-treated embryos also varied with the time of application (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Treatment of eggs within 12 hr of oviposition was problematical because the cyclohexane-treated controls often showed significant lethality. With older embryos, though, treatment with the solvent alone did not interfere with subsequent development. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6B</xref>, C summarize the ability of JHm treatment to suppress various of the “milestones” of embryonic development that we could observe through the egg chorion. Groups of embryos were treated with 1 ng pyriproxyfen at the indicated time, and we determined its effect on subsequent development. The developmental time at which JH treatment could no longer inhibit a given event in 50% of the embryos (the IT<sub>50</sub>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>) could then be compared with the time when that event normally occurs in half of the embryos (the DT<sub>50</sub>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Very early (12h AEL) treatment with JHm typically resulted in embryos that formed a segmented germ band, but they remained in the S-shaped form at the posterior pole of the egg. With later treatments with JHm, the embryos reached progressively later developmental milestones before they arrested. Although the DT<sub>50</sub>’s for these developmental milestones were fairly evenly distributed through the last 75% of embryogenesis, their IT<sub>50</sub>’s were in two clusters (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). The late cluster included definitive dorsal closure, reabsorption of the extraembryonic fluid, and hatching. Embryos that fail to complete dorsal closure do not undergo the subsequent events. The attainment of definitive dorsal closure coincides with the ramping up of endogenous JH secretion by the embryo (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) and, as shown above, the remaining events require JH for their completion. Supplementing the endogenous JH peak with additional JHm does not affect these late processes.</p>

</fig>
<p>The early processes blocked by by premature exposure to JHm include katatrepsis itself. As described below, the presence of JHm during the E1 ecdysteroid peak causes the production of an altered E1 cuticle that may not be able to stretch and deform as the extraembryonic membranes contract, thereby aborting the process. The ID<sub>50</sub> for eye pigment production occurred slightly later at 3.5d AEL (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B,C</xref>). We think that the latter represents the time when the eye placode begins eye formation. Before this time, JHm treated embryos did form any recognizable eye elements. Treatment at 3.5d AEL resulted in half of the embryos subsequently showing the red screening pigment of a developing eye, while the other half did not. The former embryos, though, only produced a few ommatidia clusters at the posterior margin of the eye (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>) and cell types within the cluster were not recognizable (although some are obviously making screening pigment). When JHm treatment was delayed to 4.5 d AEL, the full set of 12 ommatidial clusters were formed, and we could identify nuclei of specific cell types such as the two secondary pigment cells and the underlying quartet of corneal cone cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Thus, we see that in <italic>Thermobia</italic>, like in other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Friedrich, 2006</xref>), the eye placode makes ommatidia progressively starting at the posterior border of the placode and progressing anteriorly. Depending on time of application, JHm can block either the initiation or the progression of this wave of ommatidia formation. Even after a pre-cluster has formed, JH can suppress its subsequent patterning and determination of cell types.</p>
<p>The effects of premature exposure to JHm were further examined for embryos treated with pyriproxyfen at 1.5 d AEL and then <italic>dissected</italic> and immunostained at daily intervals thereafter. The embryos showed a range of responses to the JHm treatment, with different individuals arresting before, during or after katatrepsis. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7A</xref>, B summarize the effects of JHm treatment on growth of the limb buds, assessed by number of mitotic cells revealed by expression of phosphohistone H3 (pHH3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hendzel <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). The growing limb buds were obvious in both groups at 2.5 d AEL; they were of similar size and showed similar levels of pHH3 expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). In control embryos, the number of pHH3+ cells peaked between 4.5 d and d5.5 d AEL, when their limbs had achieved their full length, and then declined. At 3.5 d AEL, most of the JHm-treated embryos showed numbers of pHH3+ cells like those seen in controls, although two embryos showed a marked reduction. By 4.5 d AEL, all the JHm treated embryos showed mitotic cell a frequency that was 10-15% of that seen in controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Mitosis in their limbs remained low through subsequent development.</p>

</fig>
<p>As summarized in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7C, D</xref>, the JHm treatment sometimes evoked necrosis in the growing limb buds. Necrotic bodies, consisting of highly compacted DNA, were rarely seen in the limbs of control embryos at 4.5d and 5.5d AEL. For the JHm-treated embryos, those that completed katatrepsis also showed few, if any, necrotic bodies, but those that arrested before or during katatrepsis exhibited moderate to heavy necrosis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C, D</xref>). In the most severe cases the limb bud completely degenerated. Limb loss in such embryos was often stochastic, <italic>i.e.,</italic> in a given embryo some limbs were completely lost while others were maintained in a reduced state. We saw no segmental pattern as to which limbs were maintained and which were lost.</p>
<p>The treatment at 2.5 d AEL with JHm also altered the subsequent expression of <italic>Kr-h1, Met</italic>, and <italic>myo</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). As expected from postembryonic effects in other insects, exposure to JHm induced strong <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression, and mildly suppressed <italic>Met</italic> transcripts. Transcripts for <italic>myo</italic> normally increase as the limb buds are undergoing rapid growth from about 2.5 to 5d AEL (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), but JHm treatment prevented this increase (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>), in parallel with its suppression of proliferation in the limb (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>).</p>
<p>Early treatment with JHm also interrupted expression of the proximal-distal patterning of the forming limb. Limb bud formation requires the expression of <italic>distal-less</italic> (<italic>dll</italic>) at the tip of the growing bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Cohen and Jürgens, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Panganiban and Rubenstein, 2002</xref>). Up through the entry into katatrepsis, JHm-treated and control embryos showed similar expression of Dll in the distal half of the growing bud (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). As leg development progresses, recruitment of additional proximal-distal patterning genes resolves the <italic>dll</italic> expression into a “sock and band” pattern (<italic>e.g.,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Angelini and Kaufman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Schaeper <italic>et al,</italic> 2013</xref>) as intermediate leg regions become specified. The JHm-treated embryos shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref> are ones that did not complete katatrepsis and they did not further refine their Dll expression. Dll immunostaining was eventually lost as their limbs degenerated. The JHm-treated embryos that completed katatrepsis, by contrast, maintain legs that were shortened and but possessed the appropriate segments. We assume that the latter embryos progressed far enough through the proximal-distal patterning program before the JHm-induced arrest to produce a stable leg that maintained its integrity. An earlier arrest of the patterning program, however, appears to be insufficient to maintain a stable leg.</p>

<title>The effects of JHm on cellular differentiation</title>
<p>While the early JHm treatment suppressed growth, patterning, and cell determination, it also induced cellular differentiation as illustrated by the forming musculature (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). In control embryos (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>), longitudinal muscle fibers are first evident in the thorax and abdomen on 4.5 d AEL as thin bands of tissue that show weak, uniform staining for actin (as revealed by binding of fluorescent-phalloidin). The developing muscles increase in width over the next two days and their actin staining concentrates at the intersegmental boundaries where the developing muscle fibers attach to tendon cells. The appearance of myofibrils with their repeating sarcomeres becomes evident by 7.5 d AEL, but such embryos, dissected from the egg shells, showed neither spontaneous nor induced movements. By a day later the embryos often showed weak, spontaneous movements when removed from the egg and their muscles have well developed striations (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C</xref>, 8.5d). By contrast, embryos treated with 1 ng of pyriproxyfen at 1.5d AEL showed accelerated muscle differentiation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8D, E</xref>). Treated embryos that did not undergo katatrepsis did not show subsequent growth but their longitudinal muscles produced myofibrils by 4.5 d AEL (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). Treated embryos that completed katatrepsis also showed the premature production of myofibrils (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>) and they underwent substantial growth.</p>

<p>JHm treatment had a marked effect on the cuticle produced by young embryos. In <italic>Thermobia</italic>, the epicuticle layer of the first embryonic cuticle (EC1) is secreted after germ band formation but prior to the start of katatrepsis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Konopová and Zrzavý, 2005</xref>). A fibrous procuticle is deposited after katatrepsis and covers the embryo through its period of rapid growth and dorsal closure. Chitin staining, using Calcofluor White (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Harrington and Hageage, 2003</xref>), shows no chitin in the E1 epicuticle (as expected) (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>, 3.5d), and only faint chitin staining of the procuticle (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A</xref>, 4.5 -7.5 d AEL), indicating that the latter is relatively poor in chitin fibers. Strong chitin staining comes with the deposition of the E2 procuticle on 8.5 d AEL. The ultrastructure of the latter shows a lamellar structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Klag 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Konopová and Zrzavý, 2005</xref>), which arises from the helical deposition of chitin fibers in typical insect procuticles (Neville, 1965; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Vincent, 1980</xref>). Like controls, embryos treated with JHm at 1.5 d had no chitin in their E1 epicuticle (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>, 3.5d) but their E1 procuticle (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B</xref>, 4.5 d) showed enhanced chitin staining.

<p>JHm treatment before the formation of the E2 cuticle also changed the nature of this cuticle. As seen in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>, the E2 (= J1) cuticle has a pebbly surface sculpturing, an egg tooth, and lacks cuticular lenses for the ommatidia. Those treated with JHm at 4.5 d AEL, by contrast make a cuticle that lacks the egg tooth and surface pebbling characteristic of the E1 stage but attempts to make cuticular lenses typical of the J2 instar (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9E</xref>). Indeed, the JH treatment redirects the molt to be more like that to the J2 stage, rather than to the E2 (= J1) stage. Precocious JHm exposure to embryos of locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Truman &amp; Riddiford, 1999</xref>) and crickets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Erezyilmaz <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006</xref>) likewise cause embryos to skip a stage.</p>
<p>Overall, then, embryonic development is sensitive to treatment with exogenous JH or JHm from after the formation of the segmented germband until definitive dorsal closure. JH treatment, though, does not simply arrest development. Rather, as shown by muscle and epidermis, JH switches the embryonic cells away from morphogenesis and into differentiation.</p>

<title>JH functions as a growth/differentiation switch in Thermobia domestica embryos</title>
<p><xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A</xref> summarizes the role of JH during embryogenesis of <italic>Thermobia domestica.</italic> Like in many other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bergot <italic>et al.,</italic> 1981b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Imboden <italic>et al.,</italic> 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Temin <italic>et al.,</italic> 1986</xref>), high levels of JH appear late in embryogenesis as the embryo undergoes terminal differentiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The effects of blocking JH production, by treatment with 7EP, shows that terminal differentiation is, indeed, dependent on JH. This dependence is evident in the development of the compound eye (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). The ommatidial units can form normally in the absence of JH, but they do not then progress into their mature configuration. The block of terminal maturation and hatching is restored to such embryos by treatment with JHm, in a manner that is linked to the time of JH treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>

Limb and body patterning is more advanced in <italic>Locusta</italic> versus <italic>Thermobia</italic> at that this initial molt, so its development is less repressed. Both embryos, though, undergo substantial body growth between the first molt and dorsal closure and this growth is suppressed in both. Long germ band embryos, by contrast, have finished their organ patterning by the time of the extended germ band and undergo body retraction, rather than growth as they progress to dorsal closure. They lack the intermediate growth period which is sensitive to JH in the short germ band embryos. <italic>Locusta</italic> ecdysone titers from Lagueux <italic>et al</italic>., 1977, and JH titers from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Temin <italic>et al.,</italic> 1986</xref>.

</fig>
<p>The role of JH in embryogenesis is further revealed by the effects of premature exposure of embryos to JH III or JHm. The diverse phenotypes observed after precocious exposure of embryos to JH (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5A</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>) are consistent with the hormone inducing a premature shift from morphogenesis to differentiation. This is best seen in developing muscle (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C-E</xref>); the myocytes of JH-treated embryos form banded myofibrils by 4.5 d AEL, rather than their normal time of 7.5 d AEL. Similarly in the epidermis, early JHM treatment induced an E1 cuticle that was chitin-rich and inextensible (typical of that deposited during the differentiation phase of embryogenesis), rather than the normal extensible, fibrous E1 cuticle (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A,B</xref>). This premature differentiation was accompanied by the suppression of embryonic growth (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A,B</xref>) and tissue patterning (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>).</p>
<p>Premature exposure to JH also arrested katatrepsis and the progression of dorsal closure, processes that involve the amnion and serosa. It is not clear, though, whether these arrests result from a direct action of JH on these extraembryonic membranes, or if JH-induced changes in the embryo (such as secretion of a less extensible E1 cuticle) interferes with its response to contraction of the membranes.</p>
<p>Both experimental (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>) and natural exposures to JH (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) are associated with stimulation of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> transcription. At present, we have only correlative evidence that JH works through Kr-h1 to suppress morphogenetic growth and promote differentiation in <italic>Thermobia</italic>, but the widespread involvement of Kr-h1 in diverse JH-mediated processes in insects (Jindra <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015) make this highly likely. A target of JH, and likely Kr-h1, in <italic>Thermobia</italic> is myoglianin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>). Levels of this morphogen peak during early morphogenetic growth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) but are suppressed if embryos are treated with JHm (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). The correlation of myoglianin levels with limb growth in both normal and JHm-treated embryos (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7B</xref> versus E) is consistent with an involvement in the morphogenetic growth of the embryo. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> myoglianin acts systemically during the last larval stage to regulate imaginal disc growth so that they achieve a size appropriate for the insect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Upadhyay <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Myo could be playing a similar role in <italic>Thermobia</italic> embryos to match limb growth to embryonic body size. The suppression of <italic>myo</italic> expression by JH may account for at least part of the growth suppression caused by early JHm treatment. Targets for JH and Kr-h1 undoubtedly go beyond myoglianin. Proximal-distal patterning in a limb (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>) and the progressive patterning of ommatidial units in the eye (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D,E</xref>) involves local, as well as systemic, morphogen signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cagan, 2009</xref>). How JH may affect local morphogen signaling systems in <italic>Thermobia</italic> is unknown.</p>
<p>A circulating factor, like JH, that can shift the embryo from morphogenetic growth to differentiation might be especially important for a short germ band embryo that has to deal with a large extraembryonic yolk mass. In many insect species, egg size is not a constant and may vary with the size of the mother or with environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Fox and Czesak, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Yanagi and Midori, 2012</xref>). These variations may be especially challenging for short germ band embryos, such as those of <italic>Thermobia</italic>, in which the segmented germ band occupies only a small portion of the egg. The size of the embryo is not determined until the lateral regions of the embryo finally enclose the yolk mass at definitive dorsal closure. Since JH appears at this time, it likely provides a systemic signal that maximal growth has been achieved and embryonic processes should be shifted to terminal differentiation.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Ecdysone and the onset of JH sensitivity in Thermobia embryos</title>
<p>An important question is when does the embryo first become sensitive to JH? Even with the earliest treatments with JHm, <italic>Thermobia</italic> embryos still form a segmented germ band with its appendage buds, although we cannot exclude the possibility that JH may have some subtle effects on this process. JH, though, definitely interacts with the first ecdysteroid peak to alter the first embryonic cuticle. In <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic>, this first embryonic ecdysteroid peak consists of ecdysone, but no 20E (Lagueux <italic>et al</italic>., 1977). This lack of 20E is not surprising because the principle tissues that normally convert ecdysone to 20E, such as the midgut, are just beginning to form. The composition of the first ecdysteroid peak in <italic>Thermobia</italic> is probably like that of <italic>Locusta</italic> and the fact that we detected only a slight rise in ecdysteroids at this time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>) is likely due to the assay that we used being designed to detect 20E rather than ecdysone (Porcheron <italic>et al.,</italic> 1989). Ecdysone is generally considered to be a “pro-hormone” but it does stimulate epidermal apolysis and cell division, while procuticle deposition occurs during the 20E portion of the ecdysteroid peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Charles, 2009</xref>). The unusual characteristics of the E1 cuticle may be due to its induction by ecdysone alone. If so, then the early presence of JH may alter the composition of this first ecdysteroid peak or alter how the embryo responds to ecdysone. Unpublished studies of the effects of JHm on the early embryonic ecdysteroid peak in the locust, <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic>, show that JH does not change the composition of ecdysteroids (D.R.Williams, H.H. Rees, J.W. Truman and L.M. Riddiford, unpublished). Consequently, we think it likely that JH alters how the embryonic tissues respond to exposure to ecdysone alone.</p>
<p>A mechanism by which JH might alter the response of tissues to ecdysteroids is seen in the mosquito, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2019). After emergence of the female, JH promotes the growth and maturation of the fat body, thereby preparing this tissue to respond to the ecdysteroids that are released after a blood meal. Ecdysteroids then act on the JH-primed fat body to induce synthesis and release of yolk proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Raikhel <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Roy <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>). An important molecular component for the actions of both JH and ecdysone is Taiman, a member of the P160 class of steroid hormone coactivators (Bai <italic>et al</italic>., 2001). Taiman is involved in JH action as the heterodimeric partner with JH-Met, thereby forming an active receptor complex that binds to JH response elements of target genes such as <italic>Kr-</italic>h1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Charles <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). In the ecdysone response pathway, Taiman is a major co-activator to mediate ecdysteroid activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Montell, 2001</xref>). In <italic>Aedes aegypti,</italic> Taiman transcripts are alternatively spliced in a JH-dependent manner. While all isoforms are effective in mediating JH action, the two isoforms made in the absence of JH are ineffective in supporting ecdysone activation of fat body targets. JH, though, alters the splicing of <italic>taiman</italic> transcripts, thereby making two alternate isoforms that support strong steroid-induced activation (Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2019). We speculate that a similar relationship might hold for cuticle production in <italic>Thermobia</italic> embryos. Based on its actions during postembryonic molts, ecdysone likely is a weak activator of cuticle production in the embryo, perhaps leading to the unusual structure of the E1 procuticle. Exposure to JH, though, might alter <italic>taiman</italic> splicing, resulting in isoforms that allow ecdysone to mount a more robust molting response and a more mature type of cuticle. Regardless of the mechanism, though, JH clearly alters how the embryo responds to its first exposure to ecdysone.</p>

<title>Variation in the response of insect embryos to early exposure to JH</title>
<p>The involvement of JH in terminal embryonic differentiation has been reported for other insects. Early experiments involving the ligation of embryos of the stick insect, <italic>Clitumnus extradentatus</italic>, to remove their corpora allata, resulted in the blockage of their terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cavallin and Fournier, 1981</xref>). Subsequently, the use of precocene to suppress JH synthesis in embryos of the locust, <italic>Locusta americana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aboulafia-Baginshy <italic>et al.,</italic>1984</xref>), the cockroach <italic>Nauphoeta cinerea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Bruning <italic>et al.,</italic> 1985</xref>) and the milkweed bug, <italic>Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Dorn, 1982</xref>) also blocked late embryogenesis. In the latter two cases, the block was reversed by treatment with JH or JH mimics. Also, the use of maternal RNAi to knock-down components of the JH synthesis and response pathways interfered with late embryonic development in <italic>Blattella germanica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Fernandez-Nicolas and Belles, 2017</xref>) and the beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Naruse <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>). Genetic interruption of the JH pathway in <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> had little effect on embryogenesis although hatching was suppressed in the former (Daimon <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015) and the latter showed interference in the late migration of the primordial germ cells to the somatic gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Barton <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Embryos of hemimetabolous insects respond to premature JH exposure similarly to those of <italic>Thermobia.</italic> In the locusts, <italic>Schistocerca gregaria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Novak, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Injeyan et al., 1979</xref>) and <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Truman and Riddiford 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">2002</xref>), the cricket, <italic>Acheta domesticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Rao and Krishnakumaran, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Erezyilmaz <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006</xref>), and the true bug <italic>Pyrrhocoris apterus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Enslee and Riddiford, 1977</xref>), early treatment with JH or JHm blocks katatrepsis and results in nymphs with stunted appendages. In <italic>Acheta domesticus</italic>, treated embryos showed a marked reduction in tritiated thymidine incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Rao and Krishnakumaran, 1974</xref>), indicating a suppression of proliferation, as we see in <italic>Thermobia</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A,B</xref>). The suppression of morphogenesis by early exposure to JH is accompanied by the precocious appearance of late developmental markers, e.g., sclerotized mandibles in <italic>Acheta domesticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Erezyilmaz <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006</xref>) and <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic> (Truman and Riddiford, unpublished) and advanced body pigmentation in <italic>Pyrrhocoris apterus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Enslee and Riddiford, 1977</xref>). Therefore, the ability of JH to shift embryogenesis from growth and morphogenesis to differentiation is shared by embryos of both ametabolous and hemimetabolous insects.</p>
<p>Two factors are involved in determining the severity of derangement of embryonic development in response to precocious exposure to JH or JH mimics. The first involves the relationship of the embryonic developmental timeline to the embryonic molts that are induced by episodic releases of ecdysteroids (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>). A major ecdysteroid peak is consistently associated with definitive dorsal closure, providing the first cuticle to cover the embryo after its epidermis is completed and body growth is finished. The embryo also begins substantial JH secretion at this time, and additional, exogenous hormone has no effect. Earlier peak(s) of embryonic ecdysteroids occur after the formation of the segmented germ band but these are not tied to specific points in development. As summarized in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>, the first ecdysteroid peak and production of the E1 cuticle occurs in <italic>Thermobia</italic> as its limbs are still extending tubes that show no demarcations between the various leg segments and have proximal-distal patterning genes in an early configuration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). In locusts and crickets, by contrast, the comparable phase of ecdysone secretion and cuticle production (Lagueux <italic>et al</italic>., 1977, for <italic>Locusta</italic>) occurs relatively later in embryonic development when leg segments are clearly demarcated and limbs have been patterned (locusts: Truman and Riddiford, unpublished; crickets: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Erezyilmaz <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006</xref>). Hence, the most severe effect of precocious JHm treatment in the latter is an embryo with all of its leg segments, although stunted and somewhat malformed. In <italic>Thermobia</italic>, by contrast, the embryos arrest with incompletely patterned appendages that often then degenerate.</p>
<p>The second factor determining the severity of the arrest imposed by early JH exposure relates to the manner of germ band formation. Embryos of <italic>Thermobia,</italic> locusts, and crickets show short germ band development and have a period of substantial growth and morphogenesis until the time of definitive dorsal closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson, 1972a</xref>). Early JHm treatment suppresses this growth resulting in a tiny, arrested embryo at the posterior pole of the egg. Insects with intermediate germ band development (<italic>e.g., Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic> and <italic>Pyrrhocoris apterus</italic>) devote more of their blastoderm to making their embryonic rudiment. The differential between the body length of the germ band versus the completed embryo is less than seen in short germ band embryos as is the ability of precocious JH treatment to stunt embryonic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Enslee and Riddiford, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>The extreme condition is long germ band development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anderson, 1972b</xref>) seen only in some holometabolous groups such as Diptera and Hymenoptera. <italic>Drosophila</italic> provides an example of the latter in which the vast majority of the cellular blastoderm is devoted to making the embryo and it is simultaneously partitioned into the head and body segments. As the segmented germ band progresses into organogenesis, it becomes longer than the egg and folds back on itself. It also is establishing the primordia that will become the structures for the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Cohen, 1993</xref>). The germ band subsequently retracts to egg length before undergoing dorsal closure. Long germ band embryos lack a distinct phase of body growth between completion of the segmented germ band and terminal differentiation after dorsal closure. As such, they have lost the window of embryonic growth that is prominent in short germ band insects and is a major target of early JH exposure (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10B</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, then, the changing strategies of germ band development interacts with the timing of secretion of ecdysteroids after formation of the germ band to determine how early embryos respond to precocious exposure to JH.</p>

<sec id="s3d">
<title>JH and the progressive nature of embryonic molts</title>
<p>JH is classically known for its <italic>status quo</italic> action of maintaining the immature stages of hemimetabolous and holometabolous insects in their immature condition, and a progressive molt to the next life stage only occurs if JH is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Williams, 1961</xref>). The nature of the molt is determined at the beginning of the ecdysteroid peak and after this commitment phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Riddiford, 1976</xref>), JH is no longer needed. In embryos of <italic>Thermobia</italic>, the ecdysteroid peaks that initiate the production of the E1 and E2 cuticles begin when JH titers are nil or extremely low (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). In both cases, the early presence of JH redirects the molt in a progressive fashion to make a cuticle more typical of later life stages. For the E1 molt, for example, JH causes the epidermis to produce a chitin-rich, inextensible cuticle characteristic of later molts. The presence of JH at the start of the E2 (=J1) molt results in cuticle that lacks the pebbly surface sculpturing and egg-tooth of the E2 stage but has a smooth surface and partially formed cortical lenses characteristic of the J2 stage (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>).</p>
<p>Premature progressive molts are also seen when locust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Sbrenna-Micciarelli, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Truman and Riddiford, 1999</xref>) and cricket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Erezyilmaz <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006</xref>) embryos are prematurely exposed to JH or JHm. The experimental application of JH prior to the onset of the E2 molt to the pronymph (also called the vermiform larva (Bernays, 1971) redirects embryonic development to form an embryo with proportions, cuticular pigmentation, cuticular sculpturing and bristles characteristic of a nymph, while pronymph modifications, such as the cuticular surface sculpturing (Bernays, 1971) and hatching teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Erezyilmaz <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006</xref>), are missing. The tiny embryos that form after JHm treatment prior to the E1 molt of <italic>Locusta</italic> appear to secrete a more robust cuticle than normal, suggesting that JH can also modify the character of the E1 molt in orthopterans.</p>
<p>Although JH induces progressive molting in embryos of locusts and crickets, it switches to causing <italic>status quo</italic> molts in their nymphs. In many insects, the postembryonic effects of JH are largely mediated through Kr-h1. Since JH also induces Kr-h1 in embryos of many insects, including <italic>Thermobia</italic>, it is likely that the progressive actions of JH in the embryo are also mediated through the same transcription factor. How, then, does Kr-h1 mediate progressive molting during embryogenesis but then switch to causing <italic>status quo</italic> molts during the postembryonic period? One possibility is suggested from a comparison of action of JH in inhibiting metamorphosis of the nymphal locusts, with its reproductive actions in the adult of promoting fat body growth and maturation in the female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Both actions of JH are mediated through Kr-h1, but in the nymph, Kr-h1 recruits a co-repressor, C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), to suppress transcription of <italic>E93</italic>, thereby preventing transition to the adult. In the adult, by contrast, Kr-h1 recruits a coactivator, CREB-binding protein (CBP), to drive expression of Ribosomal protein L36 to support fat body growth. In a similar fashion, the cofactors available to Kr-h1 may change from the embryonic to the postembryonic period, shifting from coactivators that mediate the progressive molts of the embryo to co-repressors that maintain the <italic>status quo</italic> molts of the juvenile. A shift in availability of co-activators versus co-repressors may relate to the state of the tissue itself, <italic>i.e.,</italic> whether its cells are in an embryonic condition or are fully differentiated.</p>
<p>In locusts JH supports reproduction by causing the differentiation and maturation of tissues, like the fat body. It may, like in mosquitoes, also direct some aspects of the reproductive actions of ecdysteroids. Since the embryonic actions of JH in ametabolous and hemimetabolous insects involves similar themes of driving differentiation and enhancing ecdysteroid action, the reproductive and developmental functions of JH may have been very similar. The expansion of JH action into postembryonic molts in hemimetabolous insects then required a shift in Kr-h1 binding partners appropriate for maintaining the juvenile stage. The derived, postembryonic functions of JH is discussed in the last section.</p>

<title>Modifications in JH function during the evolution of hemimetabolous and holometabolous life histories</title>
<p>The progressive evolution of new life history strategies from an ancestral pattern that was likely similar to <italic>Thermobia</italic> involved the extension of morphogenesis into postembryonic life. Morphogen systems, whose functions had been originally confined to embryogenesis, had to be redeployed during phases of postembryonic growth and a postembryonic function for JH apparently accompanied this redeployment.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref> summarizes the evolving role of JH as morphogenesis and morphogens are shifted into postembryonic life. The term morphogen encompasses many signaling systems with diverse functions in development. As seen for developing wing and leg imaginal discs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, systems of secreted morphogens, such as <italic>wingless/WNT</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Swarup and Verheyen, 2012</xref>), <italic>hedgehog</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ingham, 2022</xref>) and <italic>decapentaplegic</italic> (<italic>TGF-β</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hamaratoglu <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>) function locally within the wing to direct its morphogenesis, while others act systemically to coordinate wing growth with that of the animal as a whole. Of the latter, myoglianin, coming primarily from muscle, matches wing growth to body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Upadhyay <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>), while the relaxin-like growth factor, dILP8, coordinates growth between imaginal discs during formation of the pupa (Blanco-Obregon <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022).</p>

<caption><title>Proposed scheme for the evolving role of JH to support the invention of complex life histories.</title>
<p>In all three grades of development, various lines of evidence suggest that JH interacts with systemic morphogen(s) but a complete picture of the latter has yet to be finished. Overall, the morphogen systems are involved in morphogenesis (M) while JH promotes and supports differentiation (D). In the ametabolous condition the developmental functions of JH are confined to embryogenesis where morphogens and JH act at different times to support morphogenesis followed by terminal differentiation. For hemimetabolous development, morphogens reappear during the postembryonic period to support wing formation, but the extension of JH into the postembryonic period along with this morphogen signaling results in the formation of a nymphal wing bud rather than a wing. The disappearance of JH in the last nymphal stage then allows unantagonized morphogen signaling to form the wing structure. In the holometabolous pattern, embryonic changes bring about a modified larval body plan with much of morphogenesis deferred into postembryonic life. JH continues to be needed in postembryonic life to allow the controlled growth of imaginal primordia rather than their metamorphic morphogenesis. The latter can then occur when JH is removed. The differentiation of these imaginal primordia to their pupal state requires the return of JH during pupal differentiation, reminiscent of the embryonic requirement of JH for juvenile differentiation in embryos of more basal insect groups.

<p>The morphogen systems of most importance to the role of JH likely involve circulating morphogens. Classic experiments by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Piepho (1938)</xref> on the wax moth, <italic>Galleria mellonella,</italic> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Wigglesworth (1934)</xref>, on the bug, <italic>Rhodnius prolixus</italic>, showed that tissues from first instar caterpillars and bugs could be induced to start metamorphosis if exposed to the circulating environment of the last juvenile instar. The interpretation was that the JH-free environment of the last juvenile instar was sufficient to allow their metamorphosis, but experiments over a half century later from both holometabolous and hemimetabolous species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Daimon <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; Smykal <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014) show that the simple removal of JH is not sufficient to cause first instars to initiate metamorphosis. These two sets of results can be reconciled by assuming that besides the lack of JH, the blood of the premetamorphic juvenile also has a factor(s) that promotes metamorphosis. Various hypothetical Metamorphosis Initiating Factors (Truman <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006) and competence factors (Smykal <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Chafino <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019</xref>) have been proposed. A promising candidate is myoglianin. In <italic>Manduca</italic>, an increase of myoglianin release, likely from the muscle, signals that the larva has reached its critical size for metamorphosis, and the knockdown of myoglianin in <italic>Tribolium casteneum</italic> results in a permanent larva that continues to molt well after it has surpassed its critical weight (He <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> myoglianin acts after the critical weight checkpoint in the last larval stage to match imaginal disc size to body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Upadhyay <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020</xref>) and to induce the ecdysone receptor isoform needed for neurons to start metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Awasaki <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011</xref>). While myoglianin is clearly a key player in preparing the juvenile stage for metamorphosis, it is not known if it is also the early competence factor, or if multiple morphogen systems were involved in evolving metamorphosis. <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref> refers to them simply as “circulating morphogens”.</p>
<p>The species-typical body plan is formed during embryogenesis in both ametabolous and hemimetabolous insects, and JH functions similarly in the embryos of both: it appears after dorsal closure to support the shift from morphogenetic growth to differentiation. Except for a possible involvement in the appearance of scales in the fourth instar juvenile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Watson, 1967</xref>), JH appears to have little or no role in the postembryonic development of <italic>Thermobia.</italic> Using levels of Kr-h1 as a proxy for the JH titer, Kr-h1 levels are low through juvenile growth and there is no dip in Kr-h1 levels during the transition to the adult stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Fernandez-Nicolas <italic>et al.,</italic> 2023</xref>). Nor is there evidence that JH is involved in sex-specific differentiation (production of genitalia) in <italic>Thermobia.</italic> A lack of JH involvement in the transition to the adult at the end of juvenile growth in <italic>Thermobia</italic> may not be surprising because such transitions are evident in all classes of Arthropods and, therefore, predates the emergence of JH.</p>
<p>The shift to a hemimetabolous life history involved postembryonic changes that resulted in the development of wings and of powered flight. The fossil record shows that the earliest winged insects were ametabolous with articulated winglets in the juvenile stages, but the wings showed positive allometric growth so that they were eventually became large enough to support flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Kukalová-Peck, 1978</xref>). The postembryonic formation of the wing presumably involved the recruitment of some of the embryonic morphogen systems to function postembryonally in the thorax. To protect the forming wings from damage, later insects modified early wing growth so that it occurred as immobile wing pads, laid against the thorax. The transformation of the pads into articulated, functional wings was deferred until the molt to the adult stage. As suggested in <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>, the formation of the wing bud may have come about by the reappearance of JH during nymphal life. During embryogenesis, morphogen signaling and JH are separated in time so morphogenesis occurs before differentiation. In the hemimetabolous nymph, though, morphogen signaling and JH are finally found together. The actions of the morphogens to drive the formation of a wing would then be antagonized by the action of JH in maintaining cells in the differentiated, nymphal state. We think that the antagonistic interaction of the two systems resulted in a novel structure – the wing bud. The morphogen signaling maintain the bud cells as diploid and support their positive allometric growth, while the presence of JH maintain the nymphal state of the wing bud epidermis, so that it produces a nymphal cuticle and undergoes cell division only at the molts in response to ecdysone. This state requires the tonic presence of JH and either the experimental or natural loss of JH releases the break on the morphogen systems and the bud cells partially dedifferentiate and undertake the morphogenetic growth and patterning that results in wing production at the next molt. While the challenge of developing wings was likely the driving force that brought JH into the postembryonic realm, once JH was established in the nymphal stage, it was likely captured by other tissues to control their stage-specific differences between larva and adult.</p>
<p>The subsequent shift to the holometabolous lifestyle involved a fundamental change in embryogenesis to make the altered body plan of the larva (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>). As discussed above, the embryonic primordia of holometabolous insects could be divided into a portion used to make the larval version of their structure while the remainder is set aside to later become an imaginal primordium or imaginal disc (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Cohen, 1993</xref>). These persisting embryonic primordia join the wing primordia in delaying their morphogenesis into postembryonic life. As proposed for the wing pads of hemimetabolous nymphs, the activation of imaginal primordia in holometabolous larvae likely also depends on morphogens. In newly hatched caterpillars of the butterfly <italic>Pieris rapae</italic>, each wing primordium appears as a thickened placode attached to the larva cuticle and persists as such into the second larval instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mercer, 1900</xref>). The placode has transformed into an invaginated imaginal disc by the beginning of the third instar, a similar time to when wing morphogenesis is first possible in the commercial silkworm (Daimon <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015). The time of transformation of the placode into a disc produces likely indicates when key postembryonic morphogen systems become active, and it also is when JH becomes necessary for evoking premature morphogenesis. Studies in <italic>Manduca sexta</italic>, show that after this time the tonic presence of JH is required for the imaginal discs and primordia to grow in a nutrient dependent manner but maintains its larval differentiation. These primordia undergo dedifferentiation and start morphogenesis a few hours after the experimental removal of JH (Truman <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006), presumably because the morphogens are no longer under JH suppression.</p>
<p>A unique feature of the JH titer in holometabolous insects is its transient reappearance during the formation of the pupal stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Williams, 1961</xref>). Just before this time, ecdysone acts in the absence of JH to commit the larva to its a pupal fate and larval cells start to lose their larval specializations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Riddiford, 1976</xref>). During the subsequent prepupal ecdysteroid peak, the cells re-differentiate into their pupal form. For the cells of the imaginal primordia and imaginal discs, JH is often necessary for them to become pupal; and in its absence, they jump to the adult condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Williams, 1961</xref>). This requirement of JH for pupal differentiation of imaginal disc cells is reminiscent of the need for JH by embryos of ametabolous and hemimetabolous insects to achieve their juvenile/nymphal condition. This postembryonic return of JH in the Holometabola, then, may accommodate the needs of embryonic tissues that have delayed morphogenesis and differentiation until metamorphosis. Also, it is interesting that this period when JH returns in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is also a time when another morphogen system involving dILP8 is signaling between imaginal discs to match their size to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Blanco-Obregon <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Concluding speculations</title>
<p>Our results on <italic>Thermobia</italic> argue that the ancestral functions of JH in insects were not confined to reproduction. This hormone had an essential role during embryogenesis in supporting the shift from growth and morphogenesis to maturation and terminal differentiation. This function of JH in promoting/maintaining differentiation was then utilized to support the subsequent evolution of metamorphic strategies in the juvenile. The roots of JH signaling and action, though, extend back into the Crustacea where the immediate precursor of JH, methyl farnesoate (MF), is involved in reproductive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Borst <italic>et al.,</italic> 1987</xref>) but its effects on crustacean development are subtle and diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Laufer and Biggers, 2001</xref>) and difficult to compare with its developmental effects in <italic>Thermobia</italic>.</p>
<p>The functioning of farnesol derivatives in growth versus differentiation control extends deep into the eukaryotes. In the yeast <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, secreted farnesoic acid acts as a “quorum sensing signal” that controls the transition from a budding form to a hyphal form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Hornby <italic>et al.,</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Oh <italic>et al.,</italic> 2001</xref>). Amongst animals, the genes for the enzymes to synthesize farnesoic acid are widely found throughout the invertebrate phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">So <italic>et al.,</italic> (2022)</xref>. In mammals, farnesol stimulates differentiation in epidermal keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hanley <italic>et al.,</italic> 2000</xref>) while it also suppresses xenograft-based tumor growth in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Indeed, farnesol-based molecules may have an ancient involvement in switching cells between developmental states and this capacity was eventually exploited by the insects to provide the hormonal system that regulates their metamorphosis.</p>

<p>The firebrats, <italic>Thermobia domestica</italic>, were reared at 37°C in small, covered polyethylene boxes. Layers of corrugated filter paper provided surfaces for the insects to move on and hide. The insects were fed dry Gerber’s baby rice cereal and a few pellets of dry cat food. Water was available in cotton-plugged vials. The incubator was kept above 70% relative humidity with a saturated KCl solution.</p>
<p>Cotton balls were placed between the filter paper sheets for oviposition. For timed egg collections, the cotton balls were replaced morning and evening to achieve 12 hour egg collections, and each was stored in a covered petri dish at 37°C until needed. The age of the embryos were referenced to the midpoint of the collection period.</p>

<title>Juvenile Hormone Titers</title>
<p>Timed egg collections were extracted based on the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bergot <italic>et al</italic>. (1981a)</xref> as modified by Lacy Barton and Justina Sanny (personal communication) and by LMR. Briefly, 200 eggs were homogenized in 350 µl acetonitrile containing 31.25 pg deuterated JH III (JHD3) in a silanized 2 ml Snap-It vial (Thermo-Fisher) on ice using a Benchmark D1000 homogenizer (Benchmark Scientific, New York), then capped and spun at 5000 g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to a new silanized vial. The pellet was resuspended in 250 µl acetonitrile containing 31.25 pg JHD3 III, spun at 5000g for 15 min, then the two supernatants combined. The combined supernatants were extracted with two volumes n-pentane and 4 volumes of 4% NaCl, then spun at 2000 g for 20 min at 4°C. The organic phases and aqueous phase were put into separate silanized vials, and the aqueous phase re-extracted with a half volume of n-pentane and spun 20 min at 4°C. The resultant organic phase was combined with the original organic phases which was then washed with an equal volume of 4% NaCl, and centrifuged at 2000 g for 20 min at 4°C. The organic phase was then transferred to a new silanized vial, the solvent gently blown off under a stream of nitrogen, and the residue then resuspended in 200 µl acetonitrile. The residue and two 150 µl rinses of the vial were loaded onto a Sep-Pak C18 column (3cc; Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). The purified extract was eluted from the column with 2 ml acetonitrile and frozen at -20°C until analysis by the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Ramirez <italic>et al</italic>.

<title>Ecdysteroid titers</title>
<p>Ecdysteroid concentrations in timed egg collections were measured using the 20-Hydroxyecdysone (20E) Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) kit (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI) based on the method developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Porcheron <italic>et al</italic>. (1989)</xref>. Staged <italic>Thermobia</italic> embryos (200 per sample) were homogenized in 250 µls ice cold 75% aqueous methanol as outlined in Margam <italic>et al</italic>. (2006). Homogenized samples were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 13,000g and 4°C. Supernatants were transferred to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes on ice. Pellets were resuspended in 250 µls 75% aqueous methanol, vortexed, placed on ice for 30 mins, then centrifuged as before, and the supernatants pooled. One quarter of the volume was dried down under nitrogen, stored desiccated at -20°C. It was resuspended in EIA buffer and diluted 1/100 just before assay. Following the kit instructions, the EIA was performed in a 96-well microtiter plate and is based on the competition between 20E (in standard or sample) and acetylcholinesterase-labeled 20E for the ecdysteroid antiserum that has been bound to the IGG-coated well plates. The plate was incubated with gyration overnight at 4°C, then washed five times with EIA buffer. The enzymatic substrate for acetylcholinesterase and chromogen, which form a yellow compound that absorbs between 405-414 nm, was then added to each well and incubated at room temperature with gyration for 60 min. The intensity of the color is inversely proportional to the amount of ecdysteroid present as determined by spectrophotometry on a μQuant Microplate Spectrophotometer plate reader at 410 nm (BioTek Instruments, Vermont). The kit solutions were resuspended in UltraPure water (Cayman Chemical). The readings were compared to a standard curve derived from serial dilutions of the 20E standard and quality control provided by the kit.</p>

<p>A rabbit antibody against phosphohistone H3 (#06-570: anti phosphor-Histone H3 (ser 10); EDM Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) was used at a 1:1000 dilution to identify mitotic cells. Tissue was preblocked in 2% normal donkey serum (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA) for 15 to 30 min, then incubated with the primary antibody for two to three nights. Following 5 to 6 rinses in PBS-TX, tissues were incubated with a secondary antibody along with a variety of stains. Secondary antibodies were various Alexa Fluor 488-, 594-, or 647-conjugated donkey antisera raised against rabbit IgG fractions and used at 1:500 (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA). Selection of the secondary depended on the combination of stains that were used. After staining, tissues were mounted, dehydrated, cleared and mounted as described above.

The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is <bold>convincing</bold>, drawing on a broad range of approaches and variety of experimental techniques. While the interpretation of this work in the wider context regarding its relevance for the evolution of metamorphosis is in some places overly speculative, the work will be of interest to evolutionary developmental biologists studying hormonal control of development and to entomologists studying the evolution of metamorphosis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This paper provides strong evidence for the roles of JH in an ametabolous insect species. In particular, it demonstrates that:</p>
<p>
• JH shifts embryogenesis from a growth mode to a differentiation mode and is responsible for terminal differentiation during embryogenesis. This, and other JH roles, are first suggested as correlations, based on the timing of JH peaks, but then experimentally demonstrated using JH antagonists and rescue thereof with JH mimic. This is a robust approach and the experimental results are very convincing.</p>
<p>
• JH redirects ecdysone-induced molting to direct formation of a more mature cuticle</p>
<p>
• Kr-h1 is downstream of JH in Thermobia, as it is in other insects, and is a likely mediator of many JH effects</p>
<p>
• The results support the proposed model that an ancestral role of JH in promoting and maintaining differentiation was coopted during insect radiations to drive the evolution of metamorphosis. However, alternate evolutionary scenarios should also be considered.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Overall, this is a beautiful, in-depth student. The paper is well-written and clear. The background places the work in a broad context and shows its importance in understanding fundamental questions about insect biology. The researchers are leaders in the field, and a strength of this manuscript is their use of a variety of different approaches (enzymatic assays, gene expression, agonists &amp; antagonists, analysis of morphology using different types of microscopy and detection, and more) to attack their research questions. The experimental data is clearly presented and carefully executed with appropriate controls and attention to detail. The 'multi-pronged' approach provides support for the conclusions from different angles, strengthening conclusions. In sum, the data presented are convincing and the conclusions about experimental outcomes are well-justified based on the results obtained.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
This paper provides more detail than is likely needed for readers outside the field but also provides sufficient depth for those in the field. This is both a strength and a weakness. I would suggest the authors shorten some aspects of their text to make it more accessible to a broader audience. In particular, the discussion is very long and accompanied by two model figures. The discussion could be tightened up and much of the text used for a separate review article (perhaps along with Figure 11) that would bring more attention to the proposed evolution of JH roles.</p>

<p>The authors have studied in detail the embryogenesis of the ametabolan insect Thermobia domestica. They have also measured the levels of the two most important hormones in insect development: juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroids. The work then focuses on JH, whose occurrence concentrates in the final part (between 70 and 100%) of embryo development. Then, the authors used a precocene compound (7-ethoxyprecocene, or 7EP) to destroy the JH producing tissues in the embryo of the firebrat T. domestica, which allowed to unveil that this hormone is critically involved in the last steps of embryogenesis. The 7EP-treated embryos failed to resorb the extraembryonic fluid and did not hatch. More detailed observations showed that processes like the maturational growth of the eye, the lengthening of the foregut and posterior displacement of the midgut, and the detachment of the E2 cuticle, were impaired after the 7EP treatment. Importantly, a treatment with a JH mimic subsequent to the 7EP treatment restored the correct maturation of both the eye and the gut. It is worth noting that the timing of JH mimic application was essential for correcting the defects triggered by the treatment with 7EP.</p>
<p>This is a relevant result in itself since the role of JH in insect embryogenesis is a controversial topic. It seems to have an important role in hemimetabolan embryogenesis, but not so much in holometabolans. Intriguingly, it appears important for hatching, an observation made in hemimetabolan and in holometabolan embryos. Knowing that this role was already present in ametabolans is relevant from an evolutionary point of view, and knowing exactly why embryos do not hatch in the absence of JH, is relevant from the point of view of developmental biology.</p>
<p>Then, the authors describe a series of experiments applying the JH mimic in early embryogenesis, before the natural peak of JH occurs, and its effects on embryo development. Observations were made under different doses of JHm, and under different temporal windows of treatment. Higher doses triggered more severe effects, as expected, and different windows of application produced different effects. The most used combination was 1 ng JHm applied 1.5 days AEL, checking the effects 3 days later. Of note, 1.5 days AEL is about 15% embryonic development, whereas the natural peak of JH occurs around 85% embryonic development. In general, the ectopic application of JHm triggered a diversity of effects, generally leading to an arrest of development. Intriguingly, however, a number of embryos treated with 1 ng of JHm at 1.5 days AEL showed a precocious formation of myofibrils in the longitudinal muscles. Also, a number of embryos treated in the same way showed enhanced chitin deposition in the E1 procuticle and showed an advancement of at least a day in the deposition of the E2 cuticle.</p>
<p>While the experiments and observations are done with great care and are very exhaustive, I am not sure that the results reveal genuine JH functions. The effects triggered by a significant pulse of ectopic JHm when the embryo is 15% of the development will depend on the context: the transcriptome existing at that time, especially the cocktail of transcription factors. This explains why different application times produce different effects. This also explains why the timing of JHm application was essential for correcting the effects of 7EP treatment. In this reasoning, we must consider that the context at 85% development, when the JH peaks in natural conditions and plays its genuine functions, must be very different from the context at 15% development, when the JHm was applied in most of the experiments. In summary, I believe that the observations after the application of JHm reveal effects of the ectopic JHm, but not necessarily functions of the JH. If so, then the subsequent inferences made from the premise that these ectopic treatments with JHm revealed JH functions are uncertain and should be interpreted with caution.</p>
<p>Those inferences affect not only the &quot;JH and the progressive nature of embryonic molts&quot; section, but also, the &quot;Modifications in JH function during the evolution of hemimetabolous and holometabolous life histories&quot; section, and the entire &quot;Discussion&quot;. In addition to inferences built on uncertain functions, the sections mentioned, especially the Discussion, I think suffer from too many poorly justified speculations. I love speculation in science, it is necessary and fruitful. But it must be practiced within limits of reasonableness, especially when expressed in a formal journal.</p>
<p>Finally, In the section &quot;Modifications in JH function during the evolution of hemimetabolous and holometabolous life&quot;, it is not clear the bridge that connects the observations on the embryo of Thermobia and the evolution of modified life cycles, hemimetabolan and holometabolan.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, the authors use inhibitors and mimetics of juvenile hormone (JH) to demonstrate that JH has a key role in late embryonic development in Thermobia, specifically in gut and eye development but also resorption of the extraembryonic fluid and hatching. They then exogenously apply JH early in development (when it is not normally present) to examine the biological effects of JH at these stages. This causes a plethora of defects including developmental arrest, deposition of chitin, limb development, and enhanced muscle differentiation. The authors interpret these early effects on development as JH being important for the shift from morphogenetic growth to differentiation - a role that they speculate may have facilitated the evolution of metamorphosis (hemi- and holo-metaboly). This paper will be of interest to insect evo-devo researchers, particularly those with interests in the evolution of metamorphosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The experiments are generally conducted very well with appropriate controls and the authors have included a very detailed analysis of the phenotypes.</p>
<p>
The manuscript significantly advances our understanding of Thermobia development and the role of JH in Thermobia development.</p>
<p>
The authors interpret this data to present some hypotheses regarding the role of JH in the evolution of metamorphosis, some aspects of which can be addressed by future studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The results are based on using inhibitors and mimetics of JH and there was no attempt to discern immediate effects of JH from downstream effects. The authors show, for instance, that the transcription of myoglianin is responsive to JH levels, it would have been interesting to see if any of the phenotypic effects are due to myoglianin upregulation/suppression (using RNAi for example). These kinds of experiments will be necessary to fully work out if and how the JH regulatory network has been co-opted into metamorphosis.</p>
<p>The results generally support the authors' conclusions. However, the discussion contains a lot of speculation and some far-reaching conclusions are made about the role of JH and how it became co-opted into controlling metamorphosis. There are some interesting hypotheses presented and the author's speculations are consistent with the data presented. However, it is difficult to make evolutionary inferences from a single data point as although Thermobia is a basally branching insect, the lineage giving rise to Thermobia diverged from the lineages giving rise to the holo- and hemimetabolous insects approx.. 400 mya and it is possible that the effects of JH seen in Thermobia reflect lineage-specific effects rather than the 'ancestral state'. The authors ignore the possibility that there has been substantial rewiring of the networks that are JH responsive across these 400 my. I would encourage the authors to temper some of the discussion of these hypotheses and include some of the limitations of their inferences regarding the role of JH in the evolution of metamorphosis in their discussion.</p>
