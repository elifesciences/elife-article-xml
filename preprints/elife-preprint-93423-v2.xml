<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium (<italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium) is a major foodborne zoonotic pathogen that can cause diarrhea and colitis in humans and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fabrega and Vila, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). According to reports, <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections are common in both industrialized and developing nations, posing a serious risk to public health and resulting in significant financial losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Katiyo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mohan et al., 2019</xref>). At present, antibiotics remain one of the most effective treatment strategies for <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections. However, numerous studies have reported that the prolonged use or misuse of antibiotics can lead to environmental pollution, an increase in multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, as well as gastrointestinal microbiota dysbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ferri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Paulson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Reyman et al., 2022</xref>). In order to tackle <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections, a hunt for novel antimicrobial drugs is now underway.</p>
<p>More research has recently demonstrated the critical role gut microbiota plays in reducing intestinal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cristofori et al., 2021</xref>) and mending the intestinal barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ohland and Macnaughton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). The use of probiotics is a popular approach to modulating intestinal microbiota nowadays. Among all probiotics, <italic>Bacillus</italic> is one of the most popular probiotic species because of its ability to form endospores that survive gastric transit, storage and delivery conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gu et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Bacillus</italic> species can generate extracellular enzymes and antimicrobial metabolites that inhibit enteric pathogens, which lowers the risk of infection and enhances nutrient utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdhul et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ouattara et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The recently identified <italic>Bacillus velezensis</italic> (<italic>B. velezensis</italic>) species of the <italic>Bacillus</italic> genus has a large capacity to generate a variety of secondary metabolites that possess broad-spectrum antibacterial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ye et al., 2018</xref>). Previous studies have reported that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> exhibits varying degrees of probiotic effects on plants, livestock, poultry and fish. For instance, the combined use of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> SQR9 mutant and FZB42 improved root colonization and the production of secondary metabolites that are beneficial to cucumber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shao et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>B. velezensis</italic> isolated from yaks was shown to enhance growth performance and ameliorate blood parameters related to inflammation and immunity in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2019</xref>). The dietary <italic>B. velezensis</italic> supplementation can regulate the innate immune response in the intestine of crucian carp and reduce the degree of intestinal inflammation damage induced by <italic>A. veronii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Few studies have been conducted on the treatment or prevention of colitis caused by <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium; instead, the majority of investigations on <italic>B. velezensis</italic> focused on the biocontrol of fungal infections in plants.</p>
<p>A strain of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity was selected from a vast number of <italic>Bacillus</italic> strains for this study. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 in alleviating <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium-induced mouse colitis and assessed the biological safety of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020. Notably, <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 can alleviate symptoms and colon tissue damage in experimental colitis, as indicated by markers such as <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium loads, TNF-α and ZO-1 levels. Moreover, <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 also increases the abundance of beneficial bacteria, specifically <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, within the colon microbiota. As a result, this research supports the creation of probiotic-based microbial products as a substitute method of preventing <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections.</p>

<title>Genomic Characteristics</title>
<p>HBXN2020’s complete genome was sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq and PacBio platforms. The results showed that HBXN2020 has a circular chromosome of 3,929,792 bp (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) with a GC content of 46.5%, including 3,744 protein-coding genes (CDS), 86 tRNA genes, and 27 rRNA genes (Table S1). Furthermore, the HBXN2020 genome also contains 13 different clusters of secondary metabolic synthesis genes. such as Fengycin (genomic position:1,865,856) and Difficidin (genomic position:2,270,091) (Table S2).</p>

<p>A phylogenetic tree based on genome-wide data from all 14 <italic>Bacillus</italic> strains demonstrated that the HBXN2020 belongs to the <italic>B. velezensis</italic> species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). To further understand the classification status of HBXN2020, the online tool JSpeciesWS was used to calculate the average nucleotide identity (ANI) based on the BLAST (ANIb) method. As shown in Fig. S1, HBXN2020 was found to be a member of the <italic>B. velezensis</italic> species due to the high percentage of ANIb (more than 97%).</p>

<title>Growth curve and <italic>in vitro</italic> resistance against environmental assaults</title>
<p>The growth of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 was assessed in flat-bottomed 100-well microtiter plates by measuring the values of OD<sub>600</sub> every hour using an automatic growth curve analyzer. After measurement, we found that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 entered the logarithmic growth phase after 2 h, and reached a plateau after 10 h of culture (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

Equal amounts of endospore and vegetative cells of HBXN2020 were exposed to the following: (<bold>C</bold>) acid solution (pH 2 to 7), (<bold>D</bold>) 0.3% bile salts, (<bold>E</bold>) SGF (pH 1.2) supplemented with pepsin, and (<bold>F</bold>) SIF (pH 6.8) containing trypsin at 37°C. At predetermined time points, 100 μL was taken from each sample, and tenfold serially diluted with sterile PBS (pH 7.2), and then spread on LB agar plates and cultured at 37°C for 12 h before bacterial counting. Each group was repeated three times (n = 3).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="568052v2_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Next, we evaluated the effect of physical, chemical, and biological sterilization conditions such as high temperature, strong acidity, and enzyme preparation on the survival of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020. The survival rate of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 showed a decreasing trend with increasing temperature (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), but this decrease was not obvious. In a strong acid environment (pH 2.0), <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 maintained a high survival rate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), suggesting that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores can survive under extreme conditions. Based on these results, we hypothesized that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores might also exhibit improved survival in gastrointestinal tract environments. Therefore, we further evaluated the survival rate of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 in bile salt (0.3%, v/v), simulated gastric fluid (pepsin 1 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>, pH 1.2), and simulated intestinal fluid (trypsin 1 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>, pH 6.8). As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-F</xref>, <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores demonstrated significantly improved tolerance to these simulated gastrointestinal tract environments.</p>

<title>Antibiotic susceptibility of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 and bacteriostasis effect <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>In order to assess <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020’s drug resistance, 19 antibiotics that are frequently used in clinical settings were chosen. The results indicated that only polymyxin B had a relatively small inhibition zone diameter (less than 15 mm). Ampicillin, meropenem, minocycline, ofloxacin, and trimethoprim had the strongest inhibition on <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020, with an inhibition zone diameter exceeding 30 mm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). In addition, the experimental results showed that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 was extremely sensitive to β-lactams, tetracyclines, and quinolone drugs. Then, we performed an inhibition test of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 against seven common clinical pathogenic bacteria. The results showed that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 had a similar inhibitory effect on standard and wild strains of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>), <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>), and <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> (<italic>C. perfringens</italic>), as well as wild strains of <italic>Streptococcus suis</italic> (<italic>S. suis</italic>), <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic> (<italic>P. multocida</italic>), and <italic>Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae</italic> (<italic>A. pleuropneumoniae</italic>). Except for the wild strains of <italic>S. suis</italic>and <italic>A. pleuropneumoniae</italic>, the diameter of the inhibition zone of other strains was above 15 mm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, S2), while the size of the inhibition zone of <italic>S. suis</italic> and <italic>A. pleuropneumoniae</italic> was also more than 12 mm.</p>

<p>We assessed the biological safety of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 in a mouse model in order to ascertain its safety. After gavage with <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores for two weeks, we observed no significant difference in the body weight of each group of mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The gene expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 of colon from all groups of mice exhibited no remarkable changes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, in the colon, mRNA levels of the barrier proteins ZO-1 and occludin were trending towards an increase compared with the control group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Additionally, blood routine tests and serum biochemistry tests were performed for mice in the control group and H-HBXN2020 group on the 14<sup>th</sup> d after oral administration of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores multiple times. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> and S3, the blood parameters of mice after <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 treatment, including red blood cells (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), hemoglobin (HGB), white blood cells (WBC), platelets (PLT), hematocrit (HCT), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), were consistent with those of healthy mice. The serum biochemical parameters, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (ALB), total bilirubin (TBIL), serum creatinine (CREA), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), were also within normal limits (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). The corresponding histological analysis of colon tissue from mice receiving low, medium, and high doses of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores (L-HBXN2020, M-HBXN2020, and H-HBXN2020 groups, respectively) is presented in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>. The colon tissue sections of mice in the test groups showed no significant differences compared to the control group. Additionally, there were no observable differences in the major organ tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney) of mice treated with the high dose of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores compared to healthy mice (Fig. S4). The results of this trial show that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 is safe to use and has no negative side effects in mice.</p>

<title>Oral administration of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores alleviated <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium-induced colitis</title>
<p>Testing both solid and liquid co-culture methods to see if <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 might suppress <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium ATCC14028 (STm), the findings indicated that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 decreased the development of STm in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, S5). Next, the therapeutic potential of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 was evaluated in an STm-induced mouse colitis model. At days 1, 3, and 5 after STm infection, mice in the STm + HBXN2020 group were orally administered <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores by gavage (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), while the control group and STm + PBS group were treated with sterile PBS. Also, the number of excreted STm in feces was counted daily at the designated time points. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, there was a significant and continuous reduction in the number of STm in feces following treatment with <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores, while the number of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 viable bacteria in feces is also gradually decreasing (Fig. S6A). The number of STm in mouse feces was reduced by 10 to 50 times compared to the STm + PBS group from day 2 to 7 post-treatment. <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spore treatment also resulted in a 5 to 10-fold reduction in the number of STm in the ileum, cecum, and colon, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-F</xref>). The increased inhibition of STm after <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spore treatment also resulted in less weight loss and a marked reduction (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) in DAI scores in STm + HBXN2020 group mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G-H</xref>). In addition, we also measured the colon length of the mice and found that the STm + PBS group had a significantly shorter colon length (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) than the control group. However, compared to the STm + PBS group, the STm + HBXN2020 group exhibited a longer colon (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I-J</xref>).</p>

<p>To further assess the impact of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 on the intestinal tract, we histologically analyzed their colonic tissues. The results showed that mice treated with <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores exhibited a lower histology score (total scoring) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, S6B) than mice not treated with the spores and were similar to that of healthy mice (control group). The colon tissue of mice not treated with <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores displayed higher histological scores, with significant crypt deformation, severe mucosal damage, and obvious inflammatory cell infiltration. These findings suggested that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 can alleviate colon tissue damage. Moreover, we measured the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 β (IL-1 β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in colon tissue using RT-qPCR analysis. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-D</xref>, the mRNA levels of TNF-α (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), IL-1β (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), and IL-6 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the colon tissue of STm-infected mice were significantly upregulated, indicating the successful establishment of the STm-induced colitis model. As expected, treatment with <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores led to a significant reduction in the mRNA levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the mRNA levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were significantly increased (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), suggesting that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores can alleviate the inflammatory reaction of the colon. Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of colonic epithelial barrier proteins, including ZO-1, ocludin, claudin, and Muc2, were also measured by RT-qPCR. Compared with the PBS-treated group, the <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores treatment group exhibited significantly upregulated mRNA expression levels of ZO-1 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), occludin (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), claudin (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), and Muc2 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) in the colon tissue (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F-I</xref>), further demonstrating the ability of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 to reduce damage to the colon epithelial barrier.</p>

<p>Next, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to investigate the impact of HBXN2020 spores on the makeup of the intestinal microbiota in mice treated with STm. The alpha diversity of colonic microbiota was evaluated using Sobs, Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson indices (OTU levels). Compared with the control and HBXN2020 group, the Sobs, Chao1, and Shannon indices of the STm + PBS group clearly decreased (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-C</xref>), while the Simpson index significantly increased (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Principle component analysis (PCA) based on Bray-Curtis distance showed that compared with the STm + PBS group, the gut microbiota composition of the STm + HBXN2020 group and the control group were more closer together (R= 0.3988, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). We analyzed the community composition of colonic microbiota at the phylum and genus level, and the results revealed that the composition of the gut microbiota changed markedly after STm-induced mice. At the phylum level, the STm + PBS group increased the abundance of <italic>Verrucomicrobiota</italic> and <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> and decreased the abundance of <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, <italic>Patescibacteria</italic>, <italic>Desulfobacterota</italic>, and <italic>Actinobacteriota</italic> compared to the Control group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). The HBXN2020 group increased the abundance of <italic>Bacteroidota</italic> and <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and decreased the abundance of <italic>Verrucomicrobiota</italic> compared with the Control group. On the contrary, the relative abundance of <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, <italic>Patescibacteria</italic>, <italic>Desulfobacterota</italic>, and <italic>Actinobacteriota</italic> in the STm + HBXN2020 group was significantly higher than that in the STm + PBS group. At the genus level, infection with <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium ATCC14028 in the STm + PBS group dramatically reduced the relative abundance of <italic>norank_f_Muribaculaceae</italic>, <italic>Desulfovibrio</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G, H</xref>-I) and enhanced the abundance of <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Escherichia-Shigella</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>Alistipes</italic>, and <italic>Enterococcus</italic> compared to the Control group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G, J</xref>-K). The HBXN2020 group increased the abundance of <italic>norank_f_Muribaculaceae</italic> and <italic>Alloprevotella</italic> compared to the Control group.

In addition, LEfSe analysis was also performed to identify specialized microbial communities between the STm + HBXN2020 group and the STm + PBS group and found that there was a clear difference in gut microbiota composition between them.

<p>Based on the improved therapeutic efficacy of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 in the treatment of STm-induced colitis in mice, we further explored its potential for disease prevention by evaluating pretreatment. Mice in the PBS + STm group and HBXN2020 + STm group were given the same amount of sterile PBS and <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores by gavage one week in advance.

However, the number of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 viable bacteria in feces is also gradually decreasing with time prolonging (Fig. S8A). Furthermore, compared with the PBS + STm group, oral administration of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores not only reduced the number of STm in mouse feces (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>) but also decreased STm colonization in the ileum, cecum, and colon (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8G-H</xref>, S8B).</p>

<p>Next, we examined the impact of prophylactic <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 on the intestinal microbiota composition of STm-treated mice.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium is an important intestinal pathogen that can cause invasive intestinal diseases such as bacterial colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Herp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schultz et al., 2017</xref>). Antibiotics are frequently used to treat colitis caused by bacteria; nevertheless, in recent years, their abuse has greatly increased bacterial resistance, leading to serious environmental pollution. A recent study showed that antibiotic-resistance genes in probiotics could be transmitted to the intestinal microbiota, which may threaten human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Crits-Christoph et al., 2022</xref>). It is crucial to consider the source of probiotics. Strong environmental adaptability and disease resistance make black pigs an outstanding household breed in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 was isolated from the free-range feces of black piglets in a mountain village in Xianning City (Hubei, China) and exhibited excellent antibacterial activity. Otherwise, <italic>in vitro</italic> tolerance assays showed that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores have good tolerance to high temperature, strong acids, bile salts, as well as simulated gastric and intestinal fluid, which was similar to previous research results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Du et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, studies for antibiotic susceptibility revealed that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 is not resistant to antibiotics.</p>
<p>Probiotics are distinct from food or medications in that they can cause toxins or infections in the body when ingested, and they are living when swallowed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sanders et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Snydman, 2008</xref>). Therefore, assessing the biosafety of probiotics is crucial. In this study, the safety of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 was evaluated by measuring the body weight, intestinal barrier proteins, and inflammatory cytokines of the experimented mice, as well as conducting routine blood and biochemical tests. The results showed that the expression levels of ZO-1 and occludin in the colon of mice increased after treatment with different doses of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores. It has been reported that ZO-1, occludin and claudin are the three most important tight junction proteins in intercellular connections, which play a crucial role in maintaining the intestinal epithelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bazzoni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zihni et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, it is possible to improve intestinal barrier function by upregulating ZO-1 and occludin expression levels.</p>
<p>Important aminotransferases in animals, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), are regarded as critical metrics for assessing liver function damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ozer et al., 2008</xref>). Under normal circumstances, the levels of ALT and AST are in dynamic balance without notable changes. However, when the liver is damaged or becomes dysfunctional, the levels of aminotransferases (ALT and AST) increase significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tang et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies have shown that CCL4-induced liver injury strongly increases plasma ALT/AST levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Singhal et al., 2018</xref>). Zhang et al. reported that the addition of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> to chicken diets significantly decreased the serum levels of ALT and AST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). In this present study, the levels of ALT and AST in the probiotic-treated group were slightly lower than those in the control group, indicating that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 had no negative effect on liver health in mice. The <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 treatment group’s blood indices were also found to be 18 comparable to those of the control group, falling within the normal reference range, according to regular blood testing.</p>
<p>Mice were fed with <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores orally after being challenged with <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium ATCC14028 in order to assess the spores’ potential to alleviate colitis caused by S. Typhimurium. Our experimental results demonstrated that oral treatment with <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores could alleviate <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium-induced colitis, as evidenced by decreased weight loss, DAI, and histological damage, which is similar to prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). Previous research showed that macrophages are the first line of host defense against bacterial infection. They release proinflammatory cytokines, which are critical in initiating adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dinarello, 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, proinflammatory cytokines have immunological properties that can be beneficial for the host to resist the invasion of bacteria and other microbes in the surrounding environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). For instance, pretreatment with recombinant murine TNF-α was shown to protect mice against lethal bacterial (<italic>E. coli</italic>) infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cross et al., 1989</xref>). PJ-34 exerted protective effects on intestinal epithelial cells against invasive <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection by upregulating IL-6 expression through the ERK and NF-κB signal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Huang, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, some research has demonstrated that over-activation of immune cells can result in tissue damage, organ failure, systemic or persistent inflammation, and autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Karki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kotas and Medzhitov, 2015</xref>). IL-10 is a recognized anti-inflammatory mediator that plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal microbe-immune homeostasis, regulating the release of inflammatory mediators, and inhibiting proinflammatory responses of innate and adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Maloy and Powrie, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ouyang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Saraiva et al., 2020</xref>). For instance, previous studies have shown that <italic>Clostridium butyrate</italic> can induce the production of IL-10 in the intestine, thereby alleviating experimental colitis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hayashi et al., 2013</xref>). Similar results were observed in our study, where oral administration of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores reduced the expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 while increasing the levels of IL-10 in the colon of mice. Additionally, as demonstrated by the decreased histological damage and increased expression levels of intestinal barrier proteins, oral treatment of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores reduced the functional damage of the intestinal barrier induced by S. Typhimurium infection.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we conducted additional analysis on the colon microbiome. Notably, oral <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 significantly raised the colonic microbiota’s alpha diversity. As reported in prior studies, elevated alpha diversity is associated with enhanced anti-interference ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). PCA analysis results showed that oral administration of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 significantly affected the structure of the intestinal microbiota. Further analysis at the phylum/genus level revealed that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 treatment reduced the increase of <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Escherichia-Shigella</italic>, and <italic>Salmonella</italic> (harmful to intestinal homeostasis) in colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2023</xref>) but enhanced the relative abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> (known for enhancing the epithelial barrier by increasing mucus secretion and upregulating the expression of tight junction proteins such as claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kaur et al., 2021</xref>) and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> (known for modulating intestinal immune response by producing short chain fatty acids and reducing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cani et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>Bacteroides</italic> are generally ‘friendly’ commensals in the intestine, but they can enter normal tissues through the intestinal mucosa when intestinal barrier function becomes compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Polk and Kasper, 1977</xref>), leading to inflammation, diarrhea, and abdominal abscesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pickard et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Escherichia-Shigella</italic> is a common intestinal pathogen, and its relative abundance is associated with proinflammatory states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Morgan, 2013</xref>). <italic>Salmonella</italic> can secrete bacterial virulence proteins, which are directly delivered to the host cell cytosol through the Type III secretion system and induce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hardt et al., 1998</xref>), leading to inflammation. Overall, the <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium ATCC14028 infection altered the structure of the colon microbiota and raised the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria, whereas the therapeutic <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria, decreased inflammation, and 21 enhanced the function of the intestinal barrier.</p>
<p>We assessed pretreatment in order to learn more about the potential of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores for disease prevention, given the increased efficacy of treating colitis caused by S. Typhimurium. Similarly to the therapeutic effect of oral <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020, pretreatment with <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores effectively alleviated the symptoms of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium-induced colitis and reduced the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in the colon of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium-infected mice. Furthermore, pretreatment with <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores also promoted the expression levels of intestinal barrier proteins in the colon of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium-infected mice. In addition, the microbiota composition was also dramatically modulated by prophylactic <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 in mice with colitis, although the community richness and diversity revealed by the alpha diversity index were not significantly impacted in mice with colitis by prophylactic treatment. Prophylactic <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 significantly boosted SCFA-producing bacteria, including <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, according to additional genus-level analysis, which was consistent with the effects of therapeutic <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020.</p>
<p>Similarly, harmful bacteria such as <italic>Alistipes</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Escherichia-Shigella</italic>, and <italic>Enterococcus</italic> were significantly enriched in the PBS+STm group. A facultative-pathogenic bacterium called Alistipes encourages the growth of inflammation, obesity, and colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Parker et al., 2020</xref>). Based on those results, we found that prophylactic <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 alleviates <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium-induced colitis by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria, attenuating proinflammatory responses of the intestine, and increasing intestinal barrier function.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, gut mucosal barrier disruption and intestinal inflammation results from dysbiosis of the colonic microbiota caused by S. Typhimurium ATCC14028 infection. Supplementing <italic>Bacillus velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 can improve intestinal microbiota stability and gut barrier integrity and reduce inflammation to help prevent or treat bacterial colitis.</p>

<title>Biosafety assessment</title>
<p>Biosafety assay of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 referred to the method described by Zhou et al.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>) with slight modifications. After a 7-day acclimation period (free access to water and food), mice were randomly divided into four treatment groups (n = 5): low-dose <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores group (L-HBXN2020 group, 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/mouse), medium-dose <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores group (M-HBXN2020 group, 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mouse), high-dose <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores group (H-HBXN2020 group, 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/mouse), and a control group. During the experimental period (15 days), mice were weighed and orally gavaged with their respective treatments once every two days. On day 15, all mice were euthanized, and blood, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, ileum, cecum, and colon were collected. Blood samples were used for routine blood and biochemistry tests. Major organ tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney) and a 5-mm distal segment of the colon were used for histopathology. The remaining colonic tissues were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for cytokine and tight junction protein expression analysis.</p>

<title><italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium-induced mouse model of colitis</title>
<p>After 7 days of acclimation (free access to water and food), mice were randomly divided into three treatment groups (n = 8): Control group, STm + PBS group, and STm + HBXN2020 group. The <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium-induced colitis was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Stecher et al., 2005</xref>), with slight modifications. On the first day of the experiment, all mice in the STm + PBS group and STm + HBXN2020 group were orally inoculated with 200 μL (5×10<sup>7</sup> CFU/mouse) of STm. On days 1, 3 and 5 following STm infection, each mouse in the STm + HBXN2020 group received 200 μL (1×10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mouse) of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores via gavage administration. In contrast, the control group and STm + PBS group received 200 μL of sterile PBS by oral gavage. Fecal samples were collected daily following STm infection and resuspended in sterile PBS. The number of STm in mice feces from both the STm + PBS and STm + HBXN2020 groups was then determined by spreading a serial 10-fold dilution on selective LB agar plates containing 50 µg mL<sup>-1</sup> kanamycin. Throughout the entire experiment, the body weight, stool consistency and fecal occult blood of all mice were monitored daily. As shown in Table S6, disease activity index (DAI) was calculated by the sum of the scores from three parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Praveschotinunt et al., 2019</xref>). On day 7 after STm infection, all mice were euthanized, their ileum, cecum and colon were collected. The length of colon was measured, and a 5-mm distal segment of the colon was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for further histopathology. The remaining colon was then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for cytokine and tight junction protein expression analysis. Then, the number of STm in the ileum, cecum, and colon was determined by spreading serial 10-fold dilutions on selective LB agar plates.</p>
<p>To investigate the prophylactic efficacy of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 in ameliorating STm-induced colitis, another independent experiment was conducted using six-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (SPF). After a seven-day acclimation period, mice were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 8): control group, PBS + STm group and HBXN2020 + STm group. On days 1, 3, 5 and 7, each mouse in the HBXN2020 + STm group received 200 μL (1×10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mouse) of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores via gavage administration. Meanwhile, mice in the control group and PBS + STm group received 200 μL of sterile PBS by oral gavage. On day 7, all mice in the PBS + STm group and HBXN2020 + STm group were orally inoculated with 200 μL (5×10<sup>7</sup> CFU/mouse) of STm. Fecal samples were collected daily following STm infection from both groups and resuspended in sterile PBS. The number of STm in the feces of mice was then determined by spreading serial 10-fold dilutions on selective LB agar plates (50 µg mL<sup>-1</sup> kanamycin). Throughout the entire experiment, the body weight and DAI scores of all mice were monitored daily. On day 12, all mice were euthanized, and the ileum, cecum, and colon were collected. The colon length was measured, and a 5-mm distal segment of the colon was fixed in 4% formalin for sectioning and staining. The remaining colon was stored at −80°C for future analysis. Lastly, the number of STm in the ileum, cecum, and colon was determined using a selective LB agar plate.</p>

<title>Determination of cytokines and tight junction protein expression in colon tissue</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from colon tissues using TRIpure reagent (Aidlab, China), and cDNA was obtained using HiScript<sup>®</sup> III RT SuperMix for qPCR (+gDNA wiper) (Vazyme, China). RT-qPCR for each gene was performed in triplicate using qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (Yeasen Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). The relative expression level of cytokine and tight junction protein genes was calculated using the 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method with β-actin and GAPDH as reference genes. The primer sequences used in the RT-qPCR test are listed in Table S4.</p>

<title>Histopathology analysis</title>
<p>Colon tissue samples (0.5 cm) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, and the fixed tissues were then embedded in paraffin and sectioned. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and observed and imaged using an optical microscope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). The histopathological score included the degree of inflammatory infiltration, changes in crypt structures, and the presence or absence of ulceration and edema. The scoring criteria were determined as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wu et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis</title>
<p>According to the manufacturer’s instructions, colon microbial community genomes were extracted using E.Z-N.A ® Stool DNA Kit (Omega; D4015-01), and quality was detected by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The 16S rRNA V3-V4 variable region was amplified by PCR using universal primers 338F (5 ‘- ACTCCTACGGGGGGCAG-3’) and 806R (5 ‘-GACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3’). The PCR products were examined by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and then purified with the AxyPrep DNA gel extraction kit (Axygen Biosciences, USA). A sequencing library was constructed using the NEXTFLEX® Rapid DNA-Seq Kit, and sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Raw reads were quality evaluated and filtered by fastp (version 0.20.0) and merged using FLASH (version 1.2.7). The optimized sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 97% sequence similarity using UPARSE (version 7.1). The representative sequences of each OTU was classified by RDP classifier (version 2.2; confidence threshold value, 0.7). Alpha diversity was assessed using the ACE, chao, Shannon, and Simpson indices. The β-diversity analysis was performed using Bray-Curtis distances and visualized through principal component analysis (PCA). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LefSe) was used to identify differential microbiota between groups.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Wang and colleagues study the potential probiotic effects of Bacillus velezensis. Bacillus species have potential benefit to serve as probiotics due to their ability to form endospores and synthesize secondary metabolites. B. velezensis has been shown to have probiotic effects in plants and animals but data for human use are scarce, particularly with respect to salmonella-induced colitis. In this work, the authors identify a strain of B. velezensis and test it for its ability to control colitis in mice.</p>
<p>Key findings:</p>
<p>(1) The authors sequence an isolate for B. velezensis - HBXN2020 and describe its genome (roughly 4 mb, 46% GC-content etc).</p>
<p>
(2) The authors next describe the growth of this strain in broth culture and survival under acid and temperature stress. The susceptibility of HBXN2020 was tested against various antibiotics and against various pathogenic bacteria. In the case of the latter, the authors set out to determine if HBXN2020 could directly inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria. Convincing data, indicating that this is indeed the case, are presented.</p>
<p>
(3) To determine the safety profile of BHXN2020 (for possible use as a probiotic), the authors infected the strain in mice and monitored weight, together with cytokine profiles. Infected mice displayed no significant weight loss and expression of inflammatory cytokines remained unchanged. Blood cell profiles of infected mice were consistent with that of uninfected mice. No significant differences in tissues, including the colon were observed.</p>
<p>
(4) Next, the authors tested the ability to HBXN2020 to inhibit growth of Salmonella typhimurium (STm) and demonstrate that HBXN2020 inhibits STm in a dose dependent manner. Following this, the authors infect mice with STm to induce colitis and measure the ability of HBXN2020 to control colitis. The first outcome measure was a reduction in STm in faeces. Consistent with this, HBXN2020 reduced STm loads in the ileum, cecum, and colon. Colon length was also affected by HBXN2020 treatment. In addition, treatment with HBXN2020 reduced the appearance colon pathological features associated with colitis, together with a reduction in inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>
(5) After noting the beneficial (and anti-inflammatory effects) of HBXN2020, the authors set out to investigate effects on microbiota during treatment. Using a variety of algorithms, the authors demonstrate that upon HXBN2020 treatment, microbiota composition is restored to levels akin to that seen in healthy mice.</p>
<p>
(6) Finally, the authors assessed the effect of using HBXN2020 as prophylactic treatment for colitis by first treating mice with the spores and then infecting with STm. Their data indicate that treatment with HBXN2020 reduced colitis. A similar beneficial impact was seen with the gut microbiota.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Good use of in vitro and animal models to demonstrate a beneficial probiotic effect.</p>
<p>
(2) Most observations are supported using multiple approaches.</p>
<p>
(3) Mouse experiments are very convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Whilst a beneficial effect is observed, there no investigation of the mechanism that underpins this.</p>
<p>
(2) Mouse experiments would have benefited from the use of standard anti-inflammatory therapies to control colitis. That way the authors could compare their approach of using bacillus spores that current gold standard for treatment.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Wang et al. investigates the effects of B. velezensis HBXN2020 in alleviating S. Typhimurium-induced mouse colitis. The results showed that B. velezensis HBXN2020 could alleviate bacterial colitis by enhancing intestinal homeostasis (decreasing harmful bacteria and enhancing the abundance of Lactobacillus and Akkermansia) and gut barrier integrity and reducing inflammation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>B. velezensis HBXN2020 is a novel species of Bacillus that can produce a great variety of secondary metabolites and exhibit high antibacterial activity against several pathogens. B. velezensis HBXN2020 is able to form endospores and has strong anti-stress capabilities. B. velezensis HBXN2020 has a synergistic effect with other beneficial microorganisms, which can improve intestinal homeostasis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Few studies about the clinical application of Bacillus velezensis. Thus, more studies are still needed to explore the effectiveness of Bacillus velezensis before clinical application.</p>

<p>Response: Thank you very much for your reading and comments our manuscript. The <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium ATCC14028 (STm) used in this study is a highly virulent strain. The findings of the predimed trial indicated that mice infected with 107 CFU STm exhibited notable symptoms in the absence of streptomycin pretreatment.

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Wang and colleagues study the potential probiotic effects of Bacillus velezensis. Bacillus species have the potential benefit of serving as probiotics due to their ability to form endospores and synthesize secondary metabolites. B. velezensis has been shown to have probiotic effects in plants and animals but data for human use are scarce, particularly with respect to salmonella-induced colitis. In this work, the authors identify a strain of B. velezensis and test it for its ability to control colitis in mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thanks for the constructive comments and the positive reception of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Key findings:</p>
<p>(1) The authors sequence an isolate for B. velezensis - HBXN2020 and describe its genome (roughly 4 mb, 46% GC-content etc).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thanks for the constructive comments and the positive reception of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors next describe the growth of this strain in broth culture and survival under acid and temperature stress. The susceptibility of HBXN2020 was tested against various antibiotics and against various pathogenic bacteria. In the case of the latter, the authors set out to determine if HBXN2020 could directly inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria. Convincing data, indicating that this is indeed the case, are presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thanks for the constructive comments and the positive reception of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) To determine the safety profile of BHXN2020 (for possible use as a probiotic), the authors infected the strain in mice and monitored weight, together with cytokine profiles. Infected mice displayed no significant weight loss and expression of inflammatory cytokines remained unchanged. Blood cell profiles of infected mice were consistent with that of uninfected mice. No significant differences in tissues, including the colon were observed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thanks for the constructive comments and the positive reception of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Next, the authors tested the ability of HBXN2020 to inhibit the growth of Salmonella typhimurium (STm) and demonstrate that HBXN2020 inhibits STm in a dose-dependent manner. Following this, the authors infect mice with STm to induce colitis and measure the ability of HBXN2020 to control colitis. The first outcome measure was a reduction in STm in faeces. Consistent with this, HBXN2020 reduced STm loads in the ileum, cecum, and colon. Colon length was also affected by HBXN2020 treatment. In addition, treatment with HBXN2020 reduced the appearance of colon pathological features associated with colitis, together with a reduction in inflammatory cytokines.</p>

<p>Response: Thanks for the constructive comments and the positive reception of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) After noting the beneficial (and anti-inflammatory effects) of HBXN2020, the authors set out to investigate the effects on microbiota during treatment. Using a variety of algorithms, the authors demonstrate that upon HXBN2020 treatment, microbiota composition is restored to levels akin to that seen in healthy mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thanks for the constructive comments and the positive reception of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Finally, the authors assessed the effect of using HBXN2020 as prophylactic treatment for colitis by first treating mice with the spores and then infecting them with STm. Their data indicate that treatment with HBXN2020 reduced colitis. A similar beneficial impact was seen with the gut microbiota.</p>

<p>Response:  Thanks for your suggestion. The comments improve the quality and depth of manuscript. In this study, the HBXN2020 genome contains fragments of AMR and virulence genes. However, the results of antibiotic sensitivity test and safety test showed that HBXN2020 did not exhibit resistance and toxicity. Furthermore, the HBXN2020 genome contains 13 different clusters of secondary metabolic synthesis genes. such as surfactin (genomic position: 323,509), macrolactin H (genomic position: 1,384,185), bacillaene (genomic position: 1,691,549), fengycin (genomic position: 1,865,856), difficidin (genomic position: 2,270,091), bacillibactin (genomic position: 3,000,977) and Bacilysin (genomic position: 3,589,078) (Table S2). These secondary metabolites have been shown to have varying degrees of inhibition on fungi (10.3390/foods11020140), Gram-positive pathogens (10.1371/journal.pone.0251514) and Gram-negative pathogens (10.1007/s00253-017-8095-x).

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) In Figure 2, the authors make the argument that the increased survival of Bacillus spores at high temperatures and low pH renders the strain useful as a probiotic as it would survive in the gut. However, the gut temperature is not significantly higher than the rest of the body (certainly not 95 degrees). One assumes the pH argument applies to surviving in stomach acid so that spores can travel to the gut. These conclusions should be clarified/revised. The survival in bile salts gastric fluid etc makes more sense.</p>
