<title>Abstract</title><p>Meiotic recombination is an important evolutionary force that acts by breaking up genomic linkage, thereby increasing the efficacy of selection. Meiotic recombination is initiated with a double-strand break which is resolved via a crossover, which involves the reciprocal exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, or a non-crossover, which results in small tracts of non-reciprocal exchange of genetic material. While the meiotic process is largely conserved, crossover and non-crossover rates vary between species, populations, individuals, and across the genome. In recent years, recombination is observed to be positively associated with the distribution of ancestry derived from past interspecific hybridization (introgression) in a variety of species. This trend has been interpreted to signify that introgression carries genetic incompatibilities that are selected against, such that introgression is enriched in regions of high recombination. However, recombination is well known to be suppressed in divergent sequence to prevent non-homologous recombination. Since introgressed DNA is often divergent, we sought to explore this interaction of recombination and introgression by sequencing spores and detecting crossover and non-crossover events from two crosses of the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces uvarum</italic>. One cross is between strains isolated from natural environments, and the other cross is between strains from fermentation environments, in which each strain contains introgression from their sister species, <italic>S. eubayanus</italic>. We find that the recombination landscape is significantly different between <italic>S. uvarum</italic> crosses, and that most of these differences can be explained by the presence of heterozygous introgression in the fermentation cross. Crossovers are significantly reduced and non-crossovers are increased in heterozygous introgression compared to syntenic regions in the natural cross without introgression. This translates to reduced allele shuffling within introgressed regions, and an overall reduction of shuffling on most chromosomes with introgression compared to the syntenic regions and chromosomes without introgression. Our results indicate that recent hybridization can significantly influence the recombination landscape, and suggest that the reduction in allele shuffling contributes to the initial purging of introgressed ancestry in the generations following a hybridization event.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recombination is the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during meiosis and is a staple of eukaryotic sexual reproduction. While the processes involved in recombination are largely conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arter &amp; Keeney, 2023</xref>), recombination rates vary between sexes, populations, and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Smukowski &amp; Noor, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Stapley et al., 2017</xref>). Recombination rates also vary along the genome, with conflicting patterns of enriched or depleted recombination in promoter regions and punctate or dispersed recombination depending on the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Auton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rockman &amp; Kruglyak, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Singhal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Smukowski Heil et al., 2015</xref>). These patterns in recombination can affect pairing of alleles after meiosis–in other words, the shuffling of alleles–in a population. Much of the evolutionary advantage of recombination is understood to originate from its role in shuffling alleles, which increases the number of different allele combinations segregating in a population. The increase in allele combinations can reduce selection interference–the effect that genetically linked sites have on the evolutionary fate of either beneficial or deleterious alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Felsenstein, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hill &amp; Robertson, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">McDonald et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">McGaugh et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>How much allele decoupling is produced by recombination will depend on the type of recombination event. Each recombination event begins with the severing of both strands of a sister chromatid of one of the homologous chromosomes in what is referred to as a double-strand break (DSB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Keeney, 2001</xref>). The distribution of DSBs is influenced by a variety of factors, many of which are organism-dependent, but often include decreases of DSBs near telomeres and centromeres as well as increases in genomic regions enriched for GC content, CpG sites, and depleted of methylation (CpG islands) and near promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">de Massy, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lam &amp; Keeney, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zelkowski et al., 2019</xref>). When a DSB occurs, the homologous strand is recruited to repair the break, and during this process genetic information is exchanged. The most evident and widely studied resolution of a DSB is a crossover (CO), where all the genetic information on one side of the DSB from one homologous chromosome is spliced with all the genetic information on the other side of the DSB from the other homologous chromosome. DSB resolution can also involve gene conversions–or non-crossovers (NCOs)– which result in one small segment (typically 100-2000 bp) of a homologous chromosome’s genetic information being copied onto the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chovnick et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hilliker et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jeffreys &amp; May, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Judd &amp; Petes, 1988</xref>). DSBs can be resolved through both of these processes in a single instance, and even more than one NCO can occur at a single break point. Each possible resolution can produce a variety of genetic patterns at the site of a DSB. COs generally produce more allele shuffling, and therefore degrade linkage faster than NCOs, because they recombine all loci from one side of the event with all loci on the other side. However, NCOs can occur in regions where COs are typically suppressed, like centromeres and inversions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Korunes &amp; Noor, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mancera et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Miller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Schaeffer &amp; Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Shi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Talbert &amp; Henikoff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wijnker et al., 2013</xref>). NCOs are also crucial to reducing linkage within coding regions and, unlike COs, result in 3:1 allele ratio in the meiotic product at heterozygous sites, potentially changing allele frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Korunes &amp; Noor, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The number of DSBs that occur per meiosis varies by species, as does the number of DSBs that are repaired as COs or NCOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">de Massy, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Korunes &amp; Noor, 2017</xref>). In Arabidopsis and maize, several hundred DSBs are resolved into only a handful of COs, whereas in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> the CO:NCO ratio is close to 2:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Choi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mancera et al., 2008</xref>). How CO:NCO resolution may be evolving is not well understood, but evidence from <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> suggests that the DSB landscape is well conserved across species, while recombination rates significantly differ between sister species <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lam &amp; Keeney, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests that alternate resolution of DSBs may be important in altering recombination rates between closely related species. This is further supported by the finding that several genes involved in the CO vs. NCO decision of DSB resolution show evidence of rapid evolution and directional selection in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Dapper &amp; Payseur, 2019</xref>), and that some of these genes are linked to variation in recombination rates within and between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brand et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Murdoch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Yang et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Variation in the number and distribution of COs and NCOs, and their respective associated effects on linkage, have important implications for molecular evolution. Recombination has long been appreciated to play a role in the distribution of various genomic features including nucleotide diversity. Nucleotide diversity has a positive correlation with recombination rate in a number of species, interpreted to result from selective sweeps and background selection removing genetic variation in regions of low recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Begun &amp; Aquadro, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Charlesworth et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Smith &amp; Haigh, 1974</xref>). Similarly, recombination breaking up genetic associations is particularly notable in the context of interspecific hybridization. In first-generation (F<sub>1</sub>) hybrids, each set of homologous chromosomes is composed of sister chromatids carrying genetic information from one of the parents. Since no recombination has physically separated any alleles on the chromosome at the hybrid F<sub>1</sub> stage, each parent’s genetic contribution is perfectly linked. If the hybrids then back-cross to one of the parental populations, recombination will produce genomes that are a mosaic of genetic information from the two populations (introgression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aguillon et al., 2022</xref>). Recombination drives the pattern of fragmentation in the introgressed regions over time, and therefore plays an important role in the distribution of introgressed DNA in a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barton &amp; Bengtsson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Butlin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Moran et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Nachman Michael W. &amp; Payseur Bret A., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Schumer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Veller et al., 2023</xref>). When each population has evolved alleles that are deleterious when present in the background of the other population (the Dobzhansky-Muller hybrid incompatibility model) we expect introgressed regions with low rates of recombination to be quickly purged from the population, as the accumulation of incompatible alleles incurs a steep fitness cost. In contrast, when introgressed regions have high recombination rates, the break up of genetic associations will reduce selective interference between the incompatible alleles and their surrounding haplotypes, allowing for neutral and beneficial alleles brought in with the introgression to escape the fate of neighboring incompatibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Moran et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Schumer et al., 2018</xref>). This theory is supported empirically through enrichment of introgressed segments in regions of higher recombination in a number of organisms including Mimulus, maize, butterflies, swordtail fish, stickleback, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brandvain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Calfee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Edelman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Martin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ravinet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Schumer et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>This positive correlation between introgressed ancestry and recombination is emerging as a nearly ubiquitous pattern (though see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dagilis &amp; Matute, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Duranton &amp; Pool, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pool, 2015</xref>)), however, it is unclear how these observations relate to the known effect of sequence divergence on DSB resolution. Introgression, particularly between highly diverged species, can have low sequence homology with the genomic region it is replacing. A DSB in a region of low homology will recruit mismatch repair proteins, which ensure COs are occurring between homologous chromosomes and at equivalent positions to prevent ectopic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Harfe &amp; Jinks-Robertson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hunter et al., 1996</xref>). Mismatch repair proteins reduce the frequency of CO events as sequence divergence increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chen &amp; Jinks-Robertson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cooper et al., 2021</xref>; L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Welz-Voegele &amp; Jinks-Robertson, 2008</xref>). Given that heterozygous introgression will have divergent sequences, we expect a decrease in COs, and possibly an increase in NCOs as DSBs fail to be resolved as COs in introgressed regions.</p>
<p>To help us understand this interaction of introgression and recombination, and identify patterns in CO and NCO in closely related populations, we utilized the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>. Yeasts provide an excellent opportunity to study DSB resolution, as we can readily isolate and collect all four meiotic products of a given meiosis and detect both CO and more elusive NCO events (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brion et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gerton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Liu et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mancera et al., 2008</xref>). Recombination rates vary between strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cubillos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Raffoux et al., 2018</xref>) and between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and its sister species <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Tsai et al., 2010</xref>). Strains of different <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> species have often hybridized with other species and carry introgressed DNA from these events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Albertin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Almeida et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bendixsen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">D’Angiolo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Langdon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Stelkens &amp; Bendixsen, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Tellini et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>(A) Visual representation of each of our crosses. Yeast from each of the parental strains of a cross are induced to go through meiosis to generate haploids of each mating type. Subsequently, they are mated, and their diploid offspring are induced to enter meiosis. The resulting tetrads are manually dissected, and each haploid meiotic product is grown mitotically to obtain enough material for DNA extraction and whole genome sequencing. We then call SNPs on the resulting sequences and retain loci with fixed differences between parents. These loci are then coded as 1 or 0 depending on the parent of origin and the CrossOver software detects COs and NCOs. (B) The introgressions we observe in our crosses are due to S. eubayanus hybridizing with S. uvarum, resulting in F1 hybrids that then potentially crossed with other S. uvarum individuals for some number of generations. Eventually, the S. eubayanus ancestry was degraded in the population of S. uvarum until the introgressions we observe today remained, potentially segregating in the population. A similar process likely happened in each of the parental strains we utilized, but with different introgressions remaining in each strain. We then crossed individuals from each strain that were homozygous for the introgression, resulting in offspring that were heterozygous for each introgression. It’s important to note that due to the life cycle of Saccharomyces, mitotic recombination likely played an important role in the breakdown of introgressions.</p></caption>

<p>In this study, we look at patterns of recombination and introgression at the population level by crossing two pairs of Holarctic <italic>Saccharomyces uvarum</italic> strains. One pair of strains was isolated from natural environments in North America and the other pair was isolated from European fermentation environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Almeida et al., 2014</xref>). The <italic>S. uvarum</italic> strains isolated from European fermentation environments each carry introgression from their sister species, <italic>Saccharomyces eubayanus</italic>, which is approximately 6% divergent from <italic>S. uvarum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Almeida et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Langdon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Nespolo et al., 2020</xref>). The diploid F<sub>1</sub> genome of these strains is heterozygous for nine different introgressions which make up approximately 10% of the genome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The strains from the North American cross do not carry <italic>S. eubayanus</italic> introgression, thus allowing us to assess the impact of introgression on the recombination landscape. We obtained whole genome sequencing data from individual meiotic events from the first offspring generation of each cross and used this data to detect CO and NCO events along the genome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). From these maps, we aim to understand (i) how patterns of CO and NCO differ between closely related strains, (ii) how regions of introgression differ in their CO and NCO patterns, and (iii) how these different patterns affect shuffling of alleles locally and at the chromosome level. Understanding these objectives will provide us novel insights into how introgression impacts the recombination landscape.</p>

<p><italic>S. uvarum</italic> strains (UCD61-137, yHCT78, GM14, and DBVPG7787) were obtained from the Portuguese Yeast Culture Collection and from Chris Hittinger (Table S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Almeida et al., 2014</xref>). All four <italic>S. uvarum</italic> strains had their <italic>HO</italic> locus replaced with a kanMX marker using a modified version of the high-efficiency yeast transformation using the LiAc/SS carrier DNA/PEG method. Briefly, the kanMX marker was amplified from plasmid pCSH2 with homology to genomic DNA flanking the HO ORF with primers CSH239 (GGTGGAAAACCACGAAAAGTTAGAACTACGTTCAGGCAAAgacatggaggcccagaatac) and CSH241 (GTGACCGTATTGGTACTTTTTTTGTTACCTGTTTTAGTAGcagtatagcgaccagcattc). For each strain, overnight cultures were inoculated in 25 mL of YPD at an OD of ∼ 0.0005 and incubated at room temperature on a shaker for ∼24 hours until the cultures reached an OD between 0.6 and 0.9. Subsequently, 1 ug of the template DNA was transformed with a heat shock temperature of 37°C for 45 minutes. The transformed cells were allowed to recover in liquid YPD for 4 hours before being plated onto G418 selective plates and incubated at room temperature for 2 days.</p>
<p>Single colonies were selected from the transformation plates, restreaked onto G418 plates and allowed to grow at room temperature for 2 days. Single colonies from those plates were then inoculated into 2 mL of YPD + G418 and incubated in a roller drum at room temperature overnight. From those cultures, 250 uL was used to inoculate 2 mL of sporulation media (1% potassium acetate, 0.1 % yeast extract, 0.05% dextrose) and incubated at room temperature for 3 to 5 days. Strains were confirmed to have the ho::KanMX via tetrad dissection on a Singer SporPlay+ microscope (Singer Instruments). Plates with tetrads were incubated at room temperature for 2 days and then replica plated to test for proper segregation of the kanMX marker and mating type within individual tetrads.</p>
<p>Crosses between strains UCD61-137 and yHCT78 (natural cross), and between strains GM14 and DBVPG7787 (fermentation cross) were set up by micromanipulation of single MATa and MATx cells using a Singer SporPlay+. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 days and then replica plated to mating type tester strains to test for potential diploids. Identified diploids were then sporulated by growing a culture of the cross in 2 mL YPD + G418 at room temperature overnight. From those cultures, 250 uL were used to inoculate 2 mL of sporulation media and incubated at room temperature for 3 to 5 days. Sporulated cultures were dissected on 3 YPD plates (24 tetrads per plate) using a Singer SporPlay+. Fifty of the fully viable tetrads were selected and had all their spores inoculated into YPD (200 spores total) and incubated at room temperature. The DNA was extracted from these cultures using a modified version of the Hoffman-Winston DNA Prep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hoffman &amp; Winston, 1987</xref>). The DNA concentration was then measured using SYBR green, and 150 ng of each sample’s DNA was used to prepare a sequencing library using an Illumina DNA Prep Kit, modified to use half the normal amounts of reagents. Libraries were pooled and run on an Illumina NovaSeq 500 with 150bp paired end reads.</p>

We further filtered variants by requiring they be fixed differences between the two parental strains. We kept a total of 24,574 markers for the natural cross and 74,619 markers for the fermentation cross. We utilized LUMPY to identify structural variants in the parent strains that were greater than 5000 bp and verified calls using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Layer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>).

<title>Generating CO/NCO maps</title>
<p>We generated “seg” files by coding tetrad variants by their parental origin. These seg files were the input for CrossOver (v6.3) from the ReCombine suite of programs, which we used to detect COs and NCOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>). We then filtered to remove non-crossovers with fewer than three associated markers and split the genome into 20kb windows. In each window we counted crossovers, non-crossovers, and markers. We established regions of introgressions through visual inspection of marker density in the fermentation cross (introgressions showed more divergence between fermentation strains) and confirmed them using the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Almeida et al. (2014)</xref>. We found nine heterozygous introgressions on chromosomes 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 10, 13, 14, and 15 respectively that we included in further analyses (Table S3). We excluded two additional introgressions due to poor mapping (chromosome 13:0-17,000; chromosome 16: 642,000-648,000). To account for the difference in number of markers in introgressed vs non-introgressed windows and their effect on NCO detection, we applied a previously published simulation-based method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wijnker et al., 2013</xref>). Choosing an average NCO tract length of 2kb, we simulated 1000 NCO events per window to establish our expected probability of detecting an NCO event in that window. We then divided our observed NCO count by our probability of detecting an NCO event. COs that occurred in large regions devoid of markers would be called in the middle of the empty windows. We decided to deal with this by splitting CO counts in regions with multiple consecutive windows without markers evenly between the empty windows. With these corrected maps, we calculated spearman correlations between crosses using R (v4.1.0, R Core Team 2021). Additionally, we modeled NCO and CO count as a function of introgression, introgression by cross, and GC content using a gaussian generalized linear model in R (v4.1.0, R Core Team 2021).</p>

<title>Homology</title>
<p>We calculated homology between the two fermentation cross strains in 51bp windows with 25bp overlaps. At each nucleotide position in the window, we counted fixed differences as zero homology, invariant sites between strains as full homology (1), and polymorphic sites in either or both strains as half homology (0.5). We then averaged these homology values across the window. This measure represents the probability that both strains will have the same nucleotide base at a given position. We used this measure of fine-scale homology to determine how homology related to NCO counts in introgressed regions. For this, we used Loess regressions and Spearman’s correlations on each of the introgressed regions comparing homology to NCO count, both implemented in R (v4.1.0, R Core Team 2021). We then focused on each recombination event (CO or NCO) and compared the homology 100bp up and downstream of CO breakpoints and 100bp up and downstream of NCO tracts. We then used Welch’s two sample t-tests to compare CO and NCO homology in each introgression.

<title>The recombination landscape differs dramatically between closely related crosses</title>
<p>We isolated and sequenced products of 48 meioses (192 haploid spores) for two crosses of <italic>S. uvarum</italic>, a cross between strains isolated from North America (natural cross) and a cross between strains isolated from Europe (fermentation cross). We detected COs and NCOs across the 16 nuclear chromosomes of <italic>S. uvarum</italic>. Genomewide, we found significantly more COs on average in the natural cross (82.54 COs/meiosis, SE 1.5; 0.72 cM/kb) than in the fermentation cross (63.66 COs/meiosis, SE 1.9; 0.55 cM/kb) but no significant difference when comparing the average number of NCOs between the natural cross (60.44 NCOs/meiosis, SE 2.7) and the fermentation cross (68.1 NCOs/meiosis, SE 12.47). The number of COs per meiosis in the natural and fermentation crosses are slightly higher than those of <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> (54.8) and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (76.5) respectively, but both crosses have NCO averages higher than those of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (46.4) and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> (26.9) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; Tables S4 &amp; S5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Liu et al. 2019</xref>).

<p>To further explore the differences in recombination landscapes between our crosses, we split the genome into 20kb, non-overlapping windows, and obtained CO, NCO, and marker counts for each region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). We corrected for differences in marker resolution between crosses (see Methods). We found modest, but significant genomewide correlation between our crosses for both COs (Spearman’s correlation: 0.273; p&lt;0.0001) and NCOs (Spearman’s correlation: 0.1456; p&lt;0.001). Again, these correlations were unexpectedly lower than those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Liu et al. (2019)</xref> between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> (0.48 for COs and 0.17 for NCOs).</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the low correlations between crosses might be impacted by the presence of heterozygous introgression from <italic>S. eubayanus</italic> in the fermentation cross. To explore this possibility, we separated the 20kb windows into introgressed and non-introgressed windows (based on whether they overlapped with an introgressed region). We will refer to introgression in the fermentation cross as “introgression” and use the term “introgressed region” to refer generally to the syntenic region, regardless of which cross we are focusing on. We calculated Spearman’s correlations of COs, NCOs, and marker counts between the two crosses for each chromosome. We find positive correlations between CO counts for all chromosomes when looking at non-introgressed regions (though some were not significant; Table S6). For introgressed regions, we found no significant CO correlations between crosses, which is consistent with the hypothesis that CO landscapes are changed in introgression (Table S7). There was one significant, highly positive correlation among NCOs (chromosome 1), but all other correlations were not significant. This was likely affected by the fact that markers used to detect NCOs are very differently distributed between the crosses, and the small size of NCO tracts means regions with more markers tend to reveal more NCOs.</p>
<p>We find that introgressions tend to have lower CO counts and higher NCO counts in the fermentation cross when compared to syntenic regions in the natural cross. The fermentation cross has fewer COs than the natural cross overall, but the difference is greater in the introgressed regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-C</xref>). To further explore and test possible explanations for the patterns of COs and NCOs in introgressed regions, we constructed linear models for CO and NCO counts. Our model of CO counts showed a significant positive effect of the interactions between natural cross and introgression (whether a genomic window is from the natural cross and whether that window is in an introgressed region), as well as a significant negative effect of introgression on the number of COs, and a significant positive effect of GC content on CO count (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). These results are consistent with increased COs in GC-rich regions and reduced COs in introgressions. Our linear model of NCO counts showed a similar positive effect of GC content on NCO counts, but showed opposite significant coefficients for the other two explanatory variables (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This indicates that GC content still plays an important role in localizing NCOs, and supports our findings that patterns of NCOs in introgressed regions are opposite to those of COs.</p>

<title>Reduced sequence homology helps explain non-crossover resolution of DSBs in introgressions</title>
<p>One possible explanation for an increase of NCOs in introgressions is that the reduced homology is biasing DSBs in the region to be resolved as NCOs rather than COs. We would therefore expect to see NCOs to be negatively correlated with homology. To evaluate the relationship of homology to the CO and NCO landscapes in introgressions, we measured homology, NCO depth, and CO count in 101 bp sliding windows along each of the introgressions. Mismatch repair proteins in <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> seem to suppress COs with very little mismatch in small regions (∼350 bp), which informed our window size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chen &amp; Jinks-Robertson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Datta et al., 1997</xref>). We counted the number of NCO tracts that intersect with each window as a measurement of NCO depth, and simply counted the CO events in a given window. We measured homology in the sliding windows by measuring the proportion of bases that are expected to match between the two parent strains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). We then ran Spearman’s correlations and a loess regression along each introgression and found a weak, but often significant (p&lt;&lt;0.001) correlation between NCOs and homology in the introgression (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that resolution of double strand breaks is biased towards NCOs when homology is low. From the loess regression, we can observe an increase in NCO as homology reduces until about 0.9-0.8 homology, at which point NCOs level out or reduce. However, this effect is very weak with respect to the NCO counts, and at low levels of homology the uncertainty of the regression line is very large. This is primarily driven by the number of windows with no NCOs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Introgression decreases allele shuffling locally and at the chromosome level</title>
<p>Because NCOs still play a small role in shuffling alleles along the chromosome, we were interested in whether the increase in NCOs of the fermentation cross would supplement the lost shuffling from the suppression of COs in the introgressions. To test this hypothesis, we used the measure <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="574263v1_inline15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, which accounts for the number and positioning of recombination events to estimate the probability that a randomly chosen pair of loci shuffles their alleles in a gamete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Veller et al., 2019</xref>). We calculated the average <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="574263v1_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> per chromosome and for each introgressed region for each of the two crosses. We observed high levels of shuffling at the chromosome level when compared to humans. The intra-chromosomal component of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="574263v1_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> in humans is 0.0135 in females and 0.0177 in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Veller et al., 2019</xref>), while our measurements for chromosomes varied between 0.216 and 0.426. We find that most chromosomes do not have a significantly different amount of allele shuffling between the two crosses, even though the natural cross generally has more COs (Table S8; Bonferroni-adjusted <italic>α</italic> = 0.00313). However, of the six chromosomes with significantly different <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="574263v1_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> values, all of them showed more shuffling in the natural cross, and five of the six (chromosomes 4, 9, 10, 14, and 15) contained introgressed regions (Figure 5).</p>
<p>Chromosome 12 was the only chromosome without an introgressed region to have significantly different shuffling between crosses, and it also showed more shuffling in the natural cross. All of the introgressed regions showed significantly more shuffling in the natural cross, indicating that the large increase of NCOs in the introgressions does not make up for the loss of shuffling from the depletion of COs (Table S9; Bonferroni-adjusted <italic>α</italic> = 0.00556). This finding indicates that an introgression that is segregating in a population will incur a shuffling cost in heterozygous individuals on top of any other evolutionary effects the introgression may have.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study is motivated by understanding recombination rate variation within a species and uncovering potential genetic factors underlying this variation. To investigate this question, we crossed two pairs of <italic>S. uvarum</italic> strains, one pair isolated from natural environments and one pair from fermentation environments, and explored the distribution of CO and NCO events from both crosses. We found a similar range of COs per meiosis as previous studies in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mancera et al., 2008</xref>). The number of NCOs detected, however, was considerably higher, despite having less sequence differences between strains in each of our crosses and therefore lower genomic resolution for detection. We also detected more COs and fewer NCOs in our natural cross when compared to our fermentation cross.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that these differences in the recombination landscape were influenced by introgression, given that heterozygous introgression creates sequence divergence, and that COs in regions of lower homology are known to be curtailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chen &amp; Jinks-Robertson 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Li et al. 2006</xref>, Weltz-Voegele &amp; Jinks-Robertson 2008, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cooper et al. 2021</xref>). We therefore explored the relationship between introgressions and the differences in CO and NCO counts between crosses. Our correlations between crosses, though mostly not significant, pointed to more CO distribution differences in introgressed regions than in the rest of the genome. When we then modeled CO and NCO locations, correcting for GC content (a well characterized driver of recombination events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kiktev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Marsolier-Kergoat &amp; Yeramian, 2009</xref>)), we found that the distribution of COs and NCOs we observed was well explained by introgressions. While we are limited in our interpretations by only comparing two crosses (one cross with heterozygous introgression and one without introgression), these results are in line with findings in inversions, where heterozygotes show sharp decreases in COs and an increase in NCOs in the inverted region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Crown et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Korunes &amp; Noor, 2019</xref>). However, unlike heterozygous inversions where an increase in COs is observed on freely recombining chromosomes (the inter-chromosomal effect), we do not see an increase in COs outside of introgression or on chromosomes without introgression.</p>
<p>One likely effect of this CO reduction is a reduction in shuffling at the regional and chromosomal level. While NCOs can increase local shuffling, they likely have a much weaker effect on the likelihood of two random alleles being shuffled than COs do. We find this is the case for our two crosses, where despite a large number of NCOs in introgressions, the amount of shuffling (as measured by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="574263v1_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>) is significantly lower in the fermentation cross. This loss of shuffling translates to frequently lower <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="574263v1_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> in the fermentation cross at the chromosome level for chromosomes containing introgressions. Lower <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="574263v1_inline13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is not observed when introgressions are small and near telomeres, while even a small introgression near the center of the chromosome can lead to a large reduction in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="574263v1_inline14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (as is the case for chromosome 15). This is consistent with the expectation that COs near the center of chromosomes generate much more shuffling of alleles than terminal COs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Veller et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings indicate that reducing COs, especially near the center of chromosomes, has a cost to shuffling that is not compensated by the increase of NCOs that we observe. If the benefit of recombination is its ability to generate new combinations of alleles, then the loss of shuffling resulting from being heterozygous for divergent DNA sequences may come at an additional cost beyond the possibilities of genetic incompatibilities between hybridizing species. This cost is likely higher as divergence increases and as the length of divergent sequences is greater, as is the case with early generation hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dagilis &amp; Matute, 2023</xref>). Ultimately, if sequence divergence is too high, the resultant failure to recombine can become a postzygotic reproductive barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bozdag et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hunter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Rogers et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The shuffling cost to introgression that we identify in our crosses may play an important role in the fate of introgression in the generations following hybridization. When heterozygotes for an introgression are formed, the reduction in shuffling inside the introgression will increase the likelihood that the introgression is purged from the population. This is because it will likely be inherited in its entirety and will carry the fitness cost of incompatibilities combined with a cost of shuffling. This cost is incurred because the reduction of COs in the introgression will reduce shuffling of alleles on either side of it and will vary in its intensity depending on the location and size of the introgression. In generations immediately following hybridization, introgressions will be much larger and are therefore expected to be more costly (although this likely depends on a number of factors including time since divergence). These predictions are consistent with modeling and empirical data on the purging of introgression in Drosophila and humans in the first generations following hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Veller et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>As to longer term dynamics of recombination and selection, we predict that the excess NCOs detected in heterozygous introgressions should begin to erode the divergence between the sequences, increasing homology and slowly reducing the cost of the introgression. This hypothesis posits that recombination can act to remove the larger, more deleterious regions of an introgression quickly while whittling away slightly deleterious alleles that may be linked to any beneficial regions of an introgression. However, in our current study, we are limited by only observing one generation of sexual reproduction between two pairs of strains. This means that we don’t capture longer term patterns of recombination or the landscape of recombination in introgressions that are segregating in a population. Consequently, our findings do not reflect the effects of long-term selection (and hypothesized degradation of sequence divergence through NCO) that would lead to introgressions preferentially remaining in high-CO regions, as has been observed in other organisms. Furthermore, <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> typically reproduce asexually, with only infrequent sexual cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Magwene et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Ruderfer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zeyl &amp; Otto, 2007</xref>). When they do mate, they often mate within a tetrad resulting in increased homozygosity. For example, each diploid progenitor of the parents of our fermentation cross was homozygous for introgression across the genome, meaning that recombination would neither break up nor aid in purging the introgression in isolated populations of each parent. This suggests that the fate of introgressions in this species is perhaps more loosely tied to recombination patterns than it would be in an obligately sexually reproducing species.</p>
<p>Despite some limitations to interpretation, this study provides a unique view of the early dynamics of hybridization and the role of recombination in the presence of introgression. By focusing not only on the distribution of recombination events but on their specific role in shuffling alleles, we can more closely connect the physical process of recombination to its role among other evolutionary forces.</p>

<p>The authors provide <bold>useful</bold> information, confirming previous observations that heterologous sequecnes affect crossing-over frequency. Surprisingly, they conclude that heterozygous introgressed regions, with greater levels of heterology, have greater noncrossover levels than non-introgressed regions with much lower levels of heterology. As the evidence for this conclusion is <bold>incomplete</bold> and potentially biased, the significance of these findings relative to previous knowledge in the field remains to be determined.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigated how the presence of interspecific introgressions in the genome affects the recombination landscape. This research was intended to inform about genetic phenomena influencing the evolution of introgressed regions, although it should be noted that the research itself is based on examining only one generation, which limits the possibility of drawing far-reaching evolutionary conclusions. In this work, yeast hybrids with large (from several to several dozen percent of the chromosome length) introgressions from another yeast species were crossed. Then, the products of meiosis were isolated and sequenced, and on this basis, the genome-wide distribution of both crossovers (COs) and noncrossovers (NCOs) was examined. Carrying out the analysis at different levels of resolution, it was found that in the regions of introduction, there is a very significant reduction in the frequency of COs and a simultaneous increase in the frequency of NCOs. Moreover, it was confirmed that introgressions significantly limit the local shuffling of genetic information, and NCOs are only able to slightly contribute to the shuffling, thus they do not compensate for the loss of CO recombination.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Previously, experiments examining the impact of SNP polymorphism on meiotic recombination were conducted either on the scale of single hotspots or the entire hybrid genome, but the impact of large introgressed regions from another species was not examined. Therefore, the strength of this work is its interesting research setup, which allows for providing data from a different perspective.</p>
<p>- Good quality genome-wide data on the distribution of CO and NCO were obtained, which could be related to local changes in the level of polymorphism.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The research is based on examining only one generation, which limits the possibility of drawing far-reaching evolutionary conclusions. Moreover, meiosis is stimulated in hybrids in which introgressions occur in a heterozygous state, which is a very unlikely situation in nature. Therefore, I see the main value of the work in providing information on the CO/NCO decision in regions with high sequence diversification, but not in the context of evolution.</p>
<p>- The work requires greater care in preparing informative figures and, more importantly, re-analysis of some of the data (see comments below).</p>
<p>More specific comments:</p>
<p>- The authors themselves admit that the detection of NCO, due to the short size of conversion tracts, depends on the density of SNPs in a given region. Consequently, more NCOs will be detected in introgressed regions with a high density of polymorphisms compared to the rest of the genome. To investigate what impact this has on the analysis, the authors should demonstrate that the efficiency of detecting NCOs in introgressed regions is not significantly higher than the efficiency of detecting NCOs in the rest of the genome. If it turns out that this impact is significant, analyses should be presented proving that it does not entirely explain the increase in the frequency of NCOs in introgressed regions.</p>
<p>- CO and NCO analyses performed separately for individual regions rarely show statistical significance (Figures 3 and 4). I think that the authors, after dividing the introgressed regions into non-overlapping windows of 100 bp (I suggest also trying 200 bp, 500 bp, and 1kb windows), should combine the data for all regions and perform correlations to SNP density in each window for the whole set of data. Such an analysis has a greater chance of demonstrating statistically significant relationships. This could replace the analysis presented in Figure 3 (which can be moved to Supplement). Moreover, the analysis should also take into account indels.</p>
<p>- In Arabidopsis, it has been shown that crossover is stimulated in heterozygous regions that are adjacent to homozygous regions on the same chromosome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03708.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03708.001</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-</ext-link> 022-35722-3). This effect applies only to class I crossovers, and is reversed for class II crossovers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2020104858">https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2020104858</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-42511-z">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-42511-z</ext-link>). This research system is very similar to the system used by the authors, although it likely differs in the level of DNA sequence divergence. The authors could discuss their work in this context.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Schwartzkopf et al characterized the meiotic recombination impact of highly heterozygous introgressed regions within the budding yeast Saccharomyces uvarum, a close relative of the canonical model Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To do so, they took advantage of the naturally occurring Saccharomyces bayanus introgressions specifically within fermentation isolates of S. uvarum and compared their behavior to the syntenic regions of a cross between natural isolates that do not contain such introgressions. Analysis of crossover (CO) and noncrossover (NCO) recombination events shows both a depletion in CO frequency within highly heterozygous introgressed regions and an increase in NCO frequency. These results strongly support the hypothesis that DNA sequence polymorphism inhibits CO formation, and has no or much weaker effects on NCO formation. Eventually, the authors show that the presence of introgressions negatively impacts &quot;r&quot;, the parameter that reflects the probability that a randomly chosen pair of loci shuffles their alleles in a gamete.</p>
<p>The authors chose a sound experimental setup that allowed them to directly compare recombination properties of orthologous syntenic regions in an otherwise intra-specific genetic background. The way the analyses have been performed looks right, although this reviewer is unable to judge the relevance of the statistical tests used. Eventually, most of their results which are elegant and of interest to the community are present in Figure 2.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Analysis of crossover (CO) and noncrossover (NCO) recombination events is compelling in showing both a depletion in CO frequency within highly heterozygous introgressed regions and an increase in NCO frequency.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weaknesses refer to a few text issues and a lack of discussion about the mechanistic implications of the present findings.</p>
<p>- Introduction</p>
<p>The introduction is rather long. I suggest specifically referring to &quot;meiotic&quot; recombination (line 71) and to &quot;meiotic&quot; DSBs (line 73) since recombination can occur outside of meiosis (ie somatic cells).</p>
<p>From lines 79 to 87: the description of recombination is unnecessarily complex and confusing. I suggest the authors simply remind that DSB repair through homologous recombination is inherently associated with a gene conversion tract (primarily as a result of the repair of heteroduplex DNA by the mismatch repair (MMR) machinery) that can be associated or not to a crossover. The former recombination product is a crossover (CO), the latter product is a noncrossover (NCO) or gene conversion. Limited markers may prevent the detection of gene conversions, which erase NCO but do not affect CO detection.</p>
<p>In addition, &quot;resolution&quot; in the recombination field refers to the processing of a double Holliday junction containing intermediates by structure-specific nucleases. To avoid any confusion, I suggest avoiding using &quot;resolution&quot; and simply sticking with &quot;DSB repair&quot; all along the text.</p>
<p>Note that there are several studies about S. cerevisiae meiotic recombination landscapes using different hybrids that show different CO counts. In the introduction, the authors refer to Mancera et al 2008, a reference paper in the field. In this paper, the hybrid used showed ca. 90 CO per meiosis, while their reference to Liu et al 2018 in Figure 2 shows less than 80 COs per meiosis for S. cerevisiae. This shows that it is not easy to come up with a definitive CO count per meiosis in a given species. This needs to be taken into account for the result section line 315-321.</p>
<p>In line 104, the authors refer to S. paradoxus and mention that its recombination rate is significantly different from that of S. cerevisiae. This is inaccurate since this paper claims that the CO landscape is even more conserved than the DSB landscape between these two species, and they even identify a strong role played by the subtelomeric regions. So, the discussion about this paper cannot stand as it is.</p>
<p>Line 150, when the authors refer to the anti-recombinogenic activity of the MMR, I suggest referring to the published work from Martini et al 2011 rather than the not-yet-published work from Copper et al 2021, or both, if needed.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>The clear depletion in CO and the concomitant increase in NCO within the introgressed regions strongly suggest that DNA sequence polymorphism triggers CO inhibition but does not affect NCO or to a much lower extent. Because most CO likely arises from the ZMM pathway (CO interference pathway mainly relying on Zip1, 2, 3, 4, Spo16, Msh4, 5, and Mer3) in S. uvarum as in S. cerevisiae, and because the effect of sequence polymorphism is likely mediated by the MMR machinery, this would imply that MMR specifically inhibits the ZMM pathway at some point in S. uvarum.</p>
<p>The weak effect or potential absence of the effect of sequence polymorphism on NCO formation suggests that heteroduplex DNA tracts, at least the way they form during NCO formation, escape the anti-recombinogenic effect of MMR in S. uvarum. A few comments about this could be added.</p>
<p>The same applies to the fact that the CO number is lower in the natural cross compared to the fermentation cross, while the NCO number is the same. This suggests that under similar initiating Spo11-DSB numbers in both crosses, the decrease in CO is likely compensated by a similar increase in inter-sister recombination.</p>
<p>Introgressions represent only 10% of the genome, while the decrease in CO is at least 20%. This is a bit surprising especially in light of CO regulation mechanisms such as CO homeostasis that tends to keep CO constant. Could the authors comment on that?</p>
<p>Finally, the frequency of NCOs in introgressed regions is about twice the frequency of CO in non-introgressed regions. Both CO and NCO result from Spo11-initiating DSBs. This suggests that more Spo11-DSBs are formed within introgressed regions and that such DSBs specifically give rise to NCO. Could this be related to the lack of homolog engagement which in turn shuts down Spo11-DSB formation as observed in ZMM mutants by the Keeney lab? Could this simply result from better detection of NCO in introgressed regions related to the increased marker density, although the authors claim that NCO counts are corrected for marker resolution?</p>
<p>What could be the explanation for chromosome 12 to have more shuffling in the natural cross compared to the fermentation cross which is deprived of the introgressed region?</p>
<p>Technical points:</p>
<p>- In line 248, the authors removed NCO with fewer than three associated markers.</p>
<p>
What is the rationale for this? Is the genotyping strategy not reliable enough to consider events with only one or two markers? NCO events can be rather small and even escape detection due to low local marker density.</p>
<p>- Line 270: The way homology is calculated looks odd to this reviewer, especially the meaning of 0.5 homology. A site is either identical (1 homology) or not (0 homology).</p>
<p>- Line 365: beware that the estimates are for mitotic mismatch repair (MMR). Meiotic MMR may work differently.</p>
<p>- Figure 1: there is no mention of potential 4:0 segregations. Did the authors find no such pattern? If not, how did they consider them?</p>

<p>When members of two related but diverged species mate, the resulting hybrids can produce offspring where parts of one species' genome replace those of the other. These &quot;introgressions&quot; often create regions with a much greater density of sequence differences than are normally found between members of the same species. Previous studies have shown that increased sequence differences, when heterozygous, can reduce recombination during meiosis specifically in the region of increased difference. However, most of these studies have focused on crossover recombination, and have not measured noncrossovers. The current study uses a pair of Saccharomyces uvarum crosses: one between two natural isolates that, while exhibiting some divergence, do not contain introgressions; the other is between two fermentation strains that, when combined, are heterozygous for 9 large regions of introgression that have much greater divergence than the rest of the genome. The authors wished to determine if introgressions differently affected crossovers and noncrossovers, and, if so, what impact that would have on the gene shuffling that occurs during meiosis.</p>
<p>While both crossovers and noncrossovers were measured, assessing the true impact of increased heterology (inherent in heterozygous introgressions) is complicated by the fact that the increased marker density in heterozygous introgressions also increases the ability to detect noncrossovers. The authors used a relatively simple correction aimed at compensating for this difference, and based on that correction, conclude that, while as expected crossovers are decreased by increased sequence heterology, counter to expectations noncrossovers are substantially increased. They then show that, despite this, genetic shuffling overall is substantially reduced in regions of heterozygous introgression. However, it is likely that the correction used to compensate for the effect of increased sequence density is defective, and has not fully compensated for the ascertainment bias due to greater marker density. The simplest indication of this potential artifact is that, when crossover frequencies and &quot;corrected&quot; noncrossover frequencies are taken together, regions of introgression often appear to have greater levels of total recombination than flanking regions with much lower levels of heterology. This concern seriously undercuts virtually all of the novel conclusions of the study.</p>
<p>Until this methodological concern is addressed, the work will not be a useful contribution to the field.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful feedback on our work. One important point that they bring up is a potential issue with our method for accounting for excess NCO events that are detected due to increased marker resolution in the introgressed regions. The method we chose was to simulate average sized NCO tracts over both introgressed and non-introgressed windows to determine the expected increase in NCO detection due to marker density. We then took that expected increase and used it to correct our per-window NCO counts in all windows. We used these corrections for all results and analysis involving genomic windows (maps and genomewide comparisons) but did not include them when focusing on introgression-specific characteristics (e.g. analyzing fine-scale sequence differences around NCO tracts in introgressed regions). We chose this method based on previous work in the field and after some additional analyses on our own data that we did not include in the final manuscript. We will attempt to better communicate our decision making process and include some of the exploratory results that guided us in our revised manuscript. We look forward to responding to all comments and highlighting additional aspects of our findings that we think are of interest to the evolution and recombination communities, including significant changes to the recombination landscape between closely related strains and the impact of introgression on allelic shuffling.</p>
