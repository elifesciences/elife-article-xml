<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Juvenile hormone (JH) plays a vital role in insect development and maintaining insect larval status. JH is an acyclic sesquiterpenoid known to enter cells freely via diffusion because of its lipid-soluble character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Riddiford, 2020</xref>). JH binds its intracellular receptor methoprene-tolerant protein (MET), a basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) family protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Charles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jindra et al., 2021</xref>). MET forms a transcription complex with the transcription factor Taiman (TAI, also known as FISC, p160/SRC, and is a steroid receptor coactivator) to initiate gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Charles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>). An important gene in the JH pathway is Krüppel homologue 1 (<italic>Kr-h1</italic>), which encodes the zinc-finger transcription factor <italic>Kr-h1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Minakuchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pecasse et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Kr-h1</italic> acts downstream of MET and is induced rapidly by JH to regulate larval growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Minakuchi et al., 2009</xref>). Other genes, for example, the early trypsin gene of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (<italic>AaEt</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Noriega et al., 2003</xref>), JH-inducible 21 kDa protein (<italic>Jhp21</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zhang et al., 1996</xref>), JH esterase (<italic>Jhe</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Feng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wroblewski et al., 1990</xref>), vitellogenin (<italic>Vg</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Comas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Xu et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> JH-inducible gene 1(<italic>Jhi-1</italic>), and JH-inducible gene 26 (<italic>Jhi-26</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dubrovsky et al., 2000</xref>) are regulated by JH.</p>
<p>However, some studies suggest that cell membrane receptors also play essential roles in JH signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Davey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jindra et al., 2021</xref>). For example, in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are involved in JH-induced rapid increases in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, diacylglycerol, and intracellular calcium, leading to activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to phosphorylate MET and TAI, resulting in <italic>Kr-h1</italic> gene transcription in response to JH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). JH III, also via RTKs, leads to rapid calcium release and influx in <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> epidermal cells (HaEpi cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). JH induces MET phosphorylation to increase MET interacting with TAI, which enhances <italic>Kr-h1</italic> transcription in <italic>H. armigera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Li et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, JH through RTK and PKC protein kinase C (PKC) induces phosphorylation of ultraspiracle (USP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gao et al., 2022</xref>). The phenomenon that RTK transmits JH signal has long been predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ojani et al., 2016</xref>); however, the RTKs critical for JH signaling have yet to be identified from numerous RTKs <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>RTKs constitute a class of cell surface transmembrane proteins that play important roles in mediating extracellular to intracellular signaling. Humans carry approximately 60 RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Manning et al., 2002</xref>), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes 21 RTK genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sopko and Perrimon, 2013</xref>), <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> has 20 RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alexandratos et al., 2016</xref>), and the <italic>German cockroach</italic> genome identifies 16 RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Li et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>H. armigera</italic> has 20 RTK candidates with gene codes in the <italic>H. armigera</italic> genome by our analysis. The cotton bollworm is a well-known and worldwide distributing agricultural pest in Lepidoptera, which threatens cotton and many other vegetable crops by rapidly producing resistance to various chemical insecticides and Bt-transgenic cotton. Using <italic>H. armigera</italic> as a model, we focus on identifying the RTKs functioning as the JH receptors and demonstrating the mechanism. We screened the RTKs sequentially, including examining the roles of 20 RTKs identified in the <italic>H. armigera</italic> genome in JH regulated-gene expression to obtain primary candidates, followed by screening of the candidates by their roles in maintaining larval status, JH induced-rapid increase of intracellular calcium levels, JH induced-phosphorylation of MET and TAI, and affinity to JH. The cadherin 96ca (CAD96CA) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) were finally determined as JH cell membrane receptors by their roles in JH regulated-gene expression, maintaining larval status, JH induced-rapid increase of intracellular calcium levels, JH induced-phosphorylation of MET and TAI, and their JH-binding affinity. Their roles as JH cell membrane receptors were further determined by knockdown and knockout of them <italic>in vivo</italic> and cell lines, and overexpression of them in mammal HEK-293T heterogeneously. These data not only improve our knowledge of JH signaling and open the door to studying insect development, but also present new targets to explore the new growth regulators to control the pest.</p>

<title>The screen of the RTKs involved in JH signaling</title>
<p>To explore which RTKs may be involved in JH signaling, a total of RTKs were identified in the <italic>H. armigera</italic> genome.

All the analyzed RTKs were grouped according to their structural characteristics and homology to the structure of 20 subfamilies of human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Honegger et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sparrow et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yarden and Ullrich, 1988</xref>); the cell wall integrity and stress response component kinase (WSCK), tyrosine-protein kinase receptor torso like (TORSO) and serine/threonine-protein kinase STE20-like (STE 20-like) were not classed (<italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 2</italic>).</p>

<p>To identify the RTKs involved in JH III signaling, 20 RTKs of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> were knocked down by RNA interference (RNAi) in HaEpi cells using JH III-induced <italic>Kr-h1</italic>, <italic>Vg</italic>, <italic>Jhi-1</italic>, and <italic>Jhi-26</italic> gene expression as readouts. When <italic>Cad96ca</italic>, <italic>Drl</italic> (encoding derailed), <italic>Fgfr1</italic>, <italic>Nrk</italic> (encoding neurotropic receptor kinase), <italic>Vegfr1</italic> (encoding vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1), and <italic>Wsck</italic> were knocked down, respectively, JH III-upregulated expression of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> was decreased. However, knocking down other <italic>Rtks</italic> did not decrease the <italic>Kr-h1</italic> transcription level. When <italic>Cad96ca</italic>, <italic>Drl</italic>, <italic>Fgfr1</italic>, <italic>Nrk</italic>, <italic>Vegfr1</italic>, <italic>Wsck</italic>, and <italic>Inr</italic> (encoding insulin-like receptor) were knocked down, JH III-upregulated expression of <italic>Vg</italic> was decreased. RNAi of <italic>Rtks</italic> did not affect JH-induced <italic>Jhi-1</italic> expression. When <italic>Cad96ca</italic>, <italic>Fgfr1</italic>, <italic>Nrk</italic>, and <italic>Vegfr1</italic> were knocked down, JH III-upregulated expression of <italic>Jhi-26</italic> was decreased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>Rtks</italic> were confirmed to be knocked down significantly in HaEpi cells (<italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</italic>). The off-target effects of their knockdown were excluded from the genes we detected. Off–target genes were selected based on the identity rate of nucleotide sequences (<italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</italic>). By the primary screening of RNAi, six RTKs, CAD96CA, DRL, FGFR1, NRK, VEGFR1, and WSCK were chosen for further screening.</p>
<p>The tissue–specific and developmental expression profiles of the six selected RTKs were determined using qRT‒PCR to identify their possible roles in tissues at different developmental stages. The mRNA levels of <italic>Vegfr1</italic>, <italic>Drl</italic>, <italic>Cad96ca</italic>, and <italic>Nrk</italic> showed no tissue specificity in the epidermis, midgut and fat body. Their transcript levels were high at the sixth instar feeding stage (6th–6 h to 6th–48 h) compared with those at the metamorphic molting stage (6th–72 h to 6th–120 h) and pupal stages (P–0 d to P–8 d). <italic>Fgfr1</italic> was highly expressed in the midgut at these feeding stages. <italic>Wsck</italic> was highly expressed from the 6th–48 h to the pupal stage and showed no tissue specificity (<italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</italic>). These data suggested that the RTKs are differentially distributed in tissues and highly expressed during larval feeding stages.</p>
<p>We further examined the roles played by these six RTKs in JH III-delayed pupation by injecting double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into the fifth instar 20 h larval hemocoel. The interference of these six RTK genes in larvae led to a significant decrease in the expression of <italic>Kr-h1</italic>, in which, <italic>Cad96ca</italic>, <italic>Nrk</italic>, <italic>Fgfr1</italic>, and <italic>Wsck</italic> knockdown resulted in an increase in the expression of <italic>Br-z7</italic> (encoding broad isoform Z7) (<italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</italic>). The pupation time was approximately 162 h in 93% of the larvae in the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control group. After injection of JH III, the pupation time was approximately 187 h in 76% of the larvae, which was 25 h later than that of the DMSO control group, suggesting that JH III delayed pupation. In the <italic>dsGFP</italic>+JH III-injected control, 70% larvae pupated approximately the same time as larvae after JH III treatment. In the <italic>dsVegfr1</italic>+JH III and <italic>dsDrl</italic>+JH III treatment groups, 60–63% larvae exhibited delayed pupation; only 9–10% of the larvae did not show delayed pupation, and 28–30% died at the larval or pupal stage. However, 66–68% of the larvae did not show delayed pupation after <italic>dsCad96ca</italic>+JH III, <italic>dsNrk</italic>+JH III, <italic>dsFgfr1</italic>+JH III or <italic>dsWsck</italic>+JH III injection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, C</xref><italic> and Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</italic>). These results indicated that CAD96CA, NRK, FGFR1, and WSCK are involved in JH III-induced delayed pupation.</p>
<p>To address the mechanism of the RTK effects on JH signaling, we examined the roles played by the selected RTKs in JH III-induced cellular responses by knocking down RTK gene expression in HaEpi cells. JH III-induced rapid calcium mobilization was repressed after knockdown of <italic>Vegfr1</italic>, <italic>Drl</italic>, <italic>Cad96ca</italic>, <italic>Nrk</italic>, <italic>Fgfr1</italic>, or <italic>Wsck</italic> compared with that after <italic>dsGFP</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The efficacy of RNAi was confirmed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). However, only only the knockdown of <italic>Cad96ca</italic>, <italic>Nrk</italic>, and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> decreased the JH III-induced phosphorylation of MET1 and TAI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The results suggested that these RTKs are involved in JH III-induced rapid cellular calcium increase but are differentially involved in JH III-induced MET1 and TAI phosphorylation.</p>

<title>CAD96CA and FGFR1 had high affinity to JH III</title>
<p>Since Cad96CA, FGFR1, and NRK were not only involved in JH-regulated <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression, JH III-induced delayed pupation, and calcium levels increase, but also involved in MET and TAI phosphorylation, we further analyzed their binding affinity to JH III. OTK did not respond to JH III, so we used it as a control protein on the cell membrane to exclude the possibility of nonspecific binding. The affinity of CAD96CA, FGFR1, NRK, and OTK for JH III was determined using saturable specific–binding curve analysis via microscale thermophoresis (MST). The experiment used full– length sequences of CAD96CA, FGFR1, NRK, and OTK. CAD96CA-CopGFP-His (CopGFP is a 26 kDa green fluorescent protein cloned from copepod <italic>Pontellina plumate</italic>), FGFR1-CopGFP-His, NRK-CopGFP-His, and OTK-CopGFP-His were overexpressed in the Sf9 cell line (Sf9 cells expressed the proteins at a higher level than HaEpi cells) and then, the proteins were isolated separately to determine the JH III-binding strength of each. Immunocytochemistry showed that CAD96CA-CopGFP-His, FGFR1-CopGFP-His, NRK-CopGFP-His, and OTK-CopGFP-His located in the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The purity of the proteins was assessed and confirmed using sodium dodecyl sulfate‒polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‒PAGE) with Coomassie brilliant blue staining (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). CAD96CA-CopGFP-His binding to JH III exhibited a dissociation constant (Kd) = 11.96 ± 1.61 nM. Similarly, the saturable specific binding of FGFR1-CopGFP-His to JH III exhibited a Kd = 23.61 ± 0.90 nM, and NRK-CopGFP-His and OTK-CopGFP-His showed no obvious binding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). These results suggested that CAD96CA and FGFR1 bind JH III.</p>

<p>The JH intracellular receptor MET has been reported to bind to JH in <italic>Tribolium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Charles et al., 2011</xref>); therefore, MET1 in <italic>H. armigera</italic> was used as the positive control in analyses to assess the applicability of the MST method. MET1-CopGFP-His and CopGFP-His were overexpressed in the Sf9 cell line and then isolated to determine their binding strength to JH III. Immunocytochemistry showed the nuclear location of MET1 (<italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</italic>). The purities of the isolated CopGFP-His and MET1-CopGFP-His proteins were examined and confirmed using SDS‒PAGE with coomassie brilliant blue staining (<italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</italic>). The saturable specific binding of MET1-CopGFP-His to JH III exhibited a Kd = 6.38 ± 1.41 nM. CopGFP-His showed weaker binding to JH III (<italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</italic>). In comparison with the Kd of <italic>Tribolium</italic> MET to JH III of 2.94 ± 0.68 nM as detected by [<sup>3</sup>H]JH III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Charles et al., 2011</xref>), the MST method was a valid approach to detect the JH III binding to a protein.</p>
<p>To further validate CAD96CA and FGFR1 binding JH III, saturation assays were performed using the analogs of JH, the farnesol, methoprene, and farnesoate (MF). Results showed that CAD96CA-CopGFP-His bound farnesol with a Kd of 1039.2 ± 0.68 nM. CAD96CA-CopGFP-His bound methoprene with a Kd of 553.94 ± 1.11 nM. CAD96CA-CopGFP-His bound methyl farnesoate (MF) with a Kd of 446.55 ± 0.80 nM. CAD96CA-CopGFP-His bound JH III with a Kd of 12.10 ± 1.4 nM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). The results confirmed that CAD96CA has the highest affinity to JH III.</p>
<p>Because methoprene is known as an effective juvenoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Konopova and Jindra, 2007</xref>) and competes with JH III in binding to MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Charles et al., 2011</xref>), the competitive experiment was performed to confirm CAD96CA bound JH III. CAD96CA-CopGFP-His bound to methoprene plus JH III with a Kd value of 261.43 ± 0.81 nM, whereas CAD96CA-CopGFP-His bound to methoprene with a Kd value of 563.49 ± 0.7 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). These suggested that CAD96CA-CopGFP-His has the highest affinity to JH III compared with the analogs.</p>
<p>Similarly, the saturable specific binding of FGFR1-CopGFP-His bound farnesol with a Kd = 23810 ± 0.51 nM; FGFR1-CopGFP-His bound methoprene with a Kd = 529.68 ± 0.60 nM; FGFR1-CopGFP-His bound to MF exhibited a Kd = 417.20 ± 0.66 nM; and FGFR1-CopGFP-His bound to JH III exhibited a Kd = 21.45 ± 1.02 nM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>), suggesting FGFR1 had the highest affinity to JH III. The compete binding of FGFR1-CopGFP-His to methoprene plus JH III with a Kd value = 349.27 ± 0.58 nM, whereas FGFR1-CopGFP-His bound to methoprene with a Kd value 523.57 ± 0.89 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). These suggested that FGFR1 has the highest affinity to JH III compared with the analogs.</p>
<p>Various mutants of CAD96CA and FGFR1 were further constructed to identify the key motifs in CAD96CA and FGFR1 critical for JH binding. Truncated mutations were performed on extracellular regions of CAD96CA and FGFR1, including CAD96CA-M1 (51-615 AA, amino acid), CAD96CA-M2 (101-615 AA), CAD96CA-M3 (151-615 AA), CAD96CA-M4 (201-615 AA), FGFR1-M1 (101-615 AA), FGFR1-M2 (201-615 AA), FGFR1-M3 (301-615 AA) and FGFR1-M4 (401-615 AA). Mutants were overexpressed, and the encoded mutants located in the plasma membrane, as confirmed via immunocytochemistry, and the purity of the proteins was confirmed using SDS‒ PAGE with Coomassie brilliant blue staining (<italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 1D-I</italic>). Compared with the wild-type counterparts, CAD96CA-M2, CAD96CA-M3, and CAD96CA-M4 mutants’ affinity to JH III was significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Similarly, FGFR1-M2, FGFR1-M3, and FGFR1-M4 mutants for the binding affinity to JH III were significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). These results suggested that the extracellular domain 51-151 AA in CAD96CA and the extracellular domain 101-301 AA in FGFR1 play a vital role in JH binding.</p>
<p>The affinity of CAD96CA, FGFR1, NRK, and OTK for JH III was further determined using saturable specific–binding curve analysis via isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). ITC as an alternative method to further examine the affinity of CAD96CA and FGFR1 to JH III. CAD96CA-CopGFP-His bound JH III with a Kd value of 79.6 ± 27.5 nM. Similarly, the saturable specific binding of FGFR1-CopGFP-His to JH III with a Kd value of 88.5 ± 19.4 nM, and NRK-CopGFP-His and OTK-CopGFP-His showed no remarkable binding (<italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 2</italic>). These results also suggested that CAD96CA and FGFR1 bind JH III.</p>

<p>When the Cas9-gRNA injected eggs (105 eggs were injected each for three injections, a total of 315 experimental eggs) had developed into second instar larvae, the survival rates were determined. The survival rate of the Cas9-gRNA-injected eggs (19.4∼20.6%) did not significantly differ from that of the control eggs injected with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (a survival rate of 22.6%), suggesting that the mixture of gRNA and Cas9 protein was nontoxic to the <italic>H. armigera</italic> eggs. In 61 survivors of Cas9 protein plus <italic>Cad96ca</italic>-gRNA injection, 30 mutants were identified, and mutation efficiency was 49.2%. Similarly, in the 65 survivors of Cas9 protein plus <italic>Fgfr1</italic>-gRNA injection, 35 mutants were identified, with mutation efficiency of 53.8% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The DNA sequences, deduced amino acids and off–target were analyzed (<italic>Figure 4—figure supplement 1</italic>). Most wild-type larvae showed a phenotype of pupation on time. However, in the <italic>Cad96ca</italic> mutants, 86% of the larvae showed early pupation, with the pupation time being 24 h earlier than the control. In the <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mutants, 91% of the larvae showed early pupation, with the pupation time being 23 h earlier than the control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref><italic> and </italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). The data suggested that both CAD96CA and FGFR1 prevent pupation <italic>in vivo</italic>, which is consistent with the role of the JH preventing pupation.</p>
<p>To address the mechanism of early pupation caused by knockout of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> or <italic>Fgfr1</italic>, we compared the expression of the genes in the JH and 20E pathways between mutant and wild-type <italic>H. armigera</italic>. Both the mutants of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> led to a significant decrease in <italic>Kr-h1</italic>, a JH-induced gene functioning at the downstream of MET1, expression and an increase in 20E pathway gene expression, including <italic>Hr3</italic>, <italic>Ecr</italic>, <italic>Foxo</italic> and <italic>Atg8</italic> compared with the wild-type <italic>H. armigera</italic>, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref><italic> and </italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">G</xref>), indicating that CAD96CA and FGFR1 prevented pupation by increasing <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression and repressing 20E pathway gene expression, which suggests CAD96CA and FGFR1 play roles in JH signaling.</p>
<p>To confirm the roles played by CAD96CA and FGFR1 in JH signaling, we further examined the response of HaEpi cells to JH III induction after editing of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> by CRISPR/Cas9 in HaEpi cells using the gRNAs inserted into the pIEx-4-BmU6-gRNA-Cas9-GFP-P2A-Puro plasmid (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). The mutation of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> in HaEpi cells was confirmed by sequencing the mutants and deduced amino acids (<italic>Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-D</italic>). <italic>Cad96ca</italic> or <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mutation repressed the JH III-induced expression of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> in HaEpi cells compared with wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>), and repressed the JH III-induced rapid calcium mobilization in cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref><italic> and Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</italic>), suggesting that CAD96CA and FGFR1 were involved in JH III-induced expression of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> and rapid calcium mobilization. These results supported the hypothesized roles played by CAD96CA and FGFR1 in JH signaling.</p>
<p>To clarify the physiological roles and relationships of intracellular receptor MET1, cell membrane receptors CAD96CA and FGFR1 in JH signaling, we knocked out <italic>Met1</italic> individually (single knockout), <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> together (double knockout), and <italic>Met1</italic>, <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> together (triple knockout) using CRISPR/Cas9. Sequencing and genotypic analysis for mutant identification (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref><italic> and Figure 5—figure supplement 1</italic>). In the hatched larvae, the mutation rates were 25% for <italic>Met1</italic>, 21% for <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic>, and 17% for <italic>Met1</italic>, <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mutations, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). In the G0 generation larvae, 86% of the wild-type individuals pupated normally, with an average pupation time of approximately 20 days. In <italic>Met1</italic> mutants, 42% of the larvae pupated prematurely, with an average pupation time of about 16 days, and 58% of the individuals died during the transition from larvae to pupae. In <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> double mutants, 70% of the individuals pupated prematurely, with an average pupation time of around 17 days, and 30% of the individuals died during the transition from larvae to pupae. In <italic>Met1, Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> triple mutants, 19% of the individuals pupated prematurely, with an average pupation time of approximately 15 days, and 81% of the individuals died at the 5th instar and 6th instar larval stages. Among the surviving pupae, in <italic>Met1</italic> mutants, 84% died and 16% of the pupae developed into abnormal adults. In <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> double mutants, 72% of the pupae died and 28% of the pupae developed into abnormal adults. In <italic>Met1</italic>, <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> triple mutants, 92% of the pupae died, and 8% of the pupae developed into abnormal adults (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref><italic> and </italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). The expression level of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> was significantly decreased in these mutants, while the expression levels of genes related to the 20E pathway were significantly increased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). These results indicated that CAD96CA and FGFR1 play important roles in the JH signaling, suggesting that MET1, CAD96CA, and FGFR1 can transmit JH signal to prevent pupation independently and cooperatively.</p>

<p>To confirm the roles of CAD96CA and FGFR1 in transmitting JH signal, CAD96CA and FGFR1 of <italic>H. armigera</italic> were overexpressed heterogeneously in mammalian HEK-293T cells to exclude the unknown endogenous effect in insect cells. Immunocytochemistry showed that CAD96CA-GFP, FGFR1-GFP, and NRK-GFP locate in the plasma membrane. The proteins were confirmed using western blotting (<italic>Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</italic>). The wild HEK-293T cells had no significant changes in calcium ion levels under JH III induction, because there were no CAD96CA and FGFR1 in the cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating that HEK-239T cells did not respond to JH III induction. However, when HEK-293T cells overexpressed CAD96CA or FGFR1, respectively, JH III triggered rapid cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and influx, by comparison with the DMSO condition, His tag, and other RTK NRK-His controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). These results further confirmed that CAD96CA and FGFR1 transmit JH III signal.</p>
<p>CAD96CA and FGFR1 mutants were used to further confirm their roles in transmitting the JH signal in human HEK-293T cells. Mutants were overexpressed, and the encoded mutants located in the plasma membrane, as confirmed via immunocytochemistry, and the proteins were confirmed using western blotting (<italic>Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</italic>).

<p>JH regulates insect development through intracellular and membrane signaling; however, the cell membrane receptors and the mechanism are unclear. In this study, CAD96CA and FGFR1 were screened out from the total 20 RTKs in the <italic>H. armigera</italic> genome and identified as JH III cell membrane receptors, which transmit JH signal for gene expression to prevent pupation and have a high affinity to JH III.</p>

<p>CAD96CA (also known as Stitcher, Ret-like receptor tyrosine kinase) activates upon epidermal wounding in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tsarouhas et al., 2014</xref>) and promotes growth and suppresses autophagy in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelial imaginal wing discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">O’Farrell et al., 2013</xref>). There is a CAD96CA in the genome of the <italic>H. armigera</italic>, which is without function study. Here, we reported that CAD96CA prevents pupation by transmitting JH signal as a JH cell membrane receptor. We also showed that CAD96CA of other insects has a universal function of transmitting JH signal to trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization, as demonstrated by the study in Sf9 cell lines of <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> and S2 cell lines of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.</p>
<p>FGFRs control cell migration and differentiation in the developing embryo of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Muha and Muller, 2013</xref>). The ligand of FGFR is FGF in <italic>D. melanogaste</italic>r (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Du et al., 2018</xref>). FGF binds FGFR and triggers cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Beenken and Mohammadi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). Three FGF ligands and two FGF receptors (FGFRs) are identified in <italic>Drosophila (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Huang and Stern, 2005</xref><italic>)</italic>. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> FGF-FGFR interaction is specific. Different ligands have different functions. The activation of FGFRs by specific ligands can affect specific biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kadam et al., 2009</xref>). The FGFR in the membrane of Sf9 cells can bind to Vip3Aa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>). One FGF and one FGFR are in the <italic>H. armigera</italic> genome, which have yet to be studied functionally. The study found that FGFR prevents insect pupation by transmitting JH signal as a JH cell membrane receptor. Exploring the molecular mechanism and output by which multiple ligands transmit signals through the same receptor is exciting and challenging in future work.</p>
<p>CAD96CA and FGFR1 have similar functions in JH signaling, including transmitting JH signal for <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression, larval status maintaining, rapid intracellular calcium increase, phosphorylation of transcription factors MET1 and TAI, and high affinity to JH III. CAD96CA and FGFR1 are essential in the JH signal pathway, and loss-of-function of each is sufficient to trigger strong effects on pupation, suggesting they can transmit JH signal individually. The difference is that CAD96CA expression has no tissue specificity, and the <italic>Fgfr1</italic> gene is highly expressed in the midgut; possibly, it plays a significant role in the midgut. Other possibility is that CAD96CA and FGFR1 play roles by forming heterodimer with each other in midgut or with other RTKs, which needs to be addressed in future study. CAD96CA and FGFR1 transmit JH III signals in three different insect cell lines, suggesting their conserved roles in other insects.</p>
<p>Homozygous <italic>Cad96ca</italic> null <italic>Drosophila</italic> die at late pupal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that CAD96CA is critical to insect pupation. Here, we further revealed that <italic>Cad96ca</italic> mosaic mutation by CRISPR/Cas9 caused precocious pupation in <italic>H. armigera</italic>, suggesting that CAD96CA plays roles to prevent pupation. Similarly, null mutant of <italic>Fgfr1</italic> or <italic>Fgfr2</italic> in mouse is embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Deng et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yamaguchi et al., 1994</xref>). <italic>Htl</italic> (<italic>Fgfr</italic>) homozygous mutant in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> die during late embryogenesis, too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beati et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beiman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gisselbrecht et al., 1996</xref>), suggesting FGFR1 is important to embryogenesis. However, in <italic>H. armigera</italic>, <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mosaic mutation mainly caused precocious pupation, suggesting FGFR1 is necessary to prevent pupation. The double mutation of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> caused more earlier pupation and death compared to the single mutation of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> or <italic>Fgfr1</italic>. These data suggested that both CAD96CA and FGFR1 can transmit JH signal to prevent pupation independently and cooperatively. MET1 is the intracellular receptor of JH. Knockout of <italic>Met1</italic> in the <italic>B. mori</italic> leads to precocious metamorphosis and death in the penultimate instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Daimon et al., 2015</xref>). In the <italic>Spodoptera exigua</italic>, knockout of <italic>Met1</italic> also results in the precocious metamorphosis and death in the penultimate and final instars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, both <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>Gce</italic> null mutants die during the larval-pupal transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdou et al., 2011</xref>). In the <italic>H. armigera</italic>, most of the <italic>Met1</italic> mutants died during the transformation from the final instar larva to the pupa, too. These data suggest that JH via MET1 prevents pupation. In the triple mutants of <italic>Met1, Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic>, most larvae died at the 5th and 6th instar larval stages, which is much serious than the <italic>Met1</italic> mutation, or <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> double mutation, because of the mutation both intracellular receptor MET1 and two membrane receptors CAD96CA and FGFR1 of JH. These data suggest that JH exert a complete regulatory role through cell membrane receptors and intracellular receptor, because that the cell membrane receptors regulate the phosphorylation of the intracellular receptor MET1 and the interacting transcription factor Tai. The results from different insects suggest that the insect development in the early larval instars is less dependent on JH, and JH mainly plays roles at late larval stages to allow larvae reach an appropriate size and are fully prepared for metamorphosis. This is consistent with the general knowledge that the primary role of JH is to maintain larval status and antagonize 20E-induced metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Riddiford, 2008</xref>). The insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) plays major role in promoting the cell proliferation and determining the larval growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lin and Smagghe, 2019</xref>), and 20E promotes metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nijhout et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The phenotypes of gene mutation in <italic>H. armigera</italic> are somehow different from those obtained by homozygous mutation in other animals, due to the mosaic mutation by CRISPR/Cas9. In addition, RNAi of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> was observed precocious pupation as was the case in CRISPR/Cas9, suggesting the RNAi can be used for the study of gene function in insect, especially when the gene editing is embryonic lethal.</p>
<p>The knockdown of <italic>Cad96ca</italic>, <italic>Nrk</italic>, <italic>Fgfr1</italic>, and <italic>Wsck</italic> showed phenotypes resistant to JH III induction and the decrease of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> and increase of <italic>Br-z7</italic> expression, but knockdown of <italic>Vegfr</italic> and <italic>Drl</italic> only decrease <italic>Kr-h1</italic>, without increase of <italic>Br-z7</italic>. <italic>Br-z7</italic> is involved in 20E-induced metamorphosis in <italic>H. armigera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2014</xref>), whereas, <italic>Kr-h1</italic> is a JH early response gene that mediates JH action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Minakuchi et al., 2009</xref>) and represses <italic>Br</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Riddiford et al., 2010</xref>). The high expression of <italic>Br-z7</italic> is possible due to the down-regulation of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> in <italic>Cad96ca</italic>, <italic>Nrk</italic>, <italic>Fgfr1</italic> and <italic>Wsck</italic> knockdown larvae. The different expression profiles of <italic>Br-z7</italic> in <italic>Vegfr</italic> and <italic>Drl</italic> knockdown larvae suggest other roles of <italic>Vegfr</italic> and <italic>Drl</italic> in JH signaling, which need further study.</p>
<p>This study found six RTKs that respond to JH induction by participating in JH induced-gene expression and intracellular calcium increase, however; they exert different functions in JH signaling, and finally CAD96CA and FGFR1 are determined as JH cell membrane receptors by their roles in JH induced-phosphorylation of MET and TAI and binding to JH III. We screened the RTKs transmitting JH signal primarily by examining some of JH induced-gene expression. By examining other genes or by other strategies to screen the RTKs might find new RTKs functioning as JH cell membrane receptors; however, the key evaluation indicators, such as the binding affinity of the RTKs to JH and the function in transmitting JH signal to maintain larval status are essential.</p>
<p>In addition, GPCRs also play a role in JH signaling. JH triggers GPCR, RTK, PLC, IP3R, and PKC to phosphorylate Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-subunit, consequently activating Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase for the induction of patency in <italic>L. migratoria</italic> vitellogenin follicular epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jing et al., 2018</xref>); JH activates a signaling cascade including GPCR, PLC, extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and PKC, which induces vitellogenin receptor (VgR) phosphorylation and promotes vitellogenin (Vg) endocytosis in <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jing et al., 2021</xref>). JH activates a signaling cascade including GPCR, Cdc42, Par6, and aPKC, leading to an enlarged opening of patency for Vg transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>). In <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, the dopamine D2-like receptor-mediated JH signaling promotes the accumulation of vitellogenin and increases the level of cAMP in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bai and Palli, 2016</xref>). In <italic>H. armigera</italic>, GPCRs are involved in JH III-induced broad isoform 7 (BrZ7) phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2014</xref>). In summary, these published results indicate that RTKs and GPCRs contribute to JH signaling on the cell membrane, however, the GPCR functions as JH receptor needs to be addressed in the future study. The RNAi of RTKs does not affect JH-induced <italic>Jhi-1</italic> expression, which implies that other receptors exist, presenting a target for future study of the new JH III receptor.</p>

<title>The affinity of CAD96CA and FGFR1 to JH III</title>
<p>RTKs are high–affinity cell surface receptors for many cytokines, polypeptide growth factors, and peptide hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Trenker and Jura, 2020</xref>). Up to now, there is no report that RTK binds lipid hormone. We determined that CAD96CA and FGFR1 have a high affinity to JH III by MST and ITC methods after they were isolated from the cell membrane.</p>
<p>The [<sup>3</sup>H]JH III detection method is used to determine <italic>Drosophila</italic> MET <italic>in vitro</italic> translation product binding JH III (Kd = 5.3 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Miura et al., 2005</xref>), and <italic>Tribolium</italic> MET binding JH III (Kd = 2.94 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Charles et al., 2011</xref>). However, the commercial production of [<sup>3</sup>H]JH III has ceased, whereas the microscale thermophoresis (MST) method is a widely used method to detect protein binding of small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Welsch et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, MST was used in our study as the alternative method to measure the binding strengths of RTKs with JH III. Using the MST method, we determined that the saturable specific binding of <italic>Helicoverpa</italic> MET1 to JH III is Kd of 6.38 nM, which is comparable to that report for <italic>Drosophila</italic> MET and <italic>Tribolium</italic> MET determined using [<sup>3</sup>H]JH III, confirming MST method can be used to detect protein binding JH III. The CAD96CA exhibited saturable specific binding to JH III with a Kd of 11.96 nM, and FGFR1 showed a Kd of 23.61 nM, which is higher than that of MET1 for JH III, suggesting lower binding affinity of RTKs than the intracellular receptor MET1 for JH III. A similar phenomenon is reported in another study, the binding affinities of steroid membrane receptors are orders of magnitude lower than those of nuclear receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Falkenstein et al., 2000</xref>). NRK did not bind JH III. One possible explanation is that NRK has a low affinity to JH III and thus transmits JH signal without binding JH, or NRK requires association with other proteins to play roles. Our study provides new evidence for the binding of lipid hormones by RTK and a new method to study the binding of ligands to receptors.</p>
<p>We also verified the affinity of CAD96CA and FGFR1 with JH III through the ITC method, determining their respective Kd values as 79.6 and 88.5 nanomolar. ITC is a versatile analytical method for the character of molecular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Johnson, 2021</xref>). ITC is applied in the membrane protein family, containing GPCRs, ion channels, and transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Draczkowski et al., 2014</xref>). The ITC method requires relatively high ligand and receptor concentrations for better saturation curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rajarathnam and Rösgen, 2014</xref>). However, when we prepared a protein solution of 1000 nM, protein aggregation occurred, thus we used a protein solution with a concentration of 700 nM. The Kd value detected by ITC is slightly higher than the result of the MST method; the results are sufficient to confirm the high affinity of CAD96CA and FGFR1 binding to JH III.</p>
<p>Although JH I and JH II are natural hormones for lepidopteran larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Furuta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Schooley et al., 1984</xref>), <italic>H. armigera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Liu et al., 2013</xref>) and <italic>B. mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kayukawa et al., 2012</xref>) also respond to JH III. In <italic>B. mori</italic> Bm-aff3 cells, the effective concentrations (EC50) of JHs (JH I, JH II, JH III, JHA, or methyl farnesoate) to induce <italic>Kr-h1</italic> transcription are 1.6 × 10<sup>−10</sup>, 1.2 × 10<sup>−10</sup>, 2.6 × 10<sup>−10</sup>, 6.0 × 10<sup>−8</sup>, and 1.1 × 10<sup>−7</sup> M, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kayukawa et al., 2012</xref>). In cultures of wing imaginal discs from <italic>B. mori</italic>, 1–2 µM JH III promotes cuticle protein 4 gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Deng et al., 2011</xref>). The effective concentration of JH III to induce rapid calcium increase in HaEpi cells is ≥ 1 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) and 500 ng of 6th instar larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2014</xref>). JH III is a commercially available reagent; therefore, we used JH III to carry out the experiments in this study, and the results hypothesize the possibility of CAD96CA and FGFR1 binding other JHs in addition to JH III, which should be addressed in future study.</p>

<title>Relationship of cell membrane receptor and intracellular receptor</title>
<p>MET is determined as JH’s intracellular receptor by its characters binding to JH and regulating <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Charles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jindra et al., 2021</xref>). In our study, cell membrane receptors CAD96CA and FGFR1 are also able to bind JH III and transmit JH III signal to regulate a set of JH III-induced gene expression including <italic>Kr-h1</italic>. Obviously, both intracellular receptor MET and cell membrane receptor CAD96CA and FGFR1 are involved in JH III signaling as receptors. JH III transmits signal by cell membrane receptor and intracellular receptor at different signaling stages, with cell membrane receptor CAD96CA and FGFR1 inducing rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, which regulates the phosphorylation of MET and TAI to enhance the function of MET for gene transcription, and the intracellular receptor MET regulates gene transcription by diffusion into cells based its lipid characteristics.</p>
<p>The study in human cell line HEK293 shows that overexpression of <italic>B. mori</italic> JH intracellular receptor MET2 and its cofactor SRC together in HEK293 cells may induce JH-dependent luciferase reporter expression through a plasmid that contains the JH specific kJHRE (JH response element containing the E-box core sequence for JH binding) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kayukawa et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting JH can diffuse into cells to initiate a gene expression when the insect MET2 and SRC and kJHRE exist. Our study showed that overexpressing CAD96CA or FGFR1 in HEK-293T cells elicits Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation under JH III induction, suggesting CAD96CA or FGFR1 transmit a rapid signal of JH III in HEK-293T cells, which might trigger further cellular responses of HEK-293T to JH III. These data suggest that both cell membrane receptors CAD96CA and FGFR1 and intracellular receptor MET of JH can respond to JH. These proteins might be used as switches to induce a gene expression or regulate cell fate in heterogeneous cells by JH induction when the side effects are determined.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>CAD96CA and FGFR1 were involved in JH III signaling, including maintaining larval status, JH III-induced rapid intracellular calcium increase, gene expression, and phosphorylation of MET and TAI. CAD96CA and FGFR1 had high affinity to JH III and were possible cell membrane receptors of JH III and other JHs. CAD96CA and FGFR1 had a general role in transmitting the JH III signal for gene expression in various insect cells, suggesting their conserved roles in other insects. JH III transmits signal by either cell membrane receptor or intracellular receptor at different stages in the signaling, with JH III transmitting the signal by cell membrane receptor CAD96CA and FGFR1 to induce rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, which regulates the phosphorylation of MET and TAI to enhance the function of MET for gene transcription, and intracellular receptor MET regulates gene transcription by diffusion into cells based on its lipid characteristics. CAD96CA and FGFR1 can transmit JH signaling to prevent pupation independently and cooperatively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). This study presents a platform to identify the agonist or inhibitor of JH cell membrane receptors to develop an environmental-friendly insect growth regulator.</p>

<title>Detection of RTK binding JH III by microscale thermophoresis</title>
<p>RTKs and MET1 were recombined in plasmid pIEx-4-CopGFP-His, which was overexpressed in Sf9 cells. After 48 h, total plasma membrane RTKs were extracted using a cell transmembrane protein extraction kit (BestBio, Shanghai, China). MET1-CopGFP-His and CopGFP-His were extracted using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; and 1% Triton X-100) without ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). A 100 μL of slurry of chelating Sepharose with Ni<sup>2+</sup> was washed three times with binding buffer (500 mM NaCl; 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9; and 5 mM imidazole) for 5 min. The overexpressed proteins were bound to the washed Ni<sup>2+</sup>-chelating Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). The suspension was mixed on a three-dimensional rotating mixer for 40 min at 4 °C. Then, the resin was washed three times for 5 min each time with wash buffer (0.5 M NaCl; 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9; and 20 mM imidazole). After centrifugation at 500 × <italic>g</italic> for 3 min at 4 °C, the RTKs were washed three times with wash buffer for 5 min each time. The RTKs were eluted using 100 μL of elution buffer (0.5 M NaCl; 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9; 100 mM imidazole; and 0.5% Triton X-100) and then diafiltration was carried out three times with PBST (PBS, 0.05% Tween, and 0.5% Triton X-100) buffer using Amicon Ultra 0.5 (Merck Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA) to reduce the concentration of imidazole in preparation for the subsequent experiment. The concentration of the isolated RTK was detected using a BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). JH III bound by 50 nM RTK was detected using the microscale thermophoresis (MST) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huang and Zhang, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Welsch et al., 2017</xref>). Firstly, the fluorescence intensity and the homogeneity of the protein solution were detected. We confirmed that the fluorescence intensity of the protein samples was within the range of the instrument, and there was no aggregation of the protein samples. Then, we carried out experiments. 16 microtubes were prepared, and the ligand was diluted for use at the initial concentration of 1 μM JH III. Specifically, 5 μL of the ligand buffer was added to prepared microtubes No. 2-16. After, 10 μL of the ligand was added to tube No. 1, 5 μL of the ligand solution in tube No. 1 was pipetted out of tube No. 1, added to tube No. 2, and mixed well. Then 5 μL of solution was pipetted from tube No. 2 and added to tube No. 3. Finally, 5 μL of mixed liquid was removed from tube No. 16 and discarded. (The original concentration of JH III was dissolved in DMSO, and therefore, DMSO needed to be added to the ligand dilution buffer to ensure an equal amount of DMSO in each tube). Then, 5 μL of the fluorescence molecule (target protein) was added to each tube and mixed well. With each tube holding a 10 μL volume in total, the tubes were incubated at 4 °C for 30 to 60 minutes. Finally, samples were removed with a capillary tube and tested with an MST Monolith NT.115 (NanoTempers, Munich, Germany).</p>

A mixture of 100 ng/µL Cas9 protein (GenScript, New Jersey, USA) and 300 ng/µL gRNA for the injection into the eggs (per egg 2 nL was injected) within 4 h of oviposition using a Pico-litre Microinjector (Warner Instruments, Holliston, USA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hou et al., 2021</xref>). The injected eggs were incubated at 26 ± 1 °C with 60 to 70% relative humidity for 3– 4 days until they hatched. To detect the mutagenesis of <italic>H. armigera</italic> induced by CRISPR/Cas9, we used PCR to amplify the targeted genomic region obtained from fresh epidermis samples of larvae moulted from G0 individuals and used primers at approximately 50-200 base pairs upstream and downstream from the expected double strand break site by HiFi DNA Polymerase (Transgen, Beijing, China). For the wild-type group, 10 individuals were randomly selected for PCR products sequencing analysis. For the experimental group, individuals with the phenotypes of early pupation and dead were all subjected to sequencing analysis of PCR products. For the experimental group, individuals without significant phenotypes were randomly divided into three groups, and the mixed samples were used for sequencing analysis. The sequencing results showed overlapping peaks at the target sites, and these individuals were identified as mutants. The corresponding PCR products of 10 randomly selected mutant individuals were cloned into a pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa, Osaka, Japan) for sequencing, respectively. Six colonies from one individual were randomly picked for sequencing to identify the rates of mutation in an individual. The mutated sites were identified by comparison with the wild-type sequence. The ratio of the mutants in the PCR products was the editing efficiency. The editing efficiency of the <italic>Cad96ca</italic> mutant was 67%, that of the <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mutant was 61%, that of the <italic>Met1</italic> mutant was 72%, that of the <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mutant was 69%, and that of the <italic>Met1</italic>, <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mutant was 70%.

<p>In this <bold>important</bold> study, Li and others identified cell membrane receptors for juvenile hormone (JH), a terpenoid hormone in insects that regulates their development and reproduction. While intracellular receptors for JH are well characterized, membrane receptors for JH have remained elusive for many years. The authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence indicating that two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), CAD96CA and FGFR1, modulate the genomic effects of JH by phosphorylating the intracellular receptors in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera. Although differential functions of the two RTKs and potential effects of the other endogenous ligands of these RTKs on JH signaling remain unclear, this study lays a foundation for future studies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Juvenile hormone (JH) is a pleiotropic terpenoid hormone in insects that mainly regulates their development and reproduction. In particular, its developmental functions are described as the &quot;status quo&quot; action, as its presence in the hemolymph (the insect blood) prevents metamorphosis-initiating effects of ecdysone, another important hormone in insect development, and maintains the juvenile status of insects.</p>
<p>While such canonical functions of JH are known to be mediated by its intracellular receptor complex composed of Met and Tai, there have been multiple reports suggesting the presence of cell membrane receptor(s) for JH, which mediate non-genomic effects of this terpenoid hormone. In particular, the presence of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that phosphorylate Met/Tai in response to JH and thus indirectly affect the canonical JH signaling pathway has been strongly suggested. Given the importance of JH in insect physiology and the fact that the JH signaling pathway is a major target of insect growth regulators, elucidating the identify and functions of putative JH membrane receptors is of great significance form both basic and applied perspectives.</p>
<p>In the present study, the authors identified candidate receptors for such cell membrane JH receptors, CAD96CA and FGFR1, in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Their in vitro analyses are conducted thoroughly using multiple methods, which overall support their claim that these receptors can bind to JH and mediate their non-genomic effects.</p>
<p>Their CRISPR-Cas-mediated mutagenesis in vivo shows that mutation of the two RTKs causes acceleration of pupation, which is consistent with the mutant phenotype of the intracellular JH receptor, Met1. Although this is different from the typical phenotype one would expect from JH signaling deficiency in lepidopteran insects (i.e. precocious metamorphosis), the results overall support their claim that these two RTKs modulate genomic JH effects by phosphorylating the intracellular receptors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although their loss-of-function analyses suggest that the two RTKs likely have redundant functions in vivo, it is unclear whether they have any different functions in mediating JH functions in different physiological contexts. It also remains unknown whether other endogenous ligands for these RTKs affect canonical, genomic JH signaling in vivo.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>[…] Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the revised manuscript does not show significant improvement. While the identification of the receptors is highly convincing, important issues about the biological relevance remain unaddressed. First, the main point I raised about the first version of this article is that the redundancy and/or specificity of the two receptors should be clarified, even though I understand that it cannot be deeply investigated here. I believe that this point, shared by all reviewers, is highly relevant for the scope of this work. In this revised version, it is still unclear how to reconcile gain and loss-of-function experiments and the different expression profiles of the receptors. Second, the newly added explanations and pieces of discussion provided about the mild in vivo phenotypes of early pupation upon Cad96ca or Fgfr1 knock-out do not clarify the issue but instead put emphasis on methodological issues. Indeed, it is not clear whether the mild phenotypes reflect the biological role of Cad96ca and Fgfr1, or the redundancy of these two RTKs (and/or others), or some issue with the knock-out strategy (partial efficiency, mosaicism...). Finally, parts of the updated discussion and the modifications to the figures are confusing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for asking the questions. We performed additional experiments, including editing <italic>Met1</italic> individually (single knockout), <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> together (double knockout), and <italic>Met1</italic>, <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> together (triple knockout) using CRISPR/Cas9. The results showed that single mutation of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> or <italic>Fgfr1</italic> caused precocious pupation, respectively. The double mutation of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> caused earlier pupation and death compared to the single mutation of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> or <italic>Fgfr1</italic>. The triple mutation of <italic>Met1</italic>, <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> caused most serious effect on pupation time and death. These data suggested that both CAD96CA and FGFR1 can transmit JH signal to prevent pupation independently and cooperatively, and the JH exert a complete regulatory role through cell membrane receptors and intracellular receptor of JH. We increased the results in Lines 242-263 and discussion in Lines 328-375.</p>
<p>CAD96CA and FGFR1 have similar functions in JH signaling, including transmitting JH signal for <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression, larval status maintaining, rapid intracellular calcium increase, phosphorylation of transcription factors MET1 and TAI, and high affinity to JH III. CAD96CA and FGFR1 are essential in the JH signal pathway, and the loss-of-function of each is sufficient to trigger strong effects on pupation, suggesting they can transmit JH signal individually. The difference is that CAD96CA expression has no tissue specificity, and the <italic>Fgfr1</italic> gene is highly expressed in the midgut. A possibility is that CAD96CA and FGFR1 play roles by forming homodimer or heterodimer with each other or with other RTKs in tissues, which needs to be addressed in future studies. CAD96CA and FGFR1 transmit JH III signals in three different insect cell lines, suggesting their conserved roles in other insects.</p>
<p>The mild phenotypes shown in the previous picture, Fig 4E, were counted from all the surviving individuals injected with gRNA, including mutated and non-mutated individuals. In fact, there is no phenotype of pupation on time in the mutants. According to the first round of reviewers' comments, we found that it was inappropriate to count all the surviving individuals injected with gRNA, so we replaced the picture by counting the phenotypes of all successfully mutated individuals in the second version to avoid the confusion of the phenotypes.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>[…] Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Results of their in vivo experiments, particularly those of their loss-of-function analyses using CRISPR mutants are still preliminary, and the results rather indicate that these membrane receptors do not have any physiologically significant roles in vivo. More specifically, previous studies in lepidopteran species have clearly and repeatedly shown that precocious metamorphosis is the hallmark phenotype for all JH signaling-deficient larvae. In contrast, the present study showed that Cad96ca and Fgfr1 G0 mutants only showed slight acceleration in their pupation timing, which is not a typical phenotype one would expect from JH signaling deficiency. This is inconsistent with their working model provided in Figure 6, which indicates that these cell membrane JH receptors promote the canonical JH signaling by phosphorylating Met/Tai. If the authors argue that this slight acceleration of pupation is indeed a major JH signaling-deficient phenotype in Helicoverpa, they need to provide more data to support their claim by analyzing CRISPR mutants of other genes involved in JH signaling, such as Jhamt and Met. An alternative explanation is that there is functional redundancy between CAD96CA and FGFR1 in mediating phosphorylation of Met/Tai. This possibility can be tested by analyzing double knockouts of these two receptors. Currently, the validity of their calcium imaging analysis in Figure 5 is also questionable. When performing calcium imaging in cultured cells, it is critically important to treat all the cells at the end of each experiment with a hormone or other chemical reagents that universally induce calcium increase in each particular cell line. Without such positive control, the validity of calcium imaging data remains unknown, and readers cannot properly evaluate their results.</p>

<p>Thank you for the comments. We took your suggestions and performed additional experiments, editing <italic>Met1</italic> individually (single knockout), <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> together (double knockout), and <italic>Met1</italic>, <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> together (triple knockout) using CRISPR/Cas9. We increased the results in Lines 242-263 and discussion in Lines 328-375.</p>
<p>About the calcium imaging in cultured cells (now Fig 6), our goal is to examine the roles of CAD96CA and FGFR1 in JH trigged cellular responses. The experiment was well designed and controlled and the results were validated. For examples: JH III induced intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in Sf9 and S2 cells, but DMSO could not. However, knockdown of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> significantly decreased JH III-induced intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (Figure 6A, B), and <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B), suggesting that CAD96CA and FGFR1 had a general function to transmit JH signal in <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.</p>
<p>Wild mammalian HEK-293T cells had no significant changes in calcium ion levels under JH III induction, because there is no CAD96CA and FGFR1 in mammal cells (Figure 6C). However, when HEK-293T cells were overexpressed insect CAD96CA or FGFR1, respectively, JH III triggered rapid cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and influx (Figure 6D).</p>
<p>An increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> was not detected in mutants of CAD96CA-M3 and CAD96CA-M4 under JH III induction (Figure 6E) and nor in FGFR1-M4 (Figure 6F). These results confirmed that CAD96CA and FGFR1 play roles in transmitting JH III signal.</p>
<p>We carefully revised the description of the results and methods to help people understand the study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>[…] Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors have provided evidences that the Cad96Ca and FGF1 RTK receptors contribute to JH signaling through CRISPR/Cas9, inducing precocious metamorphosis, although not to the same extent as absence of JH. Therefore, it still remains unclear whether these RTKs are completely required for pathway activation or only necessary for high activation levels during the last larval stage. While the authors have included some additional data, the mechanism by which different RTKs function in transducing JH signaling in a tissue specific manner is still unclear. As the authors note in the discussion, it is possible that other RTKs may also play a role in facilitating the transduction of JH signaling. Lastly, the study does not yet explain how RTKs with known ligands could also bind JH and contribute to JH signaling activation. Although receptor promiscuity has been suggested as a possible mechanism, future studies could explore whether activation of RTK pathways by their known ligands induces certain levels of JH transducer phosphorylation, which, in the presence of JH, could contribute to full pathway activation without the need for direct JH-RTK binding.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. To address your questions, we carried out additional experiments. The relevant results have been incorporated into Lines 242-263, and the corresponding discussion has been added to Lines 328-375.</p>
<p>We agree with your suggestions that the future studies should resolve the questions such as how different RTKs function in transducing JH signaling in a tissue specific manner; whether other RTKs can transduce JH signal; how RTKs with known ligands could also bind JH and contribute to JH signaling activation; and how the RTK pathways are activated by their ligands.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) First, some of the new paragraphs, repeatedly used in the point-by-point answer to the reviewers, are highly confusing and need proofreading (i.e. 225-230; 320-340)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your advice. We have carefully revised the manuscript and the point-by-point answer to avoid repetition.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) While the double knock-down or knock-out of Cad96ca and Fgfr1 is expected to provide valuable information regarding their respective functions, the authors indicated that they wouldn't provide experiments in that direction. It is not clear to me if they have tried or not. The Crispr/Cas9 approach might be difficult to put in place to test this interaction. However, couldn't the authors try the double knock-down compared to single knock-downs using dsRNA? This method gave convincing results to test the role of the putative receptors in mediating JH-induced developmental delay in vivo (Figure 1).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We added experiments, editing <italic>Met1</italic> individually (single knockout), <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> together (double knockout), and <italic>Met1</italic>, <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> together (triple knockout) using CRISPR/Cas9, the new evidence fully defined the physiological roles of these receptors in JH signaling <italic>in vivo</italic>. We increased the results in Lines 242-263 and discussion in Lines 328-375.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Concerning the effect of Crispr knock-out on pupation timing, this paragraph was added: &quot;The low death rate after Cad96ca and Fgfr1 knockout might be because of following reasons, including the editing efficiency (67% and 61% for Cad96ca mutant and Fgfr1 mutant, respectively), the chimera of the gene knockout at the G0 generation, and the redundant RTKs that play similar roles in JH signaling&quot;. A similar explanation applies to the pupation phenotype itself... I am therefore wondering whether the Crispr/Cas9 approach (at the G0 generation) is the best strategy. Since the dsRNA knock-down gave efficient (and probably more reproducible) results according to Figure 1B-C, why not using the same approach for analyzing loss-of-function phenotypes?</p>
<p>(4) Similarly, this new paragraph regarding the knock-out strategy by Crispr is problematic: &quot;However, in the Cad96ca mutant, 86% of the larvae (an editing efficiency of 67% by TA clone analysis) had a shortened feeding stage in the sixth instar and entered the metamorphic molting stage earlier, showing early pupation, with the pupation time being 24 h earlier. In the Fgfr1 mutant, 91% of the larvae (an editing efficiency of 61%) had a shortened feeding stage in the sixth instar and entered the metamorphic molting stage earlier, showing early pupation, with the pupation time being 23 h earlier&quot; (lines 225-230).</p>
<p>- How does the editing efficiency relate to the mutation efficiency few lines earlier (not clearly explained in the methods)? Were the animals homozygous or heterozygous for the mutations? - A shortened feeding stage can only be invoked if previous developmental transitions are unaffected. Such statement should be supported by a better description of the developmental timing phenotype (as suggested already by reviewer 2).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your questions in (3) and (4). The editing rates of 67% and 61% for Cad96ca and Fgfr1 in individuals were calculated from the PCR products, indicating that the cells were mosaics by CRISPR/Cas9 editing. The mutants produced by CRISPR/Cas9 are mosaics. We removed the content to the methods section and increased the detail methods, Lines 705-717.</p>
<p>We increased discussion: &quot;The phenotypes of gene mutation in <italic>H. armigera</italic> are somehow different from those obtained by homozygous mutation in other animals, due to the mosaic mutation by CRISPR/Cas9. In addition, RNAi of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> was observed precocious pupation as was the case in CRISPR/Cas9, suggesting the RNAi can be used for the study of gene function in insect, especially when the gene editing is embryonic lethal&quot;. Lines 367-380.</p>
<p>We removed the improper description of the phenotypes in the results, such as that of the feeding stage. By increasing experiments of editing <italic>Met1</italic> individually (single knockout), <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> together (double knockout), and <italic>Met1</italic>, <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> together (triple knockout) to define the physiological roles of these receptors in JH signaling <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<p>(5) Importantly, I don't understand where the new version of the figure 4E stems from. The « pupation on time » (blue) category present in the first version of the figure has now disappeared for mutant animals. Why? In the first, my understanding was that, among the mutant animals, around 50% had precocious pupation. In the new version of the figure 4E, the &quot;pupation on time&quot; category is missing, and the percentages of early pupation are therefore strongly increased... The explanations provided in the text are not clear regarding the reanalysis of the mutant phenotypes. In the first version of the manuscript, the following explanation was given: &quot;In 61 survivors of Cas9 protein and Cad96ca-gRNA injection, 30 mutants were identified by the earlier pupation and sequencing (an editing efficiency of 49.2%)&quot;. Were all animals sequenced, or only the 30 displaying earlier pupation? Were the 31 others not sequenced or did they have no mutation? Could it be, as suggested by the first version of the figure, that some mutant animals did not display early pupation? It was indeed stated in the text that: &quot;CRISPR/Cas9 editing by Cad96ca-gRNA or Fgfr1-gRNA injection resulted in earlier pupation (Figure 4D) for about 23-24 h by comparison with normal pupation in 46% and 54% of larvae, respectively&quot;. This new version of the figure should be explained.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reminder. The phenotype of pupation on time appeared in the first version, because we counted the phenotypes of all the surviving individuals injected with gRNA, that is, the survivors in Figure 4C, which including mutated and non-mutated individuals. According to the comments from first round of reviewers, we realized that it was inappropriate to count all the surviving individuals injected with gRNA, since there is no phenotype of pupation on time in the mutants. Therefore, in the second version, we replaced the picture by counting the phenotypes of all successfully mutated individuals, namely the mutants in Figure 4C.</p>
