<title>Abstract</title><p>Cre-loxP technology, a cornerstone in fate mapping and <italic>in vivo</italic> gene function studies, faces challenges in achieving precise and efficient conditional mutagenesis through inducible systems. This study introduces two innovative genetic tools designed to overcome these limitations. The first, roxCre, enables DreER-mediated Cre release, paving the way for intersectional genetic manipulation that permits increased precision and efficiency. The second, loxCre, facilitates conditional gene targeting by allowing CreER lines to induce Cre expression with significantly enhanced efficiency. These tools incorporate a fluorescent reporter for genetic lineage tracing, simultaneously revealing efficient gene knockout in cells marked by the reporter. These strategies hold great potential for precise and efficient exploration of lineage-specific gene functions, marking a significant advancement in genetic research methodologies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genetic modification, such as gene knockout in a precise spatiotemporal manner forms the basis for understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms in multiple biological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The Cre-loxP recombination system is widely employed to knock out or over-express specific genes <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Cre recombinase, derived from the bacteriophage P1 gene, targets short palindrome DNA sequence loxP (34bp) and recombines codirectional-loxP-flanked sequences for deletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. To date, most of the mouse genes have been successfully targeted by two loxP sites (floxed allele), which could be recombined by cell-type specific Cre lines. Application of the Cre-loxP system in mouse genetics revolutionizes gene functional analysis and significantly advances our exploration of many developmental and pathophysiological processes at the molecular level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While constitutively active Cre is robust and efficient in recombination for gene deletion, Cre lacks temporal control as the promoter driving Cre is active from the embryonic to the adult stage. Therefore, a temporally active Cre is needed to avoid early mortality and realize the ablation of an indispensable gene at a key developmental stage. To overcome the temporal limitation of Cre, CreER, the fusion of Cre with a mutated estrogen receptor, is generated to enable its activation only after tamoxifen (Tam) treatment, and the interaction of ER with Tam induces nuclear translocation of CreER from the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. As a result, Tam treatment restricts CreER activity at a specific time window and permits gene functional analysis at a higher spatiotemporal resolution than Cre<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. As the loxP-flanked sequences and their locations in genome or chromatin influence its accessibility for recombination, the recombination efficiency of CreER varies significantly among multiple floxed alleles, ranging from easy- to inert-to-recombine alleles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. For example, CreER has high efficiency in targeting the easy-to-recombine alleles, such as generic reporter <italic>R26-tdT</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, but exhibits low efficiency on some other reporters such as <italic>R26-Confetti</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, or may not excise some floxed gene alleles that are inert or resistant for targeting, leading to failure of gene deletion in some tdT<sup>+</sup> cells and causing false-positive tracing fate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In other words, tdT expression may not always necessarily denote gene deletion in the labeled cells. The notion that the pattern of Cre-expression based on a reporter (e.g., <italic>R26-tdT</italic>) represents the pattern of Cre-mediated recombination is less rigorous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is not precise to assume the successful deletion of codirectional-loxP-flanked sequences in the gene of interest based on the deletion in another gene (or reporter) by the same CreER mouse line.</p>

<p>One way to increase the recombination efficiency of CreER is to treat mice with many times of Tam, as the high dosage of Tam in theory could increase the chances of CreER-mediated recombination. However, the increased dosage of Tam treatment is toxic and could lead to many side effects on the phenotype, creating confounding effects on the study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. To increase the inducible recombination efficiency of floxed alleles, Lao et al. reported a mosaic mutant analysis with spatial and temporal control of recombination (MASTR), in which initial FlpoER-mediated recombination induces GFPCre expression, that subsequently recombines floxed alleles effectively in GFP<sup>+</sup> cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Similarly, a Flp-induced mosaic analysis system with Cre or Tomato (MASCOT) has been reported to express Cre and reporter simultaneously in a cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. While MASTR and MASCOT enable spatiotemporal labeling of mosaic mutant cells utilizing the current resources of floxed mouse lines, it may not be suitable for effective gene knockout at a tissue/population level due to low recombination efficiency initiated by Flp recombinase. In order to improve the inducible recombination efficiency, Tian et al. have also reported a self-cleaved inducible CreER (sCreER) that switches inducible CreER into a constitutively active Cre, effectively recombining floxed allele for gene manipulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. However, self-cleaved inducible Cre mice have to be newly generated each time for targeting different promoters, which is time-consuming and the system is not compatible with current resources largely based on CreER mouse lines. A recent study has reported an iSuRe-Cre strategy to induce and report Cre-dependent genetic modifications utilizing conventional CreER tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The reporter expression reflects gene knockout in cells by iSuRe-Cre. However, two limitations hinder its widespread applications. First, without any induction, the iSuRe-Cre transgene is leaky in some tissues, such as heart and skeletal muscle. Second, the initial recombination for releasing the iSuRe-Cre allele induced by CreER is far from efficient in some tissues compared with easy-to-recombine alleles such as <italic>R26-tdT</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, limiting its usage for efficient gene knockout at a tissue level. Thus, a new method is needed to ensure gene knockout in cells as effectively and efficiently as recombination on easy-to-recombine alleles, thus allowing efficient gene deletion at a population level.</p>
<p>Conventional Cre-loxP system uses tissue-specific promoter to drive Cre, thus the precision of genetic targeting solely depends on promoter activity. Now it is known that many promoters are not as specific as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The ectopic or unwanted Cre expression in other cell types may result in unspecific cell labeling or gene deletion, leading to many confounding issues or controversies in multiple fields of research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In addition, some cell types cannot be clearly distinguished by one marker from another, and thus could not be specifically and genetically targeted by only one gene promoter-driven recombinase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. To circumvent this limit, dual recombinases-mediated genetic targeting utilizes two promoters to independently drive Cre and Dre<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Dre is another bacteriophage recombinase that targets rox sites and is orthogonal to the Cre-loxP system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. While cells of interest could be labeled by specific reporters that are responsive to dual recombinases, gene deletion requires a final readout on singular Cre recombinase for targeting floxed gene alleles.</p>
<p>In this study, we developed two genetic strategies: roxCre and loxCre, in which the <italic>rox-Stop-rox</italic> (RSR) and <italic>loxP-Stop-loxP</italic> cassettes are respectively inserted into the <italic>Cre</italic> coding region, such that Cre transcription and translation are not properly carried out before the removal of the <italic>Stop</italic> cassette. There is no obviously spontaneous leakiness by roxCre or loxCre. We found that CreER-induced loxCre effectively deletes genes in reporter-labeled cells, ensuring efficient gene knockout for the evaluation of lineage-specific gene function. In addition, DreER-induced roxCre efficiently deletes genes in cells for both specific and efficient intersectional genetic studies. We expect that these tools would overcome the issues of inefficient and nonspecific genetic modifications, enhancing the ability to more precisely manipulate genes in a particular cell lineage for a better understanding of gene functions in multiple biomedical fields.</p>

<title>Design of roxCre for DreER-induced mCre expression</title>
<p>A sequential genetic approach has been recently reported to delete genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, which used Dre-induced CreER expression by removing the <italic>rox-Stop-rox</italic> sequence ahead. As aforementioned, the recombination carried out by the released CreER for excising floxed gene alleles may not be as efficient as reporters (e.g., <italic>R26-tdT</italic>). A possible strategy to control Cre activity is to engineer a rox-flanked <italic>Stop</italic> sequence ahead of its DNA (<italic>R26-RSR-Cre</italic>) that will be removed after Dre-rox recombination (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). However, such a strategy is not ideal, as the upstream transcriptional <italic>Stop</italic> sequence might not completely prevent <italic>Cre</italic> transcription, leading to leakiness (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). We then inserted a longer <italic>Stop</italic> sequence or reversed the direction of the <italic>Cre</italic> DNA by generating <italic>R26-RSR-Cre2</italic> and <italic>R26-R-reverseCre-R</italic> lines, respectively. The whole-mount fluorescence imaging results displayed heavy leakiness, which demonstrates that Cre was independently activated for recombination without being crossed with a Dre mouse line (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-G</xref>). To enable efficient dual recombinases-mediated gene knockout, we need to design a strategy for DreER-induced expression of a constitutively active Cre, and the system should not exhibit leakiness.</p>
<p>We first generated roxCre, in which an RSR cassette was inserted into the coding region of <italic>Cre</italic>, splitting <italic>Cre</italic> into N- and C-terminal segments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). After removal of RSR by Dre-rox recombination, Cre is recombined containing one remaining rox site within its coding sequence, hereafter termed modified Cre (mCre, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). To ensure that mCre has the same recombination efficiency as the conventional Cre, we inserted a rox sequence at 12 different sites of <italic>Cre</italic> individually, most of which were located between helix domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). As insertions of additional amino acids of rox would change the original sequence of Cre, potentially leading to reduced activity, we screened for their recombination efficiency by transfecting cells with 12 versions of mCre (mCre1 to mCre12) and the responding GFP reporter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). We found that mCre1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, and 11 displayed a comparable efficiency as the conventional Cre; whereas mCre5, 8, 9, and 12 exhibited impaired recombination efficiency (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K, L</xref>). These data demonstrate that some of the mCre generated in our study are as efficient as the conventional Cre <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>Next, we sought to screen for the most robust version of mCre <italic>in vivo.</italic> We generated four roxCre knock-in mice based on mCre1, 4, 7, and 10 as determined from the above <italic>in vitro</italic> screening (Figure S1-S2). In these roxCre lines, RSR inserted into <italic>Cre</italic> was removed by Dre-rox recombination resulting in the generation of mCre (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>).

<title>DreER-induced mCre robustly recombines inert alleles</title>
<p>To more rigorously evaluate the recombination effectiveness among different versions of mCre, we used an inducible DreER to temporally and specifically release mCre in hepatocytes or endothelial cells. Generic reporter mouse lines <italic>R26-GFP</italic> and <italic>R26-tdT</italic> were used to indicate the difference in recombination efficiency between roxCre1 and roxCre7 first. The fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunostaining results showed no leakiness in <italic>R26-DreER;Alb-roxCre1-tdT;R26-GFP</italic> and <italic>R26-DreER;Alb-roxCre7-GFP;R26-tdT</italic> (Figure S3C-F). Nevertheless, both two versions of mCre efficiently labeled all targeted cells (Figure S3C-E, G) due to the easy-to-recombine characteristic of <italic>R26-GFP</italic> and <italic>R26-tdT</italic>.</p>
<p>To evaluate a strong mCre, we attempted to target one of the most inert alleles for recombination, <italic>R26-Confetti</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, which is often used as reporters for clonal analysis due to its sparse labeling with rare recombination events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. According to the Cre-loxP recombination principle, Cre can remove the sequence between two loxP sites that have the same transcription direction and turn over the sequence in the middle of two loxP sites that have the opposite transcription direction. As the recombination efficiency of CreER is limited, <italic>R26-Confetti</italic> can only be recombined into YFP, or nGFP (nuclear GFP), or mCFP (membrane CFP), or RFP (Figure S4A).</p>
<p>We crossed <italic>R26-DreER;R26-Confetti</italic> mice with <italic>Alb-roxCre1-tdT</italic> (group 1) and <italic>Alb-roxCre7-GFP</italic> (group 2) mice, and Tam-induced Dre-rox recombination yielded <italic>Alb-mCre1-tdT</italic> and <italic>Alb-mCre7-GFP</italic> mice, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In this system, the constitutively active mCre would completely remove the sequence between two loxP sites that have the same transcription direction and recombine <italic>R26-Confetti</italic> into two sets of reporter pairs: YFP-nGFP pair and mCFP-RFP pair, which could be detected in a single hepatocyte due to the poly-nuclear or polyploidy feature of hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In each pair, reporters can equally express, as mCre is strong enough to turn over the sequence in the middle of two loxP sites that have the opposite transcription direction (Figure S4B). Therefore, we used YFP/mCFP to detect mCre recombination efficiency and tdT/RFP or GFP to trace its endogenous reporter activity that was driven by Alb promoter in <italic>Alb-mCre1-tdT</italic> and <italic>Alb-mCre7-GFP</italic> mice, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).

<p>In fact, DreER-rox recombination in hepatocytes is not 100%. Therefore, we quantified YFP and mCFP expression in hepatocytes with DreER-rox recombination to evaluate the strength of mCre activity. We found sparse YFP<sup>+</sup> or mCFP<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes (0.39 ± 0.04%) in <italic>Alb-CreER;R26-Confetti</italic> mice. However, 99.94 ± 0.02% of tdT<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes (DreER recombined) were YFP<sup>+</sup> or mCFP<sup>+</sup> in <italic>R26-DreER;Alb-roxCre1-tdT;R26-Confetti</italic> mice; and 76.83 ± 3.20% of GFP<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes (DreER recombined) were YFP<sup>+</sup> or mCFP<sup>+</sup> in <italic>R26-DreER;Alb-roxCre7-GFP;R26-Confetti</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B, C</xref>).

Furthermore, we compared the recombination efficiency on <italic>R26-Confetti</italic> allele and found that the percentage of hepatocytes expressing YFP/mCFP was 1.08 ± 0.23% by <italic>Alb-CreER;R26-tdT2</italic>, 19.42± 3.71% by <italic>Alb-CreER;iSuRe-Cre</italic>; and 100.00 ± 0.00% by <italic>Alb-CreER;R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Together, these findings collectively indicate that the mCre, when released from the <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> construct, exhibits a significantly enhanced recombination efficiency.

<p>To investigate whether <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> enables <italic>Alb-CreER</italic> to more efficiently delete genes, we crossed <italic>Alb-CreER;R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> with <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> to generate <italic>Alb-CreER;R26-loxCre-tdT</italic>;<italic>Ctnnb1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice for evaluating the efficiency of releasing mCre and also mCre-mediated <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> deletion in tdT<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>).

Firstly, the FACS and immunostaining data showed no leakiness in <italic>Alb-CreER;R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> (Figure S8A).

<p>We next elucidate whether the significant superiority of <italic>Alb-CreER;R26-loxCre-tdT;Ctnnb1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> in the above data is attributed to low Tam dosage, which may reduce Tam toxicity and side effects. Initially, we treated <italic>Alb-CreER;R26-tdT;Ctnnb1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>mice with one dosage of Tam and subsequently sorted out tdT<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes for qRT-PCR against <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> 4 weeks after Tam treatment. The results indicated that <italic>Alb-CreER</italic> with a single dose of Tam, without the assistance of <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic>, was insufficient to knock out <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> (Figure S8B-D). Next, we conducted an experiment involving a proportional gradient of the Tam dosages, in which we gave five dosages, one dosage, one-fifth of one dosage, one-twenty-fifth of one dosage, and one-hundred-twenty-fifth of one dosage of Tam to <italic>Alb-CreER;R26-loxCre-tdT;Ctnnb1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>mice, respectively. We analyzed samples 3 weeks after Tam’s treatment. The FACS results showed that five groups of the proportional gradient of the Tam dosages labeled a gradient of tdT<sup>+</sup> cells: 94.33±0.76%, 90.14±0.41%, 57.07±0.51%, 27.30±2.35%, and 1.27±0.54% (Figure S8E), respectively. We sorted out tdT<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes from each group for qRT-PCR against <italic>Ctnnb1</italic>. Our finding revealed that varying doses of Tam treatment primarily affect the target cell ratio but do not influence the high recombination efficiency of mCre at loxP sites within the <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> allele (Figure S8E-F). Additionally, the immunostaining analysis revealed a noticeable trend, in which the proportion of GS<sup>+</sup> or E-CAD<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes was in decreased tendency with the increase of target tdT<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes (Figure S8F-G). This observation can be attributed to the significant knockout of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> in tdT<sup>+</sup> cells (Figure S8E-F).</p>
<p>Together, the combined results lead to the conclusion that <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> significantly enhances the recombination efficiency of CreER, facilitating the targeting of genes that are challenging to manipulate by traditional CreER-loxP recombination. Furthermore, the tdT component in <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> enables precise tracing of the modified cell lineage, which accurately investigates the roles of genes in various biological processes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that the <italic>rox</italic>-<italic>Stop-rox</italic> insert placed in front of <italic>Cre</italic> does not effectively prevent the leakiness of Cre in the Rosa26 allele. To address this issue, we modified <italic>Cre</italic> by inserting the <italic>RSR</italic> cassette into its coding region, thereby dividing Cre into its N- and C-terminal segments. Our study showed that the developed roxCre not only eliminates leakage but also enables the release of mCre for targeted gene manipulation in specific cell subpopulations through the promotion of DreER. According to the construction of roxCre, we advanced to develop <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic>, which significantly enhances the efficiency of inducible Cre-mediated gene manipulation, particularly when employing less effective CreER drivers for gene functional exploration.</p>
<p>Assuming successful gene deletion in the cell type of interest depends on efficient cell labeling by a lineage-specific reporter mediated by the same Cre is unrigorous, as recombination efficiency varies significantly among different mouse lines. Our data clearly showed the differences in recombination efficiency of different alleles (e.g. <italic>R26-tdT</italic>, <italic>R26-tdT2</italic>, and <italic>R26-Confetti</italic>), even located in the same genomic locus (e.g. Rosa26) mediated by the same CreER under the same Tam treatment protocol (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, and Figure S8D). However, <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> can be efficient for recombination mediated by CreER and release mCre in targeted cells, thus enabling efficient and accurate manipulating of cells of interest.</p>
<p>Compared to the previously reported transgenic mice line, <italic>iSuRe-Cre</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> shows more stable and robust enhancement in the efficiency of CreER recombination (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>), avoiding the toxic effects resulting from high-dose of Tam. This advancement significantly improves the reliability of genetic manipulation and cell fate lineage tracing, making <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> a valuable tool for researchers investigating cellular functions and behaviors. The research group of the iSuRe-Cre system recently reported a new system, named iSuRe-HadCre, which demonstrated to be effective in deleting floxed genes while avoiding the toxicity of constitutive Cre<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> Further studies can be carried out to compare the recombination enhancement between <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> and <italic>iSuRe-HadCre</italic>. Given the high recombination efficiency of mCre, we envision that loxCre can be used for mosaic analysis, where multiple alleles in individual cells need to be efficiently recombined for evaluation of cell-autonomous gene function with genetic labeling.</p>
<p>Importantly, Cre toxicity represents a substantial concern. The toxicity may stem from the administration of Tam/4-OHT and the constitutive expression of Cre driven by specific promoters, including <italic>CD4</italic>, <italic>Ins2</italic>, and <italic>Myh6</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Cre toxicity has been shown to impact diverse cellular processes, including DNA damage, cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, inflammation, metabolic signaling, and genetic dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Although roxCre and loxCre can mitigate the toxicity associated with high-dose Tam, they cannot eliminate the Cre toxicity, as mCre is constitutively expressed following recombination. Considering the lack of Cre toxicity evaluation of the newly developed mouse lines in this study, Cre toxicity should be taken into account in future biological functional studies involving roxCre and loxCre systems. Furthermore, to optimize the robustness and rapidity of Cre expression while minimizing the toxic effects associated with constitutive Cre, further development of iterated Cre removal system should be carried out for both loxCre and roxCre systems in the future.</p>
<p>Wnt-β-catenin plays an important role in liver development, zonation, homeostasis, and diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The administration of five doses of Tam in <italic>Alb-CreER</italic> mice did not impact downstream protein GS expression due to not knocking out <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> completely. However, a single dose of Tam could effectively induce a significant knockout of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> through <italic>Alb-CreER;R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). This indicates that <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> can assist CreER in addressing challenging recombined loxP sits. Notably, <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> can release mCre by CreER-mediated activation and report tdT expression across all cells that express the recombinase. Therefore, this system does not produce a gradient of reporter fluorescence reflective of the promoter activity of CreER. Consequently, it’s advisable not to use <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> with a nonspecific and unstable CreER mouse line, which would amplify the CreER mouse line’s weakness and result in unanticipated nonspecific cell-targeting.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the strategy of roxCre further enhances the precision for cell fate mapping with genetic deletion simultaneously in Dre<sup>+</sup>Cre<sup>+</sup> cells through intersectional genetic targeting. For example, we have showcased the strength of roxCre for genetic manipulation in peri-central hepatocytes, resulting in efficient gene knockout in tdT<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes specifically (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Additional roxCre mouse lines driven by different promoters can serve as valuable tools for detailed investigations into specific cell subpopulations. By using roxCre, studies can achieve precise spatial and temporal control of gene expression, facilitating targeted analysis that contributes to the knowledge of developmental biology, disease mechanisms, and potential therapeutic interventions.</p>
<p>Previous studies have used Cre-loxP to simultaneously over-express gene and fluorescence reporter in a cell for functional genetic mosaic (ifgMosaic) analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. However, ifgMosaic could not take advantage of the abundant resources from existing available floxed mouse lines for loss-of-function study. Mosaic mutant analysis with spatial and temporal control of recombination (MASTR) utilized FlpoER for tissue-specific expression of GFPCre to delete floxed genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Compared with FlpoER lines, CreER is a more broadly used recombinase that most laboratories use in gene deletion experiments. A recent study using dual recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (MADR) also permits stable labeling of mutant cells expressing transgenic elements from defined chromosomal loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. However, the use of viruses and electroporation, albeit convenient and rapid, are inefficient to specifically target any type of cells for <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. The powerful mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) enables simultaneous lineage tracing of a pair of mutant and control sibling cells with distinct fluorescence reporters, allowing precise mosaic analysis of gene function in any cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the MADM cassette has to be combined with the mutant null allele, which is not readily available for synchronizing reporter expression and genetic modification in cells of interest. The ensured gene deletion with tdT reporter by <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> could be coupled with present CreER and loxP alleles for potential mosaic analysis. This could be achieved by adjusting Tam at a lower dosage so that the recombination efficiency to release mCre could be low in cells of interest for sparse tdT labeling. We believe that <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> could be useful for robust, efficient, and temporal gene deletion at a population level and mosaic analysis at a single-cell level with improvement in the future.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we developed two novel genetic tools, roxCre and loxCre, permitting efficient recombination to release mCre, which greatly enhanced the effectiveness of subsequent gene deletion in tdT<sup>+</sup> cells, thus facilitating further detailed characterization of these cells both <italic>in situ</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic>. These tools are particularly beneficial when utilizing less effective DreER or CreER drivers to better elucidate the roles of specific genes in biological processes, facilitating more robust studies.</p>

<title>Immunostaining</title>
<p>Immunostaining was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. 0.2% PBST was prepared with 0.2% (vol/vol) Triton X-100(Sigma, T9284) dissolved in PBS. Tissue sections were blocked with 2.5% normal donkey serum and 0.1% 4’6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Invitrogen, D21490) dissolved in 0.2% PBST for 30 mins after washing with PBS three times. The tissue sections were incubated with primary antibody diluted in 0.2% PBST at 4°C overnight. On the next day, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in 0.2% PBST at room temperature for 30 min, followed by PBS washing for three times. The slides were washed with PBS for three times. The slides were mounted with a mounting medium (Vector Lab). For weak signals, the endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched before blocking. Horseradish peroxidase or biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies and a Tyramide signal amplification kit (PerkinElmer) were used after incubating the primary antibodies. For primary antibodies of murine origin, mouse immunoglobulins were blocked with an anti-mouse Fab antibody (Jackson, 715-007-003, 1:100). The included primary antibodies are listed as follows: tdT (Rockland, 600-401-379, 1:500; or Rockland, 200-101-379, 1:500), GFP (Invitrogen, A11122, 1:500), GFP (Rockland, 600-101-215M, 1:500), GFP (Nacalai, 04404-84; 1:500), GS (Abcam, ab49873, 1:1000), β-catenin (BD Pharmingen, 610153, 1:200), E-CAD (R&amp;D, AF748, 1:500), Ep-CAM (Abcam, ab92382, 1:500), VE-Cad (R&amp;D, AF1002, 1:100), and CYP2E1(Abcam, ab28146, 1:100). The corresponding secondary antibodies (JIR or Abcam) were diluted according to the instructions. Images were captured by using a Nikon confocal (Nikon A1 FLIM) or an Olympus confocal (FV3000), and captured images were analyzed by Image J2 (version 2.9.0/1.54f) and Photoline (version 23.02) software. We collected five random fields from each liver section for quantification. Mutant and control sections were processed at the same time to avoid potential batch differences during staining. Imaging of all immunostained slides was performed under the same exposure and contrast conditions using the same confocal microscope.</p>

<title>Hepatocyte dissociation</title>
<p>Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated by the two-step collagenase perfusion method, which was modified from a previous protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Briefly, mice were anesthetized and the liver was exposed through an incision in the lower abdomen. The inferior vena cava and portal vein were also exposed. A needle was inserted into the inferior vena cava and secured with a hemostatic clamp around the needle. The portal vein was cut immediately when the mouse liver was perfused with a perfusion medium buffer (containing 0.5 mM EGTA) for 5 minutes using a peristaltic pump. Then, the liver was perfused with medium containing collagenase type I (150 U/ml; Gibco, 17100-017) for 2-5 min to adequately digest the liver. After the gallbladder was removed, the liver was dissected with cold DMEM to free the hepatic cells. Then the cell suspension was passed through a 70-μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences, 352350) and centrifuged at 50 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and cells were resuspended in Percoll (GE Healthcare, 17-0891-01)/DMEM/10 x PBS (Sangon, B548117, diluted in 1:1) (1:1:0.1) mixture and centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. After the supernatant was removed, cells were dissected with cold DMEM and centrifuged at 50 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. Purified hepatocytes were collected for FACS analysis, qRT-PCR or Western Blot analysis.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Each pot in every graph represented one individual mouse. The quantification of each mouse based on the fluorescence images was performed by counting the average data of five 10x fields from different sections. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (Version 9.5.1). All the continuous variables were expressed as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). One-way ANOVA was used to detect statistical significance between three experimental groups. The statistical difference between the two experimental groups was determined using the unpaired student’s <italic>t</italic> test. The probability (<italic>P</italic>) values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The equation, Log(agonist) vs. response – Variable slope (four parameters) in Prism, was adapted for the dose-response curve for the proportional gradient of the Tam dosages experiment analysis, with a confidence interval of 95%.</p>

<p>This is a simple and potentially valuable approach to reduce Cre leak in amplified systems designed to improve CreER use across alleles. The revised work is improved with a direct comparison to the Benedito iSure-Cre line, providing some practical guidance for investigators. The authors do not address the issue of Cre toxicity or mosaic efficiency with low Tamoxifen use.</p>
<p>The major improvement in my mind is the inclusion of Supp Fig 7 where the authors compare their loxCre to iSureCre. The discussion is somewhat improved, but still fails to discuss significant issues such as Cre toxicity in detail. As noted by most reviewers, without a biological question, the paper is entirely a technical description of a couple of new tools. Whether and to what extent journals such as eLife should publish every new technical innovation without rigorous functional comparison to prior tools is an important question raised by this study. There is already a plethora of available techniques, most of which look better on paper than they function in mice.</p>
<p>However, I do feel that these tools will be of potential use to the field.</p>

<p>This work presents new genetic tools for enhanced Cre-mediated gene deletion and genetic lineage tracing. The authors optimise and generate mouse models that convert temporally controlled CreER or DreER activity to constitutive Cre expression, coupled with the expression of tdT reporter for the visualizing and tracing of gene-deleted cells. This was achieved by inserting a stop cassette into the coding region of Cre, splitting it into N- and C-terminal segments. Removal of the stop cassette by Cre-lox or Dre-rox recombination results in the generation of modified Cre that is shown to exhibit similar activity to native Cre. The authors further demonstrate efficient gene knockout in cells marked by the reporter using these tools, including intersectional genetic targeting of pericentral hepatocytes.</p>
<p>The new models offer several important advantages. They enable tightly controlled and highly effective genetic deletion of even alleles that are difficult to recombine. By coupling Cre expression to reporter expression, these models reliably report Cre-expressing i.e. gene-targeted cells and circumvent false positives that can complicate analyses in genetic mutants relying on separate reporter alleles. Moreover, the combinatorial use of Dre/Cre permits intersectional genetic targeting, allowing for more precise fate mapping.</p>
<p>The study and the new models have also limitations. The demonstration of efficient deletion of multiple floxed alleles in a mosaic fashion, a scenario where the lines would demonstrate their full potential compared to already existing models, has not been tested in the current study. Mosaic genetics is increasingly recognized as a key methodology for assessing cell-autonomous gene functions. The challenge lies in performing such experiments, as low doses of tamoxifen needed for inducing mosaic gene deletion may not be sufficient to efficiently recombine multiple alleles in individual cells while at the same time accurately reporting gene deletion. In addition, as discussed by the authors, a limitation of this line is the constitutive expression of Cre, which is associated with toxicity in some cases.</p>

<p>Shi et al describe a new set of tools to facilitate Cre or Dre-recombinase-mediated recombination in mice. The strategies are not completely novel but have been pursued previously by the lab, which is world-leading in this field, and by others. The authors report a new version of the iSuRe-Cre approach, which was originally developed by Rui Benedito's group in Spain. Shi et al describe that their approach shows reduced leakiness compared to the iSuRe-Cre line. Furthermore, a new R26-roxCre-tdT mouse line was established after extensive testing, which enables efficient expression of the Cre recombinase after activation of the Dre recombinase. The authors carefully evaluated efficiency and leakiness of the new line and demonstrated the applicability by marking peri-central hepatocytes in an intersectional genetics approach. The paper represents the result of enormous, carefully executed efforts. Although I would have preferred to see a study which uses the wonderful new tools to address a major biological question, carefully conducted technical studies have an enormous value for the scientific community, clearly justifying publication.</p>
<p>The new mouse lines generated in this study will enhance the precision of genetic manipulation in distinct cell types and greatly facilitate future work in numerous laboratories. The authors expertly eradicated weaknesses from initial submissions. Remaining open questions regarding potential toxicity of expressing multiple recombinases and fluorescence reports were convincingly answered.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) It is a nice study but lacks some functional data required to determine how useful these alleles will be in practice, especially in comparison with the figure line that stimulated their creation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for this comment. For the usefulness of these alleles, Figure 3 shows that specific and efficient genetic manipulation of one cell subpopulation can be achieved by mating across the <italic>DreER</italic> mouse strain to the <italic>rox-Cre</italic> mouse strain. In addition, Figure 7 shows that <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> can effectively ensure Cre-loxP recombination on some gene alleles and for genetic manipulation. The expression of the tdT protein is aligned with the expression of the Cre protein (<italic>Alb roxCre-tdT</italic> and <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic>, Figure 2 and Figure 5), which ensures the accuracy of the tracing experiments. We believe more functional data can be shown in future articles that use mice lines mentioned in this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The data in Figure 5 show strong activity at the Confetti locus, but the design of the newly reported R26-loxCre line lacks a WPRE sequence that was included in the iSure-Cre line to drive very robust protein expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for bringing up this point in the manuscript. In the <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> mice knock-in strategy, the WPRE sequence is added behind the <italic>loxCre-P2A-tdT</italic> sequence, as shown in Supplementary Figure 9.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The most valuable experiment for such a new tool would be a head-to-head comparison with iSure (or the latest iSure version from the Benedito lab) using the same CreER and target foxed allele. At the very least a comparison of Cre protein expression between the two lines using identical CreER activators is needed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable and insightful comment. The comparison results of <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> with <italic>iSuRe-Cre</italic> using <italic>Alb-CreER</italic> and targeting <italic>R26-Confetti</italic> can be found in Figure 6, according to the reviewer’s suggestion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Why did the authors not use the same driver to compare mCre 1, 4, 7, and 10? The study in Figure 2 uses Alb-roxCre for 1 and 7 and Cdh5-roxCre for 4 and 10, with clearly different levels of activity driven by the two alleles in vivo. Thus whether mCre1 is really better than mCre4 or 10 is not clear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: or two mCre versions that work efficiently. For example, if <italic>Alb-mCre1</italic> was competitive with <italic>Cdh5-mCre10</italic>, we can use them for targeting genes in different cell types, broadening the potential utility of these mice.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Technical details are lacking. The authors provide little specific information regarding the precise way that the new alleles were generated, i.e. exactly what nucleotide sites were used and what the sequence of the introduced transgenes is. Such valuable information must be gleaned from schematic diagrams that are insufficient to fully explain the approach.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We appreciate your thoughtful suggestions. The schematic figures, along with the nucleotide sequences for the generation of mice, can be found in the revised Supplementary Figure 9.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The scenario where the lines would demonstrate their full potential compared to existing models has not been tested.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your thoughtful and constructive comment. The comparative analysis of <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> with <italic>iSuRe-Cre</italic>, employing <italic>Alb-CreER</italic> to target <italic>R26-Confetti</italic>, is provided in Figure 6.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The challenge lies in performing such experiments, as low doses of tamoxifen needed for inducing mosaic gene deletion may not be sufficient to efficiently recombine multiple alleles in individual cells while at the same time accurately reporting gene deletion. Therefore, a demonstration of the efficient deletion of multiple floxed alleles in a mosaic fashion would be a valuable addition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your constructive comments. Mosaic analysis using sparse labeling and efficient gene deletion would be our future direction using roxCre and loxCre strategies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. When combined with the confetti line, the reporter cassette will continue flipping, potentially leading to misleading lineage tracing results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your professional comments. Indeed, the confetti used in this study can continue flipping, which would lead to potentially misleading lineage tracing results. Our use of <italic>R26-Confetti</italic> is to demonstrate the robustness of mCre for recombination. Some multiple-color mice lines that don’t flip have been published, for example, R26-Confetti2(PMID: 30778223) and Rainbow (PMID: 32794408). These reporters could be used for tracing Cre-expressing cells, without concerns of flipping of reporter cassettes.</p>

<p>(4) Constitutive expression of Cre is also associated with toxicity, as discussed by the authors in the introduction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your professional comments. The toxicity of constitutive expression of Cre and the toxicity associated with tamoxifen treatment in CreER mice line (PMID: 37692772) are known to the field. This study can’t solve the toxicity of the constitutive expression of Cre in this work. Many mouse lines with constitutive Cre driven by different promoters are present across various fields, representing similar toxicity. To solve this issue, it would be possible to construct a new strategy that enables the removal of Cre after its expression.</p>

<p>(2) I would have preferred to see a study, which uses the wonderful new tools to address a major biological question, rather than a primarily technical report, which describes the ongoing efforts to further improve Cre and Dre recombinase-mediated recombination.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We gratefully appreciate your valuable comment. The roxCre and loxCre mice mentioned in this study provide more effective methods for inducible genetic manipulation in studying gene function. We hope that the application of our new genetic tools could help address some major biological questions in different biomedical fields in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Very high levels of Cre expression may cause toxic effects as previously reported for the hearts of Myh6-Cre mice. Thus, it seems sensible to test for unspecific toxic effects, which may be done by bulk RNA-seq analysis, cell viability, and cell proliferation assays. It should also be analyzed whether the combination of R26-roxCre-tdT with the Tnni3-Dre allele causes cardiac dysfunction, although such dysfunctions should be apparent from potential changes in gene expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry that we mistakenly spelled <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> into <italic>R26-roxCre-tdT</italic> in our manuscript. We have not generated the <italic>R26-roxCre-tdT</italic> mouse line. We also thank the reviewer for concerns about the toxicity of high Cre expression. The toxicity of constitutive expression of Cre and the toxicity of tamoxifen treatment of CreER mice line (PMID: 37692772) are known to the field. This study can’t solve the toxicity of the constitutive expression of Cre in this work. Many mouse lines with constitutive Cre driven by different promoters are present across various fields, representing similar toxicity. To solve this issue, it would be possible to construct a new strategy that enables the removal of Cre after its expression.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Is there any leakiness when the inducible DreER allele is introduced but no tamoxifen treatment is applied? This should be documented. The same also applies to loxCre mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this study, we come up with new mice tool lines, including <italic>Alb roxCre1-tdT</italic>, <italic>Cdh5 roxCre4-tdT</italic>, <italic>Alb roxCre7-GFP</italic>, <italic>Cdh5 roxCre10-GFP</italic> and <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic>. As the data shown in Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 2, and Figure 4D, <italic>Alb roxCre1-tdT</italic>, <italic>Cdh5 roxCre4-tdT</italic>, <italic>Alb roxCre7-GFP</italic>, <italic>Cdh5 roxCre10-GFP</italic> and <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> are not leaky. Therefore, if there is any leakiness driven by the inducible DreER or CreER allele, the leakiness is derived from the DreER or CreER. Additional pertinent experimental data can be referenced in Figure S4C, Figure S7A-B, and Figure S8A.</p>

<p>(5) It would be very helpful to include a dose-response curve for determining the minimum dosage required in Alb-CreER; R26-loxCre-tdT; Ctnnb1flox/flox mice for efficient recombination.</p>

<p>(6) In the liver panel of Figure 4F, tdT signals do not seem to colocalize with the VE-cad signals, which is odd. Is there any compelling explanation?</p>

<p>The staining in Figure 4F in the revision is intended to deliver optimized and high-resolution images.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The authors claim that &quot;virtually all tdT+ endothelial cells simultaneously expressed YFP/mCFP&quot; (right panel of Figure 5D). Well, it seems that the abundance of tdT is much lower compared to YFP/mCFP. If the recombination of R26-Confetti was mainly triggered by R26-loxCre-tdT, the expression of tdT and YFP/mCFP should be comparable. This should be clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you so much for your careful check. We checked these signals carefully and didn't find the “much lower” tdT signal. As the file-loading website has a file size limitation, the compressed image results in some signal unclear. We attached clear high-resolution images here. Author response image 2 shows how we split the tdT signal and compared it with YFP/mCFP.</p>

<p>(8) In several cases, the authors seem to have mixed up &quot;R26-roxCre-tdT&quot; with &quot;R26-loxCre-tdT&quot;. There are errors in #251 and #256.Furthermore, in the passage from line #278 to #301. In the lines #297 and #300 it should probably read &quot;Alb-CreER; R26-loxCretdT; Ctnnb1flox/flox&quot; rather than &quot;Alb-CreER;R26-tdT2;Ctnnb1flox/flox&quot;.</p>

<p>(1) However, for it to be useful to investigators a more direct comparison with the Benedito iSure line (or the latest version) is required as that is the crux of the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for emphasizing this point, which we have now addressed in the revised manuscript and Figure 6.</p>

<p>(2) I would like to know how the authors will make these new lines available to outside investigators.</p>

<p>Please contact the lead author by email to consult about the availability of new mouse lines developed in this study.</p>

<p>(1) Assessing the efficiency and accuracy of the lines in mosaic deletions of multiple alleles and reporting them in single cells after low-dose tamoxifen exposure would be highly beneficial to demonstrate the full potential of the models.</p>

<p>We appreciate your careful consideration of this issue. Our future endeavors will focus on mosaic analysis utilizing sparse labeling and efficient gene deletion, employing both roxCre and loxCre strategies.</p>

<p>(2) Performing FACS analysis to confirm that all targeted (Cre reporter-positive) cells are also tdT-positive would provide more precise data and avoid vague statements like 'virtually all' or 'almost complete' in the results section:</p>
<p>Line 166: Although mCre efficiently labeled virtually all targeted cells (Figure S3A-E)...</p>
<p>Line 293: ... and not a single tdT+ hepatocyte 293 expressed Cyp2e1 (Figure 6D)... However, the authors do not provide any quantification. FACS would be ideal here.</p>
<p>Line 244: ...expression of beta-catenin and GS almost disappeared in the 4W mutant sample... The resolution in the provided PDF is not adequate for assessment.</p>
<p>Line 296: ... revealed almost complete deletion of Ctnnb1 in the Alb-CreER;R26-tdT2;Ctnnb1flox/flox mice...</p>

<p>Thank you for suggesting these improvements, which have strengthened the robustness of our conclusions. In the revised version, we have incorporated FACS results that correspond to related sections. Additionally, a quantification statement has been included in the statistical analysis section. We appreciate your meticulous review and comments, which have significantly improved the clarity of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In the beginning of the results section, it is not clear which results are from this study and which are known background information (like Figure 1A). For example, it is not clear if Figure 1C presents data from R26-iSuRe-Cre. Please revise the text to more clearly present the experimental details and new findings.</p>

<p>Thank you for this observation. Figure 1C belongs to this study, and the revised version has been modified to the related statement for improved clarity.</p>

<p>(4) Experimental details regarding the genetic constructs and genotyping of the new knock-in lines are missing. Are R26 constructs driven by the endogenous R26 promoter or were additional enhancers used?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for emphasizing this point. The schematic figures and nucleotide sequences for the generation of mice can be found in the revised Supplementary Figure 9, which can help to address this issue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The method used to quantify mCre activity in terms of reporter+ target cells is not specified. From images or by FACS?</p>
<p>Additionally, if images were used for quantification, it would be important to provide details on the number of images analyzed, the number of cells counted per image, and how individual cells were identified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We have included the quantification statement in the statistical analysis section. Analyzing <italic>R26-Confetti</italic>+ target cells using FACS is challenging due to the limitations of the sorting instrument. Consequently, we quantified the related data by images. Each dot on the chart represents one sample, and the quantification for each mouse was conducted by averaging the data from five 10x fields taken from different sections.</p>
