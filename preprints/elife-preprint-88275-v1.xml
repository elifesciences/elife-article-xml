<title>Abstract</title><p>A causal relationship exists among the aging process, organ decay and dis-function, and the occurrence of various diseases including cancer. A genetically engineered mouse model, termed <italic>Eklf</italic><sup>K74R/K74R</sup> or <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R), carrying mutation on the well-conserved sumoylation site of the hematopoietic transcription factor KLF1/ EKLF has been generated that possesses extended lifespan and healthy characteristics including cancer resistance. We show that the high anti-cancer capability of the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice are gender-, age-and genetic background-independent. Significantly, the anti-cancer capability and extended lifespan characteristics of <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice could be transferred to wild-type mice via transplantation of their bone marrow mononuclear cells. Targeted/global gene expression profiling analysis has identified changes of the expression of specific proteins and cellular pathways in the leukocytes of the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) that are in the directions of anti-cancer and/or anti-aging.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aging of animals, including humans, is accompanied by lifespan-dependent organ deterioration and the occurrence of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular failure and neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. To extend healthspan and lifespan, various biomedical-and biotechnology-related strategies have been intensively developed and applied, including the therapy of different diseases such as cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The hematopoietic/ blood system is an important biomedical target for anti-aging and anti-cancer research development. Multiple blood cell lineages arise from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), with the lymphoid lineage giving rise to T, B, and natural killer (NK) cell populations, whereas the myeloid lineage differentiates into megakaryocytes, erythrocytes, granulocytes, monocytes and macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The genetic constituents and homeostasis of the hematopoietic system are regulated epigenetically and via environmental factors to maintain animal health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>EKLF, also named KLF1, is a KrÃ¼ppel-like factor that is expressed in a range of blood cells including erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, T cells, NK cells, as well as in various hematopoietic progenitors including common-myeloid-progenitor, megakaryocyte-erythroid-progenitor (MEP), and granulocyte-macrophage-progenitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The factor regulates erythropoiesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and the differentiation of MEP to megakaryocytes and erythrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> as well as of monocytes to macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. EKLF is also expressed in HSC and regulates their differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. The factor can positively or negatively regulate transcription through binding of its zinc finger domain to the CACCC motif of the regulatory regions of a diverse array of genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>EKLF could be sumoylated <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and sumoylation of the lysine at codon 74 of mouse EKLF altered the transcriptional regulatory function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> as well as nuclear import<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> of the factor. Surprisingly, homozygosity of a single amino acid substitution, lysine(K) to arginine(R), at the sumoylation site of EKLF results in the generation of a novel mouse model with healthy longevity. These mice, termed <italic>Eklf</italic><sup>K74R/K74R</sup> or <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R), exhibited extended healthspan and lifespan. In particular, the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice showed delay of the age-dependent decline of physical performance, such as the motor function and spatial learning/memory capability, and deterioration of the structure/function of tissues including the heart, liver, and kidney. Furthermore, the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice appeared to have significantly higher anti-cancer capability than the WT mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As described in the following, we have since characterized the high anti-cancer capability of the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice with respect to its dependence on the age, gender and genetic background. More importantly, we have demonstrated that the high anti-cancer ability of these genetically engineered mice could be transferred to wild type mice (WT) through hematopoietic transplantation of the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC). Furthermore, we show that the higher anti-cancer capability and extended life span of <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice are associated with changes of the global protein expression profile and specific aging-/cancer-associated cellular signaling pathways in their white blood cells (WBC), or leukocytes.</p>

<title>Characterization of the cancer resistance of Eklf(K74R) mice in relation to age, gender, and genetic background</title>
<p>The <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice appeared to be cancer resistant to carcinogenesis as manifested by their lower spontaneous cancer incidence (12.5%) in life than WT mice (75%). The <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mutation also protected the mice from metastasis in the experimental metastasis assay and it reduced tumor growth in the subcutaneous cancer cell inoculation assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. We have used the pulmonary melanoma foci assay to further characterize the higher cancer resistance of the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice with respect to the effects of gender/age/genetic background of the mice and the requirement of the homozygous K74R mutation.</p>
<p>It appeared that male as well as female <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice in the B6 genetic background had significantly fewer pulmonary melanoma foci than the corresponding WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Because of this result, we used male mice for all of the studies describe below. First, both young (2-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice had higher anti-metastasis ability against the injected melanoma cells than WT mice of age-dependent groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Secondly, homozygosity of the K74R substitution was required for the higher cancer resistance of the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice (Figure S1). Consistent with the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice survived longer than the WT mice after the injection of B16-F10 cells. Importantly, the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice in the FVB background also exhibited high cancer resistance than FVB WT mice by this assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that cancer resistance of <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice conferred by the homozygous K74R substitution was likely genetic background-independent. Finally, the higher anti-cancer capability of the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice did not appear to depend on the arginine at codon 74, since <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74A) mice carrying KâA amino acid substitution at the K74 sumoylation site also exhibited higher anti-metastasis capability than WT mice in the pulmonary foci assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Transfer of the anti-cancer capability and extended lifespan of Eklf(K74R) mice to WT mice via BMT</title>
<p>Since EKLF is a hematopoietic transcription factor expressed not only in mature blood cells but also in HSCs and hematopoietic stem progenitor cells, this cancer resistance may be transferable by means of BMT. This possibility was tested with uses of male mice and a standard BMT protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. BMMNC were purified from the bone marrow of 2-month-old CD45.2 <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) or WT mice and injected into the tail vein of CD45.1 WT recipient mice. Blood replacement of recipient mice with 10Gy Î³-irradiation by that of the donor mice reached 90% at 7<sup>th</sup>-week (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). After 2 weeks, the recipient mice were injected with B16-F10 cells and then sacrificed a further 2 weeks later to quantify pulmonary tumor foci. We found that WT mice transplanted with WT BMMNC had similarly high numbers of tumor foci relative to WT mice without BMT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). However, similar to <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice challenged with B16-F10 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), WT mice that received BMMNC from <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice presented significantly fewer tumor foci on their lungs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Notably, BMT using 24-month-old donor mice gave similar result (Figure S2A). In order to determine if WT mice having more restricted blood replacement upon BMT from <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice still exhibited a higher anti-cancer capability, we also carried out BMT experiments with lower doses of Î³-irradiation. BMT using two lower doses of Î³-irradiation (2.5Gy/5Gy) still resulted in transfer of cancer resistance from <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) to WT mice. Approximately 40% of recipient blood cells were substituted by donor cells upon BMT with 5Gy Î³-irradiation. Consequently, at that irradiation dosage, BMT from <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mouse donors reduced the average number of pulmonary tumor foci in recipient WT mice to 5. On the other hand, only 20% blood replacement was achieved in the recipient mice with 2.5Gy</p>

<p>Î³-irradiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). However, the WT mice receiving BMT from <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice again developed less number (â¼10/mouse) of pulmonary tumor foci than those WT mice receiving BMT from the WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, even at a low level of 20% blood replacement, BMT still enabled effective transfer of cancer resistance from <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice to WT mice.</p>
<p>In addition, we also attempted to transfer the extended lifespan characteristics of the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice to WT mice by BMT. Significantly, the medium lifespan of WT mice receiving BMT from <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice was 5 months longer than that of WT mice receiving BMT from WT mice (Figure S2B). Thus, the longer lifespan characteristics of the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice was also transferable via BMT.</p>

<title>Inhibition of tumor growth by transplanted BMMNC from Eklf K74R) mice</title>
<p>Our experiments indicated that <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) bone marrow carried the anti-metastasis capability that prevented melanoma cell colonization on the lungs of recipient mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). To determine if <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) BMT could inhibit tumor growth, we examined the effect of BMT on growth of tumors with B16-F10-luc cells. As outlined in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, ten days after injection of cancerous cells, the formation of bioluminescent signals in the recipient mice were confirmed by the observation of <italic>in vivo</italic> bioluminescence. The following day, we transplanted the recipient mice with BMMNC from WT or <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice and then measured the intensities of bioluminescence signals from tumors 7 and 14 days later. As shown, tumor growth in mice subjected to BMT from <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice was significantly slower relative to those receiving BMMNC from WT mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). Thus, <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) BMMNC indeed can inhibit the growth of tumor more effectively than WT BMMNC.</p>

<title>Differential expression of specific immune-, ageing-and/or cancer-associated biomolecules in the blood of Eklf(K74R) mice</title>
<p>The K74R substitution did not alter the expression levels of EKLF in the bone marrow, fetal liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and the PB cells (Figure S1D), neither did it affect much the PB populations as shown by CBC analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. We further analyzed the PB populations by flow cytometry of WT and <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice of the ages 3 and 24 months, respectively. The frequency of <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) NK1.1<sup>+</sup> cells were higher than WT NK1.1<sup>+</sup> cells at aged mice. The latter observation correlated with the finding by Shyu <italic>et al.</italic> that the NKT cells in PB cells of 24-month-old <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice was higher than that of 24-month-old WT mice (Figure S3).</p>
<p>We first used RT-qPCR to analyze the levels in PB cells of mRNAs encoding the immune checkpoint genes (ICGs) PD-1/PD-L1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> in view of the cancer resistance of <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) as well as increased levels of PD-1 and PD-L1 in aged or tumorigenic mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, the mRNA levels of <italic>Pd-1</italic> and <italic>Pd-l1</italic> in the PB, B cells and T cells of WT mice were both increased during aging. In great contrast, the mRNA levels and protein levels of these two genes were lower in 3-month-old <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice than the age-matched WT mice, and they remained low during ageing of the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice. Importantly, EKLF positively regulated expression of both <italic>Pd-1</italic> and <italic>Pd-l1</italic> at the transcriptional level, as demonstrated by RNAi knockdown experiments in splenic CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). As expected, lower levels of <italic>Pd-1</italic> and <italic>Pd-11</italic> expression were also observed in the PB of mice receiving BMT from <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice (Figure S2C). These findings indicate that the low tumorigenesis rate of <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice arises in part from low expression of the ICGs, <italic>Pd-1</italic> and <italic>Pd-l1</italic>.</p>

<p>We have also examined, by bead-based multiplex assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, the expression patterns of several ageing-and/or cancer-associated cytokines. As shown in Figure S4, there was no significant difference in the serum levels of IL-1Î², IL-2, IL-10, IL-12p70, INF-Î³ or TNF-Î± between WT and <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice at 24-month-old. In contrast, the level of IL-4, an anti-inflammatory cytokine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> beneficial to the hippocampus of aging mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, in 24-month-old <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice was 3-4 fold higher than the 24-month-old WT mice. On the other hand, the level of IL-6, a key factor in chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmunity, cytokine storm and cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, increased only moderately during aging of the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice (Figure S4). Thus, similar to PD-1 and PD-L1, the altered expression of some of the cytokines in the blood likely contributes to the anti-aging and/or anti-cancer characteristics of the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice.</p>

<title>Comparative proteomics analysis of the leukocytes of Eklf(K74R) mice and WT mice</title>
<p>We proceeded to examine age-dependent cell-intrinsic changes in the proteomes of the leukocytes from the WT and <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice in two different age groups. 259 and 306 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified between the two age groups for the WT and <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice, respectively (Figure S5A). To understand the correlations of these proteins with aging and cancer, we performed the GSEA and found that the age-dependent DEPs changed in the concordant direction in the WT and <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice were enriched for several known aging-related pathways, e.g. IL-6-JAK-STAT3 signaling, DNA repair, etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (Figure S5B). Meanwhile, the age-dependent DEPs changed in the reverse directions in the WT and <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice were enriched for nine other aging-related pathways (Figure S5C).</p>
<p>We further performed DEP analyses between WT and <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice and identified strain-dependent DEPs in the two age groups. As shown in Figure S5D, only 7 DEPs were identified in the 3-month-old mice but 40 DEPs in the 24-month-old ones. Of the 40 DEPs in the elder mice, 3 and 37 were upregulated in <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) and WT mice, respectively (Figure S4D). Significantly, GSEA analysis of these DEPs showed that elder <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) leukocytes were enriched for the anti-aging pathways related to hypoxia, and p53 signaling, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, while the elder WT leukocytes were enriched for the aging-associated pathways related to apoptosis, and mTORC1 signaling, etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the DEPs in elder <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) leukocytes were also enriched for anti-cancer pathways related to the interferon-Î± response, and TGF-Î² signaling, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> (Figure S5E), while DEPs in the elder WT leukocytes were enriched for the pro-cancer pathways related to IL-6-JAK-STAT3 signaling and angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. These data together have demonstrated that <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) leukocytes contribute to their anti-cancer capability and long lifespan through several specific cellular signaling pathways.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Because of the complexity and intercrosses of the different pathways regulating the health and the aging process, genetic manipulation of non-human animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and non-genetic approaches on animals including human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> targeting these pathways inevitably lead to moderate-to-severe side effects such as body weight loss, adiposity, etc.. With respect to the above, the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> is ideal as an animal model for further insightful understanding of the ageing process as well as for biomedical development of new anti-ageing tools and approaches. Indeed, the studies reported above on the hematopoietic transfer of the anti-cancer capability and extended lifespan of <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice have demonstrated the feasibility of a novel hematopoietic blood system for anti-disease and anti-ageing.</p>
<p>The anti-cancer capability of the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice have rendered them relatively free from spontaneous cancer occurrence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, which is also reflected by their resistance to tumorigenesis of the B16-F10 cells and LLC1 cells in the cancer-growth inhibition assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Furthermore, the cancer resistance of <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice appears to be independent of the gender, age, and genetic background (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The anti-metastasis property of the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74A) mice in the pulmonary foci assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) also indicates that the anti-cancer capability of the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice is not due to the structural and/or post-translational properties of the arginine introduced at codon 74 of EKLF. Importantly, we have shown that the anti-cancer capability and the extended lifespan characteristics of <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice are transferrable through BMT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures. 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, and S2B). In particular, we show that BMMNC from <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and S2A) could confer 2-month-old WT recipient mice with the anti-cancer capability. Furthermore, â¼20% of blood substitution would allow the recipient mice to become cancer resistant in the pulmonary foci assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Also, WT mice receiving BMMNC at 2-month-old <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice would live longer than those receiving WT BMMNC (Figure S2B). In interesting parallel, infusion of HSC(K74R) could extend the life span of aged WT recipient mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Hematopoietic stem cell therapy for different diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> including cancer has been intensively explored and practiced such as leukemia, and neuroblastoma, etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Also, certain characteristics of the young mice could be transferred to old mice via heterochronic parabiosis or heterochronic transplantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Similarly, plasma proteins from human umbilical cord blood can revitalize hippocampal function and neuroplasticity in aged mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Thus, transplantation/transfer of the blood MNC carrying homozygous mutation at the sumoylation site of EKLF could be developed as a new approach for anti-cancer cell, long-term anti-aging and rejuvenation.</p>
<p>The tumorigenesis resistance and long lifespan exhibited by the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice are most likely due to changes in the transcription regulatory properties of the mutant EKLF(K74R) protein relative to WT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. As exemplified in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>, expression levels of the ICGs <italic>Pd-1</italic> and <italic>Pd-l1</italic> in the PB, B, and T cells of <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice are reduced in comparison to the WT mice. Notably, cancer incidence increases with aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, which is accompanied by increased expression of PD-1 and PD-L1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. The lower expression of ICGs would contribute to the anti-cancer capabilities of the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) blood to fight against cancer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and 3) and to extension of the lifespan of cancer-bearing mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Given that EKLF is expressed in HSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, B cells, T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, NK cells and macrophages (bio-GPS database), and that RNAi knockdown of <italic>Eklf</italic> expression significantly reduced <italic>Pd-1</italic> and <italic>Pd-l1</italic> mRNA levels in splenic CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), we assert that this protein is an upstream transcriptional regulator of the <italic>Pd-1</italic> and <italic>Pd-l1</italic> genes and, more generally, it regulates the transcriptomes of a diverse range of hematopoietic cells. Indeed, similar to ICGs, the expression levels of several cytokines in the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) blood/serum are also different from the WT blood and some of the changes during ageing or carcinogenesis in the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) blood are opposite to the blood/serum of WT mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> (Figure S4).</p>
<p>Previously, the transcriptome data have been used to dissect the regulation of leukocyte aging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. In addition, proteomic analysis has revealed the signaling pathways that regulate aging of specific types of leukocyte such as the lymphocyte and neutrophils cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. In this study, we have performed proteomics analysis of leukocytes from WT and <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice in two age groups, and found that for the elder mice, the strain-dependent DEPs in the leukocytes are enriched for a number of signaling pathways. Among these signaling pathways, at least 12 of them are closely associated with the aging process, which include hypoxia, DNA repair, etc. (Figure S5E). As summarized by the model in Figure S5F, it appears that changes of these pathways in the elder <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) leukocytes relative to the elder WT leukocytes are mostly in the direction of anti-aging. The data of Figure S4 together strongly suggest that the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) amino acid substitution causes a change in the global gene expression profile of the leukocytes, which contributes to the high anti-cancer capability and long lifespan of the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice.</p>
<p>In sum, we have characterized the cancer resistance of the <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice, among their other healthy characteristics, in relation to gender, age, and genetic background. We also have identified cell populations, gene expression profiles and cellular signaling pathways of the white blood cells of young and old mutant mice, in comparison to the WT ones, that are changed in the anti-cancer and/or anti-ageing directions. Finally, the transferability of the cancer resistance and extended life-span of the mutant mice via transplantation of BMMNC suggests the possibility of future development of hematopoietic blood cells genome-edited at the conserved sumoylation site of EKLF for anti-cancer and the extension of healthspan and/or lifespan in animals including human.</p>

<p>C57BL/6, B6, and FVB mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine). The B6 <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R), B6 <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74A) and FVB <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice were established with the assistance of the Transgenic Core Facility (TCF), IMB, Academia Sinica, Taiwan. As described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, the K74R mutation was introduced by homologous recombination into exon 2 (E2) of the <italic>Eklf</italic> gene of B6 mice by means of a recombinant retrovirus containing the construct loxP-PGK-gb2-neo-loxP-E2 (K74R), before excising the neomycin (neo) selection marker by crossing with Ella-Cre mice. The heterozygous <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R/+) mice were then crossed to obtain homozygous mutant <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R/K74R) mice, hereafter termed <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74A) mice were generated by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Female B6 mice (7-to 8-week-old) were mated with B6 males and the fertilized embryos were collected from the oviducts. For oligos injection, Cas mRNA (100 ng/Î¼l), sgRNA (50 ng/Î¼l), and donor oligos (100 ng/Î¼l) were mixed and injected into the zygotes at the pronuclei stage. The F0 mice were genotyped by PCR and DNA sequencing. The heterozygous <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74A/+) mice were crossed to establish the germ-line stable homozygous <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74A) F1 strain.</p>
<p><italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice in the FVB background were generated using an in vitro fertilization strategy. Briefly, sperm from male B6 <italic>Eklf</italic>(K74R) mice was used to fertilize FVB mouse oocytes. In vitro fertilizations of FVB oocytes were carried out consecutively for five generations. The resulting chimeric mice with &gt;90% FVB background were then crossed with FVB mice for another five generations or more.</p>

<p>Single cell suspensions of the peripheral blood cells and spleen tissue of B6 mice were prepared by lysing red blood cells and then passing them through a 40-Î¼m cell strainer (FalconÂ®). Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) were prepared as described below in the section <bold>Bone marrow transplantation (BMT)</bold>. The peripheral blood cells and splenocytes were stained extracellularly for 30 min at room temperature using different combinations of the following antibodies: anti-CD45.1 (eBioscience); anti-CD45.2 (eBioscience); anti-CD3e (eBioscience); anti-CD45R (eBioscience); anti-NK1.1 (eBioscience); anti-PD-1 (eBioscience) and anti-PD-L1 (eBioscience).

Full-scan MS was performed in the Orbitrap over a range of 400 to 2,000 Da and a resolution of 120,000 at m/z 400. Internal calibration was performed using the ion signal of [Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O]6H<sup>+</sup> at m/z 536.165365 as lock mass. The 20 data-dependent MS/MS scan events were followed by one MS scan for the 20 most abundant precursor ions in the preview MS scan. The m/z values selected for MS/MS were dynamically excluded for 40 sec with a relative mass window of 10 ppm. The electrospray voltage was set to 2.0 kV, and the temperature of the capillary was set to 200 Â°C. MS and MS/MS automatic gain control was set to 1,000 ms (full scan) and 200 ms (MS/MS), or to 3 Ã 106 ions (full scan) and 3,000 ions (MS/MS), for maximum accumulated time or ions, respectively.</p>

<title>Protein identification</title>
<p>Data analysis was carried out using Proteome Discoverer software (version 1.4, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The MS/MS spectra were searched against the SwissProt database using the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, version 2.5). For peptide identification, 10 ppm mass tolerance was permitted for intact peptide masses, and 0.5 Da for CID fragment ions with an allowance for two missed cleavages arising from trypsin digestion, oxidized methionine and acetyl (protein N-terminal) as variable modifications, and carbamidomethyl (cysteine) as a static modification. Peptide spectrum matches (PSM) were then filtered based on high confidence and a Mascot search engine ranking of 1 for peptide identification to ensure an overall false discovery rate &lt;0.01. Proteins with single peptide hits were removed from further analysis.</p>

Differential expression across groups was determined using the function âtest_diffâ based on protein-wise linear models combined with empirical Bayes statistics. Significantly differentially-expressed proteins were determined according to a P-value threshold of 0.01 and a fold-change (FC) &gt;1.5. To establish functional pathways enriched across groups, normalized data for each pair of compared groups were used to perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA v4.2.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> on selected MSigDB gene sets, including Hallmark (H), curated (C2), and immunologic signature (C7) gene sets, by using the default parameters.

<p>Wang et al present a <bold>useful</bold> manuscript that builds modestly on the group's previous publication on KLF1 (EKLF) K47R mice focused on understanding how Eklf mutation confers anticancer and longevity advantages in vivo (Shyu et al., Adv Sci (Weinh). 2022). The data demonstrates that Eklf (K74R) imparts these advantages in a background, age, and gender independent manner, not the consequence of the specific amino acid substitution, and transferable by BMT. However, the authors overstate the meaning of these results and the strength of evidence is <bold>incomplete</bold>, since only a melanoma model of cancer is used, it is unclear why only homozygous mutation is needed when only a small fraction of cells during BMT confer benefit, they do not show EKLF expression in any cells analyzed, and the PD-1 and PDL-1 experiments are not conclusive. The definitive mechanism relative to the prior publication from this group on this topic remains unclear.</p>

<p>The authors Wang et al. present a study of a mouse model K74R that they claim can extend the life span of mice, and also has some anti-cancer properties. Importantly, this mechanism seems to be mediated by the hematopoietic system, and protective effects can be transferred with bone marrow transplantation.</p>
<p>The authors need to be more specific in the title and abstract as to what is actually novel in this manuscript (a single tumor model), and what relies on previously published data (lifespan). Because many of these claims derive from previously published data, and the current manuscript is an extension of previously published work. The authors need to be more specific as to the actual data they present (they only use the B16 melanoma model) and the actual novelty of this manuscript.</p>
<p>Especially experiments on life span are published and not sufficiently addressed in this actual paper, as the title would suggest.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Wang et al. follows up on the group's previous publication on KLF1 (EKLF) K47R mice and reduced susceptibility to tumorigenesis and increased life span (Shyu et al., Adv Sci (Weinh). Sep 2022;9(25):e2201409. doi:10.1002/advs.202201409). In the current manuscript, the authors have described the dependence of these phenotypes on age, gender, genetic background, and hematopoietic translation of bone marrow mononuclear cells. Considering the current study is centered on the phenotypes described in the previous study, the novelty is diminished. Further, there are significant conceptual concerns in the study that make the inferences in the manuscript far less convincing. Major concerns are listed below:</p>
<p>1. The authors mention more than once in the manuscript that KLF1 is expressed in range of blood cells including hematopoietic stem cells, megakaryocytes, T cells and NK cells. In the case of megakaryocytes, studies from multiple labs have shown that while EKLF is expressed megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors, EKLF is important for the bipotential lineage decision of these progenitors, and its high expression promotes erythropoiesis, while its expression is antagonized during megakaryopoiesis. In the case of HSCs, the authors reference to their previous publication for KLF1's expression in these cells- however, in this study nor in the current study, there is no western blot documented to convincingly show that KLF1 protein is expressed at detectable levels in these cells. For T cells, the authors have referenced a study which is based on ectopic expression of KLF1. For NK cells, the authors reference bioGPS: however, upon inspection, this is also questionable.</p>
<p>2. The current study rests on the premise that KLF1 is expressed in HSCs, NK cells and leukocytes, and the references cited are not sufficient to make this assumption, for the reasons mentioned in the first point. Therefore, the authors will have to show both KLF1 mRNA and protein levels in these cells, and also compare them to the expression levels seen in KLF1 wild type erythroid cells along with knockout erythroid cells as controls, for context and specificity.</p>
<p>3. To get to the mechanism driving the reduced susceptibility to tumorigenesis and increased life span phenotypes in EKLF K74R mice, the authors report some observations- However, how these observations are connected to the phenotypes is unclear.</p>
<p>
a. For example, in Figure S3, they report that the frequency of NK1.1+ cells is higher in the mutant mice. The significance of this in relation to EKLF expression in these cells and the tumorigenesis and life span related phenotypes are not described. Again, as mentioned in the second point, KLF1 protein levels are not shown in these cells.</p>
<p>
b. In Figure 4, the authors show mRNA levels of immune check point genes, PD-1 and PD-l1 are lower in EKLF K74R mice in PB, CD3+ T cells and B220+ B cells. Again, the questions remain on how these genes are regulated by EKLF, and whether and at what levels EKLF protein is expressed in T cells and B cells relative to erythroid cells. Further, while the study they reference for EKLF's role in T cells is based on ectopic expression of EKLF in CD4+ T cells, in the current study, CD3+ T cells are used. Also, there are no references for the status of EKLF in B cells. These details are not discussed in the manuscript.</p>
<p>4. The authors perform comparative proteomics in the leukocytes of EKLF K74R and WT mice as shown in Figure S5. What is the status of EKLF levels in the mutant lysate vs wild type lysates based on this analysis? More clarity needs to be provided on what cells were used for this analysis and how they were isolated since leukocytes is a very broad term.</p>
<p>5. In the discussion the authors make broad inferences that go beyond the data shown in the manuscript. They mention that the tumorigenesis resistance and long lifespan is most likely due to changes in transcription regulatory properties and changes in global gene expression profile of the mutant protein relative to WT leukocytes. And based on reduced mRNA levels of Pd-1 Pd-l1 genes in the CD3+ T cells and B220+ B cells from mutant mice, they &quot;assert&quot; that EKLF is an upstream regulator of these genes and regulates the transcriptomes of a diverse range of hematopoietic cells. The lack of a ChIP assay to show binding of WT EKLF on genes in these cells and whether this binding is reduced or abolished in the mutant cells, make the above statements unsubstantiated.</p>
<p>6. Where westerns are shown, the authors need to show the molecular weight ladder, and where qPCR data are shown for EKLF, it will be helpful to show the absolute levels and compare these levels to those in erythroid cells, along the corresponding EKLF knock out cells as controls.</p>
<p>7. Figure S1D does not have a figure legend. Therefore, it is unclear what the blot in this figure is showing. In the text of the manuscript where they reference this figure, they mention that the levels of the mutant EKLF vs WT EKLF does not change in peripheral blood, while in the figure they have labeled WBCs for the blot, and the mRNA levels shown do seem to decrease in the mutant compared to WT peripheral blood.</p>

<p>Hung et al provide a well-written manuscript focused on understanding how Eklf mutation confers anticancer and longevity advantages in vivo. The work is fundamental and the data is convincing although several details remain incompletely elucidated. The major strengths of the manuscript include the clarity of the effect and the appropriate controls. For instance, the authors query whether Eklf (K74R) imparts these advantages in a background, age, and gender dependent manner, demonstrating that the findings are independent. In addition, the authors demonstrate that the effect is not the consequence of the specific amino acid substitution, with a similar effect on anticancer activity. Furthermore, the authors provide some evidence that PD-1 and PDL-1 are altered in Eklf (K74R) mice.</p>
<p>Finally, they demonstrate that the effects are transferrable with BMT. Several weaknesses are also evidence. For instance, only melanoma is tested as a model of cancer such that a broad claim of &quot;anti-cancer activity&quot; may be somewhat of an overreach. It is also unclear why a homozygous mutation is needed when only a small fraction of cells during BMT can confer benefit. It is also difficult to explain how transplanted donor Eklf (K74R) HSCs confer anti-melanoma effect 7 and 14 days after BMT. Furthermore, it would be useful to see whether there are virulence marker alterations in the melanoma loci in WT vs Eklf (K74R) mice. Finally, the data in Fig 4c is difficult to interpret as decreased PD-1 and PDL-1 after knockdown of EKLF in vitro is not a useful experiment to corroborate how mutation without changing EKLF expression impacts immune cells. The work is impactful as it provides evidence that healthspan and lifespan may be modulated by specific hematological mutation but the mechanism by which this occurs is not completely elucidated by this work.</p>
