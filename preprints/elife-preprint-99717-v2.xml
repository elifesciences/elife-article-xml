<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Despite its conserved basic structure, the morphology of the insect brain and the timing of its development underwent evolutionary adaptations. However, little is known about the developmental processes that create this diversity. The central complex is a brain centre required for multimodal information processing and an excellent model to understand neural development and divergence. It is produced in large parts by type-II neuroblasts, which produce intermediate progenitors, another type of cycling precursor, to increase their neural progeny. These neural stem cells are believed to be conserved among insects, but little is known on their molecular characteristics in insects other than flies. <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> has emerged as a valuable new insect model for brain development and evolution. However, type-II neuroblast lineages and their role in central complex development have so far not been studied in this beetle.</p>
<p>Using CRISPR-Cas9 we created a fluorescent enhancer trap marking expression of <italic>Tribolium fez/earmuff</italic>, a key marker for type-II neuroblast derived intermediate progenitors. Using combinatorial labelling of further markers including <italic>Tc-pointed</italic>, <italic>Tc-deadpan</italic>, <italic>Tc-asense</italic> and <italic>Tc-prospero</italic> we characterized the type-II neuroblast lineages present in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryo and their sub-cell-types. Intriguingly, we found 9 type-II neuroblast lineages per hemisphere in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryo while <italic>Drosophila</italic> produces only 8 per brain hemisphere. In addition, these lineages are significantly larger at the embryonic stage of <italic>Tribolium</italic> than they are in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and contain more intermediate progenitors. Finally, we mapped these lineages to the domains of early expressed head patterning genes. Notably, <italic>Tc-otd</italic> is absent from all type-II neuroblasts and intermediate progenitors, whereas <italic>Tc-six3</italic> marks an anterior subset of the type-II-lineages. The placodal marker <italic>Tc-six4</italic> specifically marks the territory where anterior medial type-II neuroblasts differentiate.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we identified a conserved pattern of gene expression in holometabolan central complex forming type-II neuroblast lineages, and conserved head patterning genes emerged as new candidates for conferring spatial identity to individual lineages. The higher number and greater lineage size of the embryonic type-II neuroblasts in the beetle correlate with a previously described embryonic phase of central complex formation which is not found in the fly. These findings stipulate further research on the causal link between timing of stem cell activity and temporal and structural differences in central complex development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neural development of insects allows to study molecular and cellular principles in easy to manipulate invertebrate models. The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<italic>Drosophila</italic> hereafter) has mostly been used for this purpose, making it one of the best understood models for neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. However, it has remained a puzzle how the huge ecological diversity of insects and the divergent neural anatomies that are adapted to different niches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] evolved. Furthermore, <italic>Drosophila</italic> may in many instances not be a good representation of insect development and some processes are derived in the fly lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. For these reasons the beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> (<italic>Tribolium</italic> hereafter) has been introduced as an additional model for insect neural development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. <italic>Tribolium</italic> is a grain storage pest and all stages live in flour, hence there is no major transition of habitat or lifestyle between the larval and adult stage as in flies. However, when compared to <italic>Drosophila</italic> the larvae are more mobile through the use of walking legs which allows them to navigate within or between food sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. In this beetle many molecular genetic manipulation and labelling methods have been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Specifically, labelling of neural cell types in <italic>Tribolium</italic> has been facilitated by the advent of CRISPR-Cas9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Another factor that makes <italic>Tribolium</italic> an informative model for the understanding of insect brain development is the more conserved development of the head neuroectoderm facilitating the identification of specific neurogenic domains and allowing cross-species comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>The insect central complex is an anterior, midline spanning neuropile and constitutes an important brain centre for the processing of sensory input, coordination of movement and navigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. The highly conserved basic structure of the central complex, along with diverse specifications in response to ecological requirements among different insect species, make this brain structure a very interesting model for evolutionary developmental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Between the two insect models <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Tribolium</italic> a temporal shift in the emergence of central complex neuropile was observed with <italic>Tribolium</italic> developing a functional larval central complex during embryogenesis whereas it develops only at the onset of adult life in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. It is however not known how these temporal differences are established during development on a cellular and molecular level.</p>
<p>The entire insect central nervous system including the brain is produced by neural stem cells, the neuroblasts (NBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. While there are evolutionary modifications in the relative position of trunk NBs and their gene expression profiles between fly and beetle, the core determinants specifying their role as neural progenitors are conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. NBs undergo repeated divisions producing rows of ganglion mother cells (GMCs) which divide one more time to produce neurons and/or glia (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, top panel). This leads to neural cell lineages that include the neuroblast itself and its progeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Several NBs of the anterior-most part of the neuroectoderm contribute to the central complex, which has been characterized as the most complex brain structure (apart from the optic lobe) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Intriguingly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in the grasshopper <italic>Schistocerca gregaria</italic> a neuroblast subtype, the type-II neuroblasts (type-II NBs), were found to prominently contribute to the formation of the central complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. These specific neuroblasts generate more offspring by producing another class of neural precursors, the intermediate progenitors (INPs), which also divide in a stem cell like fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, lower panel). Type-II NBs and INPs have attracted a lot of attention because intermediate, cycling progenitors have also been described in vertebrates, the radial glia cells, which produce a variety of cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. In addition, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain tumours have been induced from type-II NB lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], opening up the possibility of modelling tumorigenesis in an invertebrate brain, thus making these lineages one of the most intriguing stem cell model in invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].</p>

<caption><title>Neuroblasts of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system.</title>
<p>Type-I neuroblasts (type-I NBs) (top panel) and type-II neuroblasts (type-II NBs) (lower panel). Type-I NBs undergo stem-cell-like divisions with each round producing a ganglion mother cell (GMC) that divides one more time to produce two neurons or glia cells. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, all type-I NBs express <italic>dpn</italic> and <italic>ase</italic> whereas GMCs express only <italic>ase</italic>. Type-II NBs express <italic>dpn</italic> and <italic>pnt</italic> but not <italic>ase</italic>. They also undergo repeated divisions, with each round producing an intermediate progenitor cell (INP) which also is a proliferating progenitor and expresses <italic>ase</italic>. INPs undergo a maturation process during which <italic>pnt</italic> is still expressed initially, but not <italic>dpn</italic>. Mature INPs express <italic>dpn</italic>, <italic>ase</italic> and <italic>fez/erm</italic> whereas GMCs express <italic>ase</italic> and <italic>fez/erm</italic>. Type-II NB lineages are only found in the anterior brain, they produce central complex neurons and glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>].</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="592395v2_fig1.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>In the developing insect brain the number of neurons that is produced by each type-II NB is significantly larger than the offspring of a type-I NB. Medial <italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II NBs produce an average of 450 neurons whereas type-I NBs of the brain only generate 100-200 neurons each [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. This increased number of neural cells that are produced by individual type-II lineages along with the fact that neuroblast lineages can produce different types of neurons, leads to the generation of extensive neural complexity within the anterior insect brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Based on descriptions of large proliferative lineages in the grasshopper <italic>Schistocerca gregaria,</italic> a hemimetabolous insect distantly related to flies, it is widely believed that type-II NBs and INPs are conserved within insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. However, a molecular characterisation of such lineages that on the one hand will allow to test whether the cell type markers characterized in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are more widely conserved, and on the other hand will facilitate an identification of sub-cell types, has not been performed in an insect other than <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>
<p>Whereas it is widely believed that <italic>Tribolium</italic> does use type-II NB in central complex formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] their presence has so far not been unequivocally shown and a thorough comparison of type-II NB lineages and their sub-cell-types between the fly and the beetle model has been lacking.</p>
<p>The characterization of type-II NBs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has in large parts been based on a specific reporter line in which eGFP expression is driven by an <italic>earmuff (fez/erm)</italic> enhancer element and marks INP-lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. <italic>Tribolium earmuff</italic> has been first described as <italic>Tc-fez</italic>, referring to the vertebrate <italic>earmuff</italic> ortholog <italic>fez</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. We will use <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> in the following. A defined sequence of gene expression has been described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II NBs, INPs and GMCs. The ETS-transcription factor <italic>pointed</italic> (<italic>pnt</italic>) marks type-II NBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], which do not express the type-I NB marker <italic>asense</italic> (<italic>ase</italic>) but the neural gene deadpan (<italic>dpn</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Intermediate progenitors express <italic>fez/erm</italic> and <italic>ase</italic> and at a more mature stage also <italic>dpn</italic>, whereas <italic>prospero</italic> (<italic>pros</italic>) marks mature INPs and GMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. <italic>Six4</italic> is another marker for <italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II NBs and INPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present work we characterize type-II neuroblasts in <italic>Tribolium</italic> with respect to their number, their location and the conservation of the molecular markers known from <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We also wanted to test, in how far the earlier emergence of the central complex in beetles would be reflected by a change of division activity of type-II NBs or intermediate progenitors. To that end, we used CRISPR-Cas9 induced genome editing for creating a <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> enhancer trap line to characterize embryonic <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> -expressing cells including INPs and GMCs of type-II NB lineages and combined this line with other labelling methods including multicolour <italic>hybridisation chain reaction</italic> (HCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. We found that the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryo produces 9 <italic>Tc-pnt</italic>-expressing type-II NBs compared to only 8 type-II NB lineages in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. We show that these lineages produce central complex cells and confirm a largely conserved molecular code that differentiates INPs of distinct maturation stages and GMCs. Intriguingly, we found that lineage sizes in <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryos are considerably larger and include more mature INPs than in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. We also show that the placodal marker gene <italic>Tc-six4</italic> characterizes the embryonic tissue that gives rise to the larger anterior group of type-II NBs, whereas <italic>Tc-six3</italic> is marking only an anterior subset of these lineages. Interestingly there is a part of the central complex precursors expressing neither <italic>Tc-six3</italic> nor <italic>Tc-otd,</italic> which is absent from all type-II NB lineages.</p>

<title>A CRISPR-Cas9-NHEJ generated enhancer trap lines marks <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-expressing cells at the embryonic and larval stage</title>
<p>We created an enhancer trap line driving eGFP that reflects <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> gene expression in the embryo. We named the line <italic>fez magic mushrooms</italic> (fez-mm-eGFP) because it marks the mushroom bodies of the larval brain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A-C</xref>). The reporter construct was inserted 160 bp upstream of the <italic>fez/erm</italic>-transcription start site using the <italic>non-homologous end joining</italic> (NHEJ) repair mechanism (see supplementary Fig. S1 for scheme). Enhancer traps sometimes only reflect parts of a gene expression pattern, therefore we carefully evaluated eGFP co-expression with <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-RNA. We found that at the embryonic stage fez-mm-eGFP co-localized with most <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-expressing cells in an area that will give rise to the protocerebral structures mushroom bodies, larval eyes and central complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, panel D</xref>). The fez-mm-eGFP line marked several progenitor cell types including cells that we characterize as type-II NB-derived intermediate progenitors (see below). Based on these analyses, we use the fez-mm-eGFP expression as a reporter for <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> expression.</p>

The transcription factor <italic>pointed</italic> (<italic>pnt</italic>) marks type-II NBs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and is required for their correct differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. In both <italic>Tribolium</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>pnt</italic> is also expressed in other areas (this work/[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]). Therefore, we looked for <italic>Tc</italic>-<italic>pnt</italic> expression in large cells with large nuclei (typical NB morphology) that were closely associated with <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-expressing cells (marking putative INPs). We found a total of 9 such clusters instead of the 8 expected from flies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A-C</xref>). We also found that the large <italic>Tc-pnt</italic> expressing cells as well as fez-mm-eGFP expressing cells are mitotically active (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C-I</xref>). Further molecular and cell size analysis corroborated our interpretation that these cells constitute type-II NBs, intermediate progenitors (INPs) at different maturation stages and ganglion mother cells (GMCs) (see details below).</p>

<p>Looking at a series of embryonic stages we determined the emergence and further development of <italic>Tc-pnt</italic> and fez-mm-eGFP expressing lineages as well as their arrangement with respect to the embryonic head and to one another. We first detected conspicuous adjacent expression of <italic>Tc-pnt</italic> and fez-mm-eGFP at stage NS7 (not shown). At stage NS11 seven <italic>Tc-pnt</italic>-clusters are present in a horse-shoe-shaped formation surrounding fez-mm-eGFP positive cells (white arrows in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, star marks one cluster out of focus). At stage NS13 these groups are found in a position at the medial border of the head lobes and their number has increased to nine. The seven clusters that were already present at stage NS11 are arranged in an anterior group (white arrowheads in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) at stage NS13 while two additional clusters have emerged more posteriorly (yellow arrows in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-I</xref>). The clusters are in different depths (reflected by the three optical sections shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B-I</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">B-III</xref>, clusters out of focus are visualized by grey circles in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B’I-II</xref>, respectively). Fez-mm-eGFP expression not related to type-II NB offspring was found in the lateral head lobe from NS13 onwards (blue arrowheads in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). At stage NS14 six of the anterior-medial clusters are aligned in one plane along the medial rim of the developing brain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C-I</xref>), whereas the most posterior cluster of the anterior group is located at a separate position and in a deeper plane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-II</xref>). The posterior group is found at about the same focal plane as well (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C-II</xref>). The aligned six clusters produce their <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-positive offspring towards laterally whereas the <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-positive offspring of the more posterior cluster is found medially of it (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C-II</xref>). The two most posterior clusters produce <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-cells in an anterior-lateral direction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C-II</xref>). The apparent re-arrangement of the <italic>Tc-pnt</italic>-clusters from the anterior rim of the embryonic head to a medial position reflects not active migration but follows the overall tissue movements during head morphogenesis that was previously described in <italic>Tribolium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Based on their position by the end of embryogenesis (stage NS14) we assign the nine type-II NB clusters into two groups: one anterior median group consisting of seven type-II NBs and one posterior group consisting of two type-II NBs (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">D</xref>).</p>

<title>Characterization of cell- and nuclear size of <italic>pnt</italic>-positive type II NBs</title>
<p>We wanted to confirm that each of the <italic>Tc-pnt</italic> and <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> expressing lineages contains a neuroblast. Neuroblasts, including type-II NBs, are larger than other cells, have larger nuclei and are mitotically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Therefore, we determined the cell size of the largest cells of the <italic>Tc-pnt</italic> cluster and compared it to a random sample of cells of the embryonic head. Both samples were taken from stage NS13 and NS14 embryos. We found that the cells that we had assigned as Type-II NBs had a significantly larger diameter (av.: 12.98 µm; n=43) than cells of the reference sample (av.: 6.75 µm; n=1579) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). We also found that the diameters of nuclei of type-II NBs were significantly larger (av.: 8.73 µm; n=17) than the ones of a control sample (av.: 5.21 µm; n=1080) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Although type-II NBs were clearly larger than the average cell of the head lobes the control sample also contained cells of an equal size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>) which may constitute type-I NBs.</p>

<title>Conserved patterns of gene expression mark <italic>Tribolium</italic> type-II NBs, different stages of INPs and GMCs</title>
<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II NBs, INPs and GMCs express a specific sequence of genes including <italic>asense</italic> (<italic>ase</italic>), <italic>deadpan</italic> (<italic>dpn</italic>) and <italic>prospero</italic> (<italic>pros</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. However, these markers have up to now not been tested for expression in type-II lineages in other organisms. We tested if the respective lineages express these markers in a comparable sequence in the beetle and if they mark distinctive cell types within the lineages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 panel A-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. panel 6 A, B</xref>). We found that the large <italic>Tc-pnt</italic>-positive but fez-mm-eGFP negative cells (i.e. type-II NBs) express the gene <italic>Tc-dpn</italic>, in line with expression of this gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural precursors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, panel A</xref>). Like <italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II NBs, these cells do not express the type-I NB marker <italic>Tc-ase</italic> (yellow arrowhead in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, panel D</xref>). We further found additional cells directly adjacent of the type-II NBs itself which we believe are recently born immature INPs. They are <italic>Tc-pnt</italic>-positive but fez-mm-eGFP-negative and neither express <italic>Tc-ase</italic> (Fig. panel D, pink arrowheads). Expression of <italic>Tc-ase</italic> starts in the following in immature <italic>Tc-pnt</italic>-positive INPs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 panel D</xref>; blue arrowhead) and is maintained in INPs that are <italic>Tc-pnt</italic>-negative but are marked by fez-mm-eGFP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, panel D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">E</xref>). <italic>Tc-dpn</italic> is absent from immature <italic>Tc</italic>-<italic>pnt</italic>-positive INPs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, pink arrowhead) but is expressed in mature INPs (orange arrowheads in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, panel B</xref>). Cells that are located at the distal end of the lineages that do not express <italic>Tc</italic>-<italic>dpn</italic> but are positive for fez-mm<italic>-</italic>eGFP and <italic>Tc</italic>-<italic>ase</italic> are classified as GMCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, panels B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">E</xref>). We found the gene <italic>Tc-pros</italic> expressed in most fez-mm-eGFP expressing cells of a lineage (in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, panel A-B</xref>) and infer from the extent of the expression that it is expressed in mature INPs (<italic>Tc-dpn</italic>+) and GMCs (<italic>Tc-dpn-</italic>). Fez-mm-eGFP positive cells at the base of the lineage that do not express <italic>Tc-pros</italic> are immature INPs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, panel A, B</xref>; blue arrowheads). In summary, the expression dynamics found in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> type-II NB lineages are very similar to the one found in <italic>Drosophila.</italic> Therefore these neural markers can be used for a classification of cell types within the lineages into type-II NBs (<italic>Tc-pnt</italic>+, <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-, <italic>Tc-ase</italic>-, <italic>Tc-dpn</italic>+, <italic>Tc-pros</italic>-), immature-I INPs (<italic>Tc</italic>-<italic>pnt</italic>+, <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-, <italic>Tc-ase-, Tc-dpn-, Tc-pros-</italic>), immature-II INPs (<italic>Tc-pnt</italic>+, <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>+, <italic>Tc-ase</italic>+, <italic>Tc-dpn</italic>-, <italic>Tc-pros</italic>-), mature INPs (<italic>Tc-pnt</italic>-, <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>+, <italic>Tc-ase</italic>+, <italic>Tc-dpn</italic>+, <italic>Tc-pros</italic>+), and GMCs (<italic>Tc-pnt</italic>-, <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>+, <italic>Tc-ase</italic>+, <italic>Tc-dpn-, Tc-pros</italic>+).

<p>To test if the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryonic type-II NB lineages contribute to the beetle central complex like in the fly, we used the shaking hands<italic>-</italic> (skh-) reporter line that marks central complex neurons and their postmitotic embryonic precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. By co-staining for <italic>Tc-pnt</italic> and <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> RNA in the background of the skh-line we found that the skh-positive cells are located directly distally of the type-II NB lineages in a position where the type-II NBs derived neural cells are expected (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 panels A-B, E,F</xref>). Most skh-cells have switched off <italic>fez/erm</italic>-expression, but at the transition between <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> and skh cells we found some cells that express both markers (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 panel D, E</xref>), supporting the view that many skh-positive central complex cells stem from the <italic>fez</italic>-expressing GMCs of the type-II NB lineages (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 E</xref>).

<title>The <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryonic lineages of type-II NBs are larger and contain more mature INPs than those of <italic>Drosophila</italic></title>
<p>In beetles, a single-unit central body (most likely constituting the fan-shaped body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]) develops during embryogenesis and has gained functionality at the onset of larval life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. By contrast, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> central complex commissural tracts originating from type-II NBs form in the embryo but the type-II NB become quiescent and only resume divisions in the late larval stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. In stark contrast to <italic>Tribolium</italic> a functional central complex is only observed in the adult fly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. In addition, the volume of the L1 central brain including the central complex is about four times larger in <italic>Tribolium</italic> than it is in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>], while there are only small differences in the relative neuropilar volumes of the adult beetle and fly central bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. As type-II NBs contribute to central complex development we asked in how far the embryonic division pattern of these lineages in the beetle would reflect this heterochronic development. To assess the size of the embryonic type-II NB lineages in beetles we counted the <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> positive (fez-mm-eGFP) cells (INPs and GMCs) of the anterior medial group (type-II NB lineages 1-7). As we were not always able to distinguish between cells belonging to neighbouring INP-lineages we quantified and averaged the cell number of all lineages of the anterior medial group. We also evaluated the proportion of dividing cells in that group based on anti-PH3 staining (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that at stage NS13 (early retracting embryo) each lineage consisted on average of 18,4 progenitor cells and at stage NS14 (retracted embryo) of 16.8 progenitors. Between 5-10 % of the cells were marked by the PH3 antibody. As PH3 marks dividing cells in a specific phase, the portion of dividing cells may be higher. We further quantified the number of mature <italic>Tc-dpn</italic>-positive INPs (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).</p>

Our counts are based on <italic>Tc-pnt</italic> and fez-mm-eGFP expression and therefore mostly included progenitors. However, based on the small area of co-expression of <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> and skh-expression (see above/ <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">figure 8</xref>) they may also include some newly born neurons, but the counts in <italic>Drosophila</italic> included more mature neurons which further increases the difference in the number of progenitor cells between the two species and the observed difference in lineage size represents a minimum estimate.</p>

<p>Due to a lower quality of the image data from the posterior group which is in a deeper layer (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) we were not able to quantify cells of this cluster in <italic>Tribolium</italic>.

<title>Type-II NBs and their lineages are differentially marked by the head patterning transcription factors <italic>Tc-six4</italic> and <italic>Tc-six3</italic> but do not express <italic>Tc-otd</italic></title>
<p>The anterior-most embryonic insect head is divided into different territories by highly conserved developmental transcription factors that give rise to different parts of the protocerebrum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Hence, we wondered in which of these molecular territories subsets of type-II NB lineages are located, as neuroectoderm regionalization genes are candidates for giving specific spatial identities to individual lineages. We tested co-expression with the previously characterized head patterning transcription factors <italic>Tc-otd</italic>, <italic>Tc-six4</italic>, <italic>Tc-six3</italic>, known to be active in the developing protocerebrum (<italic>Tc-otd</italic>) and in the anterior medial region of the neuroectoderm, where type-II NBs emerge (<italic>Tc-six3</italic>, <italic>Tc-six4</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. We found no co-expression of fez-mm-eGFP marked cells of both the anterior medial and posterior lineages with <italic>Tc-otd</italic>. Rather, <italic>Tc-otd</italic> was expressed in the surrounding embryonic head tissue. <italic>Tc-otd</italic> was also absent from the type-II NBs themselves (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 panel A-B</xref>). However, <italic>Tc-otd</italic> might be expressed in neural cells derived from these lineages as we can detect expression in the central area of the brain lobes where for instance skh cells are located (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 panel A, F</xref>; <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 panel A-B</xref>). Interestingly, we found that <italic>Tc-six4</italic> is expressed specifically in that area of the head lobe in which the type-II NBs clusters 1-6 of the anterior medial group first differentiate. At stage NS13 <italic>Tc-six4</italic> marks both, type-II NBs and fez-mm-eGFP expressing INPs and some surrounding cells (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11, panel A</xref>).

It is also not expressed in the posterior group of type-II NBs but only marks type-II NBs of the anterior medial group. Finally, we found that <italic>Tc-six3</italic> marks, and is restricted to, the anterior-most lineages 1-4 including both the type-II NBs and the fez-mm-eGFP marked INPs/GMCs (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11 panel C</xref>).

<title>Evolutionary divergence of number and grouping of embryonic type-II NB lineages between beetle, fly and grasshopper</title>
<p>We have identified a total of 9 type-II NB lineages on each side of the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryonic head. This represents a major evolutionary divergence as in both, the hemimetabolan grasshopper <italic>Schistocerca gregaria</italic> and the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> only 8 embryonic type-II NBs were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Our finding of an additional type-II NB lineage at the embryonic stage shows that the number of type-II NBs is not fixed across insects and suggests that evolutionary divergence in brain development between species may be driven by differences in the number of progenitor lineages. To test this, further research is required to determine where the additional lineage in <italic>Tribolium</italic> is located and if it is associated with morphological differences of the brain.</p>
<p>Although in the frame of this work we did not perform lineage tracing we can speculate about which NB might be lacking in fly embryos based on our data. In the hemimetabolan <italic>Schistocerca</italic> there is no obvious clustering of type-II NBs, and they are all arranged in one row at the medial rim of the head lobes. In <italic>Tribolium</italic> we have observed an arrangement of the type-II NBs into two groups per side, one large anterior medial group containing seven type-II NB clusters and one posterior group of two type-II NBs. The anterior six of the anterior medial group are arranged in one row like in the grasshopper. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> there are three described groups referred to as the anterior, the middle and the posterior cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. The posterior cluster consists of two type-II NBs and therefore most likely corresponds to the posterior two type-II NBs in <italic>Tribolium</italic>. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> middle and anterior cluster are most likely equivalent to the anterior medial group of <italic>Tribolium.</italic> However, the type-II NB 7, which we assigned to the anterior medial group, but which is a bit separated and produces offspring into the opposite direction (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C-II</xref>, white arrow) might be the one that does not have a homologue in the fly embryo. The identification of more specific spatial markers for type-II NBs (in addition to <italic>Tc-six3</italic> and <italic>Tc-six4</italic>) or lineage tracing tools are required to identify the neuroblast, which is not present in fly embryos. Subsequently, it would be especially interesting to see what the role of the additional type-II NBs in the beetle is and which neuropile it contributes to.</p>
<p>Summing up, there is a tendency towards grouping of type-II NBs into subsets in the holometabolan models that was not observed in the only hemimetabolan studied so far. A ninth type-II NB was only found in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryo represents a striking developmentally divergent feature, but its role and the homologisation of individual type-II NBs between the different insects requires further studies.</p>

<title>Gene expression identifies homologous cell types and suggests conservation of gene function between fly and beetle type-II NB lineages</title>
<p>The genes defining the different stages of differentiation in type-II NB lineages have been identified and intensively studied in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> but it had remained unclear, in how far the respective patterns and mechanisms were conserved. Our results show a large degree of conservation of expression and probably also function – at least in holometabola. We identified type-II NBs by their larger than average size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] and the expression of the signature marker <italic>Tc-pnt</italic> adjacent to a group of <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> expressing cells (INPs and GMCs). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> both these factors have key functions in defining the developmental potential of type-II NBs and INPs: Pnt suppresses Ase in type-II NBs and promotes the formation of INPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Loss of <italic>pnt</italic> expression leads to a de-differentiation of INPs as <italic>fez/erm</italic> is no longer repressed in young INPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Fez/Erm controls proliferation of INPs by activating Pros and prevents dedifferentiation of INPs into type-II NBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. We show that also in <italic>Tribolium</italic> INPs undergo a maturation process, during which expression of <italic>Tc-pnt</italic> stalls and expression of <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> is switched on. Despite both factors characterising different stages of INP maturation they are not completely mutual exclusive and we observed a small window of overlap in immature-II INPs, highly suggestive of a conserved role of Pnt in the activation of <italic>fez/erm</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>). <italic>Drosophila dpn</italic> is a neural marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] expressed in type-II NBs and again in mature INPs, leaving a gap of expression in immature-I and II INPs. <italic>Drosophila ase</italic> is repressed in type-II NBs but expressed together with <italic>fez</italic>/<italic>erm</italic> in INPs and GMCs where its expression overlaps with <italic>pros</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. We found identical dynamics of gene expression in <italic>Tribolium</italic> (see <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>) suggesting conservation of gene function within the lineages and a conserved process of INP maturation.</p>

<p>In conclusion, expression of the genes examined in this study in type-II NBs and their lineages is highly conserved in fly and beetle, which is implicit of conserved gene function and a conserved process of central complex formation.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Divergent timing of type-II NB activity and heterochronic development of the central complex</title>
<p>Previous work described a heterochronic shift in central complex formation between fly and beetle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. In <italic>Tribolium</italic> parts of the central complex develop during embryogenesis. It becomes functional at the onset of the first larval stage, and is presumably required for the more complex movements of the beetle larvae using legs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. In both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Tribolium</italic> the anterior groups of type-II NBs (anterior medial group of <italic>Tribolium</italic> and anterior and middle cluster of <italic>Drosophila</italic>) are fully present in the last 3<sup>rd</sup> of embryogenesis, with the beginning of germ band retraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. However, in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo only a limited number of INPs and GMCs are produced before they enter a resting stage prior to hatching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. By contrast, we show that <italic>Tribolium</italic> type-II NB lineages are much larger at the embryonic stage compared to <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. They also include more mature, <italic>Tc-dpn</italic> expressing cycling INPs which have the capability of driving the increase in lineage size. We believe that this increased activity may contribute to the embryonic development of a functional central body and protocerebral bridge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. This hypothesis does however require further confirmation by lineage tracing experiments and by testing how manipulating central genes acting within the lineages will affect the timing of central complex development. In addition, differences in cell number in the individual central complex neuropiles between <italic>Tribolium</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> have to be assessed, as the higher number of progenitors may also reflect a higher number of neurons present in the adult beetle fan shaped body or may be due to a slower rate of division and a resulting accumulation of progenitor cells. Lastly, we do not yet have any information whether <italic>Tribolium</italic> type-II NBs, or <italic>Tribolium</italic> neuroblasts in general, also enter a stage of quiescence at the end of embryogenesis as they do in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] and what role neurons born in the 1<sup>st</sup> larva play in <italic>Tribolium</italic>.</p>
<p>Another emerging question is if and when <italic>Tribolium</italic> type-II NB lineages are active during larval development and how that relates to the described steps of central complex development. After preformation in the embryo <italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II NBs have their main period of activity in the 3<sup>rd</sup> larva and the lineages are much larger and contain more INPs than the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryonic lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Therefore, it would be interesting to see if type-II NB lineages are present and active in the late larval brain of <italic>Tribolium</italic>.</p>
<p>Taken together, we have for the first time identified and molecularly characterized embryonic type-II NBs and INPs as the major central complex progenitor pool in an insect outside <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We have observed quantitative differences within these lineages when compared between <italic>Tribolium</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Based on these findings we hypothesize that increased division behaviour of type-II NB lineages is required for the embryonic central complex development as found in beetles. Our findings set the basis for future work on the relationship of the identified type-II NB lineages and the timing of central complex development.</p>

<title>The placodal marker <italic>Tc-six4</italic> may be responsible for the differentiation and the spatial identity of the anterior medial group of type-II NBs</title>
<p>The different type-II NB lineages contribute to different parts of the brain. For instance, only the anterior four type-II NB lineages form the w, x, y, and z tracts of the central complex in flies and grasshoppers. Hence, there must be signals that make them different despite the conserved and well-studied sequence of neural gene expression and functional interactions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. In the ventral nerve cord, the different identities of the NBs are specified by the combination of spatial patterning genes expressed in the neuroectoderm at the time of delamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. However, little is known about these signals for type-II NBs. In <italic>Tribolium</italic> the domains of head patterning genes in the brain neuroectoderm are well characterized and some highly conserved territories like the anterior-medial <italic>six3</italic>-positive domain were described and suggested to give respective NBs different spatial identities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. The <italic>Tc-six4</italic> expression domain is also largely coincident with an embryonic structure termed insect head placode, a neurogenic, invaginating tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>] potentially homologous to the vertebrate adenohypophyseal placode which is also marked by <italic>six4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. A placodal origin of <italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II NBs has been shown for one type-II NB, and it is assumed that the other type-II NBs also stem from placodal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Tc-six4</italic> is also a very interesting factor with regards to the specification of type-II NBs because it is expressed only in the anterior group of type-II NBs. Hence, it could contribute to distinguishing their developmental fate from the posterior group. This is however different in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva. Here Six4 is expressed in all eight lineages where it prevents the formation of supernumerary type-II NBs and a premature differentiation of INPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. In the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryo Six4 may have a similar rate limiting role within the anterior group of type-II NBs. However, its early expression in a small part of the neuroectoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>] and the delamination of the anterior-medial type-II NB group within this domain also hints at an instructive role of <italic>Tc-six4</italic> in the formation of the anterior medial group.</p>

<sec id="s3e">
<title><italic>Tc-six3</italic> marks a subset of type-II NBs whereas <italic>Tc-otd</italic> is absent from all lineages</title>
<p>Importantly, we found that in <italic>Tribolium</italic> late embryogenesis, <italic>Tc-six3</italic> is expressed specifically within the lineages of type-II NBs 1-4 of the anterior medial group, but not in the other linages. In grasshopper and fly these anterior 4 lineages (DM1-4) give rise to the z, y, x and w tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] and contribute crucially to the development of protocerebral bridge and central body. These tracts form a major midline crossing neuropile of the central body which serves as a scaffold in the development of this structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. We conclude that in <italic>Tribolium</italic> the evolutionary ancient <italic>six3</italic> territory gives rise to the neuropile of the z, y, x and w tracts. This might well be the same in other insects such as flies and grasshoppers but has to our knowledge not been looked at in detail in these models. In the beetle the central body is also missing in weak <italic>Tribolium Tc-six3</italic>-RNAi phenotypes, suggesting that <italic>Tribolium six3</italic> is required for the formation of this structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Given that central complex neuropile is marked by additional factors such as <italic>Tc-</italic>foxQ2 (<italic>Drosophila</italic> fd102c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]) and <italic>Tc-rx</italic>- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], it would be interesting to see the relationship of additional spatial patterning genes with regards to the type-II NB lineages in future studies.</p>
<p>The gene <italic>otd</italic> is a marker of the posterior protocerebrum and <italic>six3</italic> and <italic>otd</italic> are believed to subdivide the embryonic anterior brain into two major domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. This subdivision is also part of the recently revisited concept of an ancestral division of the insect protocerebrum into archicerebrum (<italic>six3</italic>-positive) and prosocerebrum (<italic>otd</italic>-positive) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. As discussed above, <italic>Tc-six3</italic> is expressed in the anterior-most four type-II NB lineages, but unexpectedly, we found that <italic>Tc-otd</italic> is specifically absent from all type-II NB lineages, suggesting that its inhibition is required for the development of all these lineages. Interestingly, the lineages of type-II NB 5 and 6 (and presumably of type-II NB 7) of the anterior cluster and the posterior type-II NB lineages do neither express <italic>Tc-otd</italic> nor <italic>Tc-six3</italic> showing that there are protocerebral structures expressing none of these conserved markers in development, questioning the assigned generalized role of these two factors in subdividing the protocerebrum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, our findings are just the beginning of the quest for the genes required for the identity specification of type-II NB lineages.

The transgene also contained the coding sequence of Cre-recombinase (not used in this work) transcribed from the same promoter, and the eye pigmentation gene <italic>Tc-vermilion</italic> behind the eye-specific 3xP3 enhancer element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>] (see Fig. S1 A for map of the transgene). On the repair plasmid the transgene was flanked by CRISPR target sequences derived from <italic>Dm-yellow</italic> and <italic>Dm-ebony</italic>, which were used for <italic>in vivo</italic> linearisation of the transgene.</p>
<p>Using CRISPR Optimal Target Finder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>] we designed three guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting the genomic region 2.5 kb upstream of the <italic>Tc</italic>-<italic>fez/erm</italic> transcription start site (see table S1). We produced three plasmids where single gRNAs were transcribed from the <italic>Tribolium</italic> pU6b RNA promoter, as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. We co-injected the three gRNAs plasmids at 125µg/µl each, gRNAs targeting the <italic>Dm-yellow</italic> and <italic>Dm-ebony</italic> sequence at 125µg/µl each, Cas9 helper plasmid (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]) at 500 µg/µl and the repair plasmid at 500 µg/µl. Embryos of the white eyed <italic>Tribolium vermilion</italic>-<italic>white</italic> (<italic>vw</italic>) strain (G0) were injected, raised and then bred to <italic>vw</italic>-beetles in individual crosses. The offspring of these crosses (F1) were screened for black eyed heterozygous carriers of the transgene. These were again outcrossed to <italic>vw</italic>-beetles and the heterozygous offspring (F2) were further analysed genetically (see table S2) and with respect to fluorescent signal. Siblings of the F2 generation were then crossed to one another to generate the homozygous line (fez-mm-eGFP). Details of the insertion can be found in Fig. S1 A.</p>
<p>We also used the shaking hands (skh) enhancer trap line (G10011-GFP) which marks central complex cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>].</p>

<title>Larval brain dissection, fixation, and staining</title>
<p>Larval brains of the newly generated <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> enhancer trap line fez-mm-eGFP were dissected and stained as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Brains were mounted in <italic>Vectashield</italic> for microscopic inspection. See table S4 for a list of antibodies and staining reagents used.</p>

<title>Embryonic RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation, hybridisation chain reaction and antibody staining</title>
<p>Gene identifiers and primer sequences that were used for amplification can be found in table S3. The fragments were inserted into a pJet1.2 cloning vector. Standard RNA <italic>in situ</italic> probes were synthesised using the 5X Megascript T7 kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturers protocol. Embryo fixation and single colour RNA <italic>in situ</italic> chain reaction in combination with antibody staining to eGFP or phospo-histone H3 staining to mark mitoses was conducted as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. Embryos were also stained for DNA (dapi) or cell membranes (FM1-43). A full list of antibodies and staining reagents can be found in table S4. Probes for multicolour <italic>hybridisation chain reaction (HCR)</italic> binding <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>, <italic>Tc-dpn</italic>, <italic>Tc-ase</italic> and <italic>Tc-pnt</italic> were produced by Molecular Instruments (see table S5). Labelling reactions were performed as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. Antibody staining to eGFP was performed following the completion of the HCR staining (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]). All embryos were mounted in <italic>Vectashield</italic> for microscopic inspection (see table S4).</p>

<title>Image acquisition and analysis</title>
<p>Multichannel image stacks were recorded using a Zeiss LSM 980 confocal laser scanning microscope. Image stacks consisted of 100-300 slices, depending on the specimen. The resolution ranged from 1024 x 1024 to 2048 x 2048 pixels. Plane thickness was optimized according to width of the pinhole and ranged from 0.1 – 1 µm. We used FIJI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>] for 3 dimensional inspection, to export individual planes or to generate maximum intensity projections. Cropping and adjustment of brightness and contrast was done with GIMP (version 2.10.32) or Adobe Photoshop CS5.</p>

<title>Evaluation and of cell size and cell number</title>
<p>Cell and nuclear diameters of type-II NBs and a control group were measured based on the image stacks using FIJI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>] across 7 embryos. Lineage size and numbers of mitoses (based on <italic>Tc-pnt</italic> and <italic>fez</italic>-mm-eGFP expression/ anti-PH3 staining) was evaluated by manual counting based on image stacks derived from 4 head lobes of 4 embryos (≘ 28 anterior-medial lineages). The number of <italic>Tc-dpn</italic> expressing intermediate progenitors was evaluated in the same way across 5 embryos (≘ 35 anterior-medial lineages). Reference data on <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineage size (type-II NBs, INPs, GMCs and neurons) and numbers of <italic>dpn</italic>-expressing intermediate INPs were extracted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Statistics on all numerical data (standard deviations and two-tailed t-tests) were performed using Microsoft Excel 2016.</p>

<p>The study is a <bold>valuable</bold> contribution to the question of evolutionary shifts in neuronal proliferation patterns and the timing of developmental progressions. The authors present <bold>convincing</bold> data which confirm the presence of type-II NB lineages in beetle with the same molecular characteristics as the Drosophila counterparts but differing in lineage size and number. The data lay the foundation for future analysis of the role and molecular characteristics of individual lineages and of whether differences in the identity, proliferation pattern and timing of developmental progression can be linked to differences in the development of functionality of the central complex.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Insects inhabit diverse environments and have neuroanatomical structures appropriate to each habitat. Although the molecular mechanism of insect neural development has been mainly studied in Drosophila, the beetle, Tribolium castaneum has been introduced as another model to understand the differences and similarities in the process of insect neural development. In this manuscript, the authors focused on the origin of the central complex. In Drosophila, type II neuroblasts have been known as the origin of the central complex. Then, the authors tried to identify those cells in the beetle brain. They established a Tribolium fez enhancer trap line to visualize putative type II neuroblasts and successfully identified 9 of those cells. In addition, they also examined expression patterns of several genes that are known to be expressed in the type II neuroblasts or their lineage in Drosophila. They concluded that the putative type II neuroblasts they identified were type II neuroblasts because those cells showed characteristics of type II neuroblasts in terms of genetic codes, cell diameter, and cell lineage.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors established a useful enhancer trap line to visualize type II neuroblasts in Tribolium embryos. Using this tool, they have identified that there are 9 type II neuroblasts in the brain hemisphere during embryonic development. Since the enhancer trap line also visualized the lineage of those cells, the authors found that the lineage size of the type II neuroblasts in the beetle is larger than that in the fly. They also showed that several genetic markers are also expressed in the type II neuroblasts and their lineages as observed in Drosophila.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The revisions have improved the manuscript greatly. However, I still have some concerns about the lack of examination of the expression of NB markers. Without examining the expression of at least one unequivocal neuroblast marker, no one can say confidently that it is a neuroblast. However, it is acknowledged that such a marker is currently not available for Tribolium.</p>

<p>The authors address the question of differences in the development of the central complex (Cx), a brain structure mainly controlling spatial orientation and locomotion in insects, which can be traced back to the neuroblast lineages that produce the Cx structure. The lineages are called type-II neuroblast (NB) lineages and assumed to be conserved in insects. While Tribolium castaneum produces a functional larval Cx that only consists of one part of the adult Cx structure, the fan-shaped body, in Drosophila melanogaster a non-functional neuropile primordium is formed by neurons produced by the embryonic type-II NBs which then enter a dormant state and continue development in late larval and pupal stages.</p>
<p>The authors present a meticulous study demonstrating that type-II neuroblast (NB) lineages are indeed present in the developing brain of Tribolium castaneum. In contrast to type-I NB lineages, type-II NBs produce additional intermediate progenitors. The authors generate a fluorescent enhancer trap line called fez/earmuff which prominently labels the mushroom bodies but also the intermediate progenitors (INPs) of the type-II NB lineages. This is convincingly demonstrated by high resolution images that show cellular staining next to large pointed labelled cells, a marker for type-II NBs in Drosophila melanogaster. Using these and other markers (e.g. deadpan, asense), the authors show that the cell type composition and embryonic development of the type-II NB lineages are similar to their counterparts in Drosophila melanogaster. Furthermore, the expression of the Drosophila type-II NB lineage markers six3 and six4 in subsets of the Tribolium type-II NB lineages (anterior 1-4 and 1-6 type-II NB lineages) and the expression of the Cx marker skh in the distal part of most of the lineages provide further evidence that the identified NB lineages are equivalent to the Drosophila lineages that establish the central complex. However, in contrast to Drosophila, there are 9 instead of 8 embryonic type-II NB lineages per brain hemisphere and the lineages contain more progenitor cells compared to the Drosophila lineages. The authors argue that the higher number of dividing progenitor cells supports the earlier development of a functional Cx in Tribolium.</p>
<p>While the manuscript clearly shows that type-II NB lineages similar to Drosophila exist in Tribolium, it does not establish a direct link between the characteristics of these lineages and a functional larval Cx in Tribolium, i.e., it does not identify the cause of the heterochronic development of the Cx in these insects. However, the detailed study lays the foundation for lineage tracing and gene function experiments that will elucidate if the higher number of Tribolium type-II NB lineage progenitors, the additional lineage and the timing of developmental progression of the progenitors can indeed be linked with the earlier function of the Cx and/or if other components are required for establishing the functional larval neural circuits in Tribolium such as e.g. larval born neurons as is the case in Drosophila.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Rethemeier et al capitalize on their previous observation that the beetle central complex develops heterochronically compared to the fly and try to identify the developmental origin of this difference. For this reason, they use a fez enhancer trap line that they generated to study the neuronal stem cells (INPs) that give rise to the central complex. Using this line and staining against Drosophila type-II neuroblast markers, they elegantly dissect the number of developmental progression of the beetle type II neuroblasts. They show that the NBs, INPs, and GMCs have a conserved marker progression by comparing to Drosophila marker genes, although the expression of some of the lineage markers (otd, six3, and six4) is slightly different. Finally, they show that the beetle type II neuroblasts lineages are likely longer than the equivalent ones in Drosophila and argue that this might be the underlying reason for the observed heterochrony.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Very interesting study system that compares a conserved structure that, however, develops in a heterochronic manner.</p>
<p>
- Identification of a conserved molecular signature of type-II neuroblasts between beetles and flies. At the same time, identification of transcription factors expression differences in the neuroblasts, as well as identification of an extra neuroblast.</p>
<p>
- Nice detailed experiments to describe the expression of conserved and divergent marker genes, including some lineaging looking into co-expression of progenitor (fez) and neuronal (skh) markers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The link between size and number of neuroblast lineages and the earlier central complex development in beetles is not examined.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>General Response to Public Reviews</p>
<p>We thank the three reviewers for their positive evaluation of our work, which presents the first molecular characterization of type-II NB lineages in an insect outside the fly <italic>Drosophila.</italic> They seem convinced of our finding of an additional type-II NB and increased proliferation during embryogenesis in the red flour beetle. The reviewers expressed hesitations on our interpretation that the observed quantitative differences of embryonic lineages can directly be linked to the embryonic development of the central complex in Tribolium. While we still believe that a connection of both observations is a valid and likely hypothesis, we acknowledge that due the lack of functional experiments and lineage tracing a causal link has not directly been shown. We have therefore changed the manuscript to an even more careful wording that on one hand describes the correlation between increased embryonic proliferation with the earlier development of the Cx but on the other hand also stresses the need for additional functional and lineage tracing experiments to test this hypothesis. We have also strengthened the discussion on alternative explanations of the increased lineage size and emphasize the less disputed elements like presence and conservation of type-II NB lineages.</p>
<p>While our manuscript could in conclusion not directly show that the reason of the heterochronic shift lies in the progenitor behaviour, we still provide a first approach to answering the question of the developmental basis of this shift and testable hypotheses directly emerge from our work. We agree with reviewer#1 that functional work is best suited to test our hypothesis and we are planning to do so. However, we believe that the presented work is already rich in novel data and significantly advances our understanding on the conservation and divergence of type-II NBs in insects. We would also like to stress that most transgenic tools for which genome-wide collections exist for Drosophila have to be created for <italic>Tribolium</italic> and doing so can be quite time consuming. Conducting RNAi experiments is certainly possible in Tribolium but observing phenotypes in this defined cellular context will need laborious optimization. We have for example tried knocking down Tc-fez/erm but could not see any embryonic phenotype which might be due to an escaper effect in which only mildly affected or wild type-like embryos survive while the others die in early embryogenesis. Due to pleiotropic functions of the involved genes a cell-specific knockdown might be necessary and we are working towards establishing a system to do that in the red flour beetle. For the stated reasons, we see our work as an important basis to inspire future functional studies that build up on the framework that we introduced.</p>
<p>In response to these common points, we have made the following changes to the manuscript</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Insects inhabit diverse environments and have neuroanatomical structures appropriate to each habitat. Although the molecular mechanism of insect neural development has been mainly studied in Drosophila, the beetle, Tribolium castaneum has been introduced as another model to understand the differences and similarities in the process of insect neural development. In this manuscript, the authors focused on the origin of the central complex. In Drosophila, type II neuroblasts have been known as the origin of the central complex. Then, the authors tried to identify those cells in the beetle brain. They established a Tribolium fez enhancer trap line to visualize putative type II neuroblasts and successfully identified 9 of those cells. In addition, they also examined expression patterns of several genes that are known to be expressed in the type II neuroblasts or their lineage in Drosophila. They concluded that the putative type II neuroblasts they identified were type II neuroblasts because those cells showed characteristics of type II neuroblasts in terms of genetic codes, cell diameter, and cell lineage.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors established a useful enhancer trap line to visualize type II neuroblasts in Tribolium embryos. Using this tool, they have identified that there are 9 type II neuroblasts in the brain hemisphere during embryonic development. Since the enhancer trap line also visualized the lineage of those cells, the authors found that the lineage size of the type II neuroblasts in the beetle is larger than that in the fly. They also showed that several genetic markers are also expressed in the type II neuroblasts and their lineages as observed in Drosophila.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I recommend the authors reconstruct the manuscript because several parts of the present version are not logical. For example, the author should first examine the expression of dpn, a well-known marker of neuroblast. Without examining the expression of at least one neuroblast marker, no one can say confidently that it is a neuroblast. The purpose of this study is to understand what makes neuroanatomical differences between insects which is appropriate to their habitats. To obtain clues to the question, I think, functional analyses are necessary as well as descriptive analyses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The expression of an exclusive type-II neuroblast marker would indeed have been the most convincing evidence. However, <italic>asense</italic> is absent from type-II NBs and <italic>deadpan</italic> is not specific enough as it is expressed in many other cells of the developing protocerebrum. The gene <italic>pointed</italic>, although also expressed elsewhere, emerged as the the most specific marker. Therefore, we start with <italic>pointed</italic> and fez/erm to describe the first appearance and developmental progression of the cells and then add further evidence that these cells are indeed type-II neuroblasts. Further evidence is provided in the following chapters.  We have discussed the need for functional work in the general response.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors address the question of differences in the development of the central complex (Cx), a brain structure mainly controlling spatial orientation and locomotion in insects, which can be traced back to the neuroblast lineages that produce the Cx structure. The lineages are called type-II neuroblast (NB) lineages and are assumed to be conserved in insects. While Tribolium castaneum produces a functional larval Cx that only consists of one part of the adult Cx structure, the fan-shaped body, in Drosophila melanogaster a non-functional neuropile primordium is formed by neurons produced by the embryonic type-II NBs which then enter a dormant state and continue development in late larval and pupal stages.</p>
<p>The authors present a meticulous study demonstrating that type-II neuroblast (NB) lineages are indeed present in the developing brain of Tribolium castaneum. In contrast to type-I NB lineages, type-II NBs produce additional intermediate progenitors. The authors generate a fluorescent enhancer trap line called fez/earmuff which prominently labels the mushroom bodies but also the intermediate progenitors (INPs) of the type-II NB lineages. This is convincingly demonstrated by high-resolution images that show cellular staining next to large pointed labelled cells, a marker for type-II NBs in Drosophila melanogaster. Using these and other markers (e.g. deadpan, asense), the authors show that the cell type composition and embryonic development of the type-II NB lineages are similar to their counterparts in Drosophila melanogaster. Furthermore, the expression of the Drosophila type-II NB lineage markers six3 and six4 in subsets of the Tribolium type-II NB lineages (anterior 1-4 and 1-6 type-II NB lineages) and the expression of the Cx marker skh in the distal part of most of the lineages provide further evidence that the identified NB lineages are equivalent to the Drosophila lineages that establish the central complex. However, in contrast to Drosophila, there are 9 instead of 8 embryonic type-II NB lineages per brain hemisphere and the lineages contain more progenitor cells compared to the Drosophila lineages. The authors argue that the higher number of dividing progenitor cells supports the earlier development of a functional Cx in Tribolium.</p>
<p>While the manuscript clearly shows that type-II NB lineages similar to Drosophila exist in Tribolium, it does not considerably advance our understanding of the heterochronic development of the Cx in these insects. First of all, the contribution of these lineages to a functional larval Cx is not clear. For example, how do the described type-II NB lineages relate to the DM1-4 lineages that produce the columnar neurons of the Cx? What is the evidence that the embryonically produced type-II NB lineage neurons contribute to a functional larval Cx? The formation of functional circuits could rely on larval neurons (like in Drosophila) which would make a comparison of embryonic lineages less informative with respect to understanding the underlying variations of the developmental processes. Furthermore, the higher number of progenitors (and consequently neurons) in Tribolium could simply reflect the demand for a higher number of cells required to build the fan-shaped body compared to Drosophila. In addition, the larger lineages in Tribolium, including the higher number of INPs could be due to a greater number of NBs within the individual clusters, rather than a higher rate of proliferation of individual neuroblasts, as suggested. What is the evidence that there is only one NB per cluster? The presented schemes (Fig. 7/12) and description of the marker gene expression and classification of progenitor cells are inconsistent but indicate that NBs and immature INPs cannot be consistently distinguished.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank this reviewer for pointing out the inconsistency in our classification of cells within the lineages as one central part of our manuscript. These were due to a confusion in the used terms (young vs. immature). We have corrected this mistake and have changed the naming of the INP subtypes to immature-I and immature-II. We are confident that based on the analysed markers, type-II NBs and immature INPs can actually be distinguished with confidence.</p>
<p>We agree that a functional link of increased proliferation to heterochronic CX development is not shown although we consider it to be likely. As stated in the general response we have changed the manuscript to saying that the two observations (higher number of progenitors and larger lineages/more INPs) correlate but that a causal link can only be hypothesized for the time being. At the same time, we have strengthened the discussion on alternative explanations.</p>
<p>We would like to remain with our statement of an increased number of embryonic progeny of <italic>Tribolium</italic> type-II NBs. We counted the total number of progenitor cells emerging from the anterior median cluster and divided this by the number of type II NBs in that cluster. Hence, the shown increased number of cells represents an average per NB but is not influenced by the increased number of NBs. On the same line, we have never seen indication for the presence of additional NBs within any cluster while one type-II NB is what we regularly found. Hence, we are confident that we know the number of respective NBs. The fact that the fly data included also neurons and was counted at a later stage indicates that the observed differences are actually minimum estimates.</p>
<p>We have discussed that based on the position and comparison to the grasshopper we believe that Tribolium type-II NB 1-4 contribute to the x, y, z and w tracts. To confirm this, lineage tracing experiments would be necessary, for which tools remain to be developed.</p>
<p>We agree that the role of larvally born neurons and the fate of Tribolium neuroblasts through the transition from embryo to larva and pupa need to be further studied.</p>
<p>Available data suggests that the adult fan shaped body in Tribolium does not hugely differ in size from the Drosophila counterpart, although no data in terms of cell number is available. In the larva, however, no fan shaped body or protocerebral bridge can be distinguished in flies while in beetle larvae, these structures are clearly developed. Hence, we think that it is more likely that differences observed in the embryo reflect differences in the larval central complex. We discuss the need for further investigation of larval stages.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The main difference between Tribolium and Drosophila Cx development with regards to the larval functionality might be that Drosophila type-II NB lineage-derived neurons undergo quiescence at the end of embryogenesis so that the development of the Cx is halted, while a developmental arrest does not occur in Tribolium. However, this needs to be confirmed (as the authors rightly observe).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, there is evidence that cells contributing to the CX go into quiescence in flies – hence, this certainly is one of the mechanisms. However, based on our data we would suggest that in addition, the balance of embryonic versus larval proliferation of type-II lineages is different between the two insects: The increased embryonic proliferation and development leads to a functional larval CX in beetles while in flies, postembryonic proliferation may be increased in order to catch up.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Rethemeier et al capitalize on their previous observation that the beetle central complex develops heterochronically compared to the fly and try to identify the developmental origin of this difference. For this reason, they use a fez enhancer trap line that they generated to study the neuronal stem cells (INPs) that give rise to the central complex. Using this line and staining against Drosophila type-II neuroblast markers, they elegantly dissect the number of developmental progression of the beetle type II neuroblasts. They show that the NBs, INPs, and GMCs have a conserved marker progression by comparing to Drosophila marker genes, although the expression of some of the lineage markers (otd, six3, and six4) is slightly different. Finally, they show that the beetle type II neuroblast lineages are likely longer than the equivalent ones in Drosophila and argue that this might be the underlying reason for the observed heterochrony.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- A very interesting study system that compares a conserved structure that, however, develops in a heterochronic manner.</p>
<p>- Identification of a conserved molecular signature of type-II neuroblasts between beetles and flies. At the same time, identification of transcription factors expression differences in the neuroblasts, as well as identification of an extra neuroblast.</p>
<p>- Nice detailed experiments to describe the expression of conserved and divergent marker genes, including some lineaging looking into the co-expression of progenitor (fez) and neuronal (skh) markers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Comparing between different species is difficult as one doesn't know what the equivalent developmental stages are. How do the authors know when to compare the sizes of the lineages between Drosophila and Tribolium? Moreover, the fact that the authors recover more INPs and GMCs could also mean that the progenitors divide more slowly and, therefore, there is an accumulation of progenitors who have not undergone their programmed number of divisions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the difficulty of comparing stages between species, but we feel that our analysis is on the save side. At stages comparable with respect to overall embryonic development (retracting or retracted germband), the fly numbers are clearly smaller. To account for potential heterochronic shifts in NB activity, we have selected the stages to compare based on the criteria given: In <italic>Drosophila</italic> the number of INPs goes down after stage 16, meaning that they reach a peak at the selected stages. In Tribolium the chosen stages also reflect the phase when lineage size is larger than in all previous stages. Therefore, we believe that the conclusion that Tribolium has larger lineages and more INPs is well founded. Lineage size in Tribolium might further increase just before hatching (stage 15) but we were for technical reasons not able to look at this. As lineage size goes down in the last stage of Drosophila embryogenesis the number of INPs goes down and type-II NB enter quiescence, we think it is highly unlikely that the ratio between Tribolium and Drosophila INPs reverses at this stage, but a study of the behaviour of type-II NB in Tribolium and whether there is a stage of quiescence is still needed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The main conclusion that the earlier central complex development in beetles is due to the enhanced activity of the neuroblasts is very handwavy and is not the only possible conclusion from their data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As discussed in the general response we have made several changes to the manuscript to account for this criticism and discuss alternative explanations for the observations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The argument for conserved patterns of gene expression between Tribolium and Drosophila type-II NBs, INPs, and GMCs is a bit circular, as the authors use Drosophila markers to identify the Tribolium cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We tested the hypothesis that in <italic>Tribolium</italic> there are type-II NBs with a molecular signature similar to flies. Our results are in line with that hypothesis. If <italic>pointed</italic> had not clearly marked cells with NB-morphology or <italic>fez/erm</italic> had not marked dividing cells adjacent to these NBs, we would have concluded that no such cells/lineages exist in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryo, or that central complex producing lineages exist but express different markers. Therefore, we regard this a valid scientific approach and hence find this argument not problematic.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>An appraisal of whether the authors achieved their aims, and whether the results support their conclusions: Based on the above, I believe that the authors, despite advancing significantly, fall short of identifying the reasons for the divergent timing of central complex development between beetle and fly.</p>

<p>We agree that based on the available data, we cannot firmly make that link and we have changed the text accordingly.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In addition to these descriptive analyses, functional analyses can be included. RNAi is highly effective in this beetle.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that functional analyses of some of the studied genes and possible effects of gene knockdowns on the studied cell lineages and on central complex development could be highly informative. However, when studying specific cell types or organs these experiments are less straight forward than it may seem as knockdowns often lead to pleiotropic effects, sterility or lethality. All the genes involved are expressed in additional cells and may have essential functions there. Given the systemic RNAi of <italic>Tribolium</italic>, it is challenging to unequivocally assign phenotypes to one of the cell groups. Overcoming these challenges is often possible but needs extensive optimization. Our study, though descriptive is already rich in data and is the first description of NB-II lineages in Tribolium central complex development. We see it as a basis for future studies on central complex development that will include functional experiments.</p>

<p>We have used the anti-pH3 antibody to detect mitoses (figure 3C, table 1 and 3) but as data on mitoses based on this antibody is only a snapshot it would require a lot of image data to reliably determine an index in this specific cells. While mitotic activity over time possibly combined with live imaging might be very interesting in this system also with regards to the timing of development, for this basic study we are satisfied with the statement that the type-II NB are indeed dividing at these stages.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“Based on their position by the end of embryogenesis...”</p>
<p>How can the authors conclude that they are neuroblasts without examining the expression of NB markers?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Type-II NB do not express asense as the key marker for type I neuroblasts. To corroborate our argument that the cells are neuroblasts we have used several criteria:</p>
<p>- We have used the same markers that are used in Drosophila to label type-II NBs (pnt, dpn, six4). We are not aware of any other marker that would be more specific.</p>
<p>- We have shown that these cells are larger and have larger nuclei than neighbouring cells and they are dividing</p>
<p>- We have shown that these cells through their INP lineages give rise to central complex neuropile</p>
<p>We believe that these features taken together leave little doubt that the described cells are indeed neuroblasts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“We found that the cells they had assigned as...”</p>
<p>How did the authors distinguish that they are really neuroblasts?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We see the difficulty that we first describe the position and development of these cells (e.g. fig 3) and then add further evidence (cell size, additional marker dpn) that these are neuroblasts (also see above). However, without previous knowledge on position (and on pnt expression as the most specific marker) the type-II NB could not have been distinguished from other NBs based on cell size or expression of other markers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“Conserved patterns of gene expression...”</p>
<p>This must be the first (especially dpn).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Dpn is not specific to type-II NB because it is also expressed in type-1 NBs, mature INPs and possibly other neural cells. It is therefore impossible to identify type-II NBs based on this gene alone. We therefore first used the most specific marker, pnt, in addition to adjacent fez expression to identify candidates for type-II lineages. Then we mapped expression of further genes on these lineages to support the interpretation (and show homology to the Drosophila lineages). Although of course the structure of a paper does not necessarily have to reflect the sequence in which experiments were done we would find putting dpn expression first misleading as it would not be clear why exactly a certain part of the expression should belong to type-II NB. Also, our pnt-fez expression data shows the position of the NB-II in the context of the whole head lobe whereas the other gene expressions are higher magnifications focussing on details. We therefore believe that the structure we chose best fits our data and the other reviewers seemed to find it acceptable as well.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“As type-II NBs contribute to central...”</p>
<p>Before the sentence, the author could explain differences in the central complex structure between Tribolium and Drosophila in terms of cell number and tissue size.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added references on the comparisons of tissue sizes, but unfortunately there is no Tribolium data that can be directly compared to available Drosophila resources in terms of cell number.</p>

<p>We agree that this conclusion is not fully evident from the presented data. We have therefore changed this part to stating that there is a correlation with the earlier central complex development described in Tribolium. See also response to the general reviewer comments.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We have moved this statement up.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>&quot;However, molecular characterisation of such lineages in another insect but the fly and a thorough comparison of type-II NBs lineages and their sub-cell-types between fly and beetle are still lacking&quot;</p>
<p>The background information should include what is known about type-II NB lineages in Tribolium, including marker gene expression, e.g. Farnworth et al.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We refer to He et al 2019, Farnworth et al 2020 and Garcia-Perez 2021. All these publications speculate about a contribution of type-II NBs to Tribolium central complex development but do not show evidence of it. As we emphasize throughout the manuscript, the present work is the first description of type-II NB in Tribolium.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>&quot;The ETS-transcription factor pointed (pnt) marks type-II NBs [40,41], which do not express the type-I NB marker asense (ase) but the pro-neural gene deadpan (dpn)&quot;  Deadpan is considered a pan-neural gene. To avoid confusion, I would remove &quot;proneural&quot; throughout.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have done so throughout the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>&quot;We further found that, like the type-II NBs itself, the youngest Tc-pnt-positive but fezmm-eGFP-negative INPs neither express Tc-ase (Fig. 5D, pink arrowheads).&quot;  What is the evidence that these are the youngest pnt positive cells? Position? This needs to be explained.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have clarified that ‘youngest pnt-positive cells’ refers to the position of these cells close to the type-II NB.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>&quot;Therefore these neural markers can be used for a classification of type II NBs (Tc-pnt+, Tcase-), young INPs (Tc-pnt+, Tc-fez/erm-, Tc-ase-), immature INPs (Tc-pnt+, Tcfez/erm+, Tcase+), mature INPs (Tc-dpn+, Tc-ase+, Tc-fez/erm+, Tc-pros+), and GMCs (Tc-ase+, Tcfez/ erm+, Tc-pros+, Tc-dpn). This classification is summarized in Fig. 7 A-B.&quot;</p>
<p>This is not the best classification and not in line with the schemes in Figure 7 - the young INPs are also immature. What is the difference? It needs to be explained what &quot;mature&quot; means (dividing?).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have corrected the error in this part that confused the two original groups (young and immature). To take the immaturity of both types of INPs into account we have then also changed our naming of INP subtypes into immature-I and immature-II and throughout the manuscript). Figure 7 and figure 12 were also changed accordingly. While our classification if primarily based on gene expression the available data indicates that both types of immature INPs are not dividing, whereas mature INPs are. We have added a statement on that to this part.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>&quot;In beetles a single-unit functional central complex develops during embryogenesis while in flies the structure is postembryonic.&quot;</p>
<p>This statement is vague - the authors need to explain what is meant by &quot;single-unit&quot;. The phrase &quot;The structure is postembryonic&quot; also needs more explanation. The Drosophila CX neuroblasts lineages originate in the embryo and the neurons form a commissural tract that becomes incorporated into the fan-shaped body of the Cx.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have explained single-unit central complex and have improved our summary of known differences in central complex development between fly and beetle.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>&quot;To assess the size of the embryonic type-II NBs lineages in beetles we counted the Tc- fez/erm positive (fez-mm-eGFP) cells (INPs and GMCs) associated with a Tc-pntexpressing type-II NBs of the anterior medial group (type-II NBs lineages 1-7).  It is not clear what is meant by &quot;with a Tc-pnt-expressing type-II NBs&quot;. Is this a typo?&quot;</p>

<p>A and B show the same lineage but map the expression of different additional markers for clarity. We have added an explanation of this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The classification contradicts the description in the section &quot;Conserved patterns of gene expression mark Tribolium type-II NBs, different stages of INPs and GMCs&quot; (last sentence) where young INPs are first in the sequence and described as pnt+, erm-, ase- and immature INPs as pnt+ erm+ and ase+.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have corrected this mistake and changed the names of the subtypes into immatureI and immature-II (see above).</p>

<p>&quot;We conclude that the evolutionary ancient six3 territory gives rise to the neuropile of the z, y, x and w tracts.&quot;</p>
<p>Please clarify if six3 is also expressed in the corresponding grasshopper NB lineages or if your conclusion is based on the comparison of Drosophila and Tribolium and you assume that this is the ancestral condition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Six3 expression has not been studied in grasshoppers. Owing to the highly conserved nature of an anterior median six3 domain in arthropods and bilaterian animals in general, we would expect it to be expressed anterior-medially in grasshoppers as well. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> the gene is expressed in the anterior-medial embryonic region where the type-II NBs are expected to develop, but to our knowledge it has not been specifically studied which type-II NB lineages are located within this domain. We have clarified in our text that we do not claim that the origin of anterior-medial type-II NB 1-4 and the X,Y, Z and W lineages from the six3 territory is highly conserved but only the territory itself. As far as we know our work is the first to analyse the relationship of type-II lineages and the conserved head patterning genes <italic>six3</italic> and <italic>otd</italic>. We have added some clarification of this into this part of the discussion.</p>

<p>(5) Methods</p>
<p>The methods section should include the methods for cell counting, as well as cell and nuclei size measurements including statistics (e.g. how many embryos, how many NB lineages). The comparison of the Tribolium NB lineage cell numbers to published Drosophila data should include a brief description of the method used in Drosophila (in addition to the method used here in Tribolium) so that the reader can understand how the data compare.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added a separate section on this to the Methods part which also includes the criteria used in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We have also included some more information to the results part on the inclusion of neurons in the Drosophila counts that may only be partially included in our numbers. This does however not change the results in terms of larger numbers of progenitor cells in <italic>Tribolium</italic>.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Suggestions for improved or additional experiments, data, or analyses:</p>
<p>a) The analysis of nuclear size is wrong. The authors compare the largest cell of a cluster of cells with a number of random cells from the same brain. It is obvious that the largest cell of a cluster will be larger than the average cell of the same brain. A better control would be to compare the largest cell of the pnt+ cluster with the largest cell of a random sample of cells, although this also comes with biases. Personally, I have no doubt that the authors are looking at neuroblasts, based on the markers they are using, so I would recommend completely eliminating Figure 4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that we produced a somewhat biased and expected result when we select the largest cell of a cluster for size comparison. However, we found it important to show based on a larger sample that these cells are also statistically larger than the average cell of a brain, which we think our assessment shows. We do not claim that type-II NBs are the largest cells of a brain, or that they are larger than type-I NBs, therefore in a random sample there might be cells that are equally big (see also distribution of the control sample shown in figure 4, and we have added a note on this to the text). We are happy to hear that this reviewer has no doubts we are looking at neural stem cells. However, reviewer#1 did express some hesitations and therefore we think it is important to keep the information on cell size as part of our argument that we are indeed looking at type-II NBs (gene expression, cell size, dividing, part of a neural lineage).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b) The comparison of NB, INP, and GMC numbers between Drosophila and Trbolium (section &quot;The Tribolium embryonic lineages of type-II NBs are larger and contain more mature INPs than those of Drosophila&quot;) compares an experiment that the authors did with published data. I would suggest that the authors repeat the Drosophila stainings and compare themselves to avoid cases of batch effects, inconsistent counting, etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>None of the authors is a Drosophila expert or has any experience at working with this model and reassessing the lineage size would require a number of combinatorial staining. Therefore, we feel that using the published data produced by experts and which also includes repeat experiments is for us the more reliable approach.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>c) In Figure 10, there are some otd+ GFP+ cells laterally. What are these?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that these cells contribute to the eye anlagen. We have added this information to the legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Minor corrections to the text and figures:</p>
<p>a) There are some typos in the text: e.g. &quot;pattering&quot; in the abstract.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have carefully checked the text for typos and hope that we have found everything.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b) The referencing of figures in the text is inconsistent (eg &quot;Figure 5 panel A&quot; vs &quot;Figure 5D&quot; on page 12).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have checked throughout the manuscript and made sure to always refer to a panel correctly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>c) In Figure 3C, the white staining (anti-PH3) is not indicated in the Figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The label has been added in the figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>d) Moreover, in Figure 3, green is not very visible in the images.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have improved the colour intensity where possible.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>e) In the figures, it might be better to outline the cells with color-coded dashed circles instead of using arrows.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think that this would obscure some details of the stainings and create a rather artificial representation. We also feel that doing this consistently in all our images is an amount of work not justified by the degree of expected improvement to the figures</p>
<p>NOTE: We are submitting a revised version of the supplementary material which only contains two minor changes: a headline was added to Table S4 (Antibodies and staining reagents) and a typo was corrected in line one of table S5 (TC to Tc).</p>
