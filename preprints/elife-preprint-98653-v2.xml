<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The CA3 region of the hippocampus is the major site of sharp wave initiation, and a brain region crucially involved in learning and memory. Highly recurrent connectivity within its excitatory network is thought to underlie processes involved in memory formation. Recent work has indicated that distinct subpopulations of pyramidal neurons within this region may contribute differently to network activity, including sharp waves, in CA3. Exactly how these contributions may arise is not yet known. Here, we disentangle the local connectivity between two distinct CA3 cell types: thorny and athorny pyramidal cells. We find an asymmetry in the connectivity between these two populations, with athorny cells receiving strong input from both athorny and thorny cells. Conversely, the thorny cell population receives very little input from the athorny population. Computational modeling suggests that this connectivity scheme may determine the sequential activation of these cell types during large network events such as sharp waves.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>We have performed additional simulations where we:
- vary connectivity of both excitatory synapse types simultaneously
- vary connectivity between our two pyramidal populations and the major inhibitory
population (basket cells)
- include parameter variability and short-term synaptic plasticity in our excitatory connections
These additional simulations strengthen our conclusion that the asymmetric connectivity between thorny and athorny pyramidal neurons, and in particular low connectivity from athorny to thorny, is the driver of the delay in peak activation of the two populations. Further, we have expanded our introduction and discussion sections to better place the relevance of our study within the literature. Our manuscript now fits the guidelines for a full article, rather than the short-report we initially submitted.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The hippocampus is one of the most studied brain regions in neuroscience. Since the study of patient H.M, the hippocampus has been established as an essential brain region for the formation of new memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Scoville and Milner, 1957</xref>). In the decades following, a plethora of research has revealed insights into how the hippocampus contributes to memory processing. One hallmark of hippocampal activity that underlies memory formation is the sharp wave-ripple complex (SPW-R). SPW-Rs are large network events characterised by the synchronous discharge of huge numbers of hippocampal pyramidal (CA3) neurons (the sharp wave, SPW), followed by oscillatory activity downstream in the CA1 (ripple). During non-REM sleep, SPW-Rs essentially replay a compressed version of neural sequences that occurred during events preceding sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52s">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee and Wilson, 2002</xref>). It is thought that these SPW-Rs play a key role in memory consolidation. Despite extensive research, the full cellular mechanisms underlying the initiation and propagation of SPW events are still not fully resolved.</p>
<p>The CA3 region in the hippocampus is considered the main generator of SPWs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buzsáki, 1986</xref>). While inhibition is proposed to be instrumental in SPW generation, recent evidence has suggested that a subclass of pyramidal neurons may also play a pivotal role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>). Diversity among pyramidal neuron populations is often overlooked when considering the role of these cells within neuronal circuits. Despite reports of variation within the pyramidal population in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bilkey and Schwartzkroin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fitch et al., 1989</xref>), much more attention has been paid to the heterogeneity of interneurons. However, several studies have reported functional and morphological heterogeneity within the pyramidal CA3 cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bilkey and Schwartzkroin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Marissal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Attention is now turning to this rich assortment of pyramidal cells, and recent efforts have begun to tease apart the distinct roles of these sub-types in functional circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cembrowski and Spruston, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Soltesz and Losonczy, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Valero and de la Prida, 2018</xref>). A recent study described two distinct sub-types of CA3 pyramidal neurons, differentiated by the presence or absence of complex spine structures called thorny excrescences (the post-synaptic site of input coming from mossy fibres of the dentate gyrus granule cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>). The study showed that cells lacking these thorny excrescences, termed athorny pyramids, fire before thorny pyramids during SPWs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is proposed that athorny cells play an important role in SPW initiation and, in turn, in memory processing in CA3. However, it is unknown how these two sub-types of pyramidal neuron are embedded in the local microcircuit. We have previously shown that CA3 pyramidal cells connect to each other at a high rate (8.8 %) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sammons et al., 2024</xref>). Here, we investigate the local sub-type specific connectivity between thorny and athorny CA3 pyramids and find a distinct asymmetry. When implementing this asymmetry into a computational model, we find that sub-type specific connectivity is crucial for the distinct firing times of athorny and thorny cells during SPWs.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To examine the connectivity between thorny and athorny pyramidal cells in CA3, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings from up to 8 cells simultaneously. Cells were posthoc classified as thorny or athorny using biocytin labelling and confocal microscopy to determine the presence or absence of thorny excrescences (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In total, we recorded from 348 CA3 pyramids across the length of the CA3 (CA3a: 20 cells, CA3b: 274 cells, CA3c: 54 cells). Of these 348 pyramids, 229 were thorny and 119 were athorny (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We measured the distance from the soma to the first branch on the apical dendrite and found that thorny cells branched significantly closer to the soma than athorny cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>; median [IQR] for thorny: 12.5 [20.9] <italic>µ</italic>m, athorny: 51.4 [38.0] <italic>µ</italic>m; <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001, Mann-Whitney-U test). Furthermore, we found that athorny cells tended to be located deeper in the pyramidal layer, towards the stratum oriens. Meanwhile, thorny cells were found throughout the deep-superficial axis of the pyramidal cell layer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, median [IQR] for thorny: 28 [32] <italic>µ</italic>m, athorny: 12 [14] <italic>µ</italic>m, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001, Mann-Whitney-U test). These results resemble findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Marissal et al. (2012)</xref> who observed similar differences in soma location and primary apical dendritic length between early and late born CA3 neurons, suggesting that thorny and athorny neurons may be developmentally distinct.</p>

<p>Next, we looked at connection rates between these two pyramidal neuron populations. In our whole-cell patch clamp recordings, each cell was stimulated to elicit 4 action potentials, and post-synaptic traces were examined for potential synaptic coupling. We found a high rate of connectivity (15%) between athorny cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Ai</xref>), and from thorny onto athorny cells (11%; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Aii</xref>). Thorny cells connected to each other at a rate of 8% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Aiii</xref>). Meanwhile, connections from athorny onto thorny cells were the least common, occurring at a rate of 4% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Aiv</xref>). The overall rate of connectivity (65/734 = 8.9 %) corresponds well to our previously reported high level of connectivity within the general CA3 pyramidal population (8.8 %) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sammons et al., 2024</xref>). We saw reciprocal connections between athorny-athorny pairs (2 reciprocally connected pairs; 4/92 connections = 4 %) and thorny-thorny (2 reciprocally connected pairs; 4/362 connections = 1 %) pairs of neurons. Synaptic connections were strongest amongst athorny-athorny cells, although no statistically significant differences were present across connection types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, median [IQR] amplitudes for athorny-athorny: 1.08 [0.56] mV; ii, thorny-athorny: 0.88 [1.03] mV; iii, thorny-thorny: 0.57 [0.55] mV; iv, athorny-thorny: 0.66 [0.25] mV; <italic>p</italic> = 0.370, Kruskal-Wallis test). EPSPs across all connection types had latencies below 3 ms (with the exception of a single connection between two athorny cells which had a latency of 3.58 ms) indicating that identified connections were monosynaptic (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). We further looked at the failure rate of each synapse type. Athorny-athorny synapses had the lowest failure rate, although no statistical difference was observed between groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, median [IQR] failure rate for athorny-athorny: 11.5 [20.5] %, thorny-athorny: 33.0 [36.2] %, thorny-thorny: 21.0 [36.3] %, athorny-thorny: 12.0 [47.5] %, p=0.729, Kruskal-Wallis test). Additionally, we looked at synaptic dynamics to determine if synapse types had different plasticity qualities. Connections from thorny onto athorny neurons showed significantly more synaptic depression than athorny-athorny connections (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.008 Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn’s posthoc with Bonferroni correction; all other comparisons <italic>p &gt;</italic> 0.05).</p>

<p>To determine the overall impact of each connection type within the local network, we calculated the synaptic product. This metric takes into account connection probability (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3Ai</xref>), connection strength (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3Aii</xref>), and size of the presynaptic population (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3Aiii</xref>), thereby giving an estimate of how large the input onto the particular cell type is for any given presynaptic population. Thorny-athorny connections show the highest synaptic product, followed by athorny-athorny connections (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3Aiv</xref>). Together, our results demonstrate a strong pattern of input onto athorny neurons and much weaker input onto thorny cells, particularly from the athorny sub-population (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>During SPW events, athorny (A) cells have been reported to fire before thorny (T) cells, suggesting that activity propagates in this direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it might appear surprising that both connectivity and synaptic product present the opposite asymmetry, with low values for athorny-thorny (A→T) and high values for thorny-athorny (T→A) connections. To understand what dynamics can be expected based on this microcircuit architecture, we constructed a model network in which T and A neurons are connected according to the experimentally observed connections (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In addition to the two pyramidal cell populations, we included two classes of interneurons that have been suggested to play fundamental roles in SPW generation: PV<sup>+</sup> basket cells (B), which are active during SPWs, and a putative class of anti-SPW interneurons (C), which fire outside SPWs, keeping the other populations inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Evangelista et al., 2020</xref>). Strong reciprocal coupling between the two inhibitory populations gives rise to a bistability between a SPW state and a non-SPW state, and the network alternates between these two states due to adaptation in pyramidal cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Bi</xref>), as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Levenstein et al. (2019)</xref> as the driving mechanism of SPWs. We tuned model parameters (see Materials and Methods) such that the SPW event incidence is ≈ 1/s (with stochastic onsets driven by finite-size fluctuations) and the average event duration is ≈ 80 ms (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Bi</xref>).</p>

<p>In our simulations, a SPW event starts when B cells suppress enough C cells to disinhibit pyramidal neurons. Among the two pyramidal cell populations, A cells subsequently emit a larger number of early spikes, due to a lower rheobase (documented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hunt et al. (2018)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Linaro et al. (2022)</xref>, and our own data (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>)) and a steeper f-I curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Linaro et al., 2022</xref>). These initial spikes recruit many further A cells, due to the high A→A connectivity, but only a few T cells, due to the low A→T connectivity. On the other hand, A cells drive the growth of B cells, which in turn inhibit T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Bi-ii</xref>): as a result, A cells have a net <italic>inhibitory</italic> effect on T cells, which get initially suppressed and can only start firing when the activity of A cells decreases, due to a surge in adaptation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Biii</xref>). Because T cells are also adaptive, their firing rate also reaches a peak and decreases, ending the SPW event. Together, these dynamics result in clearly distinct peaks of A and T population activities, with an average delay of 29 ms between the peaks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Bi-ii</xref>). This long delay matches the data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hunt et al. (2018)</xref>, which would be hard to explain if T cells were directly recruited by A cells, with monosynaptic latencies shorter than three milliseconds (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>A key ingredient for these dynamics is that the proportion between the A→T and A→A connectivity is such that A has a net inhibitory effect on T, resulting in a long delay between the peaks. We confirm this intuition by varying each of the four connectivities in the model and find that a decreased A→A (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Ci</xref>) or increased A→T (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Cii</xref>) connectivity would indeed prevent the initial suppression of T cells, as activity would build up together in both populations, resulting in almost simultaneous peaks. On the contrary, further increasing A→A or decreasing A→T would more strongly suppress T cells, which could only fire after most A cells have adapted and fallen silent, with delays even over 100 ms. For particularly low A→T connectivities, we even observe two separate A peaks, since the delay becomes so long that A cells partially recover from adaptation by the end of the SPW (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Cii</xref>, left inset). Analogously, connections from T neurons determine whether these provide net excitation or inhibition to A neurons. However, albeit affecting the relative size of the A and T peaks, such connections on their own cannot prevent the early activation of the A population, which depends on single-neuron parameters. Therefore connections from T cells play a role only in the second part of an event (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Ciii</xref> and Civ). The model dynamics and the effects of excitatory-to-excitatory connectivities qualitatively remain unaltered if we include in the model the experimentally observed short-term depression and variability of synapses (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>,<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether the described relationship between connectivity and delay holds across the parameter space, we explore the six possible combinations of the connectivities examined so far. We find that long delays are consistently found when A→A is large (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A 1,2,3</xref>) and when A→T is small <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A 3,4,5</xref>), provided that delays do not become so long that population T does not activate at all. Specifically, varying A→T and T→A together offers a good overview of the possible combinations of cooperative and competitive interactions between the two populations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A5</xref>). If these connectivities were both high, then there would be no competition and the populations would reach their peaks at approximately the same time (top right corner). Conversely, if both connectivities were low, either population could potentially suppress the other. This winner-takes-all competition would be won by the athorny cells because of their earlier activation due to their intrinsic properties (bottom left corner). When A→T is low and T→A is high (bottom right corner), matching experimental conditions, only A can suppress T, resulting in the long delay, while when A→T is high and T→A is low, A is suppressed by T, after nevertheless displaying some early activity. Afterwards, there may or may not be a later peak for the A neurons, after T neurons have adapted. This is why, in the top left corner of in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A5</xref>, there can either be a positive or long negative delay, depending on whether the first (small) or second (absent, for some parameters) A peak is taken into account.</p>

<p>The arguments presented so far assume the existence of indirect inhibitory pathways through the B interneurons, which become dominant in case the direct excitatory pathways are weak. How strong do these pathways need to be for T neurons to be initially suppressed, causing two distinct peaks to emerge? To address this question, we varied pairs of connectivity rates to and from B interneurons (B→A, B→T, A→B, and T→B — <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, 9–14</xref>) and combinations thereof with the relevant connections among excitatory neurons (A→A in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, 1–4</xref> and A→T in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, 5–8</xref> and). In this analysis, it clearly emerges that connections <italic>to</italic> the B interneurons have only a minor effect on the delay, while connections <italic>from</italic> the B interneurons are as important as the excitatory connections outlined above. Although the actual values of the inhibitory connectivities are unknown, these simulations demonstrate that there is a broad, clearly distinct, region of the parameter space that supports a long delay between the peaks of A and T. In addition, we see that B interneurons optimally contribute to the suppression of T when they primarily target T (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, fourth row and third column) rather than A (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, third row and fourth column). Interestingly, in the examples in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> the B→T connections are weaker than B→A ones (total connection strengths are displayed graphically in Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The fact that the long delay nevertheless emerges is due to the measured asymmetric connectivity between the two excitatory populations, in particular the low connectivity from A to T neurons. In conclusion, modeling shows that not only can T cells activate after A cells even if the A→T connectivity is low, but such a low connectivity is also crucial to explain the delay seen in the data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hunt et al. (2018)</xref> and in our model.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our work combines electrophysiology and computational modeling to determine connectivity patterns within the local CA3 excitatory network, and to show how these rules could govern the timing of excitatory subpopulation activation during sharp wave events.</p>
<p>We corroborate previous findings that a subset of CA3 pyramidal cells appear to lack thorny excrescences typical of mossy fiber inputs, and thus, the population can be divided into thorny and athorny neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, we find that the connectivity between these classes is distinctly asymmetric, with athorny cells receiving ample input from themselves and thorny cells, but thorny cells receiving sparse inputs from athorny pyramids. Though classified by location in the pyramidal layer (deep and superficial) rather than thorny or athorny, two other groups have recently reported similar findings using two different experimental methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Watson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Layous et al., 2025</xref>). Both studies report superficial neurons frequently innervating themselves and deep CA3 pyramids and much less frequent connectivity from deep to superficial cells. Together with our data showing that athorny cells tend to be located deeper in the pyramidal layer, these results reflect a similar pattern of asymmetric connectivity.</p>
<p>Our modeling shows that asymmetric connectivity is crucial for SPW events to have two distinct peaks with only partially overlapping activity for the two pyramidal populations, matching the data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hunt et al. (2018)</xref>. The long delay (tens of milliseconds) in our model is explained by the ambivalent role of athorny neurons, which on the one hand switch the network to the SPW state, but on the other hand initially disynaptically suppress the thorny neurons. The switch to the SPW state occurs because PV<sup>+</sup> basket cells take over from anti-SPW interneurons, a putative class proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Evangelista et al. (2020)</xref> to explain the paradoxical triggering of SPWs by <italic>in-vitro</italic> stimulation of PV<sup>+</sup> basket cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schlingloff et al., 2014</xref>). Although their existence in CA3 still needs to be demonstrated, an interneuron class with similar properties was identified in CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dudok et al., 2021</xref>). During a SPW, the initial suppression of thorny neurons occurs through the shared pool of PV<sup>+</sup> basket cells. The long delay that we observed in our model does not require special asymmetries in the connectivity between the interneurons and the pyramidal populations, given the measured values of excitatory connectivity. However, at least some baseline connectivity from athorny to basket and from basket to thorny neurons is required for the proposed disynaptic inhibition to exist. More detailed data on the interneuron connectivity would further deepen our understanding of subpopulation timing and other aspects of the initiation and propagation of SPW-ripple complexes.</p>
<p>The further functional relevance of these two cell populations remains unclear. The CA3 pyramidal population has two developmentally distinct groups — early-born and late-born cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Marissal et al., 2012</xref>). These developmentally distinct subpopulations have been shown to exhibit functionally different roles in memory encoding, with late-born cells recruited earlier in the encoding process than early-born cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kveim et al., 2024</xref>). Currently, it is not known whether thorny and athorny cells might map onto the two developmentally distinct populations. However, certain features of early- and late-born neurons are suggestive of an overlap with athorny and thorny cells, respectively. Early-born neurons tend to be located closer to the stratum oriens and have longer primary apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Marissal et al., 2012</xref>), reminiscent of our findings on athorny cells. Moreover, modulation of thorn density has been reported through excessive training in spatial memory tasks and chemically via steroid hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gómez-Padilla et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hatanaka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tsurugizawa et al., 2005</xref>). However, it is unclear whether modulation may result in the complete transition of thorny neurons to athorny cells or growth of thorns in previously athorny neurons.</p>
<p>The present work extends our existing knowledge of how the local excitatory network in the CA3 region is organized. In line with recent evidence that the CA3 pyramidal population is nonhomogeneous, we find that connectivity between these pyramids is asymmetric across subpopulations. Our modeling work shows that this asymmetry is key in maintaining the separation of peak firing between the two populations, thorny and athorny, during sharp wave events.</p>

<p>Recordings were performed in ACSF at 32–34<sup><italic>°</italic></sup>C in a submerged-type recording chamber. Cells in the CA3 were identified using infrared differential contrast microscopy (BX51WI, Olympus). We performed somatic whole-cell patch-clamp recordings (pipette resistance 3–5 MΩ) of up to eight cells simultaneously. One cell was stimulated with a train of four action potentials at 20 Hz, elicited by 2–3 ms long current injections of 1.5–4 nA. For characterization to confirm the targeting of pyramidal cells, increasing steps of current were injected (1 s, increment: 50 pA). In some cells, a hyperpolarizing or depolarizing holding current was applied to keep the membrane potential at −60 mV. The intracellular solution contained (in mM) 135 potassium-gluconate, 6.0 KCl, 2.0 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 EGTA, 5.0 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, 2.0 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 0.5 Na<sub>2</sub>-GTP, 10 HEPES buffer, and 0.2% biocytin.

<p>Cells with a membrane potential less negative than −50 mV and a series resistance higher than 30 MΩ were discarded. The connectivity screen underwent a quality control step such that only sweeps were kept if presynaptic action potentials reversed above 0 mV and the membrane potential did not deviate by more than 10 % within a sweep or with reference to the first sweep. Synaptic connections were identified when there was a postsynaptic potential corresponding to presynaptic stimulation in the averaged trace of 40–50 sweeps. A baseline period (2 ms) just prior to stimulation and the averaged postsynaptic peak during the first action potential was used for the analysis of EPSP amplitudes and synaptic delays. Only pairs in which the first postsynaptic peak was clearly discernible were used for analysis. To analyze short-term plasticity dynamics, postsynaptic traces were deconvolved as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Richardson and Silberberg (2008)</xref>. The time constant, <italic>τ</italic>, was set to 55 ms and the deconvolved trace was low-pass filtered. Subsequent evoked EPSP peaks were normalized to the first evoked EPSP in the trace. Synaptic dynamics were compared across connection types by comparing the ratio of the first and fourth EPSPs across groups. Failure rate was calculated by dividing the number of sweeps in which an EPSP was observed by the total number of sweeps. This value was calculated for each of the possible four EPSPs corresponding to the four presynaptic action potentials, and then a total sum for each cell was taken.

Interneuron parameters were based on data from CA3, if available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fidzinski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>), or otherwise from other hippocampal subfields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ledri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pawelzik et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tricoire et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The parameters of adaptation cannot be directly compared to physiological values, because this variable summarizes a multitude of different currents, each with its own size and timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Benda, 2021</xref>). Therefore, we firstly aimed at reproducing the f-I curves of different neurons, when available (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). Thorny and athorny f-I curves were compared to those measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Linaro et al. (2022)</xref>, while for PV<sup>+</sup>-basket cells we used CA3 data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fidzinski et al. (2015)</xref>. In addition, the large spike-coupling <italic>b</italic> and long timescale <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>u</italic></sub> of pyramidal adaptation allow to reproduce the strong firing rate accommodation typical of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Storm, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>), while these parameters are smaller in A and especially B cells, which can sustain a high firing rate without significant accommodation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>). In the AdEx model, if the voltage-coupling <italic>a</italic> is strong enough, spiking happens through a Hopf bifurcation, which is responsible for phenomena like transient spiking and class 2 behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Touboul and Brette, 2008</xref>). Therefore we set this parameter to 0 for thorny cells, in which these behaviours are absent, and to a higher value for athorny cells, which seem to exhibit transient spiking for intermediate values of a constant input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>), and for interneurons. In particular, for B cells, we could reproduce the discontinuity around 15 Hz typical of fast-spiking interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gerstner et al., 2014</xref>). Neuronal parameters and their values are summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Network parameters</title>
<p>Each population size is based on an estimation of its representation in a 400-<italic>µm</italic>-thick CA3 slice, according to the quantitative assessment by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bezaire and Soltesz (2013)</xref>. Pyramidal neurons are divided into thorny and athorny according to the 66%-34% ratio that we determined experimentally. The background currents <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>ext</italic></sub> are constant and correspond to the non-transient rheobase <italic>ρ</italic>, plus 10%, with the exception of population A, which receives +40% because it is responsible for keeping the other neurons inhibited for most of the time. This assumption is reasonable, since CCK<sup>+</sup>-basket cells “receive a far less efficient local excitatory drive, but are exposed to modulatory effects of extrinsic inputs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Freund, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Neurons are connected to each other with a probability <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>IJ</italic></sub>, depending on the pre- and post-synaptic population <italic>J</italic> and <italic>I</italic>. For excitatory-to-excitatory connections, these probabilities have the values that we assessed experimentally. For the other connections, the existent literature is too inconsistent to derive coherent conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gulyás et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Maccaferri et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mátyás et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bezaire and Soltesz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Campanac et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kohus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dudok et al., 2021</xref>): therefore, in order to minimize the number of assumptions not based on solid evidence, they were all given the same probability 0.2.</p>
<p>Excitatory-to-excitatory synaptic weights were all set to 0.2 nS, since differences in EPSP sizes were not found to be significant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This values corresponds to an EPSP size of 0.1 mV, which is lower than the ones measured experimentally, but compensates for the fact that they directly affect the (somatic) membrane potential of the post-synaptic neurons neurons and that connections are homogeneous. The weights involving population C were chosen in order to satisfy the basic requirements for bistability and disinhibition dynamics: the search for the bistable region of the parameter space was guided by the insights previously obtained in the bifurcation analysis of a three-population model of CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Evangelista et al., 2020</xref>). Although our model has one more population, we found that the basic requirements are the same: pyramidal cells need to more strongly excite interneurons B and to be more strongly inhibited by interneurons C. In addition, populations C and B need to have strong inhibitory couplings between each other. For firing rate requirements, we assumed, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Evangelista et al. (2020)</xref>, that C neurons fire ∼10 spikes/s in non-SPW states and are almost silent during SPWs. These choices are assumptions on population C, which still need to be tested experimentally. For the connections between B neurons and pyramidal cells, the main criterion was to balance the effect of the strong recurrent excitation, in order to achieve a realistic firing rate for pyramidal neurons and B cells themselves during SPWs. For B neurons we based on estimates of 5-10 spikes/s in the non-SPW periods and fast spiking at 50–70 during SPWs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lapray et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Varga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hájos et al., 2013</xref>). Pyramidal neurons are almost silent (0–1 spikes/s) in non-SPW periods and fire on average 10–20 spikes/s in SPW events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lapray et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hájos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">English et al., 2014</xref>). In order to satisfy these requirements, inhibitory weights needed to be about one order of magnitude larger than excitatory ones, which is partially in accordance with the hippocampal interneuron literature mentioned above, and partially necessary because not all kinds of interneurons are included in the network. The resulting non-SPW activity of our pyramidal populations is 0.2 spikes/s for T cells and 0.4 spikes/s for A cells.</p>
<p>Regarding the other synaptic parameters, all the latencies were set to 1 ms, glutamatergic and GABAergic reversal potentials have the typical values of 0 mV and -70 mV respectively, and the former are assumed to be twice as fast as the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Geiger et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bartos et al., 2002</xref>).

<title>Network activity</title>
<p>SPW events are identified based on the current flowing from B cells to the excitatory ones, which is thought to represent most of the LFP signal observed in the <italic>stratum pyramidale</italic>. This signal is low-pass filtered up to 5 Hz, in order to cover the whole duration of an event. In this signal, peaks higher than 50 pA are regarded as SPWs. The beginning and end of the events are defined as the times at which the low-pass-filtered LFP crosses the value<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="589773v2_inline10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> is the LFP peak of each event and <italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub> is a baseline value. Within each sharp wave, we record the peak timing of the firing rate of both the athorny and the thorny populations. In case a single population presents two peaks that are more than 50 ms apart, they are recorded as separate peaks and only the first one is used for the statistics in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref> and <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>.</p>
<p>When varying connectivities as in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, we up- or down-scale the synaptic strength <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>IJ</italic></sub> of all the four excitatory-to-excitatory connections by a common factor, in order to still obtain sharp waves with a similar average size of the LFP peak (±10 pA). Since the LFP peak is estimated based on the current flowing from the B interneurons, this criterion is not biased toward either pyramidal population. In <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref> we repeat the simulations in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, but this time the scaling is done with the synaptic strength of the A→B and T→B connections, which are highly relevant for the sharp wave size, but in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> were found to be little relevant for the timing of the peaks.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The hippocampal CA3 region is generally considered to be the primary site of initiation of sharp wave ripples-highly synchronous population events involved in learning and memory-although the precise mechanism remains elusive. A recent study revealed that CA3 comprises two distinct pyramidal cell populations: thorny cells that receive mossy fiber input from the dentate gyrus, and athorny cells that do not. That study also showed that it is athorny cells in particular which play a key role in sharp wave initiation. In the present work, Sammons, Masserini and colleagues expand on this by examining the connectivity probabilities among and between thorny and athorny cells. Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings, they find an asymmetrical connectivity pattern, with athorny cells receiving the most synaptic connections from both athorny and thorny cells, and thorny cells receiving fewer.</p>
<p>The authors then use a spiking network model to show how this assymmetrical connectivity is consistent with a preferential role of athorny cells in sharp wave initiation. Essentially, thorny and athorny cells are put into a winner-takes-all scenario in which athorny cells always win initially. Thorny cells can only become active after athorny cells decrease their firing rate due to adaptation, leading to a delay between the activation of athorny and thorny cells. As far as I understand, the initial victory of athorny cells in the winner-takes-all is doubly determined: it is both due to their intrinsic properties (lower rheobase and steeper f-I curve), and due to the bias in connectivity towards them. It appears to me that either of these two mechanisms (i.e., different intrinsic properties and symmetrical self- and cross-connections, or the same intrinsic properties and asymmetrical connectivity) would suffice to explain the sequential activation of the two cell types. From a theoretician's perspective, this overdetermination is not very elegant, but biology often isn't...</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provide independent validation of some of the findings by Hunt et al. (2018) concerning the distinction between thorny and athorny pyramidal cells in CA3 and advance our understanding of their differential integration in CA3 microcircuits. The properties of excitatory connections among and between thorny and athorny cells described by the authors will be key in understanding CA3 functions including, but not limited to, sharp wave initiation.</p>
<p>As stated in the paper, the modeling results lend support to the idea that the increased excitatory connectivity towards athorny cells plays an important role in causing them to fire before thorny cells in sharp waves. More generally, the model adds to an expanding pool of models of sharp wave ripples which should prove useful in guiding and interpreting experimental research.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Sammons, Masserini et al. examine the connectivity of different types of CA3 pyramidal cells (&quot;thorny&quot; and &quot;athorny&quot;), and how their connectivity putatively contributes to their relative timing in sharp-wave-like activity. First, using patch-clamp recordings, they characterize the degree of connectivity within and between athorny and thorny cells. Based upon these experimental results, they compute a synaptic product matrix, and use this to inform a computational model of CA3 activity. This model finds that this differential connectivity between these populations, augmented by two different types of inhibitory neurons, can account for the relative timing of activity observed in sharp waves in vivo.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for reading our manuscript, as well as for their nice summary and constructive comments</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The patch-clamp experiments are exceptionally thorough and well done. These are very challenging experiments and the authors should be commended for their in-depth characterization of CA3 connectivity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the recognition of our efforts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The computational elements of this study feel underdeveloped. Whereas the authors do a thorough job experimentally characterizing connections between excitatory neurons, the inhibitory neurons used in the model seem to be effectivity &quot;fit neurons&quot; and appear to have been tuned to produce the emergent properties of CA3 sharp wave-like activity. Although I appreciate the goal was to implicate CA3 connectivity contributions to activity timing, a stronger relationship seems like it could be examined. For example, did the authors try to &quot;break&quot; their model? It would be informative if they attempted different synaptic product matrices (say, the juxtaposition of their experimental product matrix) and see whether experimentally-derived sequential activity could not be elicited. It seems as though this spirit of analysis was examined in Figure 4C, but only insofar as individual connectivity parameters were changed in isolation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Including the two interneuron types (B and C) in the model is, on the one hand, necessary to align our modeling framework to the state-of-the-art model by Evangelista et al. (2020), which assumes that these populations act as switchers between an SPW and a non-SPW state, and on the other hand, less straightforward because the connectivity involving these interneurons is largely unknown.</p>
<p>For B cells, the primary criterion to set their connections to and from excitatory cells was to balance the effect of the strong recurrent excitation and to achieve a mid-range firing rate for each population during sharp wave events. Our new simulations (Figure 5B) show that the initial suppression of population T (resulting in the long delay) indeed depends in equal proportions on the outlined excitatory connections and on how strongly each excitatory population is targeted by the B interneurons. However, these simulations demonstrate that there is a broad, clearly distinct, region of the parameter space that supports a long delay between the peaks, rather than a marginal set of finetuned parameters. In addition, the simulations show that B interneurons optimally contribute to the suppression of T when they primarily target T (Fig. 5B, panels 3,7,11,12,13) rather than A (panels 4,8,9,10,11). On the contrary, as reported in the parameter table, and now also displayed graphically in the new Figure 4A (included above, with arrow sizes proportional to the synaptic product between the parameters determining the total strength of each connection), we assume B to target A less weakly than T (to make up for the higher excitability of population A). Therefore, the long delay between the peaks in our model emerges in spite of the interneuron connectivity, rather than because of it, and it is an effect of the asymmetric connectivity between the two excitatory populations, in particular the extremely low connection from A to T.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Additional explanations of how parameters for interneurons were incorporated in the model would be very helpful. As it stands, it is difficult to understand the degree to which the parameters of these neurons are biologically constrained versus used as fit parameters to produce different time windows of activity in types of CA3 pyramidal cells.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Sharp wave ripples are transient oscillations occurring in the hippocampus that are thought to play an important role in organising temporal sequences during the reactivation of neuronal activity. This study addresses the mechanism by which these temporal sequences are generated in the CA3 region focusing on two different subtypes of pyramidal neurons, thorny and athorny. Using high-quality electrophysiological recordings from up to 8 pyramidal neurons at a time the authors measure the connectivity rates between these pyramidal cell subtypes in a large dataset of 348 cells. This is a significant achievement and provides important data. The most striking finding is how similar connection characteristics are between cell types. There are no differences in synaptic strength or failure rates and some small differences in connectivity rates and short-term plasticity. Using model simulations, the authors explore the implications of the differences in connectivity rates for the temporal specificity of pyramidal cell firing within sharp-wave ripple events. The simulations show that the experimentally observed connectivity rates may contribute to the previously observed temporal sequence of pyramidal cell firing during sharp wave ripples.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for your careful review of our manuscript and the overall positive assessment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The conclusions drawn from the simulations are not experimentally tested so remain theoretical. In the simple network model, the authors include basket cell and anti-SWR interneurons but the connectivity of these cell types is not measured experimentally and variations in interneuron parameters may also influence temporal specificity of firing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As variations in some of these parameters can indeed influence the temporal specificity of firing, we have now performed additional simulations, the results of which are in the new Figures 5 and S5. Please also see response to Reviewer 1, point 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, the influence of short-term plasticity measured in their experiments is not tested in the model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now included short-term synaptic depression in all the excitatory-to-excitatory synapses and compensated for the weakened recurrent excitation by scaling some of the other parameters. The results of re-running our simulations in this alternative version of the model are reported in Figure S3 and are qualitatively analogous to those in Figure 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Interestingly, the experimental data reveal a large variability in many of the measured parameters. This may strongly influence the firing of pyramidal cells during SWRs but it is not represented within the model which uses the averaged data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now incorporated variability in the following simulation parameters: the strength and latency of the four excitatory-to-excitatory connections as well as the reversal potential and leak conductance of both types of pyramidal cells, assuming variabilities similar to those observed experimentally (see Materials and Methods for details). Upon a slight re-balancing of some inhibitory connection strengths, in order to achieve comparable firing rates, we found that this version of the model also supports the generation of sharp waves with two pyramidal components (Figure S4B), and is, thus, fully analogous to our basic model. Varying the excitatory connectivities as in the original simulations (cf. Figure 4C and Figure S4C) reveals that increasing the athorny-toathorny or decreasing the athorny-to-thorny connectivity still increases the delay between the peaks, although for some connectivity values the peak of the athorny population appears more spread out in time.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provide independent validation of some of the findings by Hunt et al. (2018) concerning the distinction between thorny and athorny pyramidal cells in CA3 and advance our understanding of their differential integration in CA3 microcircuits. The properties of excitatory connections among and between thorny and athorny cells described by the authors will be key in understanding CA3 functions including, but not limited to, sharp wave initiation.</p>
<p>As stated in the paper, the modeling results lend support to the idea that the increased excitatory connectivity towards athorny cells plays a key role in causing them to fire before thorny cells in sharp waves. More generally, the model adds to an expanding pool of models of sharp wave ripples which should prove useful in guiding and interpreting experimental research.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The mechanism by which athorny cells initiate sharp waves in the model is somewhat confusingly described. As far as I understood, random fluctuations in the activities of A and B neurons provide windows of opportunity for pyramidal cells to fire if they have additionally recovered from adaptive currents. Thorny and athorny pyramidal cells are then set in a winner-takes-all competition which is quickly won by the athorny cells. The main thesis of the paper seems to be that athorny cells win this competition because they receive more inputs both from themselves and from thorny cells, hence, the connectivity &quot;underlies the sequential activation&quot;. However, it is also stated that athorny cells activate first due to their lower rheobase and steeper f-I curve, and it is also indicated in the methods that athorny (but not thorny) cells fire in bursts. It seems that it is primarily these features that make them fire first, something which apparently happens even when the A to A connectivity is set to 0albeit with a very small lag. Perhaps the authors could further clarify the differential role of single cell and network parameters in determining the sequential activation of athorny and thorny cells. Is the role of asymmetric excitatory connectivity only to enhance the initial intrinsic advantage of athorny cells? If so, could this advantage also be enhanced in other ways?</p>

<p>Thank you for the time invested in the review of our manuscript. We especially thank you for pointing out that the description of these dynamics was unclear: we have now improved it in the main text and we provide here an additional summary. As correctly highlighted by Reviewer 3, athorny neurons (A) are more excitable than thorny (T) ones due to single-neuron parameters: therefore, if there is a winner-takes-all competition, they are going to win it. Whether there is a competition in the first place, however, depends on the excitatory (and inhibitory) connections. In particular, we should distinguish two questions: does the activity of populations A and B (PV baskets), without adaptation (so at the beginning of the sharp wave) suppress T? And does the activity of populations T and B suppress A?</p>
<p>The four possible combinations can be appreciated, for example, in the new Figure 5A5. If A can suppress T, but T cannot suppress A (low A-to-T, high T-to-A, bottom right corner, like in the data), A “wins” and T fires later, after a long delay. If both A and T can suppress each other (both cross-connections are low, bottom left corner), we still get the same outcome: A wins because of its earlier and sharper onset (due to single-neuron parameters). If neither population can suppress the other (high cross-connections, top right corner), then there is no competition and the populations reach the peak approximately at the same time. Only in the case in which T can suppress A, but A cannot suppress T (low T-to-A, high A-to-T, top left corner, opposite to the data), then A “loses” the competition. However, since A neurons nevertheless display some early activity (again, due to the single neuron parameters), this scenario is not as clean as the reversed one: rather, A cells have an initial, small peak, then T neurons quickly take over and grow to their own peak, and then, depending on how strongly T neurons suppress A neurons, there may or may not be a second peak for the A neurons. This is the reason why, in the top left corner of Figure 5B, the statistics show either a long positive or long negative delay, depending on whether the first (small) or second (absent, for some parameters) peak of A is taken into account. In summary, the experimentally measured connectivity does not only enhance the initial intrinsic advantage of A cells, but sets up the competitive dynamics in the first place, which are crucial for the emergence of two distinct peaks, rather than a single peak involving both populations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Although a clear effort has been made to constrain the model with biological data, too many degrees of freedom remain that allow the modeler to make arbitrary decisions. This is not a problem in itself, but perhaps the authors could explain more of their reasoning and expand upon the differences between their modeling choices and those of others. For example, what are the conceptual or practical advantages of using adaptation in pyramidal neurons as opposed to short-term synaptic plasticity as in the model by Hunt et al.?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It should be pointed out that the model by Hunt et al. features adaptation in pyramidal neurons as well, as the neuronal units employed are also adaptive-exponential integrate-and-fire. In an early stage of this project, we obtained from Hunt et al. the code for their model, and ascertained that adaptation is the main mechanism governing the alternations between the sharp-wave and the non-sharp-wave states, to the extent that fully removing short-term plasticity from their model does not have any significant impact on the network dynamics. Therefore, our choices are, in this regard, fully consistent with theirs. In order to confirm that synaptic depression does not significantly impact the dynamics also in our model, we now performed additional simulations (Figure S3), addressed in the main text (lines 149-151) and in the response to Reviewer 1, who expressed similar concerns.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Relatedly, what experimental observations could validate or falsify the proposed mechanisms?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As sharp wave generation in this model relies on disinhibitory dynamics (suppression of the anti-sharp-wave interneurons C), the model could be validated/falsified by proving/disproving that a class of interneurons with anti-sharp-wave features exists. In addition, the mechanism we proposed for the long delay between the peaks of the athorny and thorny activity requires at least some connectivity from athorny to basket and from basket to thorny neurons.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the data by Hunt et al., thorny cells have a higher baseline (non-SPW) firing rate, and it is claimed that it is actually stochastic correlations in their firing that are amplified by athorny cells to initiate sharp waves. However, in the current model, the firing of both types of pyramidal cells outside of ripples appears to be essentially zero. Can the model handle more realistic firing rates as described by Hunt et al., or as produced by e.g., walking around an environment tiled with place cells, or would that trigger SPWs continuously?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>When building this model, we aimed at having two clearly distinct states the network could alternate between, so we picked a rather polarized connectivity to and from the anti-sharp wave cells (C), resulting in polarized states. As a result, we obtain a low, although non-zero, activity of pyramidal neurons in non-SPW states (0.4 spikes/s for athorny and 0.2 spikes/s for thorny). These assumptions can be partially relaxed, for example in the original model by Evangelista et al. (2020), where the background firing rate of pyramidal cells is ~2 spikes/s. It should also be noted that, when walking in an environment tiled with place cells, the hippocampus is subject to additional extra-hippocampal inputs (e.g. from the medial septum, resulting in theta oscillations) and to neuromodulation, which can alter the network in various ways that we have not included in our model. However, our results are not in contradiction to transient SPW-like activity states initiated at a certain phase of the theta oscillation, when the inhibition is weakest.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Useful points to address include:</p>
<p>(1) Explore within the model the effect of altering interneuron connectivity. Are there other factors that can influence temporal specificity within SWRs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The effects of varying the connectivity to and from B interneurons (the ones which are SPWactive and therefore relevant for temporal specificity) have now been investigated in the new Figure 5B, in which such parameters were varied in pairs or combined with the two most relevant excitatoryto-excitatory connections.</p>

<p>(2) Implement the experimentally observed short-term plasticity in the model to determine how this influences temporal specificity.</p>

<p>All the findings in Figure 4 have now been replicated in the new Figure S3, in which excitatory-to-excitatory synapses feature synaptic depression.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>All the findings in Figure 4 have now been replicated in the new Figure S4, in which heterogeneity has been introduced in multiple neuronal and synaptic parameters of thorny and athorny neurons.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Include the co-connectivity rates in the data. Ie how many of the recorded neurons are reciprocally connected? Does this change the model simulations?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now added the rates of reciprocal connections that we observed into the main text (lines 8688). We found 2 pairs of reciprocally connected athorny neurons and 2 pairs of reciprocally connected thorny neurons. These rates of reciprocity were not statistically significant. We did not observe reciprocal connections in other paired neuron combinations (i.e. athorny-thorny or vice-versa). Coconnectivity does not have any effect on the model simulations, as the model includes thousands of neurons grouped in populations without specific sub-structures. It might, however, be more relevant if the excitatory populations were further subdivided in assemblies.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Specify which part of CA3 you are recording from.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added this information into our results section - we recorded from 20 cells in CA3a, 274 cells in CA3b and 54 cells in CA3c. This information can now be found in the text on lines 68-69.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Comment on why you might observe a larger fraction of athorny cells than Hunt et al.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Hunt et al. cite a broad range for the fraction of athorny cells in their discussion (10-20%). It is unclear where these estimates originate from. In their study, Hunt et al. use the bursting and nonbursting phenotypes as proxies for athorny and thorny cells respectively, and report here numbers of 32 and 70 equating to 31% athorny and 69% thorny. This fraction of athorny cells is more or less in line with our own findings, albeit slightly lower (34% and 66%). However, we believe this difference falls within the range of experimental variability. One caveat is that our electrophysiological recordings likely represent a biased sample of cells. In particular, with multipatch recordings, placement of later electrodes is often restricted to the borders of the pyramidal layer so as not to disturb already patched cells. Thus, our recorded cells do not represent a fully random sample of CA3 pyramidal cells. We believe that, only once a reliable genetic marker for athorny cells has been established can the size of this cell population be properly estimated. Furthermore, the ratio of thorny and athorny cells varies along the proximal distal axis of the CA3 so differences in ratios seen between our study and Hunt et al. may arise from sampling differences along this axis.</p>
