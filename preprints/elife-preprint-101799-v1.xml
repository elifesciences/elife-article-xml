<title>Abstract</title><p>The calcitonin (CT) family of related peptides exert their diverse physiological effects in mammals via two G-protein coupled receptors, CTR and the CTR-like receptor CLR. Analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of CT-type signaling has revealed the occurrence of CT-type peptides and CTR/CLR-type proteins in deuterostome and protostome invertebrates. Furthermore, experimental studies have revealed that in the protostome <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> the CT-like peptide DH<sub>31</sub> can act as a ligand for a CTR/CLR-type receptor and a pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) receptor. Here we investigated the signaling mechanisms and functions of CT-type neuropeptides in a deuterostome invertebrate, the sea cucumber <italic>Apostichopus japonicus</italic> (phylum Echinodermata). In <italic>A. japonicus,</italic> a single gene encodes two CT-type peptides (AjCT1 and AjCT2), both of which act as ligands for a CTR/CLR-type receptor (AjCTR) and two PDF-type receptors (AjPDFR1, AjPDFR2), but with differential activation of downstream cAMP/PKA, Gαq/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PKC and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Analysis of the expression of the gene encoding AjCT1 and AjCT2 revealed transcripts in a variety of organ systems, but with highest expression in the circumoral nervous system. <italic>In vitro</italic> pharmacological experiments revealed that AjCT1 and/or AjCT2 cause dose-dependent relaxation of longitudinal body wall muscle and intestine preparations. Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacological experiments and loss-of-function tests revealed a potential physiological role for AjCT2 signaling in promoting feeding and growth in <italic>A. japonicus</italic>. This is the first study to obtain evidence that CT-type peptides can act as ligands for both CTR/CLR-type and PDF-type receptors in a deuterostome. Furthermore, because of the economic importance of <italic>A. japonicus</italic> as a foodstuff, discovery of the potential role for CT-type peptides as regulators of feeding and growth in this species may provide a basis for practical applications in aquaculture.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The peptide calcitonin (CT) was first identified as a hormone that regulates blood calcium levels and subsequently a family of CT-related neuropeptides was discovered in mammals, including calcitonin gene related peptides (CGRPs), amylin (AMY), adrenomedullin (AM), and CT receptor-stimulating peptide (CRSP) (Copp et al., 1962; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sekiguchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sekiguchi et al., 2016</xref>). Members of the CT-type family of peptides typically have a disulfide bond in their N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2018</xref>) and exert their physiological effects in mammals by binding to two related G protein-coupled receptors: CTR (CT receptor) and CLR (CTR-like receptor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Martins et al., 2014</xref>). However, receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) acting as accessory proteins are key determinants of ligand selectivity for CTR and CLR (Mclatchie et al., 1998). Thus, formation of a complex with a RAMP is essential for CLR function, whereas RAMPs are not required for CTR ligand recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kuwasako et al., 2011</xref>; Bomberger et al., 2012). Furthermore, binding of CT to CTR in the absence of RAMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Katafuchi et al., 2009</xref>) can activate signaling via several downstream pathways, including cAMP accumulation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization, and ERK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pondel, 2000</xref>; Walker et al., 2010; Andreassen et al., 2014).</p>
<p>Transcriptome/genome sequencing has enabled analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of CT-type signaling systems, indicating that the evolutionary origin of CT-type peptides and CTR/CLR-related receptors can be traced back to the urbilaterian common ancestor of deuterostomes and protostomes (Mirabeau and Joly, 2013; Jekely, 2013). Furthermore, in protostomes two different types of CT-related peptides have been identified. Firstly, peptides that are structurally similar to vertebrate CT-type peptides in having an N-terminal disulphide bridge and secondly, diuretic hormone 31 (DH<sub>31</sub>)-type peptides that lack an N-terminal disulphide bridge. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis indicates that gene duplication in a common ancestor of the protostomes gave rise to genes encoding CT-like peptides with a disulphide bridge and DH<sub>31</sub>-type peptides, which were then differentially retained in protostome taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2018</xref>). Receptors for CT-like peptides with a disulphide bridge have been characterised in a molluscan species, the oyster <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic>, which has seven CTR/CLR-type receptors. Two of these receptors, named Cg-CT-R and Cragi-CTR2, were shown to be specifically activated by the CT-type neuropeptides Cragi-CT1b and Cragi-CT2, respectively, thereby mediating intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and cAMP accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schwartz <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). CT-like peptides with a disulphide bridge are not present in the insect <italic>Drosophila melanogaster.</italic> However, receptors that are activated by DH<sub>31</sub> have been identified in this species and, interestingly, DH<sub>31</sub> can act as a ligand for two types of receptors. Thus, DH<sub>31</sub> acts as a ligand for a CTR/CLR-related protein (CG17415), but it also acts as a ligand for a protein (CG13758) that is the receptor for pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mertens et al., 2005</xref>; Shafer et al., 2008). However, the evolutionary and functional significance of the occurrence of dual receptor pathways for DH<sub>31</sub> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are not known.</p>
<p>Currently, relatively little is known about CT-type signaling systems in deuterostome invertebrates. Analysis of transcriptome/genome sequence data has enabled identification of genes/transcripts encoding CT-type peptides and candidate CTR/CLR-type receptors for these peptides in several deuterostome invertebrate taxa, including urochordates (e.g. <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>), cephalochordates (e.g. <italic>Branchiostoma floridae</italic>), hemichordates (e.g. <italic>Saccoglossus kowalevskii</italic>) and echinoderms (e.g. <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>) (Burke et al., 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sekiguchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sekiguchi et al., 2016</xref>; Rowe and Elphick, 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Martins et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of the expression and action of CT-type peptides identified in the starfish <italic>Asterias rubens</italic> and <italic>Patiria pectinifera</italic> has revealed that they act as muscle relaxants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2018</xref>; Semmens et al., 2016). However, experimental confirmation of ligand-receptor partners has thus far only been reported for the cephalochordate <italic>B. floridae</italic>, where three CT-type peptides were shown to act as ligands for a CTR/CLR-type receptor when it is co-expressed with RAMP-type proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sekiguchi et al., 2016</xref>). To gain further insights into the mechanisms of CT-type signaling in invertebrate deuterostomes, the aim of this study was to functionally characterise CT-type peptides and their receptors in an echinoderm – the sea cucumber <italic>Apostichopus japonicus</italic>.
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>A. japonicus</italic> is an economically important species in Asian aquaculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pangestuti and Arifin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Guo et al., 2020</xref>) and a species representative of the phylum Echinodermata. As a phylum of deuterostome invertebrates, echinoderms form a sister clade to the chordates together with hemichordates and xenoturbellids (Bromham and Degnan, 1999; Bourlat et al., 2006; Dunn et al., 2008) and as such they occupy a key “intermediate” phylogenetic position relative to the protostome invertebrates and vertebrates (Zandawala et al., 2017), which make them attractive as experimental systems to address evolutionary questions. In our previous studies, we have established this species as a model system to obtain insights into the evolutionary history and comparative physiology of neuropeptide signaling systems in bilaterians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cong et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zheng et al., 2024</xref>). A gene encoding two CT-type peptides (AjCT1 and AjCT2) has been identified in <italic>A. japonicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>) and a candidate receptor (AjCTR) for these peptides has also been predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, relevant to the discovery that the CT-like peptide DH<sub>31</sub> can act as a ligand for both a CTR/CLR-type receptor and a PDF-type receptor in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the sequences of two PDF-type receptors have been identified in <italic>A. japonicus</italic> (AjPDFR1 and AjPDFR2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al., 2021</xref>).</p></list-item>

The first aim of this study was to investigate if AjCT1 and/or AjCT2 act as ligands for AjCTR, AjPDFR1 and AjPDFR2 and to characterise the downstream signaling pathways that are activated when AjCT1 and/or AjCT2 bind to their receptor(s). The second aim was to investigate the physiological roles of AjCT1 and AjCT2 in <italic>A. japonicus</italic> by analysing the expression of the gene encoding these peptides, examining the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacological effects of these peptides and performing loss-of-function tests. The functional characterisation of CT-type signaling in <italic>A. japonicus</italic> reported in this study provides new insights into the evolution and comparative physiology of neuropeptides and a basis for application of neuropeptide-based strategies to improve aquaculture methods for this economically important species.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>Characterization and phylogenetic analysis of AjCT1/2</title>
<p>The complete cDNA sequences of the CT-type neuropeptide precursors <italic>AjCTP1</italic> and <italic>AjCTP2</italic> were confirmed. The coding sequence of <italic>AjCTP2</italic> is shorter than <italic>AjCTP1</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) but both transcripts encode precursor proteins that comprise the same predicted 23-residue N-terminal signal peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>). <italic>AjCTP1</italic> encodes both putative CT-type neuropeptides (AjCT1 and AjCT2), while <italic>AjCTP2</italic> only encodes AjCT2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">1B</xref>). Exon and intron structure analysis showed that <italic>AjCTP1</italic> comprises four exons, with AjCT1 and AjCT2 encoded in the third and fourth exons, respectively. <italic>AjCTP2</italic> comprises three exons, excluding the third exon that encodes AjCT1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that AjCTP1 and AjCTP2 are closely related to CT-type precursors from other sea cucumbers (<italic>Holothuria glaberrima</italic> and <italic>Holothuria scabra</italic>), and are positioned within a clade that also contains CT-type precursors from other echinoderms (sea urchin <italic>S. purpuratus</italic>, starfish <italic>A. rubens</italic>). Furthermore, with vasopressin/oxytocin-type neuropeptide precursors included as an outgroup, the echinoderm CT-type precursors are positioned within a clade that also comprises CT-type precursors from chordates and DH<sub>31</sub>/CT-type precursors from protostomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The predicted tertiary structures of the AjCTP1 and AjCTP2 proteins are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1C</xref>. Sequence alignment of CT-related neuropeptides revealed that, with the exception of DH<sub>31</sub>-type peptides, the N-terminal region of CT-related peptides has a pair of conserved cysteine residues that are known or predicted to form a disulfide bond. Another conserved feature is a C-terminal proline residue, with the exception of CGRPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1-figure supplement 2</xref>). Accordingly, both AjCT1 and AjCT2 have these two conserved characteristics described above.</p>

<label>2.2</label><title>Characterization and phylogenetic analysis of three candidate receptors for AjCT1/2</title>
<p>The sequences of three candidate receptors for AjCT1 and AjCT2 were obtained by RACE and phosphorylation sites were predicted, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1-figure supplement 3A, 3B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3C</xref>. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CTR/CLR-type receptors divided into two clades and AjCTR was positioned in a clade with other deuterostome CTR/CLR-type receptors, whilst the other clade comprised CTR/CLR-type receptors from protostomes. Similarly, AjPDFR1 and AjPDFR2 were positioned in a clade comprising PDF-type receptors from other deuterostomes, whilst another clade comprised PDF-type receptors from protostomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Domain prediction of the candidate receptors showed that AjCTR had HRM (Hormone receptor) and 7tm_GPCRs (seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor) superfamily domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1-figure supplement 4A</xref>), whereas AjPDFR1 and AjPDFR2 only presented the 7tm_GPCRs superfamily domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1-figure supplement 4B</xref>). To further investigate an orthologous relationship of the candidate receptors with homologous receptors in other echinoderms, we conducted a gene synteny analysis in <italic>A. japonicus</italic>, <italic>A. rubens</italic> and <italic>L. variegatus</italic>. The neighboring genes of <italic>AjCTR</italic> included <italic>GOLGA4</italic>, <italic>NeuroD</italic>, <italic>CRF2</italic>, <italic>ppGalNAc-T</italic>, <italic>URB3</italic>, <italic>SLC40A1</italic>, <italic>CMAH</italic> and <italic>MAGP</italic>. The relative positions of these genes were different from those in <italic>A. rubens</italic> and <italic>L. variegatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1-figure supplement 4C</xref>). The same situation was also observed for the synteny analysis of PDFRs.</p>

<label>2.3</label><title>AjCT1 and AjCT2 act as ligands for AjCTR, AjPDFR1 and AjPDFR2</title>
<p>To investigate if AjCT1 and/or AjCT2 act as ligands for AjCTR, AjPDFR1 and AjPDFR2, here, two receptor assay methods were employed. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, both AjCT1 and AjCT2 (10<sup>-6</sup> M) caused a significant increase in CRE luciferase activity in HEK293T cells transfected with AjCTR, AjPDFR1 or AjPDFR2 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, this effect was inhibited by pre-incubation of cells with the PKA inhibitor H89. The intracellular accumulation of cAMP was also measured, and this showed that AjCT1 and AjCT2 (10<sup>-9</sup> – 10<sup>-5</sup> M) caused a dose-dependent increase in cAMP in HEK293T cells transfected with AjCTR, AjPDFR1 or AjPDFR2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). However, when exposed to AjCT1 or AjCT2, the maximum accumulation of intracellular cAMP was higher in cells transfected with <italic>AjCTR</italic> than in cells transfected with <italic>AjPDFR1</italic> and <italic>AjPDFR2</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Measurement of SRE luciferase activity revealed that AjCT1 and AjCT2 (10<sup>-6</sup> M) administration evoked an increase in activity in HEK293T cells transfected with <italic>AjCTR</italic> and <italic>AjPDFR1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). However, in HEK293T cells transfected with <italic>AjPDFR2</italic>, an increase in SRE luciferase activity was only observed with AjCT2, not with AjCT1 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, AjCT1- and AjCT2-induced increases in SRE luciferase activity were not observed in cells that had been pre-incubated with FR900359 (Gαq protein inhibitor) and Gö 6983 (PKC inhibitor). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>, receptors localized in the cell membrane, but after exposure to AjCT1 and AjCT2 (10<sup>-6</sup> M) for 15 min, internalization of pEGFP-N1/<italic>AjCTR</italic>, pEGFP-N1/<italic>AjPDFR1</italic> and pEGFP-N1/<italic>AjPDFR2</italic> was observed in transfected HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Taken together, all these findings indicate that AjCT1 and AjCT2 can act as ligands for the three candidate receptors and then activate cAMP/PKA signaling and Gαq/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PKC signaling in all combinations, with the exception of AjCT1/<italic>AjPDFR2</italic> which only activates the cAMP/PKA cascade.</p>

<p>To investigate whether the activated signaling pathways may exert downstream effects via the ERK–MAPK pathway, the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 were analysed in transfected HEK293T cells. pERK1/2 levels in cells transfected with <italic>AjCTR</italic> or <italic>AjPDFR1</italic>, but not <italic>AjPDFR2,</italic> were significantly increased after a 5 min incubation with AjCT1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

<p>Previous studies have revealed that the CT-type neuropeptide DH<sub>31</sub> can act as a ligand for a CTR/CLR-type receptor and a pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) receptor in a protostome – the insect <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mertens et al., 2005</xref>; Shafer et al., 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schwartz et al., 2019</xref>). Here we show that two CT-type peptides (AjCT1 and AjCT2) act as ligands for a CTR/CLR-type receptor and two pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) type receptors in a deuterostome – the sea cucumber <italic>A. japonicus</italic> (phylum Echinodermata). This is an important finding because it indicates that the ability of CT-type neuropeptides to act as ligands for both CTR/CLR-type receptors and PDF-type receptors is an evolutionarily ancient property that originated in a common ancestor of the Bilateria. However, further studies on a wider variety of both protostome (e.g. molluscs, annelids) and deuterostome taxa (e.g. other echinoderms, hemichordates) will be needed to establish if this is an evolutionarily conserved property of CT-type neuropeptides. Here, we also investigated the signal transduction pathways that are activated by AjCT1 and AjCT2 when these peptides bind to their receptors and then proceeded to investigate the expression and actions of these peptides to gain insights into their physiological/behavioral roles in <italic>A. japonicus</italic>, as discussed below.</p>

<label>3.1</label><title>Alternative RNA splicing gives rise to transcripts encoding one (AjCT2) or two (AjCT1, AjCT2) CT-type neuropeptides in A. japonicus</title>
<p>In vertebrates, alternative RNA splicing gives rise to transcripts encoding CT or CGRP (Amara et al., 1982; Morris et al., 1984). Analysis of transcriptome/genome sequence data from <italic>A. japonicus</italic> has revealed that in this species alternative RNA splicing gives rise to transcripts encoding one (AjCT2) or two (AjCT1, AjCT2) CT-type neuropeptides (Rowe et al., 2014; Zandawala et al., 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; this study). A similar pattern of alternative RNA splicing has been reported for CT-type precursors in other sea cucumbers (<italic>H. scabra</italic> and <italic>H. glaberrima</italic>; class Holothuroidea) and in brittle stars (<italic>Amphiura filiformis</italic> and <italic>Ophiopsila Aranea</italic>; class Ophiuroidea) (Zandawala et al., 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Suwansa-Ard et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, CT-type precursors identified in other echinoderm classes (Asteroidea, Echinoidea and Crinoidea) comprise a single CT-type neuropeptide (Rowe and Elphick, 2012; Mirabeau and Joly, 2013; Rowe et al., 2014; Semmens et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aleotti et al., 2022</xref>). However, it remains to be determined if this feature of CT-type precursors in sea cucumbers and brittle stars evolved independently or originated in a common ancestor of eleutherozoan echinoderms but with subsequent loss in Asteroidea and Echinoidea (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

<p>Analysis of the sequences of AjCT1 and AjCT2 revealed the presence of a two cysteine residues in their N-terminal regions, which is an evolutionarily conserved feature of CT-type peptides. Furthermore, structural analysis of CT-type peptides in vertebrates and in starfish has revealed that these cysteines form a disulphide bridge in the mature peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2018</xref>) and therefore it is inferred that this post-translational modification also occurs in AjCT1 and AjCT2. Furthermore, the C-terminal residue of the AjCT1 and ACT2 is predicted to be an amidated proline, which is a conserved post-translational modification of CT/DH31-type peptides in many taxa, but not vertebrate CGRPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<label>3.2</label><title>Identification and characterisation of receptors for CT-type neuropeptides in A. japonicus</title>
<p>Informed by previous genome-wide analysis of GPCRs in <italic>A. japonicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al., 2021</xref>), we identified three candidate receptors for AjCT1 and/or AjCT2. Firstly, AjCTR, which is a homolog of CT/DH<sub>31</sub>-type receptors that have been identified in other taxa, including vertebrates and insects (Garelja et al., 2022; Johnson et al., 2005; Toribio et al., 2003). Secondly, AjPDFR1 and AjPDF2, which are homologs of the PDF-type receptor that has been shown to be activated by DH<sub>31</sub> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mertens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zandawala, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In mammals, CTR and CLR mediate effects of all CT-related neuropeptides, but their ligand specificity relies on the presence and types of receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) (McLatchie et al., 1998; Purdue et al., 2002; Conner et al., 2004; Hay et al., 2018). Thus, CTR acts as a functional receptor for CT-type peptides without an associated RAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Katafuchi et al., 2009</xref>), whereas activation of downstream signaling via CLR requires an associated RAMP (Hay et al., 2018). Here, we investigated the occurrence of RAMPs in <italic>A. japonicus</italic> using the tblastn method employed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sekiguchi <italic>et al</italic>., (2016)</xref>, which enabled identification of RAMPs in the cephalochordate <italic>B. floridae</italic>. However, no RAMPs were identified in <italic>A. japonicus</italic>, suggesting that AjCTR may be functionally more similar to CTR than CLR. Accordingly, tblastn analysis of other available echinoderm genomes (<italic>A. rubens</italic>, <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> and <italic>A. japonica</italic>), as well as transcriptome databases for brittle stars (<italic>O. victoriae</italic>, <italic>O. aranea</italic> and <italic>A. filiformis</italic>; no published genomes), also failed to identify RAMPs. Likewise, RAMPs have also not been found in protostomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schwartz et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, RAMPs may be unique to chordates, although interestingly RAMPs have also not been identified in the urochordate <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sekiguchi et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As highlighted above, here we show that the CT-type peptides AjCT1 and AjCT2 both act as ligands for a CTR/CLR-type receptor (AjCTR) and two PDF-type receptors (AjPDFR1, AjPDFR2) in <italic>A. japonicus</italic>. Furthermore, characterization of downstream signaling mechanisms revealed that both AjCT1 and AjCT2 trigger AjCTR-mediated cAMP accumulation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization, and ERK signaling. These findings are consistent with previous studies on CT-type receptors in vertebrates and in the mollusc <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pondel, 2000</xref>; Walker et al., 2010; Andreassen et al., 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schwartz et al., 2019</xref>). Both AjCT1 and AjCT2 trigger cAMP accumulation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization, and ERK signaling mediated by AjPDFR1. Both AjCT1 and AjCT2 triggered cAMP accumulation mediated by AjPDF2, but only AjCT2 (not AjCT1) triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and ERK signaling mediated by AjPDFR2. These differences in the signal transduction mechanisms activated by AjCT1 and AjCT2 may account for differences in the pharmacological activities and physiological roles of these peptides, as discussed below.</p>

<label>3.3</label><title>AjCT1 and AjCT2 act as muscle relaxants in A. japonicus</title>
<p>Analysis of the expression of the gene encoding the precursors comprising AjCT2 or AjCT1 and AjCT2 revealed the occurrence of transcripts in the circumoral nervous system as well as in peripheral tissues/organs, including the longitudinal body wall muscle, digestive system and gonads. Accordingly, analysis of CT-type neuropeptide expression in other echinoderms has revealed a widespread pattern of expression in larval and adult starfish (<italic>A. rubens</italic>) and in juvenile and adult featherstars (<italic>Antedon mediterranea</italic>) (Mayorova et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aleotti et al., 2022</xref>). Several CT-related peptides act as muscle relaxants in vertebrates (Steiner et al., 1991; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pinto et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yoshimoto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Edvinsson et al., 2001</xref>; Golpon et al., 2001; Kandilci et al., 2008) and, accordingly, previous studies have revealed that CT-type neuropeptides cause relaxation of muscle preparations in starfish, including locomotory organs (tube feet) and the apical muscle, which is functionally similar to the longitudinal body wall muscle in sea cucumbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it was of interest to investigate if AjCT1 and/or AjCT2 act as muscle relaxants in <italic>A. japonicus</italic>. Both AjCT1 and AjCT2 caused dose-dependent relaxation of longitudinal muscle preparations, consistent with the relaxing effect of CT-type peptides on starfish apical muscle preparations. Furthermore, AjCT2, but not AjCT1, caused dose-dependent relaxation of intestine preparations from <italic>A. japonicus</italic>. Interestingly, the CT-type peptide ArCT does not to cause relaxation of cardiac stomach preparations from the starfish <italic>A. rubens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, from a functional perspective ArCT is more like AjCT1 than AjCT2 and we speculate that this may reflect loss of an exon encoding a AjCT2-like peptide in the Asteroidea lineage. Further insights into this issue and the evolution of CT-type neuropeptide function echinoderms could be obtained by investigation of the actions of CT-type peptides in brittle stars and sea urchins. Differences in the effects of AjCT1 and ArCT2 on the intestine may be explained by differences in their signal transduction mechanisms. Thus, only AjCT2, not AjCT1, triggered AjPDFR2-mediated acivation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and ERK signaling and therefore we speculate that the relaxing effect of AjCT2 on the intestine may be mediated by activation of AjPDFR2.</p>

<label>3.4</label><title>AjCT2 stimulates feeding and growth in A. japonicus</title>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic> pharmacological experiments revealed that treatment with AjCT2 at a high concentration (5 × 10<sup>-1</sup> mg/ml) caused a significant increase in body mass, and this was accompanied by a decrease in residual bait and an increase in feacal mass. However, these effects were not observed with AjCT2 at a low concentration (5 × 10<sup>-3</sup> mg/ml) or with AjCT1 at low or high concentrations. It is noteworthy that AjCT2, but not AjCT1, has a relaxing effect on the intestine in <italic>A. japonicus</italic> and therefore the effects of AjCT2 on feeding, defecation and growth may, at least in part, be mediated via binding of this peptide to receptors in the intestine. Accordingly, upregulation of the expression of the AjCT1/AjCT2 receptors AjCTR, AjPDFR1 and AjPDFR2 was observed in the intestine of animals injected with AjCT2 at a high concentration. Furthermore, changes in intestinal expression of genes encoding growth-related factors were also observed in animals injected with AjCT2 at a high concentration, with up-regulation of <italic>AjIgf</italic> and <italic>AjMegf6</italic> expression and down-regulation of <italic>AjGDF-8</italic> (Appendix 1—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1</xref>). Consistent with these changes in gene expression and the growth-promoting effect of AjCT2, it has been reported that <italic>GDF-8</italic> inhibits growth in <italic>A. japonicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li et al., 2016</xref>), whilst <italic>Megf6</italic> and <italic>Igf</italic> promote growth in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Párrizas and LeRoith, 1997</xref>; Deribe et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Collectively, these findings indicate that AjCT2 has a physiological role in stimulating feeding and growth in <italic>A. japonicus.</italic> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report orexigenic and growth-promoting effects of a CT-type neuropeptide in bilaterian animals. Interestingly, previous studies have reported the expression of CT-type neuropeptides in the digestive system of invertebrate chordates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sekiguchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sekiguchi et al., 2016</xref>). However, in contrast to the stimulatory effect of AjCT2 on feeding/growth in <italic>A. japonicus</italic>, CT-type neuropeptides have been found to inhibit feeding and growth in vertebrates (Del et al., 2002; Hay et al., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nakamura et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it appears that opposing roles of CT-type neuropeptide signaling systems as regulators for feeding/growth have evolved in deuterostomes, with a stimulatory role reported here in an echinoderm and an inhibitory role reported previously in vertebrates. Further research is now needed to investigate if the stimulatory effect of AjCT2 on feeding/growth observed in here in <italic>A. japonicus</italic> also applies to other sea cucumber species. Moreover, our discovery of this effect of AjCT2 on <italic>A. japonicus</italic> may provide a basis for development of novel approaches to improve aquaculture of this economically important species.</p>

<p>Adult sea cucumbers were collected from an aquaculture breeding farm in Weihai, Shandong, China. All the animals were acclimated in breeding aquaria (18 ℃, 32 ppt) for at least seven days and fed daily with a commercially formulated diet. Tissues used for cDNA cloning and qRT-PCR were obtained from five adult <italic>A. japonicus</italic> (∼120 g) and kept at -80 ℃ until use. Circumoral nervous tissues from three adult sea cucumbers (∼120 g) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, G-CLONE, Beijing, China) and used for <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analysis. <italic>In vitro</italic> functional analysis and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments were carried out using twelve (∼120 g body weight) and 168 (∼20 g) sea cucumbers, respectively.</p>

<label>4.3</label><title>Cloning, sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree construction for candidate AjCT1/2 receptors in A. japonicus</title>
<p>Five potential receptors for AjCT1 and AjCT2 in <italic>A. japonicus</italic> (GenBank accession number: PIK49998.1, PIK49999.1, PIK49604.1, PIK34007.1 and PIK62458.1) were identified based on genome-wide analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al., 2021</xref>). Sequence comparison revealed that both PIK49998.1 and PIK62458.1 were partial sequences of PIK34007.1. Thus, three candidate receptors named as <italic>AjCTR</italic> (Calcitonin receptor, GenBank accession number: PIK49604.1), <italic>AjPDFR1</italic> (Pigment-dispersing factor receptor 1, GenBank accession number: PIK34007.1), and <italic>AjPDFR2</italic> (Pigment-dispersing factor receptor 2, GenBank accession number: PIK49999.1) were predicted and then analyzed. To confirm the accuracy of these sequences, cDNAs were cloned using the SMARTer RACE 5’/3’ Kit (Takara, Cat No. 634858) and then sequenced (Beijing Genomics Institution, China). Receptor sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis were performed as described in 4.2. In addition, the online tool NetPhos-3.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?NetPhos-3.1">https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?NetPhos-3.1</ext-link>) was used to predict potential phosphorylation sites. The conserved domains of protein sequences were predicted by the Batch SMART plugin of TBtools (Toolbox for biologists, v.1.098652) software. For analysis of gene synteny, neighboring genes of <italic>AjCTR</italic>, <italic>AjPDFR1</italic> and <italic>AjPDFR2</italic> were found based on an <italic>A. japonicus</italic> chromosome-level genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang et al., 2022</xref>) and the corresponding genes in the starfish <italic>Asterias rubens</italic> and the sea urchin <italic>Lytechinus variegatus</italic> were also identified by performing BLASTp in the NCBI database.

<label>4.4</label><title>Testing AjCT1 and AjCT2 as ligands for candidate receptors and exploration of downstream signaling pathways</title>
<p>AjCT1 and AjCT2 were custom synthesized by GL Biochem Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Subsequently, CRE (cAMP response element) -Luc (Luciferase) detection, cAMP accumulation, SRE (serum response element) -Luc detection, receptor translocation assays, and Western blotting were carried out.</p>
<p><italic>AjCTR</italic>, <italic>AjPDFR1</italic> and <italic>AjPDFR2</italic> incorporating enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were constructed respectively according to the method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li <italic>et al</italic>. (2022)</xref>. Briefly, the complete ORFs of candidate receptors were cloned and sequenced. Then, the PCR products were digested with EcoRI and BamHI (TaKaRa, Kusatsu, Japan) and then incorporated into the pEGFP-N1 vector (YouBio, Changsha, China) that was subject to the same double-digestion. Finally, the constructed plasmid with correct sequences was transfected into HEK293T cells seeded on glass coverslips in 12-well plates. After incubation with AjCT1 (10<sup>-6</sup> M), AjCT2 (10<sup>-6</sup> M) or serum-free DMEM (Biosharp, Hefei, China) for 15 min, cells were washed with PBS (Biosharp, Hefei, China) and fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min. Finally, cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (G-CLONE, Beijing, China) for 5 min and an Olympus bright field light microscope was used for image capture. The pcDNA 3.1(+) vectors (YouBio, Changsha, China) comprising the complete ORF of the three candidate receptors were also constructed as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li <italic>et al</italic>. (2022)</xref>. Then, they were co-transfected with the cAMP response element, pCRE-Luc (YouBio, Changsha, China) or the pSRE-Luc plasmid including PKC reporter gene (YouBio, Changsha, China) into HEK293T cells. Incubation was carried out with AjCT1 (10<sup>-6</sup> M), AjCT2 (10<sup>-6</sup> M) or serum-free DMEM (negative control) for 4 h at 37 °C. Finally, luciferase activity was tested using the firefly luciferase assay kit (MK, Shanghai, China). When required, transfected cells described above were co-incubated with H89 (PKA inhibitor) (Absin, Shanghai, China), FR900359 (Gαq protein inhibitor) (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan) or Gö 6983 (PKC inhibitor) (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan) before the experiment to explore the potential signaling pathways. To confirm the concentration of intracellular cAMP after stimulation, HEK293T cells expressing pcDNA 3.1(+)/<italic>AjCTR</italic>, pcDNA 3.1(+)/<italic>AjPDFR2</italic> or pcDNA 3.1(+)/<italic>AjPDFR1</italic> were treated with AjCT1 or AjCT2 (10<sup>-9</sup> – 10<sup>-5</sup> M) respectively for 15 min after 2 h starvation in serum-free medium. Subsequently, cAMP was measured using the ELISA-based cAMP assay kit (R&amp;D systems, USA&amp;Canada) following the manufacturer’s instruction. HEK293T cells transfected with empty pcDNA3.1(+) were used as a negative control. The specific primers used for constructing plasmids are listed in Supplemental Table 1.</p>
<p>Western blotting was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, HEK293T cells transfected with the constructed pcDNA 3.1(+) plasmid were starved in serum-free medium for 2 h, and then incubated with AjCT1 or AjCT2 (10<sup>-6</sup> M). PVDF membranes containing proteins were blocked with 5% BSA (G-CLONE, Beijing, China) and incubated overnight with phosphorylated ERK1/2 kinases (CST, Boston, China). After that, goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Absin, Shanghai, China) was applied and incubated, followed by the addition of Omni-ECL™ Femto Light Chemiluminescence reagents (EpiZyme, Shanghai, China) . Finally, RVL-100-G (ECHO, America) was applied for visualization of the PVDF membrane. When required, transfected cells were co-incubated with PKA or PKC inhibitor before the experiment to identify signaling pathways that activate downstream ERK1/2 cascade.</p>

<p>qRT-PCR was employed to detect <italic>AjCTP1</italic> and <italic>AjCTP2</italic> transcript expression in five tissues from <italic>A. japonicus</italic>, including the intestine, longitudinal muscle, respiratory tree, gonad and circumoral nervous system. Because it was difficult to design specific primers for <italic>AjCTP1</italic> and <italic>AjCTP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>), total transcript expression levels for <italic>AjCTP1/2</italic> (<italic>AjCTP1</italic> + <italic>AjCTP2</italic>) were investigated. Total RNA was extracted from the collected tissues using Trizol RNA isolation reagent (Vazyme, Nanjing, China), cDNA was synthesized using Hifair® Ⅲ 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix (YEASEN, Shanghai, China) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For qRT-PCR, amplification was performed in 20 µL volume reactions based on Hieff UNICON Universal Blue qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (YEASEN, Shanghai, China) and expression levels were assessed by a Corbett Rotoe-Gnen Q (Qiagen, Germany). 𝛽 - actin (GenBank accession number: PIK61412.1) and 𝛽 -tubulin (GenBank accession number: PIK51093) were used as house-keeping genes for normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). The 2<sup>−ΔΔCT</sup> method was applied to analyze the relative expression levels and comparison between tissues was carried out using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Tukey post hoc test (IBM SPSS 25.0 software, Chicago, IL, USA). A <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.05 was considered as a statistically significant difference. Specific sequences of primers used for qRT-PCR are listed in Supplemental Table 1.</p>

Blocking buffer was used for blocking non-specific binding sites and then alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies were added according to the manufacturer’s instruction, which could specifically bind to the hybridized nucleic acid probe. Finally, the chromogenic substrate NBT/BCIP was added for visualization of <italic>AjCTP1/2</italic> expression.

<p>Longitudinal muscles and intestines (20 mm in length) from <italic>A. japonicus</italic> were dissected and then suspended in a 50 mL glass organ bath containing 20 mL sterilized seawater. Both ends of the preprations were tied with cotton ligatures and then one end was tied to a metal hook and the other end was connected with a High Grade Isotonic Transducer (ADinstruments MLT0015, Oxford, UK). Before testing, the preparation was stabilized for about 20 min, and the resting tension was adjusted to 1.0 g. Informed by previous findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al.

<label>4.8</label><title>Investigation of the in vivo pharmacological effects of AjCT1 and AjCT2 in A. japonicus</title>
<p>A total of 150 adult sea cucumbers were randomly assigned to five groups (30 individuals per group), including two high concentration groups (CT1H and CT2H, 5 × 10<sup>-1</sup> mg/ml), two low concentration groups (CT1L and CT2L, 5 × 10<sup>-3</sup> mg/ml) and the control group (CO, sterilized seawater), with each group consisting of three parallel experiments comprising ten animals.

The si<italic>AjCTP1/2</italic>-1, si<italic>AjCTP1/2</italic>-2 or siNC dry powder was diluted to 20 μM with DEPC water following the manufacturer’s instruction, then 60 μl sterilized seawater was mixed with 20 μl si<italic>AjCTP1/2</italic>-1, si<italic>AjCTP1/2</italic>-2 or siNC, and 20 μl Lipo6000 transfection reagent (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) as the transfection solution. Eighteen sea cucumbers were randomly divided into three groups and injected with three different transfection solutions respectively. The mixed solutions were injected through the peristome once a day (1 μl/g wet weight) and intestines were dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen 3 days after injection. The expression level of <italic>AjCTP1/2</italic> was investigated by qRT-PCR and the interference rate was calculated to determine the inhibition efficiency of siRNAs.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript characterizes a functional peptidergic system in the echinoderm Apostichopus japonicus that is related to the widely conserved family of calcitonin/diuretic hormone 31 (CT/DH31) peptides in bilaterian animals. In vitro analysis of receptor-ligand interactions, using multiple receptor activation assays, identifies three cognate receptors for two CT-like peptides in the sea cucumber, which stimulate cAMP, calcium, and ERK signaling. Only one of these receptors is closely related to the family of calcitonin and calcitonin-like receptors (CTR/CLR) in bilaterian animals, whereas two other receptors cluster with invertebrate pigment dispersing factor receptors (PDFRs). In addition, this study sheds light on the transcript expression and in vivo functions of CT-like peptides in A. japonicus, by quantitative real-time PCR, in situ hybridization, pharmacological experiments on body wall muscle and intestine preparations, and peptide injection and RNAi knockdown experiments. This reveals a conserved function of CT-like peptides as muscle relaxants and hints at a potential role as growth regulators in A. japonicus.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work combines both in vitro and in vivo functional assays to identify a CT-like peptidergic system in an economically relevant echinoderm species, the sea cucumber A. japonicus. A major strength of the study is that it identifies three G protein-coupled receptors for AjCT-like peptides, one related to the CTR/CLR family and two related to the PDFR family. A similar finding was previously reported for the CT-related peptide DH31 in Drosophila melanogaster that activates both CT-type and PDF-type receptors. Here, the authors expand this observation to a deuterostomian animal, which suggests that receptor promiscuity is a more general feature of the CT/DH31 peptide family and that CT/DH31-like peptides may activate both CT-type and PDF-type receptors in other animals as well.</p>
<p>Besides the identification of receptor-ligand pairs, the downstream signaling pathways of AjCT receptors have been characterized, highlighting broad effects on cAMP, calcium, and ERK signaling. Functional characterization of the CT-related peptide system in heterologous cells is complemented with ex vivo and in vivo experiments. First, peptide injection and RNAi knockdown experiments establish transcriptional regulation of all three identified receptors in response to changing AjCT peptide levels. Second, ex vivo experiments reveal a conserved role for the two CT-like peptides as muscle relaxants, which have differential effects on body wall muscle and intestine preparations. Finally, peptide injection studies suggest a putative role for one of the two CT-like peptides (AjCT2) in growth regulation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Analysis of transcript expression is limited to the CT-peptide encoding gene, while no gene expression analysis was attempted for the three identified receptors. Differences in the activation of downstream signaling pathways between the three receptors are also questionable due to unclarities in the statistical analysis and variation in the control and experimental data in heterologous assays. Together, this makes it difficult to propose a mechanism underlying differences in the functions of the two CT-like peptides in muscle control and growth regulation.</p>
<p>The authors also suggest a putative orexigenic role for the CT-like peptidergic system in feeding behavior. This effect is not well supported by the experimental data provided, as no detailed analysis of feeding behavior was carried out (only indirect measurements were performed that could be influenced by other peptidergic effects, such as on muscle relaxation) and no statistically significant differences were reported in these assays.</p>
<p>Overall, details regarding statistical analyses are not (clearly) specified in the manuscript, and there are several instances where statements are not supported by literature evidence.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors show that A. japonicus calcitonins (AjCT1 and AjCT2) activate not only the calcitonin/calcitonin-like receptor but also activate the two PDF receptors, ex vivo. They also explore secondary messenger pathways that are recruited following receptor activation. They determine the source of CT1 and CT2 using qPCR and in situ hybridization and finally test the effects of these peptides on tissue contractions, feeding, and growth. This study provides solid evidence that CT1 and CT2 act as ligands for calcitonin receptors; however, evidence supporting cross-talk between CT peptides and PDF receptors is only based on ex vivo experiments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is the first study to report the pharmacological characterization of CT receptors in an echinoderm. Multiple lines of evidence in cell culture (receptor internalization and secondary messenger pathways) support this conclusion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors claim that A. japonicus CTs activate &quot;PDF&quot; receptors and suggest that this cross-talk is evolutionarily ancient since a similar phenomenon also exists in the fly Drosophila melanogaster. These conclusions are not fully supported for several reasons. The authors perform phylogenetic analysis to show that the two &quot;PDF&quot; receptors form an independent clade. This clade is sister to the clade comprising CT receptors. This phylogenetic analysis suffers from several issues. Firstly, the phylogenies lack bootstrap support. Secondly, the resolution of the phylogeny is poor because representative members from diverse phyla have not been included. For instance, insect or other protostomian PDF receptors have not been included so how can the authors distinguish between &quot;PDF&quot; receptors or another group of CT receptors? Thirdly, no in vivo evidence has been presented to support that CT can activate &quot;PDF&quot; receptors in vivo.</p>
<p>The source of CT which mediates the effects on longitudinal muscles and intestine is unclear. Is it autocrine or paracrine signaling by CT from the same tissue or is it long-range hormonal signaling?</p>
<p>Pharmacology experiments showing the effects of CT1 and CT2 on ACh-induced contractions were performed. Sample traces have been provided but no traces with ACh alone have been included. How long do ACh-induced contractions persist? These controls are necessary to differentiate between the eventual decay of ACh effects and relaxation induced by CT1 and CT2. The traces also do not reflect the results portrayed in dose-response curves. For instance, in Figure 6B, maximum relaxation is reported for 10-6M. Yet, the trace hardly shows any difference before and after the addition of 10-6M peptide. The maximum effect in the trace appears to be after the addition of 10-8M peptide.</p>
<p>I am unsure how differences in wet mass indicate feeding and growth differences since no justification has been provided. Couldn't wet mass also be influenced by differences in osmotic balance, a key function of calcitonin-like peptides in protostomian invertebrates? The statistical comparisons have not been included in Figure 7B.</p>
<p>While the authors succeeded in knocking down CT, the physiological effects of reduced CT signaling were not examined.</p>

<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s comment, we will supplement the expression analysis for the three identified receptors. Actually, we did all the statistical tests for all the experiments, and maybe the form of marking is a bit messy, so sorry for the confusion and we will uniform them and include all this information both in the figure legends and the methods section. And for the variation in the control and experimental data, because every control is transfected with different receptors or uses cells from different batches, that is why the control conditions in different experiments have little bit variation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors also suggest a putative orexigenic role for the CT-like peptidergic system in feeding behavior.

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s comment. Actually, we did all the statistical tests for all the experiments, the mass of remaining bait and the excrement were added in Figure 7A-figure supplement 1 and we will conduct additional behavioral experiments to explore the changes in feeding behavior of <italic>A. japonicus</italic> after injection of CT-type neuropeptides to support the role of CT-like peptidergic system in the regulation of feeding behavior, as I mentioned above, maybe the form of marking is a bit messy, so sorry for the confusion and we will uniform them and include all this information both in the figure legends and the methods section. And also we will supplement the experiments to further support our claim by assessing the feeding and growth factors after knocking down the CTP encoding genes.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We do agree with the reviewer that the cross-talk between CTs and PDFRs is not so solid based on our current study.</p>
<p>So firstly, we will re-do the phylogenetic analyses as the reviewer suggested and mark the bootstrap value, then we will supplement more experiments (like PDFR knockdown) to further confirm that CT can activate “PDF” receptors in vivo.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The source of CT which mediates the effects on longitudinal muscles and intestine is unclear. Is it autocrine or paracrine signaling by CT from the same tissue or is it long-range hormonal signaling?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s comment, actually we have done in situ and immunohistochemical experiments for CTP and CT in different tissues, we just did not put them in our current manuscript, we will add them in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s comment, we will provide the trace of contraction caused by ACh alone. In Figure 6B, the trace represents successive treatments of neuropeptides at different concentrations, which represents a cumulative effect. Therefore, the corresponding receptors may become desensitized when high concentration of peptide is finally applied. Actually, we examined the pharmacological effects of CT2 at 10-6M concentrations, which exhibited the maximum relaxation, and we will provide this trace.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s comment, we will analyze the weight gain rate, growth rate and feeding rate of <italic>A. japonicus</italic> to explain the difference of feeding and growth between injection group and control group. And we can confirm that wet mass is not influenced by differences in osmotic balance, we will put our supporting evidence in supplementary files in revised manuscript and we did not find the key function of calcitonin-like peptides observed in protostomian invertebrates.
