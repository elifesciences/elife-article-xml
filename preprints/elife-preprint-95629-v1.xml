<title>Abstract</title><p>Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are unique glial cells found in both the central and peripheral nervous systems where they support the continuous axonal outgrowth of immature olfactory sensory neurons to their targets. Here we show that following severe spinal cord injury, olfactory bulb-derived OECs transplanted near the injury site modify the normally inhibitory glial scar and facilitate axon regeneration past the scar border and into the lesion center. To understand the mechanisms underlying the reparative properties of such transplanted OECs, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to study their gene expression programs. Our analyses revealed five diverse subtypes of OECs, each expressing novel marker genes and pathways indicative of progenitor, axonal regeneration and repair, secreted molecules, or microglia-like functions. As expected, we found substantial overlap of OEC genes with those of Schwann cells, but also with astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia. We confirmed established markers on cultured OECs, and then localized select top genes of OEC subtypes in rat olfactory bulb tissue. In addition, we present evidence that OECs secrete both Reelin and Connective tissue growth factor, extracellular matrix molecules which are important for neural repair and axonal outgrowth. Our results support that adult OECs are a unique hybrid glia, some with progenitor characteristics, and that their gene expression patterns indicate diverse functions related to wound healing, injury repair and axonal regeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are remarkable as they undergo life-long neurogenesis within the adult olfactory epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Graziadei &amp; Monti Graziadei, 1985</xref>), and their axons are exclusively associated with a specialized type of glia, olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Doucette, 1990</xref>). OECs provide the outgrowth and guidance factors needed for OSN axons to reach their glomerular targets and to exhibit regenerative abilities in response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Doucette, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Williams et al., 2004</xref>). OECs have received considerable interest due to their ability to support axonal outgrowth even after severe or complete spinal cord transection in rodents, dogs and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Granger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Khankan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ramon-Cueto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tabakow et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Takeoka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Thornton et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The regenerative capacity of adult spinal cord neurons is inhibited by the lesion site environment that includes a reactive glial scar, together with invading meningeal fibroblasts and multiple immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burda &amp; Sofroniew, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wanner et al., 2013</xref>). The lesion core is composed of non-neural tissue that inhibits axonal outgrowth due to the upregulation and secretion of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that impede axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cregg et al., 2014</xref>). Studies of severe or complete spinal cord transection in rats followed by the transplantation of OECs provided evidence that the OECs surround axon bundles which regenerate into and occasionally across the injury site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Khankan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ramon-Cueto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Takeoka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Thornton et al., 2018</xref>). In combination with <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, detailed analyses of injury sites suggest that OECs: 1) function as phagocytes to clear degenerating axonal debris and necrotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Khankan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nazareth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Su et al., 2013</xref>), 2) modulate the immune response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Khankan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Vincent et al., 2007</xref>), and 3) interact favorably with the glial scar and lesion core that form after injury <italic>in vitro</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lakatos et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lakatos et al., 2000</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Khankan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Thornton et al., 2018</xref>). OEC transplantation following complete spinal cord transection creates an environment that is conducive to neural repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Khankan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Takeoka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Thornton et al., 2018</xref>). OECs secrete molecules that stimulate axon outgrowth such as Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), Nerve growth factor (Ngf), and Laminin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ruitenberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Runyan &amp; Phelps, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Woodhall et al., 2001</xref>) and enhance cell-to-cell mediated interactions between neurites and OECs in an inhibitory environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chung et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Khankan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Windus et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Khankan et al. (2015)</xref> showed that neurites grew 2-3 times longer in growth-inhibitory areas of multicellular âscar-likeâ cultures when they were directly associated with olfactory bulb-derived OECs (OB-OECs), but the molecular mechanisms are unknown.</p>
<p>The major question addressed in this study is how OB-OECs perform the diverse functions associated with neural repair. We hypothesize that there exist OB-OEC subtypes, and that their respective gene programs and secreted molecules underlie their multifaceted reparative activities. Here we identify the OB-OEC subtypes and their molecular programs that contribute to injury repair, such as the growth-stimulating secreted and cell adhesion molecules involved in OB-OEC interactions that promote neurite and axonal outgrowth. We used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the immunopurified rat OB-OECs (hereafter called OECs unless stated otherwise) that are similar to those transplanted into our previous rat spinal cord injury studies. We first compared the genes expressed by purified OECs with those expressed by the âleftover cellsâ, i.e., the cells which are not selected by the panning procedure, to determine if the purification process selected for specific OEC subtypes. After confirming the characteristic OEC markers, our scRNA-seq data revealed five OEC subtypes which expressed unique marker genes and were further characterized and confirmed experimentally. Finally, we examined interesting extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules secreted by OECs, Reelin (<italic>Reln</italic>) and Connective tissue growth factor (<italic>Ccn2</italic>/<italic>Ctgf</italic>), both of which may facilitate axonal outgrowth into the inhibitory injury core environment.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>One particularly challenging aspect facing neural repair of spinal cord injury (SCI) is to facilitate axonal outgrowth and eventually regeneration across the inhibitory injury site. A common finding in our studies testing the effects of OEC transplantation following SCI is that OECs modify the injury site so that some axons project into the lesion core surrounded by OECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dixie, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Khankan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Takeoka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Thornton et al., 2018</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows an enlargement of an injury site which contains green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled OECs in the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-negative injury core between the two GFAP-positive spinal cord stumps. The OECs in the injury core are associated with a few serotonergic-(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a-f</xref>) and many neurofilament-labeled axons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g-l</xref>). To learn more about possible mechanisms by which OECs support axon regeneration, we prepared immunopurified OECs and examined their gene expression and diversity with scRNA-seq.</p>

<title>Unbiased scRNA-seq of immunopurified OECs and âleftoverâ controls distinguishes OECs, microglia, and fibroblasts</title>
<p>Using scRNA-seq, we sequenced a total of 65,481 cells across 7 samples (n=3 OEC preparations and 4 âleftoverâ controls) that passed quality control, with an average of 9,354 cells per sample. Cell clusters were visualized using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE). The tSNE plot showed that cells from imunnopanned OEC samples were separated from the cells from the leftover samples (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). Cell clustering analysis defined a total of seven clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>), each of which showed expression patterns of marker genes that distinguish one cluster from the others (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). Based on previously reported cell type marker genes, we found elevated expression of OEC marker genes in clusters 2, 3 and 7, microglia marker genes in clusters 4, 6, and 7, and fibroblast marker genes in clusters 0, 1, and 5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). As expected, many cells enriched in the leftover controls were defined as fibroblast and microglia based on the corresponding known marker genes, whereas cells from the immunopanned OEC samples showed high expression of OEC marker genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref> vs. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). After cell type assignment, a dot plot clearly depicts distinct expression of cell type-specific marker genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>). Our scRNA-seq results support the expected cell type composition following the immunopanning procedure.</p>

<p>We next asked if there were differences between cultures of immunopurified OECs and OECs grown in âleftoverâ cultures. While our previous spinal cord injury studies transplanted 90-95% purified OECs, other labs culture and implant less purified OECs and thus many of the neighboring cells, i.e., primarily fibroblasts and microglia, would be included. Our comparison showed that purified OECs express higher levels of <italic>Cryab</italic> (stress protection, inflammation inhibition), <italic>Nqo1</italic> (antioxidant protection, stress adaptation), and <italic>Postn</italic> (cell proliferation, survival, migration) genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref>), whereas OECs in leftover cultures with fibroblasts and microglia express higher levels of <italic>Apoe</italic> (lipid transport and glial function), <italic>Calcb</italic> (inflammation and pain modulation), and <italic>Mgp</italic> (ECM calcium inhibitor; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref>) than purified OECs. These results indicate immunopurified OECs may have better stress response and proliferative and survival capacity than the controls.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence verification of typical OEC marker genes revealed by scRNA-seq</title>
<p>To validate the OEC markers revealed by scRNA-seq, we re-cultured extra cells not used for sequencing for immunocytochemical confirmation (Suppl. Table 1). Because our adult OECs are immunopurified with anti-nerve growth factor receptor p75 (Ngfr<sup>p75</sup>), we expected and found OEC samples heavily enriched in Ngfr<sup>p75</sup> in both immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>) and scRNA-seq (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). Next, we detected the high expression of two common glial markers, Blbp (<italic>Fabp7;</italic> <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>) and S100Î² (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>), in OECs. Sox10 is expressed in the nuclei of neural crest-derived cells such as OECs and Schwann cells, and our cultures showed high expression levels in scRNA-seq and immunocytochemistry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3k</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3m</xref>). Three cell adhesion molecules, L1-Cam (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Runyan &amp; Phelps, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Witheford et al., 2013</xref>), N-Cam (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3i</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3j</xref>), and N-Cadherins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3k</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3l</xref>), are also expressed in purified OEC cultures. In addition, other previously reported OEC genes are now verified by scRNA-seq, including the pro-myelinating Ciliary neurotrophic factor (<italic>Cntf</italic>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3n</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Asan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Roet et al., 2011</xref>), the laminin receptor Î±7 integrin (<italic>Itga</italic> 7, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3o</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ingram et al., 2016</xref>), and the myelin related gene P0 (<italic>Mpz,</italic> <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3p</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sasaki et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, well-characterized OEC markers were detected by scRNA-seq and most are widely distributed among OEC clusters.</p>

<title>Subclustering analysis of OECs revealed refined OEC subtypes and their top marker genes</title>
<p>Next, we extracted OECs and performed a subclustering analysis with OECs alone, and found five distinct subclusters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). All subclusters except for cluster 3 expressed previously identified markers of OECs, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4b, c</xref>). Interestingly, cluster 3 showed expression of both microglia and OEC markers.

<p>The confusion about Reelin expression in OECs likely stemmed from the use of standard immunochemical methods to confirm its presence. Our attempts to detect Reelin expression in the adult olfactory nerve layer (ONL) or in cultured OECs were unsuccessful using several antibodies and multiple protocols, despite consistent localization of Reelin within mitral cells of the olfactory bulb. To understand this discrepancy, we examined Reelin expression in embryonic sections which included both the peripheral and OB-OECs. Images of E16.5 <italic>Reln<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Reln<sup>â/â</sup></italic>olfactory system show Reelin expression in peripheral OECs and in neurons of the olfactory bulb (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8g</xref>, green), but not on OB-OECs in the ONL or in <italic>Reln<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8g, g2, h</xref>). In comparison, Blbp expression is uniformly expressed in both peripheral and OB-OECs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8g1, h1</xref>, red). Enlargements of the region where axon bundles from olfactory sensory neurons join the ONL show that Blbp is present in OB-OECs throughout the ONL, but Reelin is detected only on peripheral OECs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8g, g1-2</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine if adult rat OB-OECs synthesize and secrete Reelin <italic>in vitro</italic>, we treated primary Ngfr<sup>p75</sup>-purified OECs with or without Brefeldin-A, a fungal metabolite that specifically inhibits protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Misumi et al., 1986</xref>). In Brefeldin-treated primary OEC cultures, spindle-shaped GFP-labeled OECs contain Reelin in their cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9a</xref>, arrows). Large contaminating Reln-immunonegative cells present in primary cultures serve as an intrinsic control (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9a</xref>, arrowhead). Reelin expression was also confirmed in Brefeldin-treated Ngfr<sup>p75</sup>-purified OEC cultures (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9b-c</xref>), a finding which supports our scRNA-seq results.</p>

<p>To further confirm that cultured OECs express and secrete Reelin, we performed western blotting. The G10 antibody recognizes full-length Reelin protein, which is approximately 400 kDa, and its two cleaved fragments at â¼300 and â¼180 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lambert de Rouvroit et al., 1999</xref>). Both the rat ONL and <italic>Reln</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mouse olfactory bulbs showed the characteristic large molecular weight band at 400 kDa and another at 150 kDa (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9d</xref>, lanes 1-2, Reln). As expected, these bands were absent in mutant <italic>Reln</italic><sup>â/â</sup> olfactory bulbs (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9d</xref>, lane 3). Additionally, Reelin-positive bands were present in blots of OEC whole cell lysates (WCL) and OEC conditioned media (CM; <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9d</xref>, lanes 4-8 Reln). A 4-15% gradient gel allowed for the visualization of all three Reelin isoforms (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9e</xref>). Brain extracts of <italic>Reln</italic><sup>+/+</sup> (positive control) and <italic>Reln</italic><sup>â/â</sup> (negative control) mice confirm the specificity of Reelin detection (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9e</xref>, lanes 1-2). All three Reelin isoforms at their corresponding molecular weights are present in rat ONL and OEC CM samples (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9e</xref>, lanes 3-6). These results clearly indicate that cultured OECs derived from the ONL can synthesize and secrete Reelin despite our inability to detect it in the embryonic or adult ONL.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our scRNA-seq study of immunopurified OECs identified five OEC subtypes with distinct gene expression patterns, pathways, and properties of each subtype. The well-established OEC markers, such as <italic>Ngfr <sup>p75</sup></italic>, <italic>S100Î²</italic>, <italic>Fabp7</italic> (Blbp), and <italic>Sox10</italic>, are widely distributed throughout most clusters derived from cultured OECs. We also experimentally confirmed a number of the top markers in the OEC subtypes on sections of the rat olfactory system and established that OECs secrete both Reelin and Ctgf, ECM molecules reported to be important for neural repair and axon outgrowth. Additional proregenerative OEC marker genes such as <italic>Atf3, Btc,</italic> and <italic>Pcsk1</italic> also were identified. Our findings provide an unbiased and in-depth view of the heterogeneity of OEC populations with demonstrated injury repair capacity, and the potential mechanisms that underlie their regenerative and protective properties.</p>
<p>This scRNA-seq analysis confirmed the immunopurification of the OECs compared with the mixture of OECs grown with numerous fibroblasts and microglia. Although some may debate if purified OECs are needed to maximize neural repair, this study suggests that immunopurified OECs have higher expression of anti-stress genes than unpurified controls. Several of our earlier studies, which transplanted similarly purified OECs, also showed evidence of neural regeneration following severe spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Khankan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Takeoka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Thornton et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to the purity of OECs, we found significant overlap of the marker genes between our study and those from the meta-analysis of five OEC microarray studies on cultured early-passage OECs versus other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Roet et al., 2011</xref>), supporting the reproducibility of our scRNA-seq findings. When we compared our data from cultured OB-OECs to previous scRNA-seq studies of the olfactory system tissue which included peripheral OECs (Durante et al, 2000), or a mixture of peripheral and OB-OECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tepe et al., 2018</xref>), there was little overlap. Most likely, the substantial differences were due to the dissection areas, techniques used for OEC preparation, the species studied, as well as sex and age of the subjects. It is important to note that our OB-OEC populations were repeatedly shown to induce injury repair, and their subtypes and markers support their diverse reparative functions, whereas the neural repair function of the cell populations in the other scRNA-seq studies is unclear.</p>

<title>OECs represent a hybrid glial cell that promote neural repair</title>
<p>Based on intrinsic gene expression patterns revealed by scRNA-seq data, there is substantial expression of Schwann cell, astrocyte, oligodendrocyte and microglial markers within our five clusters of OECs. We observed transcriptionally distinct clusters that highly expressed markers for proliferation (cluster 2), microglia (cluster 3), and astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (cluster 4). The microglia-like OECs reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Smithson and Kawaja (2010)</xref> resemble our transcriptome-based subtyping of OEC cluster 3 which uniquely identified this subpopulation. Our results further support the activities of OECs in modulating immune responses, based on the expression of genes involved in the endocytosis of bacteria, the regulation of microglia activation, and the expression of numerous lysosomal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Leung et al., 2008</xref>). OECs in cluster 4 are distinctive by their expression of several astrocytic markers that reportedly regulate synaptogenesis (Thrombospondin 2) and synaptic connectivity, and remove inactive synaptic connections (Complement component 1q family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Christopherson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Eroglu &amp; Barres, 2010</xref>). Our trajectory and network analyses indicate potential relationships between the OEC subclusters, which warrant further experimental testing.</p>
<p>Both OECs and Schwann cells originate from the neural crest, express similar immunological markers, and share many transcriptional similarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Forni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Vincent et al., 2005</xref>). OECs share phenotypic characteristics with myelin-producing Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes, but they more closely resemble Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Doucette, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Radtke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ramon-Cueto &amp; Valverde, 1995</xref>). Gliomedin is a required ECM protein that initiates the assembly of nodes of Ranvier along Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Eshed et al., 2005</xref>), yet despite the fact that OECs do not have nodes of Ranvier, they express high levels of Gliomedin. This novel Gliomedin expression in OECs suggests a possible function as a glial ligand for the unmyelinated axon bundles that OECs ensheath. Following peripheral nerve injury, the loss of contact between axons and myelinating Schwann cells induces a nonmyelinating phenotypic change in Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fu &amp; Gordon, 1997</xref>). These dedifferentiated nonmyelinating Schwann cells are proregenerative and upregulate the expression of Glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jessen et al., 1990</xref>), Ngfr<sup>p75</sup> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">You et al., 1997</xref>), cell adhesion molecules L1 and N-Cam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Martini &amp; Schachner, 1988</xref>), and neurotrophic factors, including Bdnf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Meyer et al., 1992</xref>) and Glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Trupp et al., 1995</xref>). Genes for these proregenerative factors are detected in OECs in the present study, as well as the transcription factor <italic>Mitf</italic>, that controls a network of genes related to plasticity and repair in Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Daboussi et al., 2023</xref>). Reelin is another developmentally expressed protein detected in immature Schwann cells following sciatic nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Panteri et al., 2006</xref>) that also is found in OECs.</p>
<p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental validation of numerous marker genes strongly support their validity. Based on our tissue localization, the two large clusters (0 and 1) were found throughout the olfactory nerve layer, whereas cluster 2 (progenitors) and cluster 3 (microglial) are scattered within the olfactory nerve layer. Future functional studies of these subclusters will benefit from both the marker genes and their localizations uncovered in this study.</p>

<title>Reelin and CTGF are distinctive markers for OECs</title>
<p>Our interest in the function of OEC-secreted Reelin stems from studies using OEC transplants as a therapy following spinal cord injury. OEC transplantation into the spinal cord may provide an exogenous source of Reelin that could phosphorylate the Dab1-containing neurons in the spinal cord, such as sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, and somatic motor neurons, and axons of Dab1-expressing projection neurons, such as the corticospinal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abadesco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Phelps et al., 2002</xref>). Further investigation of the role of OEC-secreted Reelin should increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which OECs mediate repair following spinal cord injury.</p>
<p>Mammals show little evidence of spontaneous axonal regeneration across a spinal cord injury site, in contrast to lower organisms such as fish. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mokalled et al. (2016)</xref> reported that glial secretion of CtgfÎ±/Ccn2 was both necessary and sufficient to stimulate a glial bridge for substantial axon regeneration across the zebrafish transection site. Cell populations reported in the injury site that express Ctgf are ependymal cells, endothelial cells, and reactive astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Conrad et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mokalled et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schwab et al., 2001</xref>). Here we show that OECs contribute to glial bridge formation in rats. The most consistent finding among our severe SCI studies combined with OEC transplantation is the extent of remodeling of the injury site and axons growing into the inhibitory lesion site together with OECs and astrocytes. The formation of a glial bridge across the injury was critical to the spontaneous axon generation seen in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mokalled et al., 2016</xref>) and likely contributed to the axon regeneration detected in our OEC transplanted, transected rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Khankan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Takeoka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Thornton et al., 2018</xref>). As spinal cord injury transplant procedures are further enhanced and OEC survival improves, these hybrid glial cells should be re-examined due to their strong proregenerative characteristics.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>To understand how immunopurified OECs repair spinal cord injuries, we carried out an unbiased scRNA-seq analysis and found that OECs have a wide range of subtypes including a proliferative state, microglia-like cells and neural regenerative clusters. We demonstrated that these multi-functional OECs are clearly distinguishable from each other by expression of unique genes and pathways within subtypes based on the scRNAseq data and our <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue studies. In addition, these subtypes of OECs produce important ECM genes, including <italic>Reln</italic> and <italic>Ctgf</italic> and many other signaling molecules which are involved in a wide range of intercellular communication as well as axon regeneration. Our single-cell resolution investigation offers a comprehensive molecular landscape of OECs and numerous novel targets for future injury repair and functional/mechanistic studies.</p>

Primary cultures were generated from both olfactory bulbs from each rodent. The first two layers of the olfactory bulb were dissected, isolated, and then washed in Hankâs balanced salt solution (HBSS, Gibco, Rockville, MD) prior to tissue centrifugation at 365 g for 5 mins.

<title>Cell collection and culture</title>
<p>Flasks with purified OECs and leftover cells were rinsed with HBSS and dissociated with trypsin-EDTA as above. Cells were washed in D/F-FBS-P/S medium and further resuspended with siliconized pipettes. Media and cells were washed and centrifuged at 365 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and resuspended. After the final wash, cells for sequencing were resuspended in PBS+BSA in volumes of 1200 cells/ÂµL. On each of 2 different culture days, 4 flasks of cells (2 purified OECs and 2 âleftoversâ) were generated for scRNA-seq, yielding 8 samples in total (4 purified OECs and 4 âleftoversâ). To confirm our scRNA-seq results directly with immunocytochemistry, we plated extra cells from the second preparation on PLL-coated coverslips in 24-well plates with 500ÂµL D/F-FBS-P/S medium. Medium was changed at 2 days, cultures were fixed at 3 days in cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 mins, washed 3X with PB and stored in PB with 0.06% sodium azide.</p>
<p>scRNA-seq was performed using the 10X Genomics Chromium scRNA-seq system which incorporates microfluidic capture-based encapsulation, barcoding, and library preparation (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA). About 10,000 cells per OEC or leftover preparation were loaded into a Chromium Chip B along with partitioning oil, reverse transcription reagents, and a mix of hydrogel beads containing 3,500,000 unique 10X barcodes. Paired-end sequencing was performed on a Novaseq S4 system, using the v3 Illumina platform, at 20-50K reads/cell. The paired-end reads were processed using the Cell Ranger pipeline and <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> (Rnor_6.0) from Ensembl as the reference genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yates et al., 2020</xref>) to produce a gene expression matrix. Among the 8 samples, one OEC sample showed a low fraction of reads and RNA content in cells, which may indicate high level of ambient RNA (Supple. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). This sample was removed from further analysis, leaving 3 OEC samples and 4 leftover samples for downstream analysis.</p>

<title>scRNA-seq data quality control, normalization, and integration</title>
<p>Gene expression matrix from each of the 7 remaining samples that passed quality control was loaded into the Seurat R package ver 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). Cells were called based on the number of genes (200-5000), unique molecular identifiers (UMIs; 5000-20000), and percent of mitochondrial genes (&lt;20%; Suppl. Figure 3b). After quality control, log normalization was performed within each sample using <italic>NormalizeData</italic> function with default parameters. Top 2,000 variable genes were selected using <italic>FindVariableFeatures</italic>. The seven samples were integrated together with <italic>FindIntegrationAnchors</italic> and <italic>IntegrateData</italic> functions which incorporate canonical correlation analysis to align cells with similar transcriptomic patterns across samples.</p>

<sec id="s4d3">
<title>Cell clustering and cell type identification</title>
<p>The integrated Seurat object was used for principal component analysis (PCA). The top 15 PCs were used to construct the k-nearest neighbor graph, followed by Louvain algorithm to cluster cells based on similar gene expression patterns. Cell clusters were visualized using tSNE plots.</p>
<p>To assign cell type identities to each cluster, marker genes of each cluster were found using <italic>FindAllMarkers</italic> with average log fold change &gt; 0.5 and minimum percent difference &gt; 0.25. Cell cluster marker genes were subsequently compared to known OEC cell type markers curated from previous studies that used different species, sex, age, dissection areas, and cell preparation methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Durante et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tepe et al., 2018</xref>). Cell clusters whose marker genes match known cell type markers were labeled with the corresponding cell type identity. Gene expression heatmaps of top markers were generated to visualize the distinct expression patterns of the marker genes for different cell clusters.</p>

<title>OEC subtype identification</title>
<p>A subset of cells expressing well-known OEC markers (e.g., <italic>Ngfr<sup>p75</sup></italic>, <italic>S100Î²</italic>, and <italic>Sox10</italic>) was labeled as OECs and then selected for further subclustering analysis to identify potential OEC subtypes. To do this, OECs from the original Seurat object were extracted using the <italic>subset</italic> function and the top 10 PCs of each OEC subset were used for clustering analysis and tSNE visualization. Marker genes for each OEC subcluster were identified using the <italic>FindAllMarkerGene</italic> function. Pseudotime trajectory analysis across the OEC subtypes was performed using Slingshot version 1.8.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Street et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s4d5">
<title>Pathway enrichment analysis</title>
<p>To annotate the biological functions of the marker genes of individual cell clusters or OEC subclusters, we carried out pathway enrichment analysis using EnrichR ver 3.0, where KEGG, Reactome, and GO Biological Process were used as reference pathway databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Top pathways were ranked by multiple-testing adjusted P-values.</p>

<title>Potential cell-cell ligand-receptor interactions across OEC subtypes</title>
<p>In order to characterize potential interactions mediated by secreted ligand-receptor pairs between subtypes of OECs, we implemented NicheNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Browaeys et al., 2020</xref>), which curates ligand-receptor interactions from various publicly available resources. The NicheNet ligand-receptor model was integrated with markers from each OEC subtype to find potentially activated ligand-receptor pairs. Differentially expressed ligands identified by markers from source OEC subtypes and activated receptors identified by NicheNet in target OEC subtypes were used to assess ligand-receptor interaction. Ligand-receptor interaction networks between cell types were visualized using Cytoscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Confirmation of OEC gene expression <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Immunocytochemistry experiments to confirm gene expression revealed by scRNA-seq were conducted on extra cultured OECs and âleftoverâ controls which were replated and cultured for 3 additional days. OECs samples were treated with the following primary antibodies against OEC marker genes identified from scRNA-seq with experimental parameters recorded in Suppl. Table 1; 1) polyclonal and monoclonal anti-Blbp, 2) anti-N-Cadherins, 3) anti-green fluorescent protein, 4) a proliferative marker anti-Ki67, 5) anti-L1, 6) anti-NCAM, 7) monoclonal anti-Ngfr<sup>p75</sup>, 8) anti-S100Î², and 9) anti-SOX10. Prior to adding the primary antibodies, the cells were incubated in 0.3% Triton-X 100 detergent in PBS. Cells were blocked in 5% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, # 017-000-121) with 0.3% Triton-X before adding the primary antibodies and left to incubate at RT overnight on the rotator. Following multiple washes, species-appropriate secondary antibodies with fluorescence for 488, 555, and 647 were used to visualize the immunoreaction (1:200 â 1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs donkey-anti-chicken-488, # 703-545-155; donkey-anti-rabbit-647, # 711-605-152; donkey-anti-mouse-647, # 715-605-150; Life Technologies, donkey-anti-mouse-555, # A31570; donkey-anti-rabbit-555, # A31572). Cultures were counterstained with Hoechst (Bis-benzimide, 1:500, Sigma-Aldrich, # B2261) and coverslipped with EverBrite medium (Biotium, # 23001).</p>
<p>Experiments were carried out to confirm gene expression of OEC subtype markers in the 8-10-week-old olfactory system of rats. Soft tissues and the jaw were removed from fixed heads that were decalcified in undiluted formic acid bone decalcifier (Immunocal, Decal Chemical Corps, Tallman, NY) for 12 hrs., washed, and then infiltrated with increasing concentrations of 5% to 20% sucrose for 24 hr. Heads in 20% sucrose were heated in a 37Â°C oven and then placed in a gelatin sucrose mixture for 4 hrs, embedded in warm gelatin sucrose in a plastic mold, allowed to gel, frozen on dry ice and stored at â70Â°C. Heads were sectioned coronally at 40 Âµm thick, and mounted in series on 16 glass slides. Several antibodies from each of the 4 OEC clusters were chosen to determine their distribution in olfactory bulb sections. Primary antibodies used are listed in Suppl. Table 1, together with the experimental parameters used. For most antibodies, the olfactory bulb sections first underwent a heat-induced antigen retrieval step with 10mM citric acid at pH 6 for 5 min and then were transferred to 1.5% NDS and 0.1% Triton-X-100 in TBS-BSA (0.1M Tris; 1.4% NaCl; 0.1% BSA) for 1 h followed by overnight incubation in primary antibody at RT. Following multiple washes, species-appropriate secondary antibodies with fluorescence for 488 and 555 were used to visualize the immunofluorescence (IF).</p>
<p>For experiments carried out using a Tyramide Signal Amplification (TSA) kit, sections were first incubated in 1% hydrogen peroxide and 0.1% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline PBS for 30 mins followed by 10% NDS and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hr. Next, the sections were incubated with Avidin-Biotin solution (Vector laboratories; kit #SP-2001) before an overnight incubation with the primary antibody at RT. The following day, sections were washed in PBS followed by TNT buffer (0.1M Tris-HCl; 0.15M NaCl; 0.05% Tween) followed by 1 hr incubation with biotinylated horse anti-goat IgG (1:1000; Vector laboratories; #BA-9500), biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000; Jackson Immunoresearch; #711-065-152), or biotinylated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:1000; Jackson Immunoresearch; #715-065-150) in TSA-specific blocking buffer (TNB; 0.1M Tris-HCl; 0.15M NaCl; 0.5% Blocking reagent; PerkinElmer; #FP1020). Sections were then washed with TNT followed by a 1 h incubation with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (1:1000; PerkinElmer; #NEL750001EA) in TNB, and a 10-min incubation with TSA Plus Fluorescein (1:150; PerkinElmer; #NEL741001KT) or TSA Plus Cyanine 3 (Cy3; 1:100; PerkinElmer; #NEL744001KT). Sections were imaged on an Olympus AX70 microscope with a Zeiss AxioCam HRcRv.2 camera. Images were transferred to Adobe Photoshop for assembly, cropping, and adjustment of brightness/contrast to create the compiled figures.</p>

<title>Ki67 analysis</title>
<p>To determine if OEC progenitor cells marked with Ki67 immunoreactivity have a distinctive morphology, purified and fixed OEC cultures from 4 rats were processed with anti-Ngfr<sup>p75</sup>, anti-Ki67 and counterstained with Hoechst (Bis-benzimide, 1:500, Sigma-Aldrich, #B2261). Images were acquired from 7-10 randomly selected fields/sample using an Olympus AX70 microscope and Zen image processing and analysis software (Carl Zeiss). We distinguished the larger, flat âastrocyte-likeâ OECs from the smaller, fusiform âSchwann cell-likeâ OECs, and recorded their expression of Ngfr<sup>p75</sup> and Ki67. Cell counts from each field were averaged per rat and then averaged into a group mean Â± SEM. A Student t-test was conducted to compare the effect of Ngfr<sup>p75</sup>-labeled cell morphology and the proliferative marker Ki67.

<p>Summary</p>
<p>This manuscript explores the transcriptomic identities of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), glial cells that support life-long axonal growth in olfactory neurons, as they relate to spinal cord injury repair. The authors show that transplantation of cultured, immunopurified rodent OECs at a spinal cord injury site can promote injury-bridging axonal regrowth. They then characterize these OECs using single-cell RNA sequencing, identifying five subtypes and proposing functional roles that include regeneration, wound healing, and cell-cell communication. They identify one progenitor OEC subpopulation and also report several other functionally relevant findings, notably, that OEC marker genes contain mixtures of other glial cell type markers (such as for Schwann cells and astrocytes), and that these cultured OECs produce and secrete Reelin, a regrowth-promoting protein that has been disputed as a gene product of OECs.</p>
<p>This manuscript offers an extensive, cell-level characterization of OECs, supporting their potential therapeutic value for spinal cord injury and suggesting potential underlying repair mechanisms. The authors use various approaches to validate their findings, providing interesting images that show the overlap between sprouting axons and transplanted OECs, and showing that OEC marker genes identified using single-cell RNA sequencing are present in vivo, in both olfactory bulb tissue and spinal cord after OEC transplantation.</p>
<p>Despite the breadth of information presented, however, further quantification of results and explanation of experimental approaches would be needed to support some of the authors' claims. Additionally, a more thorough discussion is needed to contextualize their findings relative to previous work.</p>
<p>(1) Important quantification is lacking for the data presented. For example, multiple figures include immunohistochemistry or immunocytochemistry data (Figures 1, 5, 6), but they are presented without accompanying measures like fractions of cells labeled or comparisons against controls. As a result, for axons projecting via OEC bridges in Figure 1, it is unclear how common these bridges are in the presence or absence of OECs. For Figure 6., it is unclear whether cells having an alternative OEC morphology coincide with progenitor OEC subtype marker genes to a statistically significant degree. Similar quantification is missing in other types of data such as Western blot images (Fig. 9) and OEC marker gene data (for which p-values are not reported; Table S2).</p>
<p>The addition of quantitative measures and, where appropriate, statistical comparisons with p-values or other significance measures, would be important for supporting the authors' claims and more rigorously conveying the results.</p>
<p>(2) Some aspects of the experimental design that are relevant to the interpretation of the results are not explained. For example, OECs appear to be collected from only female rats, but the potential implications of this factor are not discussed.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is unclear from the manuscript to what degree immunopurified cells are OECs as opposed to other cell types. The antibody used to retain OECs, nerve growth factor receptor p75 (Ngfr-p75), can also be expressed by non-OEC olfactory bulb cell types including astrocytes [1-3]. The possible inclusion of Ngfr-p75-positive but non-OEC cell types in the OEC culture is not sufficiently addressed. Such non-OEC cell types are also not distinguished in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data (only microglia, fibroblasts, and OECs are identified; Figure 2). Thus, it is currently unclear whether results related to the OEC subtype may have been impacted by these experimental factors.</p>
<p>(3) The introduction, while well written, does not discuss studies showing no significant effect of OEC implantation after spinal cord injury. The discussion also fails to sufficiently acknowledge this variability in the efficacy of OEC implantation. This omission amplifies bias in the text, suggesting that OECs have significant effects that are not fully reflected in the literature. The introduction would need to be expanded to properly address the nuance suggested by the literature regarding the benefits of OECs after spinal cord injury. Additionally, in the discussion, relating the current study to previous work would help clarify how varying observations may relate to experimental or biological factors.</p>
