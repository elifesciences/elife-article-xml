<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>The association between late replication timing and low transcription rates in eukaryotic heterochromatin is well-known, yet the specific mechanisms underlying this link remain uncertain. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the histone deacetylase Sir2 is required for both transcriptional silencing and late replication at the repetitive ribosomal DNA arrays (rDNA). We have previously reported that in the absence of <italic>SIR2</italic>, a derepressed RNA PolII repositions MCM replicative helicases from their loading site at the ribosomal origin, where they abut well-positioned, high-occupancy nucleosomes, to an adjacent region with lower nucleosome occupancy. By developing a method that can distinguish activation of closely spaced MCM complexes, here we show that the displaced MCMs at rDNA origins have increased firing propensity compared to the nondisplaced MCMs. Furthermore, we found that both, activation of the repositioned MCMs and low occupancy of the adjacent nucleosomes critically depend on the chromatin remodeling activity of <italic>FUN30</italic>. Our study elucidates the mechanism by which Sir2 delays replication timing, and it demonstrates, for the first time, that activation of a specific replication origin <italic>in vivo</italic> relies on the nucleosome context shaped by a single chromatin remodeler.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>SIR2</italic> is the founding member of a family of NAD-dependent protein deacylases called sirtuins, which have important effects on transcription, replication, chromatin structure and metabolism in organisms from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Houtkooper et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Shahgaldi and Kahmini 2021</xref>). <italic>SIR2</italic> was initially identified in budding yeast in 1979 on the basis of its role in transcriptional repression at the silent mating type loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Haber and George 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Klar et al. 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rine et al. 1979</xref>), and it was therefore dubbed a &quot;<underline>S</underline>ilent <underline>I</underline>nformation <underline>R</underline>egulator&quot;. The silent mating type loci are heterochromatic regions that contain non-transcribed copies of the small open reading frames that determine yeast mating type, and deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> not only activates their transcription but also abolishes their heterochromatic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ivy et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rine and Herskowitz 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Weiss and Simpson 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ravindra et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Haber 2012</xref>). It was later discovered that, in addition to regulating transcription at the silent mating type loci, Sir2 also regulates DNA replication, and it does so not only at the silent mating type loci but also at the two other heterochromatic regions of the yeast genome, namely at telomeres and the rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pasero et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yoshida et al. 2014</xref>). It is this last activity of Sir2, namely its effect on replication at the rDNA, that is the focus of this report.</p>
<p>The rDNA, which encodes the structural RNA components of the ribosome, is composed of approximately 150 tandemly arranged 9.1 kb repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Woolford and Baserga 2013</xref>). At almost 1.4 megabases, the rDNA is too large to be replicated passively, and thus it must contain its own origins of replication. This is achieved by the organization shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>: The ribosomal RNAs are produced as two major species, known as the 35S and 5S, which are transcribed by RNA polI and RNA polIII, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fernandez-Pevida et al. 2015</xref>). Between the 5’ ends of these genes is an origin of replication, and immediately to the left of this origin is a short Sir2-repressed RNA PolII-transcribed non-coding transcript called C-pro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kobayashi and Ganley 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Li et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Vasiljeva et al. 2008</xref>), which we will discuss further below. In wild-type cells, rDNA origins fire in the second half of S phase, making the rDNA among the later replicating regions of the genome, while in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants, they fire early in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pasero et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yoshida et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Foss et al. 2017</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>rDNA structure, Chromatin Endogenous Cleavage (ChEC), and MCM displacement in <italic>sir2</italic>.</title><p><bold>A</bold>. The 1.4 megabase rDNA region on chromosome XII is composed of approximately one hundred and fifty 9.1 kb repeats. Each repeat encodes both the 35S and 5S ribosomal RNAs (rRNA), which are transcribed by RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) and RNA Polymerase III (Pol III), respectively. The ribosomal origin of replication (rARS) is located between the 5’ ends of these genes. The C-pro transcript, which is suppressed by Sir2, initiates approximately two hundred base pairs from the rARS. The unidirectional replication fork block, which functions to prevent collision between replication and transcription machinery, is depicted in green. The probe used in Southern blots in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> to assess licensing is marked by *. <bold>B.</bold> In ChEC-seq, micrococcal nuclease (MNase; depicted as scissors) is fused to the protein of interest, in this case MCM2. The double-hexameric MCM helicase complex, MCM2-7, is depicted in purple, and nucleosomes are in blue. Cleavage is induced by addition of calcium to permeabilized cells. Due to the proximity of nucleosome entrance and exit sites, MCM2-ChEC can reveal not only the binding site of the MCM complex but also that of the adjacent nucleosome. <bold>C.</bold> Depiction of nucleosomes and MCM complex in wild type and <italic>sir2</italic> in G1 and G2.

The three different MCM helicase complexes depicted in the bottom right panel are intended to convey the three most prominent locations for the complex in <italic>sir2</italic>; this is not intended to indicate that there is ever more than one MCM complex in the same rDNA repeat.

<p>An indication of the biological significance of maintaining the late replication status of the rDNA came from a genome wide association study aimed at identifying naturally occurring genetic variants that affect replicative lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kwan et al. 2013</xref>). Replicative lifespan in budding yeast is defined as the number of daughter cells that a mother cell is able to produce and is therefore a measure of a cell’s replicative capacity at birth. By measuring lifespan in segregants from a cross between two genetically diverse strains of yeast, Kwan et al. were able to identify a point mutation at the rARS that (1) decreased origin activity at the rDNA; (2) increased origin activity elsewhere in the genome; and (3) prolonged replicative lifespan. They interpreted these results as reflecting competition for replication resources between the origins in two distinct compartments of the nucleus, namely the heterochromatic repetitive nucleolus or rDNA and the non-repetitive sequences that make up the bulk of the yeast genome. This competition is exacerbated by the perturbation of nucleolar heterochromatin caused by the absence of <italic>SIR2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yoshida et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Foss et al. 2017</xref>). Most replication outside of the rDNA initiates from approximately 300 replication origins, and thus the 150 origins at the rDNA make up approximately one third of total origins. Increased replication resources directed toward the rDNA might therefore be expected to create a significant strain on replication in the rest of the genome.</p>
<p>Replication origins are known to compete for limiting resources at the level of origin firing. Broadly speaking, replication origin activity is regulated at two levels, namely origin licensing and origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Remus and Diffley 2009</xref>). Origin licensing refers to loading of the replicative helicase in G1, and only origins that have been licensed are capable of being used in the subsequent S phase. Licensing occurs when an Origin Recognition Complex, Orc1-6, that is bound to an 11-17 base pair so-called ARS consensus sequence (ACS) within the origin loads two hexameric helicases, each consisting of a ring of subunits, MCM2-7, that encircles the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bell and Stillman 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Francis et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bell and Botchan 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Deegan and Diffley 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Deegan et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Douglas et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lewis et al. 2022</xref>). The mechanism by which Orc recognizes origins and loads an MCM double-hexamer has been elucidated in great detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bell and Labib 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Costa and Diffley 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hu and Stillman 2023</xref>). DNA replication initiates from only a subset of these licensed origins, namely those where the helicase complex is activated, a process referred to as origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rhind and Gilbert 2013</xref>). Origin firing is triggered by activation of two kinase signaling pathways, DDK and CDK, which then cause each hexameric MCM helicase to encircle a single strand of DNA and track in opposite directions in front of the replisome, thereby establishing bidirectional replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Heller et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Larasati and Duncker 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Li et al. 2023</xref>). Firing factors are not present in sufficient quantities to activate all licensed origins simultaneously, and thus origins are activated in waves, with firing factors being recycled until the entire genome has been replicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mantiero et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tanaka et al. 2011</xref>). Determining the criteria by which origins are prioritized for activation remains an area of active research.</p>
<p>Importantly, if the competition between the origins at the rDNA and those in the rest of the genome is tilted in favor of the rDNA, either by a point mutation in the rARS or by deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic>, replication gaps between distantly spaced origins outside of the rDNA persist late into S phase, and genome duplication may remain incomplete when the cell enters mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Foss et al. 2017</xref>). Indeed, the observation that weakening the rARS by a point mutation can suppress the short replicative lifespan characteristic of <italic>sir2</italic> mutants suggests that these replication gaps may be the ultimate cause of &quot;replicative death&quot;. Teleologically, one can rationalize the prioritization of replication of the unique areas of the genome over the repetitive and heterochromatic areas, because (1) there are mechanisms available for repair in repetitive regions, like single-strand annealing, that are not available in unique regions, and they may therefore be able to survive lesions created when mitosis precedes the completion of replication; and (2) the cell is able to tolerate variation in copy number at the rDNA, but not deletion of protein-coding sequences in unique regions. Consistent with this view of the utility of assigning a low priority to replication of repetitive sequence, heterochromatic regions are also late-replicating in mammalian cells, and disease states have been associated with disruption of this pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Donley and Thayer 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite its biological importance, the mechanism by which Sir2 suppresses replication initiation is poorly understood. Clues to Sir2’s role in replication may be gleaned from its role in transcription, although here, too, our understanding is limited. Sir2’s ability to repress transcription at the silent mating type loci has been postulated to follow from its role in chromatin compaction. Experiments demonstrating <italic>SIR2</italic>-dependent protection of heterochromatin from digestion with endonucleases or methylation by bacterial DNA methyltransferases support the notion that DNA in heterochromatin is generally less accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gottschling 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Singh and Klar 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Loo and Rine 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ansari and Gartenberg 1999</xref>). Thus, a widely publicized model attributes Sir2’s ability to inhibit transcription to blocking access of RNA PolII to the DNA, although a simple model of indiscriminate steric occlusion cannot account for this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen and Widom 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lynch and Rusche 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kitada et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bondra and Rine 2023</xref>). Whether Sir2’s effect on replication is similarly the result of chromatin compaction limiting access to enzymes involved in DNA metabolism is not known.</p>
<p>A study examining the distribution of MCM helicase complexes at the rDNA suggests that, rather than a global manifestation of lack of accessibility of the rDNA, the early activation of replication at the rDNA in the absence of Sir2 may reflect a more localized phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Foss et al. 2019</xref>). In this study, MCM binding was assessed at nucleotide-level resolution by fusing a subunit of MCM to micrococcal nuclease (MNase), a technique known as Chromatin Endogenous Cleavage, or &quot;ChEC&quot; (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Schmid et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zentner et al. 2015</xref>). Permeabilization of cells with detergent followed by addition of calcium activates MNase, thereby generating approximately 65 base-pair fragments of DNA under MCM double-hexamers that can be identified by high-throughput sequencing. This analysis revealed that, while deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> did not elicit an obvious change in the overall levels of licensing at the rDNA, it led to a dramatic redistribution of MCM helicase complexes: In wild-type cells, the helicase complexes are located almost exclusively immediately adjacent to a high occupancy well-positioned nucleosome approximately 130 base pairs to the left of the ACS. In contrast, the MCM complexes in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants are largely displaced to the right into an area with lower nucleosome occupancy (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>). This displacement appears to be caused by the de-repression of C-pro transcription in the absence of <italic>SIR2</italic>, which results in RNA PolII pushing the MCM double-hexamer into the relatively nucleosome-free region. This observation is provocative in light of studies demonstrating that the arrangement of MCM-proximal nucleosomes can have a dramatic effect on MCM activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Azmi et al. 2017</xref>). Specifically, by using chromatin remodeling enzymes (CREs) to create a variety of nucleosomal arrangements on an origin-containing fragment of DNA, Azmi et al. demonstrated that activation of an MCM double-hexamer loaded at that origin could be inhibited by nucleosomes arranged by specific CREs. In another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chacin et al. 2023</xref>), a mutant version of Orc1 that retains the ability to load MCM but alters phasing of MCM adjacent nucleosomes was shown to inhibit DNA replication <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, consistent with a critical role for nucleosome organization at origins in the initiation of replication.</p>
<p>Taken together, the observations above led us to hypothesize that (1) relocation of MCM helicases from regions of high nucleosome occupancy to nearby regions of low nucleosome occupancy promotes early activation of replication origins in <italic>sir2</italic>; (2) this local difference in nucleosome occupancy is the result of modulation of nucleosomal architecture by one or more CREs; and therefore (3) screening CREs for the ability to suppress the early rDNA replication phenotype in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants might allow us to identify the relevant CRE. In this report, we show that the displaced MCM complexes fire before their nondisplaced counterpart and that increased nucleosome occupancy near the displaced MCMs in the absence of Fun30 CRE suppresses their early activation. This is the first <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstration of the modulation of an origin activity by a specific chromatin remodeler <italic>in vivo</italic>, and has implications for the broader relationship between transcription and replication timing.</p>

In this widely used technique, G1 and S phase populations of cells from a log phase culture are sorted using flow cytometry and their DNA subjected to genomic sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Muller et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Batrakou et al. 2020</xref>). Replication timing can then be inferred from read depths in the S phase fraction, because regions that replicate early in S phase will be present in two copies in most cells, while regions that replicate late will be present mostly as a single copy. S phase read depths are normalized to those in G1 to account for differences in DNA copy numbers, which is particularly important for repetitive loci whose copy number can vary, such as rDNA. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, which depicts the S-seq profile of chromosome 12, relative replication timing (Trel) values using this approach typically range from 1.4 to 0.8 for early- and late-replicating regions, respectively, with a value of 1 indicating that a locus replicates at the same time as the genome-wide average (see Materials and Methods for specific calculation). The late replication of the rDNA, defined as coordinates 450,000 - 470,000 on chrXII, in wild type is reflected in a Trel value of 0.89, whereas this ratio increases to 1.2 upon deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Using this method, we showed that a point mutation in the ACS of the rARS suppresses early replication of the rDNA in <italic>sir2</italic>, while promoting replication in the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kwan et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Foss et al. 2017</xref>). To identify potential chromatin remodelers required for early rDNA replication in <italic>sir2</italic>, we measured rDNA replication timing in double-mutants in <italic>sir2</italic> and each of 10 non-essential CRE subunits (Chd1, Fun30, Htl1, Irc5, Isw1, Isw2, Nhp10, Swp82). Deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic>, but no other gene, delayed replication of the rDNA in a <italic>sir2</italic> background, shifting the Trel value from 1.2 to 1.06, while having had no significant effect in <italic>SIR2</italic> cells (0.89 for WT and 0.91 for <italic>fun30</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>Because Fun30 can form a complex with the replication scaffold protein Dpb11, it was possible that Fun30 played a structural rather than an enzymatic role in regulating rDNA replication. However, we found that a point mutation that abolishes Fun30 ATPase activity, K603R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Neves-Costa et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Eapen et al. 2012</xref>), also suppresses early rDNA replication (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), arguing that Fun30 instead promotes rDNA replication through its enzymatic activity in nucleosome remodeling. Fun30 is also known to play a role in the DNA damage response; specifically, phosphorylation of Fun30 on S20 and S28 by CDK1 targets Fun30 to sites of DNA breaks, where it promotes DNA resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bantele et al. 2017</xref>). To determine whether the replication phenotype that we observed might be a consequence of Fun30’s role in the DNA damage response, we tested non-phosphorylatable mutants for the ability to suppress early replication of the rDNA in <italic>sir2</italic>; these mutations had no effect on the replication phenotype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), arguing against a primary role for Fun30 in DNA damage repair that somehow manifests itself in replication.</p>

<title><italic>Fun30</italic> chromatin remodeling activity is required for maintaining rDNA array size in <italic>sir2</italic> mutant</title>
<p>We next wanted to determine whether <italic>FUN30</italic> affects rDNA array size. The repetitive nature of the rDNA allows it to fluctuate in size, and mutations that impair DNA replication, either globally or in a manner specific to the rDNA, are associated with shrinkage of the rDNA. For example, the rDNA in a wild-type strain in the S288c background consists of 150 copies, but a point mutation at the ARS consensus sequence (ACS) that impairs Orc binding causes the rDNA to shrink to just 80 copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kwan et al. 2013</xref>). rDNA shrinkage in response to global replication defects is thought to reflect the fact that the rDNA, which typically comprises approximately 10% of genomic DNA, imposes a significant replicative burden on the cell that can be ameliorated by decreasing the number of repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Salim et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>We determined rDNA size by assessing the fraction of DNA sequencing reads from a sonicated G1 population that arose from the rDNA. While deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> had no notable effect on rDNA size in a <italic>SIR2</italic> strain, it caused a 50% reduction in a <italic>sir2</italic> mutant, from 9.2% to 4.2% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). rDNA size reduction of a similar magnitude was observed in the ATPase-deficient Fun30K603R mutant, but not in the non-phosphorylatable Fun30S20AS28A mutant, mirroring the disparate effect of the two alleles on rDNA replication timing. The reduction of the rDNA size in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> mutants was confirmed by qPCR analysis of DNA isolated from log cultures, and by Southern blots (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Based on measurements in log-growing cells, we estimated the rDNA size in <italic>fun30 sir2</italic> mutants to be ∼40 repeats (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>). This places it in a category comparable to the shortest rDNA arrays in a collection of DNA replication mutants noted for their contraction of the rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Salim et al. 2017</xref>), thus emphasizing the severity of the replicative disadvantage conferred by the deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> when Sir2 function is absent.</p>

<p>Alterations of rDNA size are promoted by the replication fork barrier (RFB), which imposes a unidirectional replication fork arrest to prevent head-to-head collisions between DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase I while transcribing 35S units. Replication forks that are stalled at the RFB are prone to breakage, which can lead to unequal sister chromatid exchange and fluctuations in rDNA array size. These rDNA size fluctuations are exacerbated in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants, which exhibit an increased rate of recombination, resulting in an unstable rDNA array size. Deletion of <italic>FOB1</italic>, which abolishes RFB function, stabilizes rDNA size by reducing,though not eliminating,the frequency of recombination-initiating double-strand breaks.</p>
<p>We have interpreted the shrinkage of the rDNA caused by deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>FUN30</italic> to be a specific example of the general phenomenon demonstrated by Salim et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Salim et al. 2017</xref>), i.e. that mutations that impair replication generate selective pressure that favors rDNA shrinkage. According to this interpretation, while deletion of <italic>FOB1</italic> is expected to retard the transition to reduced array sizes, it should not prevent it, and thus rDNA shrinkage should not be <italic>FOB1</italic>-dependent.</p>
<p>To determine whether the reduction of rDNA size in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> mutants was dependent on RFB activity and <italic>FOB1</italic>, we deleted <italic>FUN30</italic> in a <italic>sir2 fob1</italic> strain with 160 repeats. Using this strategy, we obtained <italic>fob1 sir2 fun30</italic> transformants with over 150 rDNA repeats.. If rDNA shrinkage does not require Fob1, it should occur, albeit slowly, in <italic>fob1</italic> mutants. To assess this, we continuously grew several independent <italic>fob1 sir2 fun30</italic> colonies, along with control <italic>fob1 sir2</italic>, and <italic>fob1 fun30</italic> strains for 120 generations. We found that, unlike the control <italic>fob1</italic> strains, which maintained a stable rDNA size, all four <italic>fob1 sir2 fun30</italic> cultures reduced their rDNA arrays size to fewer than 100 copies by 120 division (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>). These results demonstrate that, although <italic>FOB1</italic> affects the kinetics of rDNA size reduction in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> strains, the reduced rDNA array size upon <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion size does not depend on <italic>FOB1</italic>. Thus, suppressed rDNA replicaton drives the selection for reduced rDNA array size in both RFB-proficient and RFB-deficient <italic>fun30 sir2</italic> cells. Consistent with this notion, our S-seq results showed delayed rDNA replication timing in <italic>fob1 sir2 fun30</italic> cells with 150 rDNA repeats, compared to their <italic>fob1 sir2</italic> counterparts (<xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 3</xref>). In summary, we conclude that Fun30 nucleosome remodeling activity promotes rDNA replication and is required for maintaining rDNA size in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants. We next aimed to determine whether Fun30 exerts this effect by reducing MCM loading or the ability of loaded MCMs to fire.</p>

<title>High level of origin licensing at rDNA origins in WT, <italic>sir2</italic> and <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> mutants</title>
<p>It has been estimated that ∼20% of potential rDNA origins are activated during any single S-phase in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brewer and Fangman 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Linskens and Huberman 1988</xref>). Furthermore, single-molecule studies suggested that the fraction of active origins is increased in <italic>sir2</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pasero et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yoshida et al. 2014</xref>). To determine whether <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>FUN30</italic> modulate rDNA replication by changing origin licensing, i.e. the fraction of origins that are bound by MCM helicase complexes prior to the beginning of S phase, we assessed licensing in WT, <italic>sir2</italic>, <italic>fun30</italic>, and <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> cells by measuring DNA cleavage by MCM2-MNase using Southern blots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Foss et al. 2021</xref>): Digestion with XmnI yields a 3.5 kb fragment that spans the rARS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), and, if the rARS is licensed, activation of MNase by addition of calcium will eliminate this fragment, thus making it undetectable when using a probe upstream of the rARS. As a control, we used a fragment that, based on our MCM-ChEC data, should not contain MCM complexes. Activation of MNase in all 4 genotypes led to an ∼60-85% decrease in the XmnI fragment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 figure supplement 1</xref>), therefore we conclude that (1) licensing is high, at ∼60-85%; and (2) a much higher fraction of origins are licensed than are activated, making it unlikely that significant regulation of origin activity occurs at the level of licensing. This is the first quantitative assessment of licensing at the rDNA in either wild type or <italic>sir2</italic>.</p>

<title>Fun30 promotes firing of rDNA origins and suppresses firing of non-rDNA origins in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants</title>
<p>Our observation that <italic>FUN30</italic> status had no obvious effect on rDNA origin licensing suggested that Fun30 might instead advance rDNA replication in sir2 mutants by promoting rDNA origin firing. To evaluate this possibility, we measured the effect of <italic>FUN30</italic> status on origin activity at the rDNA using 2D gels. We grew cells to log phase, arrested them for 1.5 hours in alpha factor and collected them at different time points after release into 200 mM hydroxyurea. Prior to separation on 2D gels, DNA was digested with NheI, which releases a 4.7 kb rARS-containing linear DNA fragment at the internal rDNA repeats (1N) and a much larger, 24.4 kb single-rARS-containing fragment originating from the rightmost repeat (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In 2D gels, active origins generate replication bubble arc signals, whereas passive replication of an origin appears as a y-arc (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B</xref>). Having a signal emanating from a single-rARS-containing fragment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>) simplifies the comparison of rDNA origin activity in strains with different numbers of rDNA repeats, such as in <italic>sir2</italic> vs <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> mutants. Origin activity is expressed as a ratio of the bubble to the single-ARS signal, effectively measuring the number of active rDNA origins per cell at a given time point.</p>

<p>As seen previously, deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> increased the number of activated rDNA origins, while deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> suppressed this effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). When analyzed in aggregate at 20, 30, 60 and 90 minutes following release into HU, the average number of activate rDNA origins in <italic>sir2</italic> mutant was increased 6.3-fold compared to those in WT (5.0±2.3 in <italic>sir2</italic> vs 0.8±0.4 in wt, p&lt;0.05 by two-tailed t-test), and this increased number was reduced upon <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion (1.3±0.7 in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic>, p&lt;0.05 by 2 tailed t-test vs <italic>sir2,</italic> NS for comparison to WT). Deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> in a strain with a wild-type copy of <italic>SIR2</italic> did not have asignificant effect. We conclude that deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> partially reverses the accelerated activation of ribosomal origins caused by deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic>.</p>
<p>The overall impact of <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion on rDNA origin activity in a <italic>sir2</italic> background is expected to be a composite of two opposing effects: a suppression of rDNA origin activation and increased rDNA origin activation due to reduced rDNA size. To evaluate the effect of <italic>FUN30</italic> on rDNA origin activation independently of rDNA size, we generated an isogenic set of strains in a <italic>fob1</italic> background, all of which contain ∼30 copies of the rDNA repeats. (Deletion of <italic>FOB1</italic> is necessary to stabilize rDNA copy number.) Comparing rDNA origin activity in <italic>sir2</italic> versus <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> genotypes, we observed a robust and reproducible reduction in rDNA origin activity upon <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). This finding confirms that the <italic>FUN30</italic> suppresses rDNA origin firing in <italic>sir2</italic> backgrpound independently of both rDNA size and <italic>FOB1</italic> status.</p>
<p>We and others have previously shown that deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> not only advances replication at the rDNA but also retards replication elsewhere in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kwan et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yoshida et al. 2014</xref>). The absence of <italic>SIR2</italic> has been linked to decreased activation of less robust early replication origins, likely due to their heightened sensitivity to overall levels of replication-initiating factors. To ascertain the specificity of the interaction between <italic>FUN30</italic> and <italic>SIR2</italic>, we investigated whether deleting <italic>FUN30</italic> also mitigates the delayed activation of weak early origins in a <italic>sir2</italic> mutant background. We focused on the activation of ARS305, an origin we previously identified as delayed in a <italic>sir2</italic> mutant using 2D gel analysis. Overall, the comparison of origin activity at ARS305, measured as bubble arc to 1N signal, with that at rDNA demonstrates a reciprocial relationship between activity at ARS305 and rDNA across the four genotypes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). As seen previously, deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> suppresses ARS305, whereas additional deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> increased activity close to that of wild type. Deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> in a <italic>SIR2</italic> background also showed a trend of increased origin activation, though this difference was not statistically significant.</p>
<p>Delayed initiation of genomic origins following <italic>SIR2</italic> deletion has been previously demonstrated on a global scale as a decline in the incorporation of a labeled uridine analogue, bromodeoxyuridine, at weak early origins in <italic>sir2</italic> cells compared to wild-type cells upon their release from G1 into HU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yoshida et al. 2014</xref>). We employed a similar approach to investigate whether the deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> mitigates this effect, utilizing a different labeled nucleotide, ethynyl-deoxy-uridine (EdU), which can be isolated through click chemistry rather than immunoprecipitation. Wild-type (WT), <italic>sir2</italic>, <italic>sir2 fun30</italic>, and <italic>fun30</italic> cells engineered for the uptake and phosphorylation of the analogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Viggiani and Aparicio 2006</xref>) were arrested in G1 using alpha factor and collected 60 minutes after release into medium containing HU and EdU. DNA extracted from these cells was sonicated and subjected to click chemistry with biotin azide to covalently link biotin to EdU incorporated into DNA. Biotinylated DNA was then purified and sequenced. The impact of <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>FUN30</italic> status on replication timing was assessed by graphing the EdU signal at 111 early origins in WT cells on the x-axis against the signal in <italic>sir2</italic>, <italic>fun30</italic>, and <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> cells on the y-axis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Similar to observations with BrdU, we noted reduced EdU incorporation at a subset of early origins in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants, coupled with increased EdU incorporation at rDNA origins. Deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> in a <italic>sir2</italic> background partially restored EdU incorporation at early origins, concomitant with reduced EdU incorporation at rDNA origins. In particular, the median value of log<sub>10</sub> of read depths at 111 early origins, as the data are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, dropped from 6.5 for wild type to 6.2 for <italic>sir2</italic> but then returned almost to wild type levels (6.4) in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic>. The p value obtained by Student’s t test, comparing the drop in 111 origins from wild type to <italic>sir2</italic> with that from wild type to <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> was highly significant (&lt;&lt; 10<sup>-16</sup>) In contrast, <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion in the WT background did not reduce EdU incorporation at genomic origins (median 6.6). These findings highlight that <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion-induced suppression of rDNA origins in <italic>sir2</italic> is accompanied by the activation of genomic origins.</p>

<title>Early firing of displaced helicase complexes</title>
<p>While our results above demonstrate that deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> promotes firing of rDNA origins and that additional deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> suppresses this phenotype, they lack the resolution to distinguish replication arising from the displaced versus the nondisplaced MCM complexes. Other methods for measuring origin activation, such as generation of single-stranded DNA or incorporation of nucleoside analogs, also suffer from this limitation. Distinguishing between firing of the displaced versus the nondisplaced MCM complexes is important to test our hypothesis that displacement of the helicase complex into a relatively nucleosome-free region is responsible for its early activation. We therefore sought to devise a method that can differentiate activation of MCM complexes that are only ∼150 bp apart, i.e. the approximate distance between displaced and nondisplaced MCMs. We reasoned that, because MCM-ChEC has the resolution to distinguish closely spaced helicase complexes, the differential disappearance of such closely spaced footprints might permit us to distinguish their relative activation times.</p>
<p>To explore the possibility that the disappearance of the MCM-ChEC signal could be used to distinguish the firing of the displaced versus nondisplaced populations of MCM, we first asked whether the pattern of disappearance of the MCM signal recapitulates that of origin firing. In particular, while late origins are inhibited by hydroxyurea (HU), early origins are not; therefore, we asked whether this phenomenon was reflected in MCM-ChEC. To do this, we arrested cells in G1 using alpha factor and then released them into medium containing hydroxyurea (HU), taking samples for ChEC analysis at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). HU inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and thereby dramatically slows S phase, making it easier to follow replication kinetics, but the relative order of firing of different origins remains unchanged. In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, we plot the MCM-ChEC signal at 111 early origins and 101 late origins, with G1 on the x-axis and S phase on the y-axis. While we observed little difference in the signal abundance between early and late origins just 15 minutes after release from alpha factor, before origins have had a chance to fire, this difference increases over the time course, with early origins dropping more than late. MCM signal quantification demonstrates that the differences in MCM abundance between early and late origins increase over the time course in HU (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) for FLAG-tagged MCM2 in cells arrested in alpha factor and those released into HU for 60 minutes, we observed a similar reduction of the MCM signal at early compared to later origins, confirming our MCM-ChEC results (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>). We conclude that the disappearance of the MCM-ChEC signal as cells progress through S phase can be used to assess origin firing.</p>

<p>We then turned our attention to the MCM signals at the rDNA origin; here the presence of the replication fork block approximately 1.5 kb from the sites of MCM binding provides a fortuitous means of confirming our interpretation, since the loss of the MCM-MNase signal at the origin should appear as a reciprocal increase where the replisome stalls. We first used MCM2-Flag ChIP in WT and sir2 cells after release into HU to confirm this prediction. In both WT and <italic>sir2</italic> cells, the MCM can be found at the rDNA origin in alpha factor-arrested cells as expected (<xref rid="fig5s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 - figure supplement 3</xref>). However, at 60 minutes following release into HU, unlike in WT cells where the MCM signal remains at its loading site, in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants, we can see that a large fraction of the signal has now redistributed from its loading site and accumulated left of the RFB, consistent with early activation of rDNA origins in <italic>sir2</italic> cells and the arrest of the replicaiton forks at the RFB. While these results demonstrate that ChIP can be used to monitor the repositioning of the MCM signal at a kb scale and origin activation, its resolution is inadequate for small-scale changes in MCM signal distribution, which is needed to monitor the proposed differences in activation of repositioned and non-repositioned MCM complexes. We therefore turned to ChEC to address this question.</p>
<p>The MCM-ChEC signal in wild-type cells remained at their initial loading throughout the duration of the HU experiment (blue box in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) as we have seen by ChIP in WT cells at 60 minutes. (Note that 200 mM HU causes an approximately 20-fold slowing of S phase, therfore a 60 minute time point is equivalent to &lt;5 minutes without HU, i.e. prior to the time when the rDNA origin fires in wild-type cells). Like in wild type, this nondisplaced population of MCM in <italic>sir2</italic> remains relatively constant (blue box); however, in striking contrast, the displaced population of MCM in <italic>sir2</italic> (orange box) shows a continual decrease over the course of the experiment, and there is a concomitant increase in signal in the region upstream of RFB that is absent in wild type. Furthermore, both the decrease in the displaced signal (orange box) and its corresponding increase upstream of the RFB were suppressed by deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic>. The changes in the relative abundance of displaced and nondisplaced MCMs during the time course, as well as the repositioning of the MCM signal to the region upstream of RFB across different genotypes, were highly reproducible (<xref rid="fig5s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these observations provide strong support for the hypothesis that the displaced population of MCM in <italic>sir2</italic> cells fires more readily than its nondisplaced counterpart and that the increased firing of the displaced MCMs is suppressed by <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion.</p>
<p>It is notable that, although a small fraction of the total G1 signal in wild type arises from the displaced location, this minor signal likewise disappears more rapidly than its nondisplaced counterpart (<xref rid="fig5s5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 5</xref>). This suggests that some feature of the immediate chromatin environment may be responsible for the difference in firing times at the two locations, and that this difference is present in both wild type and <italic>sir2</italic>; in other words, the fact that the displaced helicase complex is activated before the nondisplaced complex regardless of <italic>SIR2</italic> status is consistent with a model in which <italic>sir2</italic> mutants replicate their rDNA early by virtue of displacing much of their loaded helicases to a region where they are more apt to fire, rather than by altering the chromatin environment more globally to affect all replicative helicases in the nucleolus.</p>
<p>Finally, although deletion of FUN30 could suppress replication initiation at the rDNA either by inhibiting the firing of the active (displaced) MCM complex or by preventing its displacement to the &quot;activating location&quot; in the first place, our results make it clear that suppression occurs via the former mechanism rather than the latter. Indeed, deletion of FUN30 actually skews the distribution to favor the displaced location over the nondisplaced one, and this skewing can be observed in both <italic>sir2</italic> and <italic>SIR2</italic>. As we have previously shown, rightward displacement of MCMs is accomplished by the derepression of C-pro transcription and the consequent pushing by RNA polII, suggesting that deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> does not act via repression of C-pro transcription. Consistent with both this expectation and a previous report demonstrating that fun30 mutants are deficient in transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Neves-Costa et al. 2009</xref>), C-pro RNA levels were approximately twice as high in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> cells compared to those in <italic>sir2</italic> cells when adjusted for differences in rDNA size (<xref rid="fig5s6" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 6</xref>). A combination of increased MCM repositioning and reduction of MCM signal at the RFB observed in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> mutants also confirms that the accumulation at the RFB is a reflection of replication fork stalling rather than RNA PolII-mediated repositioning of the MCMs. Taken together, our findings indicate that FUN30 deletion specifically hampers the activity of repositioned MCMs when silencing mechanisms are compromised.</p>

<title>Fun30 maintains low nucleosome occupancy near repositioned MCMs</title>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that MCMs, when situated at their loading site adjacent to a high-occupancy +1 nucleosome, exhibit reduced firing propensity. In contrast, when these MCMs are displaced to a neighboring region with lower nucleosome occupancy, their firing propensity significantly increases. This heightened firing tendency is dependent on Fun30 CRE and its remodeling activity. This suggests that the absence of <italic>FUN30</italic> could elevate nucleosome occupancy around the relocated MCMs, consequently inhibiting their ability to fire.</p>
<p>To evaluate this possibility, we examined the effect of <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion on nucleosome occupancy at rDNA origins in WT and <italic>sir2</italic> background using MNase-seq in G1 arrested cells. Chromatin treatment with MNase digests DNA that is not bound by proteins, such as nucleosomes and transcription factors. Nucleosomes, which are wrapped by approximately 150 base pairs of DNA, tend to protect fragments in the 150-200 base pair range, and thus profiling fragments in this size range is widely used to assess nucleosome distribution. Plotting nucleosome midpoints at the rARS in G1 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>) reveals that nucleosome occupancy at the +2 (green box) and +3 (red box) positions is higher in the <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> double mutant than in the <italic>sir2</italic> single mutant. Furthermore, this effect of Fun30 is not limited to the <italic>sir2</italic> background, since nucleosome occupancy is also modestly increased in <italic>fun30</italic> cells compared to wild type cells. These observations support the notion that it is the relatively nucleosome-free nature of the region into which MCMs are displaced in <italic>sir2</italic> that make the displaced complexes more prone to activation. Furthermore, this suggests that it could be particularly informative to assess nucleosome occupancy specifically adjacent to loaded MCM complexes, as described below.</p>

<p>It has previously been observed, both with MCM and with various transcription factors, that the ChEC technique can reveal not only the binding site of the protein to which the MNase is fused, but also, if present, that of the adjacent nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zentner et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Foss et al. 2019</xref>). This is due to the fact that the entrance and exit sites for DNA wrapped around a nucleosome are in close physical proximity, despite the fact that they are separated by approximately 150 base pairs, and thus the MNase fusion protein adjacent to a nucleosome often cleaves both sites. MCM-ChEC, therefore, provides a powerful tool for measuring nucleosome occupancy immediately adjacent to the MCM helicase complex <italic>exclusively in those rDNA repeats where those complexes have been loaded</italic>. By plotting the midpoints of 150-200 bp fragments released by MCM2-Mnase, we were able to determine that nucleosome occupancy at both the +2 and +3 nucleosomes, i.e. those adjacent to the displaced MCM complexes, are elevated in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> as compared to <italic>sir2</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have attempted to shed light on the mechanism by which Sir2 represses replication origins at the rDNA. Sir2’s activity has been widely ascribed to the intuitive, but mechanistically imprecise, notion that &quot;closed chromatin&quot; is less accessible to both transcription and replication factors. Consistent with this model, deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> abolishes heterochromatic compaction and simultaneously increases the ability of methylases and restriction endonucleases to act on those sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gottschling 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Singh and Klar 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Loo and Rine 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Weiss and Simpson 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ansari and Gartenberg 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ravindra et al. 1999</xref>). However, at least in its simplest form, non-specific steric exclusion of DNA metabolic enzymes cannot fully account for the suppression of transcription and replication at the rDNA. Steric arguments such as these are even less compelling when made for rDNA than for the silent mating type loci and telomeres, because chromatin compaction has been studied mostly in the context of the complete Sir complex (Sir2-4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gartenberg and Smith 2016</xref>). In contrast, Sir3, and Sir4 are not present at the rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Straight et al. 1999</xref>). Moreover, rDNA is the most highly transcribed region of the genome, with transcription by PolI and PolIII accounting for approximately 80% of cellular RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Warner 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Woolford and Baserga 2013</xref>). These two polymerase complexes are similar in size to the PolII complex, thus size alone is not sufficient to selectively occlude PolII.</p>
<p>Additionally, deletion of SIR2 increases accessibility of restriction enzymes to heterochromatin at the HML locus by 1.5-fold, yet it increases PolII transcription by over 3000-fold (Holland 2002). This indicates that the magnitude of Sir2’s steric exclusion is insufficient to explain its effect on PolII transcription. Similar measurements in eukaryotic cells found little difference in accessibility of restriction enzymes and micrococcal nuclease between euchromatin and heterochromatin (Chereji et al. 2019).</p>
<p>In the current report, we argue that Sir2’s role in suppressing replication at the rDNA reflects local differences in the distribution of the MCM replicative helicase complexes rather than more global occlusion of these complexes from the rDNA. In particular, our results suggest that the key difference between wild type and <italic>sir2</italic>, with regard to replication initiation, is the location of the MCM complex, with the preponderance of that complex in wild type abutting a high-occupancy nucleosome while, in <italic>sir2</italic>, it is mostly in a relatively nucleosome-free region. Furthermore, we show that, even though this nucleosome-free region is less than 200 base pairs from MCM’s original location, the displaced helicase complex is significantly more prone to activation than its nondisplaced counterpart. Moreover, the chromatin-remodeling enzyme Fun30 is required to maintain the nucleosome-free character around the displaced MCM, and its deletion both increases nucleosome occupancy and decreases the ability of the displaced MCM to fire. Finally, as discussed below, we suggest that the increased proclivity of the displaced MCM to fire is not an anomaly specific to the physiology of <italic>sir2</italic> cells, but is an integral feature of replication of the rDNA during normal S phase.</p>
<p>Our model for the manner in which Sir2 regulates rDNA replication depends critically on the notion that the local nucleosome landscape can influence the activation of MCM helicase complexes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>), and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments suggest that this is, indeed, the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Azmi et al. 2017</xref>): Azmi et al. monitored both licensing and firing <italic>in vitro</italic>, using a 3.8 kb nucleosomal template containing the ARS1 origin. They found that, while licensing was equivalent whether the template had been populated with nucleosomes using Swi/Snf or Rsc remodelers, on the one hand, or Isw1a, on the other, the loaded MCM complexes in the latter templates were more prone to activation. Furthermore, MCM complexes on Swi/Snf- or Rsc-remodeled templates could be made more prone to activation if subsequently treated with Isw1a, although the converse was not true. The salient difference between the two types of nucleosomal landscapes, however, was not obvious, as the distance between the MCM complex and the nearest nucleosome was not notably affected, although it is possible that the composition (e.g. H2A/H2B content) differs. It was also unclear how the nucleosome landscape affected activation of MCM complexes, though the relevant step in activation was determined to be the formation of the CMG complex with Cdc45 and GINS rather than the prior phosphorylation of the complex by DDK. In summary, while it is clear that the local nucleosome landscape can affect origin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Eaton et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Belsky et al. 2015</xref>), the underlying mechanism remains murky.</p>

<p>Regardless of the reason for the increased proclivity of the displaced MCM to fire, the observation has implications for replication at the rDNA not only in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants but also in wild type. We have previously shown that the rightward displacement of MCM double hexamers in <italic>sir2</italic> is due to derepression of C-pro transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Foss et al. 2019</xref>), while our current results demonstrate that the displaced MCM is more prone to activation. Combining these two observations, we suggest that the rDNA replicates earlier in <italic>sir2</italic> than in wild type simply because more of the MCM complex is in a location that favors its activation; in other words, we favor the view that the region of relatively low nucleosome occupancy to the right of MCM’s normal location is more amenable to MCM activation, regardless of <italic>SIR2</italic> status. In support of this notion, close analysis of our MCM-ChEC data reveals that, while MCM complexes at the displaced location are much rarer in wild type than they are in <italic>sir2</italic>, this particular subpopulation appears equally susceptible to activation in both genotypes. This has the important implication that the manner in which the rDNA origin fires in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants may be simply an exaggerated instance of its normal behavior, and that even in wild type cells, it is predominantly from MCMs that are displaced, likely due to low level of C-pro transcription, that replication initiates.</p>
<p>Classic studies that employed EM and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that only a fraction of rDNA origins, estimated at one in five, are activated in any single cell cycle in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brewer and Fangman 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Linskens and Huberman 1988</xref>). These estimates were later corroborated by single molecule analysis, which also observed that the fraction of active origins increases in <italic>sir2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pasero et al. 2002</xref>). This low fraction of active rDNA origins could be due to insufficient origins licensing, suppression of activation or licensed origins or a combination of the two mechanisms. Our measurements of rDNA licensing showed that MCM are loaded in up to 90% of origins in WT cells and allowed us to conclude that regulation or rDNA replication initiation occurs primarily at the level of origin firing.</p>
<p>Chromatin remodeling enzymes have been proposed to assist DNA replication by modulation of nucleosome phasing in the vicinity of replication origins, but it has proven difficult to assign specific roles to remodelers in genome replication <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cutler et al. 2018</xref>). One of the reasons for this difficulty is the redundancy among different remodelers on one hand, and the multiple essential roles CRE play in DNA transactions in addition to replication. For example, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have identified four different remodelers that in combination with ORC can phase nucleosome at 320 replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chacin et al. 2023</xref>). However, a deletion of any single of these remodelers had no discernable effect on nucleosome phasing <italic>in vivo</italic> and a quadruple mutant was required to abolish phasing. While the characterization of this quadruple mutant suggested impaired replication initiation, it was difficult to exclude indirect effects that might have been caused by the effects on transcription. In contrast, the effect of a chromatin remodeler on DNA replication we describe in this work is remarkably specific: we found that the activity of a single remodeler, Fun30, is required to activation not only of a specific origin, but that its action is specific to nucleosomes adjacent to repositioned MCM complexes at the rDNA. The suppression of rDNA origin activity in sir2 mutants, which contained a large fraction of repositioned MCMs, by <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion is so severe that it reduces the rDNA size ∼3-5 fold, from 160 to 35-50 copies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence highlighting the importance of positioning of the MCM replicative helicase within the local nucleosome environment in determining replication timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Azmi et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rodriguez et al. 2017</xref>). While it is clear that small differences in this positioning can have significant effects on the timing of DNA replication, it is unlikely that a simple rule exists to directly infer origin timing solely based on the distance between the MCM complex and the nearest nucleosome. Nonetheless, our results suggest that this parameter could be a crucial piece of the puzzle in understanding why some origins fire early in S phase, while others fire late. Further research is needed to unravel the precise molecular mechanisms governing the interplay between the MCM complex and nucleosomes and how these dynamics influence replication timing across different genomic loci. Such insights will deepen our understanding of DNA replication regulation in the context of disease states associated with epigenetic drift, such as aging and cancer.</p>

<title>Quantification of rDNA replication using the thymidine analogue EdU</title>
<p>Cells were grown to log phase in rich YEPD medium from a 50 mL culture and synchronized in G1 using 3 μM alpha factor for 2 hours at 30°C. Using 500 μg/mL pronase, arrested cells were released into rich media containing 200 mM hydroxyurea and 130 μM EdU (5-Ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine). Cells were harvested in G1 and after 60 minutes released into HU. DNA was extracted using YeaStar Genomic DNA Kit (Zymo Research) and sonicated. Separate sequencing primers were ligated to each of the samples. Samples were pooled together, and subjected to click chemistry reaction in 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 50mM NaCl, 20 μM biotin-TEG azide (Vector Laboratories), 5mM THPTA (tris-hydroxypropyltriazolylmethylamine) (Vector Laboratories), 1mM copper sulfate, and 15 mM sodium ascorbate (total volume 200 μL). Click reaction proceeded for 30 minutes at room temperature prior to DNA ethanol precipitation. Streptavidin magnetic beads (New England Biolabs) were washed 3 times with B&amp;W buffer I (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween20, 0.5% SDS) before adding 100 μL of bead suspension to 180 μL DNA plus B&amp;W buffer I. After a 30-minute incubation at room temperature while gently inverting tubes, bead bound DNA was washed with 200 μL B&amp;W buffer I followed by 100 μL Stringency wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.1% SSC buffer) and 200 μL Wash Buffer II (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper presents a mechanistic study of rDNA origin regulation in yeast by SIR2. Each of the ~180 tandemly repeated rDNA gene copies contains a potential replication origin. Early-efficient initiation of these origins is suppressed by Sir2, reducing competition with origins distributed throughout the genome for rate-limiting initiation factors. Previous studies by these authors showed that SIR2 deletion advances replication timing of rDNA origins by a complex mechanism of transcriptional de-repression of a local PolII promoter causing licensed origin proteins (MCMcomplexes) to re-localize (slide along the DNA) to a different (and altered) chromatin environment. In this study, they identify a chromatin remodeler, FUN30, that suppresses the sir2∆ effect, and remarkably, results in a contraction of the rDNA to about one-quarter it's normal length/number of repeats, implicating replication defects of the rDNA. Through examination of replication timing, MCM occupancy and nucleosome occupancy on the chromatin in sir2, fun30, and double mutants, they propose a model where nucleosome position relative to the licensed origin (MCM complexes) intrinsically determines origin timing/efficiency. While their interpretations of the data are largely reasonable and can be interpreted to support their model, a key weakness is the connection between Mcm ChEC signal disappearance and origin firing. While the cyclical chromatin association-dissociation of MCM proteins with potential origin sequences may be generally interpreted as licensing followed by firing, dissociation may also result from passive replication and as shown here, displacement by transcription and/or chromatin remodeling. Moreover, linking its disappearance from chromatin in the ChEC method with such precise resolution needs to be validated against an independent method to determine the initiation site(s). Differences in rDNA copy number and relative transcription levels also are not directly accounted for, obscuring a clearer interpretation of the results. Nevertheless, this paper makes a valuable advance with the finding of Fun30 involvement, which substantially reduces rDNA repeat number in sir2∆ background. The model they develop is compelling and I am inclined to agree, but I think the evidence on this specific point is purely correlative and a better method is needed to address the initiation site question. The authors deserve credit for their efforts to elucidate our obscure understanding of the intricacies of chromatin regulation. At a minimum, I suggest their conclusions on these points of concern should be softened and caveats discussed. Statistical analysis is lacking for some claims.</p>
<p>Strengths are the identification of FUN30 as suppressor, examination of specific mutants of FUN30 to distinguish likely functional involvement. Use of multiple methods to analyze replication and protein occupancies on chromatin. Development of a coherent model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses are failure to address copy number as a variable; insufficient validation of ChEC method relationship to exact initiation locus; lack of statistical analysis in some cases.</p>
<p>Review of revised version and response letter:</p>
<p>In the response, the authors make some improvements by better quantifying 2D gels, adding some missing statistical analyses, analyzing the effect of fun30 on rDNA replication in strains with reduced rDNA copy number, and using ChIP-seq of MCMs to support the ChEC-seq data. However, these additions do not address the main issue that is at the heart of their model: where initiation precisely occurs and whether the location is altered in the mutant(s). Thus, mechanistic insight is limited.</p>
<p>Under the section &quot;Addressing Alternative Explanations&quot;, the authors claim that processes like transcription and passive replication cannot affect the displaced complex specifically. Why? They are not on same DNA (as mentioned in the Fig 1 legend).</p>
<p>The model in Fig 7 implies that initiation sites are different in WT versus the mutants and this determines their timing/efficiency. But they also suggest that the same site might be used with different efficiencies in this response. I agree that both are possibilities and are not resolved.</p>
<p>Supporting their model requires better resolution to determine the actual replication initiation site. While this may be challenging, it should be feasible with methods to map nascent strands like DNAscent, or Okazaki fragment mapping.</p>
<p>The 2D gel analysis of strains with reduced rDNA copy numbers adequately addresses the copy number variable with regard to the replication effect.</p>
<p>Overall, the paper is improved by providing additional data and improved analysis. The paper nicely characterizes the effect of Fun30. The model is reasonable but remains lacking in precise details of mechanism.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors follow up on their previous work showing that in the absence of the Sir2 deacetylase the MCM replicative helicase at the rDNA spacer region is repositioned to a region of low nucleosome occupancy. Here they show that the repositioned displaced MCMs have increased firing propensity relative to non-displaced MCMs. In addition, they show that activation of the repositioned MCMs and low nucleosome occupancy in the adjacent region depend on the chromatin remodeling activity of Fun30.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper provides new information on the role of a conserved chromatin remodeling protein in regulation of origin firing and in addition provides evidence that not all loaded MCMs fire and that origin firing is regulated at a step downstream of MCM loading.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The relationship between the authors results and prior work on the role of Sir2 (and Fob1) in regulation of rDNA recombination and copy number maintenance is not explored, making it difficult to place the results in a broader context. Sir2 has previously been shown to be recruited by Fob1, which is also required for DSB formation and recombination-mediated changes in rDNA copy number. Are the changes that the authors observe specifically in fun30 sir2 cells related to this pathway? Is Fob1 required for the reduced rDNA copy number in fun30 sir2 double mutant cells?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Heterochromatin is characterized by low transcription activity and late replication timing, both dependent on the NAD-dependent protein deacetylase Sir2, the founding member of the sirtuins. This manuscript addresses the mechanism by which Sir2 delays replication timing at the rDNA in budding yeast. Previous work from the same laboratory (Foss et al. PLoS Genetics 15, e1008138) showed that Sir2 represses transcription-dependent displacement of the Mcm helicase in the rDNA. In this manuscript, the authors show convincingly that the repositioned Mcms fire earlier and that this early firing partly depends on the ATPase activity of the nucleosome remodeler Fun30. Using read-depth analysis of sorted G1/S cells, fun30 was the only chromatin remodeler mutant that somewhat delayed replication timing in sir2 mutants, while nhp10, chd1, isw1, htl1, swr1, isw2, and irc5 had no effect. The conclusion was corroborated with orthogonal assays including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and analysis of EdU incorporation at early origins. Using an insightful analysis with an Mcm-MNase fusion (Mcm-ChEC), the authors show that the repositioned Mcms in sir2 mutants fire earlier than the Mcm at the normal position in wild type. This early firing at the repositioned Mcms is partially suppressed by Fun30. In addition, the authors show Fun30 affects nucleosome occupancy at the sites of the repositioned Mcm, providing a plausible mechanism for the effect of Fun30 on Mcm firing at that position. However, the results from the MNAse-seq and ChEC-seq assays are not fully congruent for the fun30 single mutant. Overall, the results support the conclusions providing a much better mechanistic understanding how Sir2 affects replication timing at rDNA,</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>(1) The data clearly show that the repositioned Mcm helicase fires earlier than the Mcm in the wild type position.</p>
<p>
(2) The study identifies a specific role for Fun30 in replication timing and an effect on nucleosome occupancy around the newly positioned Mcm helicase in sir2 cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(1) It is unclear which strains were used in each experiment.</p>
<p>
(2) The relevance of the fun30 phospho-site mutant (S20AS28A) is unclear.</p>
<p>
(3) For some experiments (Figs. 3, 4, 6) it is unclear whether the data are reproducible and the differences significant. Information about the number of independent experiments and quantitation is lacking. This affects the interpretation, as fun30 seems to affect the +3 nucleosome much more than let on in the description.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>This study is a detailed investigation of how chromatin structure influences replication origin function in yeast ribosomal DNA, with focus on the role of the histone deacetylase Sir2 and the chromatin remodeler Fun30. Convincing evidence shows that Sir2 does not affect origin licensing but rather affects local transcription and nucleosome positioning which correlates with increased origin firing. However, the evidence remains incomplete as the methods employed do not rigorously establish a key aspect of the mechanism, fully address some alternative models, or sufficiently relate to prior results. Overall, this is a valuable advance for the field that could be improved to establish a more robust paradigm.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added extensive new results to the manuscript that, we believe, address all three criticisms above, namely that the methods employed do not (1) rigorously establish a key aspect of the mechanism; (2) fully address some alternative models; or (3) sufficiently relate to prior results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper presents a mechanistic study of rDNA origin regulation in yeast by SIR2. Each of the ~180 tandemly repeated rDNA gene copies contains a potential replication origin. Earlyefficient initiation of these origins is suppressed by Sir2, reducing competition with origins distributed throughout the genome for rate-limiting initiation factors. Previous studies by these authors showed that SIR2 deletion advances replication timing of rDNA origins by a complex mechanism of transcriptional de-repression of a local PolII promoter causing licensed origin proteins (MCMcomplexes) to re-localize (slide along the DNA) to a different (and altered) chromatin environment. In this study, they identify a chromatin remodeler, FUN30, that suppresses the sir2∆ effect, and remarkably, results in a contraction of the rDNA to about onequarter it's normal length/number of repeats, implicating replication defects of the rDNA. Through examination of replication timing, MCM occupancy and nucleosome occupancy on the chromatin in sir2, fun30, and double mutants, they propose a model where nucleosome position relative to the licensed origin (MCM complexes) intrinsically determines origin timing/efficiency. While their interpretations of the data are largely reasonable and can be interpreted to support their model, a key weakness is the connection between Mcm ChEC signal disappearance and origin firing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Criticism: The reviewer expressed concern about the connection between Mcm ChEC signal disappearance and origin firing.</p>
<p>To further support our claim that the disappearance of the MCM signal in our ChEC datasets reflects origin firing, we now present additional data using the well-established method of MCM Chromatin IP (ChIP).</p>
<p>(1) New Supporting Evidence:  ChIP at genome-wide origins. In Figure 5 figure supplement 2, we demonstrate that the Mcm2 ChIP signal in cells released into hydroxyurea (HU) is significantly reduced at early origins compared to late origins, which mirrors the pattern observed with the MCM2 ChEC signal. This reduction in the ChIP signal at early origins supports the interpretation that the MCM signal disappearance is associated with origin firing.</p>
<p>(2) New supporting based evidence:  ChIP at rDNA Origins. Our ChIP analysis also shows that the disappearance of the MCM signal at rDNA origins in sir2Δ cells released into HU is accompanied by signal accumulation at the replication fork barrier (RFB), indicative of stalled replication forks at this location (Figure 5 figure supplement 3). This pattern is consistent with the initiation of replication at these origins and fork stalling at the RFB.</p>
<p>(3) New supporting evidence:  2D gels with quantification. Furthermore, additional 2D gel electrophoresis results provide ample independent evidence of rDNA origin firing in HU in <italic>sir2Δ</italic> mutants and suppression of origin firing in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> cells. These new data include 1) quantification of 2D gels in Figure 4D and 2) new 2D gels presented in Figure 4C as described below in greater detail. Collectively, these results demonstrate that rDNA origins fire prematurely in HU in <italic>sir2</italic> cells and that firing is suppressed by <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion. These additional data reinforce our model and support the association between MCM signal disappearance and replication initiation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While the cyclical chromatin association-dissociation of MCM proteins with potential origin sequences may be generally interpreted as licensing followed by firing, dissociation may also result from passive replication and as shown here, displacement by transcription and/or chromatin remodeling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raised a concern that the cyclical chromatin association-dissociation of MCM proteins could be interpreted as licensing followed by firing, but might also result from passive replication or displacement by transcription and chromatin remodeling.</p>
<p>Addressing Alternative Explanations:</p>
<p>(1) Selective Disappearance of MCM Complexes: While transcription and passive replication can indeed cause the MCM-ChEC signal to disappear, these processes cannot selectively cause the disappearance of the displaced MCM complex without also affecting the non-displaced MCM complex. Specifically, RNA polymerase transcribing C-pro would first need to dislodge the normally positioned MCM complex before reaching the displaced complex, which is not observed in our data.</p>
<p>(2) Role of FUN30 Deletion:  <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion results in increased C-pro transcription and reduced disappearance of the displaced MCM complex. This observation supports our model, as transcription alone would not selectively affect the displaced MCM complex while leaving the normally positioned MCM complex unaffected.</p>
<p>(3) Licensing Restrictions: It is crucial to note that continuous replenishment of displaced MCMs with newly loaded MCMs is not possible in our experimental conditions, as the cells are in S phase and licensing is restricted to G1. This temporal restriction further supports our interpretation that the disappearance of the MCM signal reflects origin firing rather than alternative processes.</p>
<p>In summary, while alternative explanations such as transcription and passive replication could potentially account for MCM signal disappearance, our data indicate that these processes cannot selectively affect the displaced MCM complex without impacting the non-displaced complex. The selective disappearance observed in our experiments, along with the effects of <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion and the temporal constraints on MCM loading, strongly support our interpretation that the disappearance of the MCM signal reflects origin firing.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Moreover, linking its disappearance from chromatin in the ChEC method with such precise resolution needs to be validated against an independent method to determine the initiation site(s). Differences in rDNA copy number and relative transcription levels also are not directly accounted for, obscuring a clearer interpretation of the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raised concerns about the need to validate the disappearance of MCM from chromatin observed using the ChEC method against an independent method to determine initiation sites. Additionally, they pointed out that differences in rDNA copy number and relative transcription levels are not directly accounted for, which may obscure the interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>(1) Reduced rDNA Copy Number promotes Early Replication: Copy number reduction of the magnitude caused by deletion of both <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>FUN30</italic> is not expected to suppress early rDNA replication in <italic>sir2</italic>, but rather to exacerbate it. Specifically, deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>FUN30</italic> causes the rDNA to shrink to approximately 35 copies. Kwan et al., 2023 (PMID: 36842087) have shown that a reduction in rDNA copy number to 35 copies results in a dramatic acceleration of rDNA replication in a <italic>SIR2+</italic> strain. Therefore, the effect of rDNA size on replication timing reinforces our conclusion that deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> suppresses rDNA replication.</p>
<p>(2) New 2D Gels in <italic>sir2</italic> and <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> strains with equal number of rDNA repeats: To directly address the concern regarding differences in the number of rDNA repeats, we have included new 2D gel analyses in the revised manuscript. By using a <italic>fob1</italic></p>
<p>background, we were able to equalize the repeat number between the <italic>sir2</italic> and <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> strains (Figure 4E). The 2D gels conclusively show that the suppression of rDNA origin firing upon <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion is independent of both rDNA size and <italic>FOB1</italic>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Nevertheless, this paper makes a valuable advance with the finding of Fun30 involvement, which substantially reduces rDNA repeat number in sir2∆ background. The model they develop is compelling and I am inclined to agree, but I think the evidence on this specific point is purely correlative and a better method is needed to address the initiation site question. The authors deserve credit for their efforts to elucidate our obscure understanding of the intricacies of chromatin regulation. At a minimum, I suggest their conclusions on these points of concern should be softened and caveats discussed. Statistical analysis is lacking for some claims.</p>
<p>Strengths are the identification of FUN30 as suppressor, examination of specific mutants of FUN30 to distinguish likely functional involvement. Use of multiple methods to analyze replication and protein occupancies on chromatin. Development of a coherent model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses are failure to address copy number as a variable; insufficient validation of ChEC method relationship to exact initiation locus; lack of statistical analysis in some cases.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>With regard to &quot;insufficient validation of ChEC method relationship to exact initiation locus&quot;:  The two potential initiation sites that one would monitor (non-displaced and displaced) are separated by less than 150 base pairs, and other techniques simply do not have the resolution necessary to distinguish such differences. Indeed, our new ChIP results presented in Figure 5 figure supplement 3 clearly demonstrate that while the resolution of ChIP is adequate to detect the reduction of MCM signal at the replication initiation site and its relocation to the RFB ( ~2 kb away), it lacks the resolution required to differentiate closely spaced MCM complexes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as we suggest in the manuscript, our results are consistent with a model in which it is only the displaced MCM complex that is activated, whether in <italic>sir2</italic> or WT.  If no genotypedependent difference in initiation sites is even expected, it would be hard to interpret even the most precise replication-based assays.</p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer pointing out that some statistical analyses were lacking: we have added statistical analysis for 2D gels (Figures 4D and 4E),  EdU incorporation experiments in Figure 4F and disappearance of MCM ChEC and ChIP signal upon release of cells into HU (Figure 5 supplement 1 and Supplement 2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additional background and discussion for public review:</p>
<p>This paper broadly addresses the mechanism(s) that regulate replication origin firing in different chromatin contexts. The rDNA origin is present in each of ~180 tandem repeats of the rDNA sequence, representing a high potential origin density per length of DNA (9.1kb repeat unit). However, the average origin efficiency of rDNA origins is relatively low (~20% in wild-type cells), which reduces the replication load on the overall genome by reducing competition with origins throughout the genome for limiting replication initiation factors. Deletion of histone deacetylase SIR2, which silences PolII transcription within the rDNA, results in increased early activation or the rDNA origins (and reduced rate of overall genome replication). Previous work by the authors showed that MCM complexes loaded onto the rDNA origins (origin licensing) were laterally displaced (sliding) along the rDNA, away from a well-positioned nucleosome on one side. The authors' major hypothesis throughout this work is that the new MCM location(s) are intrinsically more efficient configurations for origin firing. The authors identify a chromatin remodeling enzyme, FUN30, whose deletion appears to suppress the earlier activation of rDNA origins in sir2∆ cells. Indeed, it appears that the reduction of rDNA origin activity in sir2∆ fun30∆ cells is severe enough to results in a substantial reduction in the rDNA array repeat length (number of repeats); the reduced rDNA length presumably facilitates it's more stable replication and maintenance.</p>
<p>Analysis of replication by 2D gels is marginally convincing, using 2D gels for this purpose is very challenging and tricky to quantify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We address this criticism by carefuly quantifying 2 D gel results using single rARS signal for normalizing bubble arc as discussed below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The more quantitative analysis by EdU incorporation is more convincing of the suppression of the earlier replication caused by SIR2 deletion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have also added quantification of EdU results to strengthen our arguments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>To address the mechanism of suppression, they analyze MCM positioning using ChEC, which in G1 cells shows partial displacement of MCM from normal position A to positions B and C in sir2∆ cells and similar but more complete displacement away from A to positions B and C in sir2fun30 cells. During S-phase in the presence of hydroxyurea, which slows replication progression considerably (and blocks later origin firing) MCM signals redistribute, which is interpreted to represent origin firing and bidirectional movement of MCMs (only one direction is shown), some of which accumulate near the replication fork barrier, consistent with their interpretation. They observe that MCMs displaced (in G1) to sites B or C in sir2∆ cells, disappear more rapidly during S-phase, whereas the similar dynamic is not observed in sir2∆fun30∆. This is the main basis for their conclusion that the B and C sites are more permissive than A. While this may be the simplest interpretation, there are limitations with this assay that undermine a rigorous conclusion (additional points below). The main problem is that we know the MCM complexes are mobile so disappearance may reflect displacement by other means including transcription which is high is the sir2∆ background. Indeed, the double mutant has greater level of transcription per repeat unit which might explain more displaced from A in G1. Thus, displacement might not always represent origin firing. Because the sir2 background profoundly changes transcription, and the double mutant has a much smaller array length associated with higher transcription, how can we rule out greater accessibility at site A, for example in sir2∆, leading to more firing, which is suppressed in sir2 fun30 due to greater MCM displacement away from A?</p>
<p>I think the critical missing data to solidly support their conclusions is a definitive determination of the site(s) of initiation using a more direct method, such as strand specific sequencing of EdU or nascent strand analysis. More direct comparisons of the strains with lower copy number to rule out this facet. As discussed in detail below, copy number reduction is known to suppress at least part of the sir2∆ effect so this looms over the interpretations. I think they are probably correct in their overall model based on the simplest interpretation of the data but I think it remains to be rigorously established. I think they should soften their conclusions in this respect.</p>

Are the changes that the authors observe specifically in fun30 sir2 cells related to this pathway? Is Fob1 required for the reduced rDNA copy number in fun30 sir2 double mutant cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have conducted additional studies in the <italic>fob1</italic> background to address how <italic>FOB1</italic> and the replication fork barrier (RFB) influence the kinetics of rDNA size reduction upon <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion (Figure 2 - figure supplement 2), rDNA replication timing (Figure 2 - figure supplement 3), and rDNA origin firing using 2D gels (Figure 4C).</p>
<p>Strains lacking <italic>SIR2</italic> exhibit unstable rDNA size, and <italic>FOB1</italic> deletion stabilizes rDNA size in a <italic>sir2</italic> background (and otherwise). Similarly, we found that <italic>FOB1</italic> deletion influences the kinetics of rDNA size reduction in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> cells. Specifically, we were able to generate a <italic>fob1 sir2 fun30</italic> strain with more than 150 copies. Nonetheless, and consistent with our model, this strain still exhibited delayed rDNA replication timing (Figure 2 - figure supplement 3), and its rDNA still shrank upon continuous culture (Figure 2 figure supplement 2). These results demonstrate that, although <italic>FOB1</italic> affects the kinetics of rDNA size reduction in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> strains, the reduced rDNA array size or delayed replication timing upon <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion size does not depend on <italic>FOB1</italic>.</p>
<p>The use of the <italic>fob1</italic> background allowed us to compare the activation of rDNA origins in <italic>sir2</italic> and <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> strains with equally short rDNA sizes. 2D gels demonstrate robust and reproducible suppression of rDNA origin activity upon deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> in <italic>sir2 fob1</italic> strains with 35 rDNA copies (Figure 4C). These results indicate that the main effect we are interested in—<italic>FUN30</italic>-induced reduction in origin firing—is independent of both <italic>FOB1</italic> and rDNA size.</p>
<p>Our additional studies conclusively show that the <italic>FUN30</italic>-induced reduction in rDNA origin firing is independent of both <italic>FOB1</italic> and rDNA size. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms regulating rDNA copy number maintenance, placing our results within the broader context of existing knowledge on Sir2 and Fob1 functions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Heterochromatin is characterized by low transcription activity and late replication timing, both dependent on the NAD-dependent protein deacetylase Sir2, the founding member of the sirtuins. This manuscript addresses the mechanism by which Sir2 delays replication timing at the rDNA in budding yeast. Previous work from the same laboratory (Foss et al. PLoS Genetics 15, e1008138) showed that Sir2 represses transcription-dependent displacement of the Mcm helicase in the rDNA. In this manuscript, the authors show convincingly that the repositioned Mcms fire earlier and that this early firing partly depends on the ATPase activity of the nucleosome remodeler Fun30. Using read-depth analysis of sorted G1/S cells, fun30 was the only chromatin remodeler mutant that somewhat delayed replication timing in sir2 mutants, while nhp10, chd1, isw1, htl1, swr1, isw2, and irc3 had not effect. The conclusion was corroborated with orthogonal assays including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and analysis of EdU incorporation at early origins. Using an insightful analysis with an Mcm-MNase fusion (Mcm-ChEC), the authors show that the repositioned Mcms in sir2 mutants fire earlier than the Mcm at the normal position in wild type. This early firing at the repositioned Mcms is partially suppressed by Fun30. In addition, the authors show Fun30 affects nucleosome occupancy at the sites of the repositioned Mcm, providing a plausible mechanism for the effect of Fun30 on Mcm firing at that position. However, the results from the MNAse-seq and ChEC-seq assays are not fully congruent for the fun30 single mutant. Overall, the results support the conclusions providing a much better mechanistic understanding how Sir2 affects replication timing at rDNA,</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The observation that the MNase-seq plot in <italic>fun30</italic> mutant shows a large signal at the +3 nucleosome and somewhat smaller at position +2, while the ChEC-seq plot exhibits negligible signals, is indeed an important point of consideration. This discrepancy arises because most of the MCM in <italic>fun30</italic> mutant remains at its original site where it abuts +1 nucleosome. As a result, the MCM-MNase fusion protein fails to reach and “light up” the +3 nucleosome, which is, nonetheless, well-visualized with exogenous MNase.  The paucity of displaced MCMs, which is responsible for cutting +2 nucleosome, explains the discrepancy in the +2 nucleosome signal between exogenous MNase and CheC datasets in the <italic>fun30</italic> mutant.</p>
<p>Despite this apparent discrepancy, the overall results support our conclusions and provide a much better mechanistic understanding of how Sir2 affects replication timing at rDNA. The MNaseseq data reflect nucleosome positioning and chromatin structure, while the ChEC-seq data specifically highlights the locations where MCM is bound and active.</p>

<p>Fun30 is also known to play a role in the DNA damage response; specifically, phosphorylation of Fun30 on S20 and S28 by CDK1 targets Fun30 to sites of DNA damage, where it promotes DNA resection (Chen et al. 2016; Bantele et al. 2017). To determine whether the replication phenotype that we observed might be a consequence of Fun30's role in the DNA damage response, we tested non-phosphorylatable mutants for the ability to suppress early replication of the rDNA in sir2; these mutations had no effect on the replication phenotype (Figure 2B), arguing against a primary role for Fun30 in DNA damage repair that somehow manifests itself in replication.</p>
<p>(3) For some experiments (Figs. 3, 4, 6) it is unclear whether the data are reproducible and the differences significant. Information about the number of independent experiments and quantitation is lacking. This affects the interpretation, as fun30 seems to affect the +3 nucleosome much more than let on in the description.</p>

<p>Fig. 3-Examination of MCM occupancy at the rDNA ARS region using a variation of ChEC.</p>
<p>Presumably these are these G1-arrested cells but does not seem to be stated. Please confirm.</p>
<p>The 2D gels results are not very convincing of their conclusions. We are asked to compare bubble to fork arcs at 30 minutes, but this is not feasible. It is the author's job to quantify the data from multiple replicates, but none is given. After much careful examination, comparing the relative intensities of ascending bubble and Y-arcs, I think I can accept that 4A shows highest early efficiency for sir2 over WT and fun30, which are similar to each other, and lowest for sir2 fun30, at 60 and 90 min.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revision we provide a careful quantification of the 2D gels in Figure 4. For assessing rDNA origin activity, we normalized the bubble arc during the HU time course to a single rARS signal, that appears as large 24.4kb Nhe1I fragment originating from the  rightmost rDNA repeat (see Figures 4A and 4B). The description of the quantification in the text is provided below.</p>
<p>“Prior to separation on 2D gels, DNA was digested with NheI, which releases a 4.7 kb rARScontaining linear DNA fragment at the internal rDNA repeats (1N) and a much larger, 24.5 kb single-rARS-containing fragment originating from the rightmost repeat. In 2D gels, active origins generate replication bubble arc signals, whereas passive replication of an origin appears as a y-arc. Having a signal emanating from a single ARS-containing fragment simplifies the comparison of rDNA origin activity in strains with different numbers of rDNA repeats, such as in <italic>sir2</italic> vs <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> mutants. Origin activity is expressed as a ratio of the bubble to the single-ARS signal, effectively measuring the number of active rDNA origins per cell at a given time point.</p>
<p>As seen previously (Foss et al. 2019), deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> increased the number of activated rDNA origins, while deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> suppressed this effect. When analyzed in aggregate at 20, 30, 60 and 90 minutes following release into HU, the average number of activated rDNA origin activity in <italic>sir2</italic> mutant was increased 6.3-fold compared to those in WT (5.0±2.3 in <italic>sir2</italic> vs 0.8±0.4 in wt, p&lt;0.05 by 2 tailed t-test), and the increased number was reduced upon <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion (1.3±0.7 in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic>, p&lt;0.05 by 2 tailed t-test vs <italic>sir2,</italic> NS for comparison to WT).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>However, for part 4B, they state (p. 11) that deletion of FUN30 in a SIR2 background had no perceptible effect (on ARS305) but I think the data appear otherwise: the FUN30 cells show more Y-arc than WT.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now provide the assessment of ARS305 activity in HU cells as a ratio of bubble-arc to 1N signal. The reviewer is right that FUN30 has a more robust bubble arc signal compared to WT.</p>
<p>However, after normalization to 1N this difference did not appear significant (3.7 vs 5.1). Overall the analysis of activity or ARS305 origins demonstrates a reciprocity with the activity of rDNA origins in each of the four genotypes.  Furthermore, this observation is confirmed in our EdU-based analysis of 111 genomic origins, with statistical analysis showing a very high level of significance (see below).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Ultimately, analysis of unsynchronized cells would give unambiguous results about origin efficiency. In this regard I note that analysis of rDNA origin firing by 2D gels with HU versus asynchronous gives different results in WT versus sir2∆, with no difference in unsynchronized cells (He et al. 2022). It would be interesting to test the strains here unsynchronized, though copy number size would still be a variable to address.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Origin activity in log cultures is typically assessed by comparing replication initiation within an origin, presenting as a bubble arc, to passively replicated DNA (Y-arc). However, such an analysis at tandemly arrayed origins, such as rDNA, is not feasible, as both active and passive replication are the result of activation of the same origins. This explains the lack of difference between WT and sir2 cells previously reported (He et al. 2022), which we have also observed. Differences in activation of rDNA origins in WT vs <italic>sir2</italic> cells is clearly reflected in HU experiments, as was the case in the earlier report (He et al. 2022).</p>
<p>To address the issue of differences in copy number between <italic>sir2</italic> and <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> cells we have now done experiments in a <italic>fob1</italic> background where we can equalize the copy number among the two genotypes. These 2D gels are presented in Figure 4C. We address this issue in the revised manuscript as follows:</p>
<p>“The overall impact of <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion on rDNA origin activity in a <italic>sir2</italic> background is expected to be a composite of two opposing effects: a suppression of rDNA origin activation and increased rDNA origin activation due to reduced rDNA size (Kwan et al. 2023). To evaluate the effect <italic>FUN30</italic> on rDNA origin activation independently of rDNA size, we generated an isogenic set of strains in a <italic>fob1</italic> background, all of which contain 35 copies of the rDNA repeat.  (Deletion of <italic>FOB1</italic> is necessary to stabilize rDNA copy number.)  Comparing rDNA origin activity in <italic>sir2</italic> versus <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> genotypes, we observed a robust and reproducible reduction in rDNA origin activity upon <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion. This finding confirms that the <italic>FUN30</italic> suppresses rDNA origin firing in <italic>sir2</italic> background independently of both rDNA size and <italic>FOB1</italic> status.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-EdU analysis is more convincing regarding relative effects on genome versus rDNA, however, again, the effect of reduced rDNA array size in the sir2 fun30 cells may also be the proximal cause of the reduced effect on genome (early origins) replication rather than a direct effect on origin efficiency. No statistic provided to support that fun30 suppresses sir2 for rDNA activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This comment raises three distinct, but related, issues:</p>
<p>First, the reviewer is asking whether the reduced rDNA size, of the magnitude we observed in sir2 fun30 cells, could by itself be responsible for increased origin activity elsewhere in the genome, just because there is less rDNA that needs to be replicated. As noted earlier (Kwan et al. 2023), Kwan et al. examined the effect of rDNA size reduction and observed: 1) marked increased in rDNA origin activity and 2) reciprocal reduction in origin activity elsewhere in the genome. This counterintuitive finding suggests that a smaller rDNA size exerts more competition for limited replication resources compared to a larger rDNA size. In light of this, our findings with FUN30 deletion become even more compelling. The suppression of rDNA firing upon FUN30 deletion is so significant that it overrides the expected effects of rDNA size reduction.</p>
<p>Second, the reviewer points out our lack of statistical analysis to support our contention that fun30 suppresses sir2 with regard to rDNA origin activity. We have now addressed this issue as well, by quantifying 2D gel signals, as described above in the text that begins with &quot;Prior to separation on 2D gels, DNA was digested with NheI ...&quot;.</p>
<p>Third, we have now provided a statistical analysis to support our conclusion that EdU-based analysis of activity of 111 early origins shows suppression upon deletion of SIR2 that is largely reversed by additional deletion of FUN30.</p>
<p>&quot;Deletion of <italic>FUN30</italic> in a <italic>sir2</italic> background partially restored EdU incorporation at early origins, concomitant with reduced EdU incorporation at rDNA origins. In particular, the median value of log10 of read depths at 111 early origins, as the data are shown in Figure 4F, dropped from 6.5 for wild type to 6.2 for <italic>sir2</italic> but then returned almost to wild type levels (6.4) in <italic>sir2 fun30</italic>.  The p value obtained by Student's t test, comparing the drop in 111 origins from wild type to <italic>sir2</italic> with that from wild type to <italic>sir2 fun30</italic> was highly significant (&lt;&lt; 10-16)  In contrast, <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion in the WT background did not reduce EdU incorporation at genomic origins (median 6.6). These findings highlight that <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion-induced suppression of rDNA origins in <italic>sir2</italic> is accompanied by the activation of genomic origins.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Use loss of Mcm-ChEC signal as proxy for origin firing. Reasonably convincing that decrease correlates with origin firing on a one-to-one basis (Fig. 5B), though no statistic given.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We provide the statistical analysis in Figure 5-figure supplement 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>However, there is no demonstration of ability to observe this correlation with fine resolution as needed for the claims here. It seems equally possible that sir2 deletion causes more firing by repositioning MCMs to a better location or that the prior location, which still contains substantial MCM, becomes more permissive. The MCM signal appears to be mobile, so perhaps the role of FUN30 is to prevent to mobility of MCM away from the original site in WT cells; note that significantly less Mcm signal is at the original position in sir2 fun30. No accumulation of MCM occurs near the RFB in WT (and fun30) cells. I understand that origin firing is lower in WT but raises concerns about sensitivity and dynamic range of this assay and that MCM positions may reflect transcription versus replication.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Suggestions for the authors to consider:</p>
<p>(1) The authors make a good case for the importance of replication balance between rDNA and euchromatin in ensuring that the genome is replicated in a timely fashion. This seems to be clearly regulated by Sir2. However, Sir2 also affects rDNA copy number and suppresses unequal cross over events, which are stimulates by Fob1. Does Fun30 suppress Fob1-dependent recombination events in sir2D cells?</p>
<p>It is unclear why FUN30 only affects rDNA repeat copy number in sir2 cells. Why doesn't Fun30 reduce copy number in wild-type cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> causes rightward repositioning of MCMs to a position where they are more prone to fire, as shown by our HU ChEC datasets in which we show that the repositioned MCMs are more prone to activation than the non-repositioned ones. <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion suppresses activation of these, activation-prone repositioned MCMs, as shown by HU ChEC. This suppression of rDNA origin activation in <italic>sir2</italic> cells causes rDNA to shrink. In fun30 single mutants, due to the paucity of non-repositioned MCMs, we do not observe significant suppression of rDNA origin firing, and consequently, there is no reduction in rDNA size in <italic>fun30</italic> cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors use Mcm-MNase to map the location of the MCM helicase. Can these results be confirmed using the more standard and direct ChIP assay to examine changes in MCM localization</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We carried out suggested MCM ChIP experiments and present these results in Figure 5 supplement 2 and supplement 3. These ChIP data demonstrate that:</p>
<p>(1) MCM signal disappears preferentially at early origins compared to late origins, as seen in our ChEC results.</p>
<p>(2) The disappearance of ChEC signal at rDNA origins in <italic>sir2</italic> mutant is accompanied by the signal accumulation at the RFB, consistent with fork stalling at the RFB mirroring the results we obtained by ChEC. While these results indicate that that ChIP has adequate resolution to detect MCM repositioning at 2 kb, scale, its resolution was insufficient for fine scale discrimination of repositioned and non-repositioned MCMs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In this regard, the specific role of Fun30 in regulation of MCM firing at rDNA is interesting.</p>
<p>Does Fun30 localize to the ARS region of rDNA? How is Fun30 specifically recruited to rDNA?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We carried out ChIP for Fun30 and observed, similarly to previous reports (Durand-Dubief et al. 2012), a wide distribution of Fun30 throughout the genome and at rDNA. We have elected not to include these results in the current manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><italic>(3) The 2D gels in Figure 4 are difficult to interpret. The bubble to arc ratios in fun30D seem different from both wild-type and sir2D. It may be helpful to the reader to quantify the bubble to arc ratios. fun30D also seems to be affecting ARS305 by itself.</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We provide quantification of 2 D gels in Figure 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 5.</p>
<p>(4.1) For examining origin firing based on the disappearance of the Mcm-MNase reads, is HU arrest necessary? HU may be causing indirect effects due to replication fork stalling. In principle, the authors should be able to perform this analysis without HU, since their cells are released from synchronized arrest in G1 (and at least for the first cell cycle should proceed synchronously on to S phase). In addition, validation of Mcm-ChEC results using ChIP for one of the subunits of the MCM complex would increase confidence in the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The HU arrest allows us to examine early events in DNA replication at much finer spatial and temporal resolution than it would be possible without it.</p>
<p>We have now used Mcm2 ChIP to confirm that the signal disappears at the MCM loading site in HU in <italic>sir2</italic> cells as discussed above (Figure 5 figure supplement 3). However, the resolution is inadequate to discriminate non-repositioned vs repositioned MCMs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4.2) The non-displaced Mcm-ChEC signal in sir2D seems like it's decreasing more than in wildtype cells. Explain. It would be helpful to quantify these results by integrating the area under each peek (or based on read numbers). It looks like one of the displaced Mcm signals (the one more distal from the non-displaced) is changing at a similar rate to the non-displaced.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Integrating the area under each Mcm-ChEC peak or using read numbers is superfluous for the following reasons:  (1) The rectangular appearance of the peaks in Figure 5 clearly reflects signal intensity, making additional numerical integration redundant. (2) The visual differences between wild-type and sir2D cells are distinct and sufficient for drawing conclusions without further quantification.  (3) Keeping the analysis straightforward avoids unnecessary complexity and maintains clarity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4.3) Can the authors explain why fun30D seems to be suppressing only one of the 2 displaced Mcms from firing?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We speculate that the local environment is more conductive for firing one of two displaced MCMs, but we do not understand why.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 6. Why would the deletion of SIR2, a silencing factor, results in increased nucleosome occupancy at rDNA?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>If we understand correctly, the reviewer is referring to a small increase in +2 and +3 signal in <italic>sir2</italic> compared to the WT. In WT G1 cells, there is a single MCM between +1 and +3 nucleosome. This space cannot accommodate a +2 nucleosome in G1 cells because MCM is loaded at that position in most cells (in G2 cells however, this space is occupied by a nucleosome (Foss et al., 2019). MCM repositioning in sir2 mutant would displace MCM from this location making it possible for this space to be now occupied by a nucleosome.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The changes in nuc density seem modest. Also, nucleosome density is similarly increased in sir2D and fun30D cells, but sir2 has a dramatic effect on origin firing but fun30D does not. Explain.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that the <italic>FUN30</italic> status makes most of the difference for firing of displaced MCMs.</p>
<p>Since there are few displaced MCMs in <italic>SIR2</italic> cells, there is not large impact on origin firing. Furthermore, the rDNA already fires late in WT cells, so our ability to detect further delay upon  <italic>FUN30</italic> deletion could be more difficult.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Discussion. At rDNA Sir2 may simply act by deacetylating nucleosomes and decreasing their mobility. This is unrelated to compaction which is usually only invoked regarding the activities of the full SIR complex (Sir2/3/4) at telomeres and the mating type locus. The arguments regarding polymerase size, compaction etc may not be relevant to the main point since although the budding yeast Sir2 participates in heterochromatin formation at the mating type loci and telomeres, at rDNA it may act locally near its recruitment site at the RFB.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a valid point. We have added this sentence in the discussion to highlight the differences between silencing at rDNA and those at the silent mating loci and telomeres that SIR-complex dependent.</p>
<p>“Steric arguments such as these are even less compelling when made for rDNA than for the silent mating type loci and telomeres, because chromatin compaction has been studied mostly in the context of the complete Sir complex (Sir1-4). In contrast, Sir1, 3, and 4 are not present at the rDNA.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see if deletion of any histone acetyltranferases acts in a similar way to Fun30 to reduce rDNA copy number in sir2D cells.</p>
