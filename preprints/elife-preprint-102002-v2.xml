<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL) and multiple myeloma (MM) both share the overproduction of a clonal light chain (LC). However, while LCs in MM remain soluble in circulation, AL LCs misfold into toxic soluble species and amyloid fibrils that accumulate in organs, leading to distinct clinical manifestations. The significant sequence variability of LCs has hindered understanding of the mechanisms driving LC aggregation. Nevertheless, emerging biochemical properties, including dimer stability, conformational dynamics, and proteolysis susceptibility, distinguish AL LCs from those in MM under native conditions. This study aimed to identify a conformational fingerprint distinguishing AL from MM LCs. Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) under native conditions, we analyzed four AL and two MM LCs. We observed that AL LCs exhibited a slightly larger radius of gyration and greater deviations from X-ray crystallography-determined or predicted structures, reflecting enhanced conformational dynamics. SAXS data, integrated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, revealed a conformational ensemble where LCs adopt multiple states, with variable and constant domains either bent or straight. AL LCs displayed a distinct, low-populated, straight conformation (termed H state), which maximized solvent accessibility at the interface between constant and variable domains. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) experimentally validated this H state. These findings reconcile diverse experimental observations and provide a precise structural target for future drug design efforts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis is a systemic disease associated with the overproduction and subsequent amyloid aggregation of patient-specific light chains (LCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Such aggregation may take place in one or several organs, the heart and kidneys being the most affected ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). AL originates from an abnormal proliferation of a plasma cell clone that results in LCs overexpression and over-secretion in the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). LCs belonging both to lambda (λ) and kappa (κ) isotypes are associated with AL; however, λ-LCs are greatly overrepresented in the repertoire of AL patients. Specifically, AL-causing LCs (AL-LCs) most often belong to a specific subset of lambda germlines such as <italic>IGLV6</italic> (λ6), <italic>IGLV1</italic> (λ1), and <italic>IGLV3</italic> (λ3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>λ-LCs are dimeric in solution with each subunit characterized by two immunoglobulin domains, a constant domain (CL) with a highly conserved sequence and a variable domain (VL) whose extreme sequence variability is the result of genomic recombination and somatic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). VL domains are generally indicated as the key responsible for LC amyloidogenic behavior. The observation that the fibrillar core in most of the structures of <italic>ex-vivo</italic> AL amyloid fibrils consist of VL residues further strengthens this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). However, in a recent cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) structure, a stretch of residues belonging to the CL domain is also part of the fibrillar core, and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of several <italic>ex vivo</italic> fibrils from different patients indicates that amyloids are composed of several LC proteoforms including full-length LCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly the overproduction of a light chain is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the onset of AL. Indeed, the uncontrolled production of a clonal LC is often associated with Multiple Myeloma (MM), a blood cancer, but only a subset of MM patients develops AL, thus indicating that specific sequence/biophysical properties determine LC amyloidogenicity and AL onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). To date, the extreme sequence variability of AL-LCs has prevented the identification of sequence patterns predictive of LC amyloidogenicity, however, it has been reproducibly reported that several biophysical properties correlate with LC aggregation propensity. AL-LCs display a lower thermodynamic and kinetic fold stability compared to non-amyloidogenic LCs found overexpressed in MM patients (named hereafter MM-LCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous work on LCs has indicated how differences in conformational dynamics can play a role in the aggregation properties of AL-LCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Oberti <italic>et al.</italic> have compared multiple λ-LCs obtained from either AL patients or MM patients identifying the susceptibility to proteolysis as the best biophysical parameter distinguishing the two sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Weber <italic>et al.</italic> have shown, using a murine-derived κ-LC, how a modification in the linker region can lead to a greater conformational dynamic, an increased susceptibility to proteolysis, as well as an increased <italic>in vitro</italic> aggregation propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Additionally, AL-LC flexibility and conformational freedom have also been correlated to the proteotoxicity observed in patients affected by cardiac AL and experimentally verified in human cardiac cells and a <italic>C. elegans</italic> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). It is noteworthy that the amyloid LCs analyzed in this study were originally purified from patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis.</p>
<p>Here building on this previous work as well on our previous experience on β2-microglobulin, another natively folded amyloidogenic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) we aimed at revealing the structural and dynamic determinants of LC amyloidogenicity. With this goal we investigated the native solution state dynamics of multiple λ-LCs by combining MD simulations, SAXS, and HDX-MS. Interestingly, we found a unique conformational fingerprint of amyloidogenic LCs corresponding to a low-populated state (defined as H-state in the following) characterized by extended linkers, with an accessible VL-CL interface and possible structural rearrangements in the CL-CL interface.</p>

<title>SAXS suggests differences in the conformational dynamics of amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic LC</title>
<p>SAXS data were acquired either in bulk or in-line with size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) for a set of six LCs previously described (cf. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and Methods). Four of these LCs (referred as H3, H7, H18 in ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) and AL55 in ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>)) were identified in multiple AL patients (AL-LC), white two (referred as M7, and M10 in ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>)), were identified in MM patients (MM-LC). These LCs cover multiple germlines, with H18 and M7 belonging to the same germline (cf. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The sequence identity is the largest for H18 and M7 (91.6%) while is the lowest for AL55 and M7 (75.2%). A table showing the statistics for all pairwise sequence alignments is reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Table S1</xref> in the Supporting Information. For H3, H7, and M7 a crystal structure was previously determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) while for H18, AL55, and M10 we obtained a model using either homology modeling (H18 and AL55) or AlphaFold2 (M10). Qualitatively, the SAXS curves in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> did not reveal any macroscopic deviation of the solution behavior with respect to the crystal or model conformation. For each LC, we compared the experimental and theoretical curves calculated from the LC structures (cf. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) analyzing the residuals and the associated χ<sup>2</sup>. The analysis indicated a discrepancy between the model conformation and the data in the case of the AL-LCs, which was instead not observed in the case of the MM-LCs. For AL-LC, residuals deviate from normality in the low <italic>q</italic> region, suggesting some variability in the global size of the system. Additionally, a weak trend distinguishing AL-LC from MM-LCs could be identified in the radius of gyration (Rg) as derived from the Guinier approximation (cf. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). H3, H7, H18, and AL55 have an Rg that is 0.5 to 0.8 Å larger than M7 and M10, a small but statistically significant difference (p-value &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>). Overall, the SAXS measurements point to less compact and more structurally heterogeneous AL-LCs compared to more compact and structurally homogeneous MM-LCs.</p>

<title>MD simulations reveal a conformational fingerprint for amyloidogenic light chains</title>
<p>To investigate the conformational dynamics of the six LCs we performed Metadynamics Metainference (M&amp;M) MD simulations employing the SAXS curves (<italic>q&lt;0.3</italic> Å) as restraints (cf. Material and Methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Metainference is a Bayesian framework that allows the integration of experimental knowledge on-the-fly in MD simulations improving the latter while accounting for the uncertainty in the data and their interpretation. Metadynamics is an enhanced sampling technique able to speed up the sampling of the conformational space of complex systems. The combination of SAXS and MD simulations has been shown to be effective for multi-domain proteins as well as for intrinsically disordered proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>).</p>
<p>For each LC, we performed two independent M&amp;M simulations coupled by the SAXS restraint, accumulating around 120-180 µs of MD per protein (cf. Material and Methods and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The resulting conformational ensembles resulted in a generally improved agreement with the SAXS data employed as restraints (cf. <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). To investigate differences in the LC local flexibility we first analyzed the root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) for the CL and VL separately, averaging over the chains and the replicates, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>. The RMSF indicates comparable flexibility in most of the regions, with differences localized in the termini and in some loops. The VL of amyloidogenic LCs are generally more flexible than the MM ones, but this may be associated with the lengths of their complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Indeed, M10 has the longest and most flexible CDR1 and the shortest and least flexible CDR3. Unexpectedly, there are some differences also in the CL domains. Here, in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, the AL-LCs are always more flexible in at least one region even if these differences are relatively small. Overall, the RMSF does not provide a clear indication to differentiate AL and MM-LCs. To provide a global description of the dynamics of the six LC systems, we then introduced two collective variables, namely the elbow angle, describing the relative orientation of VL and CL dimers, and the distance between the VL and CL dimers center of mass, illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>.</p>

<p>In <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, we report the free energy surfaces (FES) obtained from the processing of the two replicates of each LC as a function of the elbow angle and the CL-VL distance calculated from their center of mass. The visual inspection of the FES indicates converged simulation: in all cases, the replicates explore a comparable free-energy landscape with comparable features. All six LC FES share common features: a relatively continuous low free energy region along the diagonal, spanning configurations where the CL and VL are bent and close to each other (state L<sub>B</sub>), and configurations where the CL and VL domains are straight and at relative distance between 3.4 and 4.1 nm (state L<sub>S</sub>). A subset of LCs, namely H18, M7, and AL55, display conformations where the domains are straight in line (elbow angle greater than 2.5 rad) and in close vicinity, with a relative distance between the center of mass of less than 3.4 nm (state G). Of note, H18 and M7 belong to the same germline, letting us speculate that this state G may be germline specific. Most importantly, only the AL-LCs display configurations with CL and VL straight in line but well separated at relative distances greater than 4.1 nm, this state H seems to be a fingerprint specific for AL-LCs. A set of configurations exemplifying the four states is reported in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. The estimates of the populations for the four states L<sub>B</sub>, L<sub>S</sub>, G, and H are reported in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The quantitative analysis indicates that, within the statistical significance of the simulations, states L<sub>B</sub> and L<sub>S</sub> represent in all cases most of the conformational space. In the case of H18, AL55, and M7, the compact state G is also significantly populated (10-34%). The state H, associated with amyloidogenic LCs, is populated between 5 and 10% in H3, H7, H18, and AL55 and less than 1% in M7 and M10.</p>

From the comparison of the FESes, it is clear that only in the conformations corresponding to the state H do the CL-CL dimers display an alternative configuration. In the case of H3, the CL-CL domains in the H state are characterized by a shift towards configurations characterized by a larger distance, the same is observed in the case of H18 and AL55, while in the case of H7 the H state is characterized by a smaller distance between the CL domains.</p>

<title>HDX independently validates the amyloidogenic LC conformational fingerprint</title>
<p>To gain further molecular insight into how the dynamics of the tertiary and quaternary structures can be differentiated in AL- and MM-LCs, HDX-MS was performed on our set of proteins. HDX-MS probes the protein dynamics by monitoring the hydrogen-to-deuterium uptake over time and the obtained data well complement structural, biophysical, and computational data. Four LCs from our set (H3, H7, AL55, and M10) yielded good peptide sequence coverages of 98.6, 92.5, 98.6, and 99.1%, respectively, with redundancy of &gt; 4.0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Figures S8A-S11A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Table S2</xref> in the Supporting Information). H18 and M7 were not included in this analysis due to their poor sequence coverage and were not further investigated. Due to sequence heterogeneity among our proteins, the common peptide analyses were not performed. Therefore, the relative deuterium exchange at different HDX time points of 0.5 to 240 min with respect to zero exchange time was used to compare the dynamics of individual proteins. The average uptake at different time points for selected regions including residues 34-50 and 152-180 were included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Figure S12</xref> in the Supporting Information. The individual peptide mapping at all HDX time points is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Figure S13</xref> in the Supporting Information.

<p>HDX-MS analysis revealed subtle structural dynamics of the individual proteins. The most significant difference between the AL and MM-LCs is observed for residues 34-50, which are part of both the VL-VL dimerization interface and, more importantly in the context of this work, the CL-VL interface. These residues show significantly higher deuterium uptakes in all H-proteins, with H3 being the highest, implying that AL-LCs dimeric interfaces (VL-VL and CL-VL) are more dynamic and hence significantly more destabilized than in M10 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Figure S12</xref> in the Supporting Information). The highly dynamic VL-VL interface of H3 also correlates well with its open VL-VL interface in a crystal structure (PDB 8P89), which houses two nanobodies interacting with each VL in a dimeric structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). On the other hand, residues 54-70, which are not part of either interface, show a higher deuterium uptake and hence more dynamics in M10 protein, which may be a result of redistribution of dynamics in the regions away from the rigid VL-VL interface to stabilize the overall structure as also observed for other proteins previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Figure S12</xref>). In contrast, the VL-CL hinge regions (residues 110-120) show homogenously high flexibility in all the proteins except H7 indicating their higher accessible surface areas (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). As expected, the CL domains from residues 170-200 also show a similar pattern of average deuterium uptakes and hence flexibility in AL- and MM-LCs, with a minor difference contributed by the rigid VL-CL interface containing residues 165-180 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Figures S8B-S11B, S12</xref> in the Supporting Information). This region shows significantly less deuterium uptake (rigid) in both AL and M proteins when compared to other peptides in the CL domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Figures S8B-S11B</xref> in the Supporting Information). However, comparing the average uptake for this region (residue 152-180) between AL and M proteins shows that H3 and AL55 have higher uptake than M10. In contrast, H7 is an exception with the lowest deuterium uptake in this region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Figure S12 Panel 152-180</xref> in the Supporting Information). These data are particularly interesting in the light of our simulations. The dimeric conformations identified in the H state, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, are characterized by higher accessibility for the CL-VL interface, which is in agreement with the increased accessibility for the region 34-50 on the VL and 159-180 in the CL observed in the HDX-MS analysis. Notably, the H state of H7 is the only one in which the CL-CL interface is remarkably compact (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Figure S3</xref> in the Supporting Information), consistent with the lower HDX for residues 152-180 observed in H7. Overall, the HDX-MS data provide an independent validation of the H-state predicted from our conformational ensembles</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Understanding the molecular determinants of AL amyloidosis has been hampered by its high sequence variability in contrast to its highly conserved three-dimensional structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In this work, building on our previous studies highlighting susceptibility to proteolysis as a property that can discriminate between AL-LC and MM-LC, as well as the role of conformational dynamics in protein aggregation, we characterized LC conformational dynamics under the assumption that AL-LC proteins, despite their sequence diversity, may share a property that emerges at the level of their dynamics. We combined SAXS measurements with MD simulations under the integrative framework of Metainference to generate conformational ensembles representing the native state conformational dynamics of 4 AL-LC and 2 MM-LC. While SAXS alone already indicated possible differences, its combination with MD allowed us to observe a possible low-populated state, which we refer to as state H, characterized by well-separated VL and CL dimers and a perturbed CL-CL interface, which is significantly populated in AL-LCs while only marginally populated in MM-LCs. Notably, high-energy states associated with amyloidogenic proteins have been previously identified in the case of SH3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) and β2m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Here, HDX measurements allowed us to independently validate this state by observing increased accessibility in CL-VL interface regions. Importantly, given the limited size of our LC set, we observed in reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) that a comparison of lambda-6 LCs by HDX-MS revealed differences between AL and MM LCs in a region overlapping with the one reported here (residues 35–50). Specifically, this region exhibited increased deuterium uptake in AL compared to MM proteins. A T32N substitution was shown to mitigate aggregation propensity and reduce deuterium uptake in the AL protein, while the reverse substitution, N32T, applied to the germline sequence, increased it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Finally, the H-state observed here is comparable to that previously observed for an aggregation-prone mutation in a monomeric kappa LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>
<p>Having established a conformational fingerprint for AL-LC proteins, it would be tempting to identify possible mutations that could be associated with the presence of the H state. Comparing the sequences and structures of M7 and H18, both of which belong to the <italic>IGLV3-19*01</italic> germline, we can identify a single mutation, A40G, that could easily be associated with the appearance of the H state in H18. This mutation is located in the 37-43 loop, which H/D exchange showed to be more accessible in our three AL-LCs than in our MM-LC (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Figure S12</xref>), and it breaks a hydrophobic interaction with the methyl group of T165, as observed in the crystal structure of M7 (PDB 5MVG and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Figure S13</xref>), potentially making T165 more accessible in H18 than in M7 (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Figure S12</xref>). Comparing the H18 and M7 sequences with the germline reference sequence, we see that position 40 in <italic>IGLV3-19*01</italic> is a glycine (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Figure S13</xref>). This would suggest the intriguing interpretation that the G40A mutation in M7 may increase the interdomain stability compared to the germline sequence, making it less susceptible to aggregation. However, it should also be noted that while this framework position is a glycine in H3, H7, and AL55, it is also a glycine in M10. Previous research has often focused on identifying, on a case-by-case basis, the key mutations that may be considered responsible for the emergence of the aggregation propensity, under the assumption that such aggregation propensity should not be present in germline sequences, but this assumption may be misleading given the observation that few germlines are strongly overrepresented in AL, suggesting that these starting germline sequences may be inherently more aggregation-prone than the germline genes that are absent or rarely found in AL patients. More generally, by comparing our AL-LC sequences with their germline references (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Figures S14 to S19</xref> in the Supporting Information), we observe that all mutations fall exclusively in the variable domain, allowing us to exclude for these systems a direct role for residues in the linker region, as observed in ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), or in the constant domain, as observed in ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Many mutations fall in the CDR regions, as expected, but others are found in the framework regions, both near the dimerization interface and in other regions of the protein. Somatic mutations in the dimerization interfaces have been identified previously as possibly responsible for toxicity of AL-LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Regarding mutations in the CDRs, it has been suggested that AL-LC proteins may exhibit frustrated CDR2 and CDR3 loops, with few key residues populating the left-hand alpha helix or other high-energy conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), resulting in the destabilization of the VL. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Figures S14 to S19</xref> in the Supporting Information, we have analyzed the Ramachandran plot obtained from our conformational ensembles, focusing only on those residues that most populate the left-hand alpha helix region, which are marked with a red circle symbol and whose Ramachandran is reported. Our data indicate the presence of residues populating left-hand alpha regions in the Ramachandran plot, but these are also found in the case of MM-LCs, so our simulations do not allow to confirm or exclude this mechanism in our set of protein systems.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study provides a novel, complementary, perspective on the determinants of the misfolding propensity of AL-LCs that we schematize in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>. The identification of a high-energy state, with perturbed CL dimerization interfaces, extended linkers, and accessible regions in both the VL-CL and VL-VL interfaces may be the common feature interplaying with specific properties shown by previous work including the direct or indirect destabilization of both the VL-VL and CL-CL dimerization interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Our conformational fingerprint is also consistent with the observation that protein stability does not fully correlate with the tendency to aggregate, whereas susceptibility to proteolysis and conformational dynamics may better to capture the differences between AL-LC and MM-LC. In this context, our data allow us to rationally suggest that targeting the constant domain region at the CL-VL interface, which is more labile in the H state, maybe a novel strategy to search for molecules against LC aggregation in AL amyloidosis.</p>

<p>Recombinant AL- (H3, H7, H18, and AL5) and M- (M7, M10) proteins were produced and purified from the host <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21(DE3). Firstly, the competent BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with plasmid pET21(b+), which contains genes encoding H3, H7, H18, AL55, M7, and M10 proteins. The transformed cells were selected for each plasmid by growing them on LB agar plates containing the antibiotic ampicillin at a final concentration of 100 µg/ml. For over-expression of protein, one colony was picked from each plate and grown overnight in 20 ml of LB broth containing ampicillin at a final concentration of 100 µg/ml. The overnight-grown cells were then used to inoculate a secondary culture in one liter of LB broth. The cells were grown until the turbidity (OD<sub>600nm</sub>) reached between 0.6-0.8 and protein expression was subsequently induced by adding 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h. The bacterial cells containing overexpressed LCs were then harvested using a Backman Coulter centrifuge at 6000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. All the proteins were overexpressed as inclusion bodies. For protein purification, the inclusion bodies were isolated by cell lysis induced by sonication. The purification of inclusion bodies was performed by washing them with buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 8) and 1% triton X 100. The purified inclusion bodies were unfolded with buffer containing 6.0 M guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl) for 4h at 4 °C. The unfolded LCs were then refolded in a buffer containing reduced and oxidized glutathione to assist in disulfide bond formation. The refolded proteins were subjected to anion exchange and size-exclusion chromatography steps for final purification. The level of protein purity was checked on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels. The final protein concentration was measured using molecular weight and extinction coefficient of individual proteins. The purified proteins were stored at −20 °C for further use. Size exclusion coupled multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) confirmed the dimeric assembly of purified proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Figure S20</xref>) which were used for SAXS and HDX-MS experiments mentioned below.</p>

Simulations were performed in the NPT ensemble maintaining the temperature at 310 K with the Bussi thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>) and the pressure of 1 atm with the Parrinello-Rahman barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>); the electrostatic was treated by using the particle mesh Ewald scheme with a short-range cut-off of 0.9 nm and van der Waals interaction cut-off was set to 0.9 nm. To reduce the computational cost, the hydrogen mass repartitioning scheme was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>): the mass of heavy atoms was repartitioned into the bonded hydrogen atoms using the heavyh flag in the <italic>pdb2gmx</italic> tool, the LINCS algorithm was used to constraint all bonds, allowing to use a time step of 5 fs. In these simulations Parallel Bias Metadynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>) was used to enhance the sampling, combined with well-tempered metadynamics and the multiple-walker scheme, where Gaussians with an initial height of 1.0 kJ/mol were deposited every 0.5 ps, using a bias factor of 10. Five CVs were biased, including combinations of phi/psi dihedral angles of the linker regions (i.e. residues connecting variable and constant domains) in the two chains, combinations of chi dihedral angles of the linker regions in the two chains, combination of inter-domain contacts between the variable and the constant domains. The width of the Gaussians was 0.07, 0.12 and 120 for the combination of phi/psi, of chi dihedral angles and combination of contacts, respectively. Metainference was used to include SAXS restraints, using the hySAXS hybrid approach described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). A set of 13 representative SAXS intensities at different scattering angles, ranging between 0.015 AJJ and 0.25 AJJ and equally spaced, was used as restraints. These intensities were extracted from experimental data, after performing regularization with the Distance Distribution tool of Primus, based on Gnom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Metainference was applied every 5 steps, using a single Gaussian noise per data point and sampling a scaling factor between experimental and calculated SAXS intensities with a flat prior between 0.5 and 1.5. The aggregate sampling from the 60 replicas was reweighted using the final metadynamics bias to obtain a conformational ensemble where each conformation has an associated statistical weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). Convergence and error estimates were assessed by the inspection of the two replicated metadynamics metainference run. SAXS data were then recalculated using crysol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). All relevant data are available on Zenodo (cf. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1350">Dataset S2</xref>).</p>

<title>Hydrogen-deuterium mass exchange spectrometry (HDX-MS)</title>
<p>SYNAPT G2-HDMS system (Waters Corporation, USA) equipped with a LEAP robotic liquid handler was used to perform HDX-MS measurements in a fully automated mode as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>). The data collection was carried out by a 20-fold dilution of H3, H7, AL55, and M10 proteins (100 µM) with the labeling buffer 1X phosphate buffer saline (PBS) prepared in D<sub>2</sub>O (pD 7.4) to trigger HDX for 0, 0.5, 1,10, 30, 120, and 240 min at 25 °C in technical triplicates. Each reaction was quenched by mixing the labeled protein with quench buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 250 mM TCEP, 3.0 M GdnHCl (pH 2)) in a 1:1 ratio at 0 °C. Online digestion was then performed using an immobilized pepsin digestion column (Waters Enzymate BEH Pepsin, 2.1 x 30 mm). The digested peptides were trapped using a C18 trapping column (Acquity BEH VanGuard 1.7 µm, 2.1 x 5.0 mm) and separated by a linear acetonitrile gradient of 5 to 40%. Protein Lynx Global Server (PLGS), and DynamX (Waters Corporation, USA) were used to identify the individual peptides, and subsequently, data processing using parameters: maximum peptide length of 25, the minimum intensity of 1000; minimum ion per amino acid of 0.1; maximum MH+ error of 5 ppm and a file threshold of three. A reference molecule [(Glu1)-fibrinopeptide B human (CAS No 103213-49-6, Merck, USA)] was used to lock mass with an expected molecular weight of 785.8426 Da. The obtained peptide coverage of H3, H7, AL55, and M10 were 98.6%, 92.5%, 98.6%, and 99.1%, respectively, with a redundancy &gt; 4.0. Backbone amide groups exhibited a relative deuterium uptake (with respect to the zero exchange time data) of 0 to 30% within 4 h of exchange time. The relative deuterium uptake data at different HDX times were then used to generate heat maps for each amino acid. The obtained data was mapped on individual protein structures in a gradient of blue-white-red showing 0 to 30% of uptake, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>). Red denotes the dynamic peptides while peptides colors in blue are rigid. The common peptide analysis between different model LCs was not performed in this analysis as they all generate different peptides both due to sequence heterogeneity in LCs especially in the VL domain and non-specific cleavage of pepsin enzyme used to generate peptides after deuterium exchanged for MS analysis. Therefore, all interpretation was done on individual relative exchange data.</p>

<p>This study addresses an <bold>important</bold> and longstanding question regarding the molecular mechanism of protein misfolding in Ig light chain (LC) amyloidosis (AL), a life-threatening condition. By combining advanced techniques, including small-angle X-ray scattering, molecular dynamics simulations, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, the authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that the &quot;H state&quot; distinguishes amyloidogenic from non-amyloidogenic LCs. These findings not only offer novel insights into LC structural dynamics but also hold promise for guiding therapeutic strategies in amyloidosis and will be of particular interest to structural biologists, biophysicists, and many others working on amyloid diseases.</p>

<p>The study investigates light chains (LCs) using three distinct approaches, with a focus on identifying a conformational fingerprint to differentiate amyloidogenic light chains from multiple myeloma light chains. The study's major contribution is the identification of a low-populated &quot;H state,&quot; which the authors propose as a unique marker for AL-LCs. While this finding is promising, the review highlights several strengths and weaknesses. Strengths include the valuable contribution of identifying the H state and the use of multiple approaches, which provide a comprehensive understanding of LC structural dynamics. Weaknesses include a lack of physical insights explaining the changes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This well-written manuscript addresses an important but recalcitrant problem - molecular mechanism of protein misfolding in Ig light chain (LC) amyloidosis (AL), a major life-threatening form of systemic human amyloidosis. The authors use expertly recorded and analyzed small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data as a restraint for molecular dynamics simulations (called M&amp;M). Six patient-based LC proteins are explored, including four AL and two non-AL. The authors report a partially populated &quot;H-state&quot; determined computationally, wherein the two domains in an LC molecule acquire a straight rather than bent conformation, with an extended interdomain linker; this H-state distinguishes AL from non-AL LCs. H-D exchange mass spectrometry is used to support this conclusion. This is a novel and interesting finding with potentially important translational implications.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Expertly recorded and analyzed SAXS data combined with clever M&amp;M simulations lead to a novel and interesting conclusion, which is supported by limited H-D exchange data.</p>
<p>
Stabilization of the CL-CL interface is a good idea that may help protect a subset of AL LCs from misfolding in amyloid.</p>
<p>Computational M&amp;M evidence is convincing and is supported by SAXS data, which are used as restraints for simulations. Although Kratky plots reported in the main MS Fig. 1 show significant differences between the data and the structural model for only one AL protein, AL-55, H-state is also inferred for other AL proteins.</p>
<p>Apparent limitations:</p>
<p>HDX MS results show that residues 35-50 from VL-VL and VL-CL dimerization interface are less protected in AL vs. non-AL proteins, which is consistent with the H-state. However, the small number of proteins yielding useful HDX data (three AL and one non-AL) suggests that this conclusion should be treated with caution. It is unclear whether the conformational heterogeneity depicted in M&amp;M simulations is consistent with HDX results, and whether prior HDX studies of AL and MM LCs are consistent with the conclusions that a particular domain-domain interface is weakened in AL vs. non-AL LCs. The butterfly plots in Fig. 5 could benefit from the X-axis labeling with the peptide fragments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study identifies confirmational fingerprints of amylodogenic light chains, that set them apart from the non-amylodogenic ones.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The research employs a comprehensive combination of structural and dynamic analysis techniques, providing evidence that conformational dynamics at VL-CL interface and structural expansion are distinguished features of amylodogenic LCs.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The sample size is limited, which may affect the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the study could benefit from deeper analysis of specific mutations driving this unique conformation to further strengthen therapeutic relevance.</p>
<p>Furthermore. p-value (statistical significance) of Rg difference should be computer. Finally, significance of mutations (SHM?) at the interface, such as A40G should be compared with previous observations. (Garofalo et al., 2021)</p>

<p>This important study identifies the &quot;H-state&quot; as a potential conformational marker distinguishing amyloidogenic from non-amyloidogenic light chains, addressing a critical problem in protein misfolding and amyloidosis. By combining advanced techniques such as small-angle X-ray scattering, molecular dynamics simulations, and H-D exchange mass spectrometry, the authors provide convincing evidence for their novel findings. However, incomplete experimental descriptions, limitations in SAXS data interpretation, and the way HDX MS data is presented aHect the strength and generalizability of the conclusions. Strengthening these aspects would enhance the impact of this work for researchers in amyloidosis and protein misfolding.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank eLife editors and reviewers for their constructive feedback. The manuscript has been improved to provide a more complete description of the experiments and to strengthen the interpretation and presentation of all data. Updated Figures (Figure 2 and Figure 5) and a new Table (Table 2) in the main text provide a more complete and clearer comparison of the SAXS data with MD simulations as well as a clearer representation of the HDX MS data. Additional figures have been added in SI. The text has been extended accordingly and complete materials and methods are now included in the main text. Abstract, introduction and discussion have been revised to improve the overall readability of the manuscript.</p>

<p>The study investigates light chains (LCs) using three distinct approaches, with a focus on identifying a conformational fingerprint to diHerentiate amyloidogenic light chains from multiple myeloma light chains. The study's major contribution is identifying a low-populated &quot;H state,&quot; which the authors propose as a unique marker for AL-LCs. While this finding is promising, the review highlights several strengths and weaknesses. Strengths include the valuable contribution of identifying the H state and using multiple approaches, which provide a comprehensive understanding of LC structural dynamics. However, the study suHers from weaknesses, particularly in interpreting SAXS data, lack of clarity in presentation, and methodological inconsistencies. Critical concerns include high error margins between SAXS profiles and MD fits, unclear validation of oligomeric species in SAXS measurements, and insuHicient quantitative cross-validation between experimental (HDX) and computational data (MD). This reviewer calls for major revisions including clearer definitions, improved methodology, and additional validation, to strengthen the conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the supportive comments, in the revised version of the manuscript we have focused on improving the clarity and completeness of our work. We are sorry for example to not have made previously clear enough that the comparison of SAXS with MD simulation was not that shown in the main text in Figure 1 and Table 1 (this is the comparison with single structures) but that reported in the SI (previously Figure S1 and Table S2, showing very good fits). These data have been moved in the main text in the reworked Figure 2 and new Table 2. We have also improved the presentation of the HDX MS data in Figure 5 and in the text adding also additional analysis in SI. Materials and methods are now completely moved in the main text. We generally revised the manuscript for clarity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This well-written manuscript addresses an important but recalcitrant problem - the molecular mechanism of protein misfolding in Ig light chain (LC) amyloidosis (AL), a major life-threatening form of systemic human amyloidosis. The authors use expertly recorded and analyzed smallangle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data as a restraint for molecular dynamics simulations (called M&amp;M) and to explore six patient-based LC proteins. The authors report that a highly populated &quot;H-state&quot; determined computationally, wherein the two domains in an LC molecule acquire a straight rather than bent conformation, is what distinguishes AL from non-AL LCs. They then use H-D exchange mass spectrometry to verify this conclusion. If confirmed, this is a novel and interesting finding with potentially important translational implications.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Expertly recorded and analyzed SAXS data combined with clever M&amp;M simulations lead to a novel and interesting conclusion. Regardless of whether or not the CL-CL domain interface is destabilized in AL LCs explored in this (Figure 6) and other studies, stabilization of this interface is an excellent idea that may help protect at least a subset of AL LCs from misfolding in amyloid. This idea increases the potential impact of this interesting study.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree, we tried to maximise the size of the sample and this was the best we could do. With respect to the analysis of the mutations, while we tried to discuss some of them also in view of previous works, because our set covers multiple germlines instead than focusing on a single one, this limit our ability to discuss single point mutations systematically, at the same time the discussion of single points mutations has been the focus of many recent works, while our approach provide a diNerent point of view.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>This study provides an investigation of light chains (LCs) using three distinct approaches, focusing primarily on identifying a conformational fingerprint to distinguish amyloidogenic light chains (AL-LCs) from multiple myeloma light chains (MM-LCs). The authors propose that the presence of a low-populated &quot;H state,&quot; characterized by an extended quaternary structure and a perturbed CL-CL interface, is unique to AL-LCs. This finding is validated through hydrogendeuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). The study makes a valuable contribution to understanding the structural dynamics of light chains, particularly with the identification of the H state in AL-LCs. However, significant concerns regarding the interpretation of the SAXS data, clarity in presentation, and methodological rigor must be addressed. I recommend major revisions and resubmission of the work.</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) A critical concern is how the authors ensure that the SAXS profiles represent only dimeric species, given the high propensity of LCs to aggregate. If higher-order aggregates or monomers were present, this would significantly impact the SAXS data and SAXS-MD integration. Some measurements are bulk SAXS, while others are SEC-SAXS, making the study questionable. The authors need to clarify how only dimeric species were measured for the SEC-SAXS analysis, and all assessments of the dimeric state should be shown in the SI. Additionally, complementary techniques such as DLS or SEC-MALS should be used to verify the oligomeric state of the samples. Without this validation, the SAXS profiles may not be reliable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added SEC-MALS and SEC-SAXS data in the SI (Figures S20 and S21) as well the SAXS curves shown in log-log plot (Figure S1) that display a flat trend at low q that exclude aggregation. SAXS is very sensitive to oligomers and aggregates and our data do not indicate the presence of those species. When we had indication of possible aggregation in the sample we used SEC-SAXS.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) A major problem with the paper is that the claim of the &quot;H state,&quot; which is the novelty of the study and serves as a marker of aggregation, is derived from samples where the error between the SAXS profiles and MD fits is extremely high. This casts doubt on whether the structure is indeed resolved by MD. The main conclusion of the paper is derived from weak consistency between experiment and simulation. In AL55, the error between experiment and simulation is greater than 5; for H7, it is higher than 2.8. The residuals show significant error at mid-q values, suggesting that long-range distance correlations (20-10 Å, CL, VL positioning) are not consistent between simulation and experiment. Furthermore, the FES plots of two independent replicas show deviation in the existence of the H state. One shows a minimum in that region, while the other does not. So, how robust is this conclusion? What is the chi-squared value if each replica is used independently? A separate experimental cross-validation is necessary to claim the existence of the H state.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologise for the misunderstanding underlying this reviewer comment. The poor agreement mentioned is not between the SAXS and MD simulations, but with the individual structures, and this disagreement led us to perform MD simulations that are in much better agreement with the data (previously Fig. S1 and Table S2). To avoid this misunderstanding, which would indeed weaken our work, we have now moved both the figure and the table in the main text to the updated Figure 2 and the new Table 2.</p>
<p>Regarding the robustness of the sampling, we believe that Table 3 (previously Table 2) clearly shows the statistical convergence of the data, diNerences in the presentation of the free energy are purely interpolation issues. The chi-squares of each replicate are reported in Table 2 (previously Table S2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) There is insuHicient discussion about SAXS computations from MD trajectories. The accuracy of these calculations is crucial to deriving the existing conclusions, and the study's reliance on the PLUMED plugin, which is known to give inaccurate results for SAXS computations, raises concerns. How the solvent is treated in the SAXS computations needs to be explained. Alternative methods like WAXSiS or Crysol should be explored to check whether the SAXS profiles derived from the MD trajectory are consistent across other SAXS computation methods for the major conformers of the proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now clarified that while the SAXS calculation to perform Metainference MD were done using PLUMED (that to our knowledge is as accurate as crysol) SAXS curves used for analysis were calculated using crysol.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The HDX and MD results do not seem to correlate well, and there is a disconnect between Figure 2 (SAXS profiles) and Figure 5 (HDX structural interpretation). The authors should quantitatively assess residue-level dynamics by comparing HDX signals with MD-derived HDX signals for each protein. This would provide a cross-validation between the experimental and computational data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our opinion our SAXS, MD and HDX MS data provide a consistent picture. Our HDX-MS do not provide per residue data, making a quantitative comparison out of scope. RMSF data do not necessarily need to correlate with the deuterium uptake.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) MD simulations are only used to refine the structure of AlphaFold predictions, but the trajectories could help explain why these structures diHer, what stabilizes the dimer, or what leads to the conformational transition of the H state. A lack of analysis regarding the physical mechanism behind these structural changes is a weakness of the study. The authors should dedicate more eHort to analyzing their data and provide physical insights into why these changes are observed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our aim was to identify a property that could discriminate between AL and MM LCs. We used MD simulations, not to refine structures, but to explore the conformational dynamics of LCs (starting from either X-ray structures, homology or AlphaFold models), because SAXS data suggested that conformational dynamics could discriminate between AL- and MM-LCs. Simulations allowed us to propose a hypothesis, which we tested by HDX MS. While more insight is always welcome, we believe that we have achieved our goal for now. In the discussion, we present additional analysis of the simulations to connect with previous literature, we agree that more analysis can be done, and also for this reason, all our data are publicly available.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor concerns</p>
<p>(6) The abstract leans heavily on describing the problem and methods but lacks a clear presentation of key results. Providing a concise summary of the main findings (e.g., the identification of the H state) would better balance the abstract.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and we rewrote the abstract.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In the abstract, the term &quot;experimental structure&quot; is used ambiguously. Since SAXS also provides an experimental structure, it is unclear what the authors are referring to. This should be clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and we rewrote the abstract.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Abbreviations such as VL (variable domain) and CL (constant domain) are not defined, making it harder for readers unfamiliar with the field to follow. Abbreviations should be defined when first mentioned.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and we rewrote the abstract.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) The introduction provides a good general context but fails to explicitly define the knowledge gap. Specifically, the structural and dynamic determinants of LC amyloidogenicity are not well established, and this study could be framed as addressing that gap.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer and we agree this could be better framed, we improved the introduction accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) The introduction does not present the novel discovery of the H state early enough. The unique contribution of identifying this state as a marker for AL-LCs should be mentioned upfront to guide the reader through the significance of the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer and we have now made more explicit what we found.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) The therapeutic implications of this research should be highlighted more clearly in the discussion. Examples of how these findings could be utilized in drug design or therapeutic approaches would enhance the study's impact.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer, but while we think that the H-state could be targeted for drug design, since we do not have data yet we do not want to stress this point more than what we are already doing.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) There is an overwhelming use of abbreviations such as H3, H7, H18, M7, and M10 without proper introduction. This makes it diHicult for readers to follow the results, and the average reader may become lost in the details. An introductory figure summarizing the sequences under study, along with a schematic of the dimeric structure defining VL and CL domains, would significantly aid comprehension.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and we tried to better introduce the systems and simplify the language without adding a figure that we think would be redundant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) In Figure 1, add labels to each SAXS curve to indicate which protein they correspond to. Also, what does online SEC-SAXS mean?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Done</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(14) The caption of Figure 3 is unclear, particularly with abbreviations like Lb, Ls, G, and H, which are not mentioned in the captions. The authors should define these terms for clarity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Done</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(15) The study claims that the dominant structure of the dimer changes between diHerent LCs. However, Figure 5 shows identical structures for all proteins, raising questions about the consistency between the SAXS and HDX data. This inconsistency is a general problem between the MD and HDX sections, where cross-communication and comparisons are not properly addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not claim that the dominant structure of the dimer changes between diNerent LCs, this would also be in contradiction with current literature. We claim a diNerence in a low-populated state. From this point of view using always the same structure is consistent and should simplify the representation of the results. We agree that the manuscript may be not always easy to follow and we thank the reviewer in helping us improving it.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(16) The authors show I(q) vs q and residuals for each protein. The Kratky plots are not suHicient to compare the SAXS computations with the measured profile.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Showing Kratky and residuals is a standard and complementary way to present and compare SAXS data to structures. Chi-square values are also reported. Log-log plots have been added to SI in response to previous comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(17) The authors need to explain how they estimate the Rg values (from simulation or SAXS profiles). If they are using simulations, they should compute the Rg values from the simulations for comparison.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Rg values reported in Table 1 are derived from SAXS. Rg from simulations have been added in Table 2.</p>

<p>(18) The evolution of the sampling is unclear. The authors need to show the initial starting conformation in each case and the most likely conformation after M&amp;M in the SI, to demonstrate that their approach indeed caused changes in the initial predictions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our approach is not structure refinement and as such the proposed analysis would be misleading. Metainference is meant to generate a statistical ensemble representing the equilibrium conformations that as whole reproduce the data. DiNerences (or not) between initial and selected configurations will not be particularly informative in this context.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(19) The authors should also provide a running average of chi-squared values over time to demonstrate that the conformational ensemble converged toward the SAXS profile.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our simulations are not driven to improve the agreement with SAXS over time, this is not structure refinement. Metainference is meant to generate a statistical ensemble representing the equilibrium conformations that as whole reproduce the data. The suggested analysis would be a misinterpretation of our simulations. The comparison with SAXS is provided in Figure 2 and Table 2 as mentioned above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(20) The aggregate simulation time of 120 microseconds is misleading, as each replica was only run for 2-3 microseconds. This should be clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The number reported in the text is accurate and represent the aggregated sampling. The number of replicas for each metainference simulation and their length is reported in Table 2 now moved for clarity from the SI to main text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(21) It is not clear how the replicas were weighted to compute the SAXS profiles and FES. There are two independent runs in each case, and each run has about 30 replicas. How these replicas are weighted needs to be discussed in the SI.</p>

<p>Done</p>

<p>(22) The methods section is unevenly distributed, with detailed explanations of LC production and purification, while other key methodologies like SAXS+MD integration and HDX are not even mentioned in the main text (they are in the Supporting Information). The authors should provide a brief overview of all methodologies in the main text or move everything to the SI for consistency.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer, all methods are now in main text.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Computational M&amp;M evidence is strong (Figure 3) and is supported by SAXS (used as restraints). However, Kratky plots reported in the main MS Figure 1 show significant diHerences between the data and the structural model only for one protein, AL-55. It is hard for the general reader to see how these SAXS data support a clear diHerence between AL and non-AL proteins. If possible, please strengthen the evidence; if not, soften the conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. The chi-square (Table 1) and the residuals (Figure 1) are a strong indication of the diNerence. To strengthen the evidence, following also the comment from reviewer 3 we calculated the p-value (&lt;10<sup>-5</sup>) on the significance of the radius of gyration to discriminate AL and MM LCs. We agree that SAXS alone was not enough and this is indeed what prompted us to perform MD simulations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) HDX MS results are cursory and not very convincing as presented. The butterfly plots in Figure 5 are too small to read and are unlabeled so it is unclear which protein is which.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 5 has been reworked for readability. More data have been added in SI.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) What labeling time was selected to construct these plots and why?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The deuterium uptakes at 30 min HDX time showed the most pronounced diNerences between diNerent proteins, which were chosen to illustrate the key structural features in the main figure panel (Figure 5).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>How diHerent are the results at other labeling times? Showing uptake curves (with errors) for more than just two peptides in the supplement Figure S12 might be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We found a continuous increase in deuterium uptake as we increased the exchange time from 0.5 to 240 min, which reached saturation at 120 min. Therefore, the exchange follows the same pattern at all time points. Butterfly plots at diNerent HDX times of 0.5 to 240 min are shown in gradient of light blue to dark blue which clearly shows the pattern of deuterium uptake at increasing incubation times (Figure 5). The HDX uptake kinetics of selected peptides with corresponding error bars are shown in Figure S12.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>How redundant are the data, i.e. how good is the peptide coverage/resolution in key regions at the domain-domain interface that the authors deem important? Mapping the maximal deuterium uptake on the structures in Figure 5 is not very helpful. Perhaps mapping the whole range of uptake using a gradient color scheme would be more informative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Overall coverage and redundancy for all four proteins are&gt; 90% and &gt; 4.0, respectively, with an average error margin in fractional uptake among all peptides is 0.04-0.05 Da, which suggests that our data is reliable (<bold>Table S3</bold>). We modified the main panel figures showing the gradient of deuterium uptake in blue-white-red for 0 to 30% of deuterium uptake on the chain A of the dimeric LCs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Is the conformational heterogeneity depicted in M&amp;M simulations consistent with HDX results? The authors may want to address this by looking at the EX1/EX2 exchange kinetics for AL vs. non-AL proteins. Do AL proteins show more EX1?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>No, we don’t see any EX1 exchange kinetics in our analysis. This is compatible with the prediction of the H-state that is a native like state and not an unfolded/partially folded state.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Perhaps the main conclusion could be softened given the small number of proteins (six), esp. since only four (3 AL and 1 non-AL) could be explored by HDX. Are other HDX MS data of AL LCs from the same Lambda6 family (e.g. PMID: 34678302) consistent with the conclusions that a particular domain-domain interface is weakened in AL vs. non-AL LCs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestions. A diNerence in HDX MS data is indeed visible between AL and MM proteins for peptide 33-47 in the suggested paper (Figures 4, S5 and S8). The diNerence is reduced by the mutation identified in the paper as driving the aggregation in that specific case. We now mention this in the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Please clarify if the H* state is the same for a covalent vs. non-covalent LC dimer.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not know because our data are only for covalent dimers. But, interestingly, the state is very similar to what was observed for a model kappa light-chain in Weber, et al., we have better highlighted this point in the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Please try and better explain why a smaller distance between CL domains in H7 protein and a larger distance in other AL proteins both promote protein misfolding.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not have elements to discuss this point in more detail.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Please comment on the Kratky plots data vs. model agreement (see comments above).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Done.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Please find a better way to display, describe, and interpret the HD exchange MS data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have generated new main text (new Figure 5) and SI figures that we think allow the reader to better appreciated our observations. Corresponding results sections have been also improved.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>(9) Is the population of the H-state with perturbed CL-CL domain interface, which was obtained in M&amp;M simulations, suHicient to be observable by HDX MS?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While populations alone are not enough to determine what is observable by HDX MS, a 10% population correspond roughly to 6 kJ/mol of ΔG and is compatible with EX2 kinetics. Previous works suggested that HDX-MS data should be sensitive to subpopulations of the order of 10%, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2020.02.005">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2020.02.005</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c06148">https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c06148</ext-link>)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) Typically, an excited intermediate in protein unfolding is a monomer, while here it is an LC dimer. Is this unusual?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a good point, we think that intermediates have mostly been studied on monomeric proteins because these are more commonly used as model systems, but we do not feel like discussing this point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) Low deuterium uptake is consistent with a rigid structure but may also reflect buried structure and/or structure that moves on a time scale greater than the labeling time.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The p-value (statistical significance) of Rg diHerence should be computed.</p>
