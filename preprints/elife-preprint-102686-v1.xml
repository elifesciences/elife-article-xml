<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Understanding bacterial behavior in confined environments is crucial for elucidating microbial ecology and developing strategies to manage bacterial infections. While extensive research has focused on bacterial motility on surfaces and in porous media, chemotaxis in confined spaces remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the chemotaxis of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> within microfluidic lanes under a linear concentration gradient of L-aspartate. We demonstrate that <italic>E. coli</italic> exhibits significantly enhanced chemotaxis in lanes with sidewalls compared to open surfaces, primarily due to cells aligning and swimming along the right sidewalls. By varying lane widths, we identify that an 8 μm width—approximating the radius of bacterial circular swimming on surfaces—maximizes chemotactic drift velocity. These results are supported by both experimental observations and stochastic simulations, establishing a clear proportional relationship between optimal lane width and the radius of bacterial circular swimming. Further geometric analysis provides an intuitive understanding of this phenomenon. Our results offer new insights into bacterial navigation in complex biological environments such as host tissues and biofilms, shedding light on microbial ecology in confined habitats and suggesting new avenues for controlling bacterial infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Microorganisms inhabit a variety of complex confined environments. Sperm swimming in the reproductive tract of a female animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), bacteria navigating through host cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), cells moving in the wrinkle of biofilm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), and swarm cells maneuvering in crowded cell clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) are all examples of organisms operating in geometrically confined environments. Furthermore, many diseases have been found to be related to bacterial motion in confinement, such as urinary tract infections and neonatal sepsis.</p>
<p>Previous research has explored the motion of bacteria in confined environments. Studies have shown that flagellated bacteria tend to accumulate near both solid-liquid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) and air-liquid interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), and exhibit a specific direction of circular swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). For example, <italic>E. coli</italic> swim clockwise when observed from above a solid surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Moreover, Tang <italic>et al</italic>. found that flagellated bacteria orbit within the thin fluid film around micrometer-sized particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Bacteria also display different motion behaviors in porous media and tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), as well as in other types of confinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>E. coli</italic> can sense and move in chemical gradients through a set of chemotactic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). The transmembrane chemoreceptors detect attractants or repellents and transmit signals into the cell by changing the concentration of the response regulator protein CheY-P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). CheY-P binds to the cytoplasmic domain of flagellar motors, altering the probability of their clockwise rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Clockwise and counterclockwise rotations of motors lead to reorientation (tumble) and smooth swimming (run) modes of the cell body, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). The adaptation enzymes CheR and CheB(p) methylate and demethylate the receptors, respectively, facilitating adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has shown that bacterial chemotactic drift velocity decreases sharply near sample chamber surfaces compared to bulk liquid, a phenomenon attributed to circular cell movement at these interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). This observation suggests that surface effects can significantly impair bacterial chemotactic performance. However, a study of chemotaxis in two-dimensional bacterial swarms on semisolid agar surfaces has demonstrated that <italic>E. coli</italic> can exhibit effective chemotaxis in attractant gradients, especially at high cell densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). This apparent contradiction is likely due to cell-cell interactions mitigating surface effects in dense populations. While previous studies have investigated bacterial motility in confined environments, especially under surface effects, research on chemotaxis under these conditions remains limited.</p>
<p>Here, we study the chemotaxis of <italic>E. coli</italic> on surfaces within lanes of different widths, exposed to a linear concentration gradient of L-aspartate using a hydrogel-based microfluidic device. Our findings reveal enhanced chemotactic performance in the presence of sidewalls compared to their absence. Cells in the middle area (MA) exhibited no drift and did not contribute to overall chemotaxis. However, cells near the left sidewall (LSW) and right sidewall (RSW) demonstrated negative and positive drift, respectively, with the positive drift velocity from the RSW exceeding the negative drift velocity from the LSW.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by comparing lanes of different widths within the same stable linear gradient field, we observed that cells exhibited the highest drift velocity in 8 μm-wide lanes, which approximates the peak value in the distribution of circular swimming radii on surfaces. This optimal width for maximal chemotaxis resulted from the largest percentage of cells occupying the right sidewalls. Stochastic simulations of bacterial chemotaxis corroborated that the optimized lane width varies with the bacteria’s circular swimming radius. Our findings have important implications for the screening of swimming organisms and the study of chemotactic behavior in real-world scenarios.</p>

<title>Chemotaxis of <italic>E. coli</italic> within lane confinements</title>
<p>To study bacterial chemotaxis in confined environments such as tubes or interstitial tissues, we developed a hydrogel-based microfluidic device featuring lanes of different widths. The device design, illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, incorporates two 2% (w/v) agarose walls inserted between three main channels: a sink channel, a cell channel, and a source channel. These walls prevent cell passage while allowing chemical diffusion. The agarose walls and main channels measure 100 μm and 400 μm in width, respectively, with the device having a depth of 30 μm.</p>

</fig>
<p>We established a linear concentration gradient (0.05 μM/μm) of L-aspartate, an attractant sensed by the Tar receptor, by flowing motility medium through the sink channel and 50 μM L-aspartate solution (prepared in motility medium) through the source channel at a constant rate of 10 μL/min. The resulting gradient across the cell channel is depicted in <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>.</p>
<p>The lanes of various widths were created using parallel PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) pillars spaced at different distances. Each lane, approximately 160 μm in length, is highlighted by a yellow rectangular box in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>. <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, confined to the cell channel, sensed the attractant gradient and performed chemotaxis within these lanes of different widths.</p>
<p>To enhance imaging contrast, we introduced a plasmid expressing mCherry fluorescent protein (pTrc99a-mcherry) into wild-type <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> HCB1, denoting it as HCB1-pTrc99a-mcherry. A high-sensitivity CMOS camera was used to record bacterial movement trajectories on the bottom surfaces of the lanes in the cell channel, where most cells accumulate.</p>
<p>We recorded the movement of HCB1-pTrc99a-mcherry cells on the liquid-glass surface of a 44-μm-wide lane with and without a L-aspartate concentration gradient, respectively. An example video is shown in Movie S1, and several representative trajectories are illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>.</p>
<p>We then calculated the drift velocities <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> of the trajectories from both assays along the <italic>x</italic>-direction (up-gradient) by fitting the relation ⟨<italic>x</italic>(<italic>i+n</italic>)−<italic>x</italic>(<italic>i</italic>)⟩∼<italic>n</italic>Δ<italic>t</italic>(<italic>n</italic>=1, 3, 5, …, 39) with a linear function, the slope of which is the drift velocity. Here, <italic>x</italic>(<italic>i</italic>) represents the cell’s <italic>x</italic>-position in the <italic>i</italic>-th frame, and Δ<italic>t</italic> denotes the time interval between two frames (0.05 s). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, the drift velocity <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> was 1.6±0.3 μm/s and 0.2±0.2 μm/s (mean±SD) for the gradient and control (no-gradient) assays, respectively. Thus, bacteria in the L-aspartate gradient exhibited obvious chemotaxis on the lane surfaces, contrasting with previous findings on liquid-solid surfaces without sidewalls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>The cells in the right sidewall region dominated the chemotaxis of <italic>E. coli</italic> within lane confinements</title>
<p>To elucidate the mechanism of bacterial chemotaxis within lane confinements, we analyzed cell trajectories, identifying three distinct motion states due to the presence of sidewalls. As illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, cells exhibited straight-line swimming along sidewalls, movement towards or away from sidewalls, or circular swimming. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> displays three representative trajectories.

where <italic>θ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is the angle between the swimming direction and the positive <italic>x</italic>-axis direction at time <italic>t, τ</italic> is the lag time, <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> is a constant, and <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> is the rotational exponent. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> shows the <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> values for the three trajectories in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, while <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> illustrates the relationship between <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> and average <italic>y</italic>-coordinate. Trajectories further from sidewalls exhibit larger <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub>, indicating more curved paths, while <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> decreases sharply as the cells approach sidewalls, representing straighter trajectories.</p>
<p>We also analyzed tumble kinematics for cells swimming along and away from sidewalls. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2F</xref> show normalized tumble angle distributions for cells in sidewalls (SW) and middle areas (MA), respectively. Red solid lines represent exponential function fits <italic>y</italic> = <italic>a</italic> * exp(<italic>x</italic>/<italic>b</italic>), with fitted <italic>b</italic> values of 0.25 rad (SW) and 1.35 rad (MA). Consistent with previous reports, we observed a higher occurrence of large reorientation angles for surface-swimming cells in the MA region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Interestingly, we also found large tumble angles in the SW region, albeit with a smaller characteristic angle than in the MA region. Movie S2 demonstrates an example of a large reorientation angle during tumbling.</p>
<p>Given the strong spatial dependence of trajectory characteristics, we classified the cells into three distinct populations. The distribution of cells along the <italic>y</italic>-axis is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>. Based on mean distances from the sidewalls, we divided the lane into three areas (viewing along the positive <italic>x</italic>-axis): the left sidewall (LSW), the middle area (MA), and the right sidewall (RSW). As shown by different shaded colors in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2G</xref>, we defined cells in LSW, RSW and MA for trajectories with ⟨<italic>y</italic>⟩ ≤ <italic>d</italic>, ⟨<italic>y</italic>⟩ ≥ <italic>w</italic> − <italic>d</italic>, and <italic>d</italic> &lt; ⟨<italic>y</italic>⟩ &lt; <italic>w</italic> − <italic>d</italic>, respectively. The threshold <italic>d</italic> was set at 3 µm (approximately the average length of a cell body), and <italic>w</italic> represents the lane width. The proportion of trajectories in different regions is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>. For the gradient assay, the probabilities of trajectories being in LSW, MA and RSW regions were 0.20 ± 0.01, 0.59 ± 0.02, and 0.21 ± 0.03, respectively. In the control assay without gradient, these values were 0.18 ± 0.03, 0.70 ± 0.03, and 0.12 ± 0.01, respectively.</p>
<p>We then compared the drift velocity of cells in the three areas separately for both gradient and control assays. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>, cells in the LSW region tended to display a negative drift with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="615998v1_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and -5.0 ± 2.0μm/s for gradient and control assays, respectively. Cells in the MA region exhibited minimal drift with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="615998v1_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and 0.4 ± 0.6 μm/s for gradient and control assays, respectively. Cells in the RSW region displayed a typical positive drift with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="615998v1_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> μm/s and 6.2 ± 1.9 μm/s for gradient and control assays, respectively. Thus, cells in the RSW region dominated the difference in drift velocity between the two assays.</p>
<p>In summary, cells swim on the right-hand side under the effect of the bottom surface of lanes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). The LSW and RSW cells swim down and up the gradient, respectively, while MA cells swim in circles without any drift. RSW cells demonstrated more persistent swimming towards the attractant in the L-aspartate gradient, exhibiting a higher positive drift velocity. Detailed information on the difference in drift velocity between LSW and RSW cells can be found in the supplemental materials. Notably, the attractant gradient minimally affects the ratio of bacteria in different regions.</p>

<title>The dependence of chemotactic performance on lane width</title>
<p>Having established that <italic>E. coli</italic> chemotaxis on lane surfaces is closely related to sidewall confinement, we investigated chemotaxis in lanes of different widths to mimic bacterial chemotactic behavior in interstitial tissues or tubes of varying sizes. We compared five lanes with widths of 6 μm, 8 μm, 10 μm, 25 μm, and 44 μm. Drift velocity was calculated using the same method as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, with results shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>. The mean drift velocities were 1.8 ± 1.3 μm/s, 7.5 ± 1.4 μm/s, 4.6 ± 1.7 μm/s, 2.5 ± 0.5 μm/s, and 2.6 ± 0.4 μm/s for lanes of width 6 μm, 8 μm, 10 μm, 25 μm, and 44 μm, respectively. Bacteria exhibited optimal chemotaxis (highest drift velocity) in lanes that were 8 μm wide.</p>

<p>Noting that this optimal width is of the same order of magnitude as the radius of bacterial circular swimming on a solid surface, we measured the radius of circular swimming for cells in the MA region. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, the peak radius in the distribution of circular swimming radii is ∼10 μm, which is close to the lane width supporting optimal chemotaxis.</p>
<p>It has been reported that bacteria swimming in capillaries of different radii possess different swimming speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Therefore, we calculated the cell swimming speeds for all lane widths. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, swimming speed remains relatively constant across different lane widths. This indicates that the optimized chemotaxis is not a result of varying swimming speeds.</p>

<title>The optimal chemotaxis resulted from more cells moving towards the attractant along the right sidewall</title>
<p>To identify the underlying mechanism of optimal lane width for chemotaxis, we evaluated the drift velocity for cells in the LSW, MA, and RSW regions separately. The results are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>. Cells in the MA region did not exhibit effective drift, while LSW and RSW cells demonstrated negative and positive drift, respectively, consistent with the findings in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>. The drift velocity for RSW cells increased with lane width, and remained relatively constant above a lane width of 8 μm, thus not exhibiting a highest value in the 8 μm-wide lanes. Therefore, the width-dependent optimal chemotaxis is not attributable to an optimal drift velocity for RSW cells.</p>

<p>We then sought a comparison of cell proportions in the three areas, as plotted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>. The proportion of cells in the MA region increased gradually with lane width due to the increase in area. Notably, the largest proportion of RSW cells appears in the 8 μm-wide lane.

<p>To further investigate changes in up- and down-gradient cell numbers in the RSW region, we calculated the proportion of RSW-UG (cells swimming up-gradient in the RSW) and RSW-DG (cells swimming down-gradient in the RSW) cells.

<title>Simulation of <italic>E. coli</italic> chemotaxis within lane confinements</title>
<p>To explore the relationship between the circular swimming of bacteria on lane surfaces and optimal chemotaxis, we simulated two-dimensional chemotaxis of bacteria with varying circular swimming radii on lanes of different widths in a steady linear gradient of L-aspartate.</p>
<p>In our simulation, cells were treated as self-propelled particles performing a random walk in a run-and-tumble mode within a two-dimensional space. Cells could be in either a run or tumble state, determined by the intracellular chemotaxis signal. During a run, cells swam smoothly at a constant speed of 20 μm/s. The effect of the bottom surface on bacterial swimming was modeled by adding a directional bias term to the swimming direction:

<title>Discussions</title>
<p>Bacterial behavior in confined environments differs significantly from that in free environments. Previous studies have reported that cells tend to swim in circles and accumulate near a solid-liquid interface, leading to diminished chemotaxis. However, recent research on chemotaxis of swarm cells suggests that crowded environments may enhance bacterial chemotaxis on surfaces. In this study, we examined the chemotaxis of <italic>E. coli</italic> on the bottom surface of microfluidic lanes, exploring the effects of lane confinement on bacterial chemotaxis.</p>
<p>We found that in the presence of sidewalls, cells that would otherwise have been unable to exhibit chemotaxis showed significant chemotactic behavior in a linear gradient of L-aspartate. Cells in different regions of the lanes demonstrated distinct motion behaviors. In the MA region, cells showed no drift, similar to observations in chemotaxis near surfaces. Conversely, cells exhibited positive and negative drift when in the RSW and LSW regions, respectively.</p>
<p>Further investigation into chemotaxis in lanes of varying widths demonstrated that cells exhibited the highest chemotactic drift velocity in lanes that were 8 μm wide. This width is close to the radius of bacterial swimming circles. By analyzing the proportion and drift velocity of cells in different regions, we determined that this optimal lane width was primarily due to the higher proportion of cells swimming up-gradient along the right sidewall.</p>
<p>To explore the relationship between chemotactic drift velocity and circular swimming radius of bacteria, we conducted systematic simulations of <italic>E. coli</italic> chemotaxis with different circular swimming radii in lanes of varying widths under a linear concentration gradient of L-aspartate. We found that optimal chemotaxis occurred when the swimming radius was close to the lane width, with <italic>w</italic> = 0.66<italic>r</italic>. This suggests a significant proportional relationship between the optimal lane width for chemotaxis and the circular swimming radius of bacteria.</p>
<p>To elucidate the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we employed geometric analysis. We demonstrated that bacteria in lanes could swim up-gradient in the RSW with maximal probability when the lane width was 0.7-0.8 times the radius of circular swimming. This finding is consistent with the experimental results presented in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>.</p>
<p>Our findings have important implications for the screening of single-celled swimming organisms and the study of restricted chemotactic behavior. This research provides insights into how confinement affects bacterial chemotaxis and may inform the design of microfluidic devices for bacterial manipulation and analysis.</p>
<p>Bacteria frequently inhabit confined spaces such as soil pores, sediment interstices, rock crevices, biological tissues, and hydrogels. In these constrained environments, bacterial behavior often deviates significantly from that observed in unconfined conditions, typically resulting in reduced chemotactic ability. However, our findings challenge this notion, suggesting that certain types of environmental confinement may actually enhance bacterial chemotaxis. This discovery could contribute to our understanding of microbial ecology across various habitats, including soil, oceans, and the human body.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these insights could have potential applications. In biotechnology, optimizing confinement conditions could improve the efficiency of bioremediation processes or the production of microbial products. In medicine, understanding how pathogens navigate confined spaces within the body could lead to novel strategies for preventing or treating infections.</p>

<title>Microfluidic device design and fabrication</title>
<p>A hydrogel-based microfluidic device containing lanes of different width was designed using L-edit based on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). The silicon mold with the positive relief features was fabricated using the standard soft lithography technique performed in our laboratory. Firstly, a 4-inch diameter silicon wafer was spin washed sequentially using water, acetone, methanol and isopropanol. The wafer was thoroughly dried on a 150 °C hot plate to ensure that organics has volatilized completely. Then, the wafer was treated with air plasma (Harrick plasma, PDC-002, 30W) for 10 min before the SU-8 2025 photoresist (Microchem) was spin-coated according to the products protocols. The spin-coated wafer was placed on a hot plate at 65°C for 3 min followed by 6 min at 95°C, then exposed to UV light using a maskless lithography machine (Heidelberg, μMLA) at 800 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> with defocus was set to 0. The post-exposure bake was performed at 65°C for 2 min followed by 6 min at 95°C. Development procedure lasted about 6 minutes with constant shaking in the SU-8 developer. The wafer was rinsed with fresh developer followed by isopropanol. Finally, an approximately 30-μm-high photoresist layer was created as the master mold. The mold was fixed on a glass petri dish using double-sided tape.</p>
<p>Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and curing agent was mixed with a 10:1 ratio (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min to remove air bubbles. The mixture was poured over the mold in glass petri dish and then placed at 4°C for an hour to avoid interference from very small air bubbles. The PDMS was cured at 80°C for 3 h, then separated from the wafer and cut into pieces, and holes were punched for inlets and outlets. The punched PDMS was cleaned with adhesive tape. The cleaned PDMS was bonded to a glass slide after air plasma treatment (Harrick plasma, PDC-002, 30W). The fabricated device was baked at 80°C overnight to establish covalent bonding.</p>
<p>The hydrogel agarose was used at 2% (w/v) concentration in motility medium to create diffusion-permeable walls. Agarose was slowly injected through the inlet port using a syringe pump at a constant flow rate of 2 µL/min, and the injection process was carried out in a drying oven at a constant temperature of 68 °C.</p>

During a tumble, cells stop swimming and a tumble angle is selected from the distribution that we have measured. Cells will swim along the sidewalls for 2 s (the average dwell time from <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>), then escape from it with an angle selected from <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>.

<title>Explanation of difference in drift velocity between LSW and RSW cells</title>
<p>We observed obvious chemotaxis of <italic>E. coli</italic> on the surface of lanes, closely related to cells swimming along sidewalls. As shown in <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>, cells swimming along sidewalls in an attractant gradient can be divided into four states: Cells on the right sidewall swimming up-gradient (RSW-UG), cells on the right sidewall swimming down-gradient (RSW-DG), cells on the left sidewall swimming up-gradient (LSW-UG), and cells on the left sidewall swimming down-gradient (LSW-DG). These cells can escape from sidewalls with rates:
<disp-formula id="ueqn19">
<graphic xlink:href="615998v1_ueqn19.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>B</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>B</italic><sup>−</sup> represent the probability of tumble when cells swim up-gradient and down-gradient, respectively, and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> denote the escape rates during tumble and run, respectively. Cells swimming on the sidewalls experience a force <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> from the bottom surface, causing them to swim to the right. RSW-UG and LSW-DG cells can swim away from the sidewalls via tumble, while RSW-DG and LSW-UG cells can escape via tumble or run. The gradient field direction ensures that 0 ≤ <italic>B</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> &lt; <italic>B</italic><sup>−</sup> ≤ 1.</p>
<p>Dwell times for the four states are plotted in <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>, suggesting that <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>RSW</italic>−<italic>UG</italic></sub> &gt; <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>LSW</italic>−<italic>DG</italic></sub> &gt; <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>RSW</italic>−<italic>DG</italic></sub> &gt; <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>LSW</italic>−<italic>UG</italic></sub>. Thus, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> &gt; <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub> &gt; 0.</p>
<p>The drift velocity for cells on right and left sidewall can be calculated as:

where <italic>v</italic><sub>0</sub> represents the swimming speed.

<p>This article deals with the chemotactic behavior of E coli bacteria in thin channels (a situation close to 2D). It combines experiments and simulations.</p>
<p>The authors show experimentally that, in 2D, bacteria swim up a chemotactic gradient much more effectively when they are in the presence of lateral walls. Systematic experiments identify an optimum for chemotaxis for a channel width of ~8µm, close to the average radius of the circle trajectories of the unconfined bacteria in 2D. It is known that these circles are chiral and impose that the bacteria swim preferentially along the right-side wall when there is no chemotactic gradient. In the presence of a chemotactic gradient, this larger proportion of bacteria swimming on the right wall yields chemotaxis. This effect is backed by numerical simulations and a geometrical analysis.</p>
<p>If the conclusions drawn from the experiments presented in this article seem clear and interesting, I find that the key elements of the mechanism of this wall-directed chemotaxis are not sufficiently emphasized. Moreover, the paper would be clearer with more details on the hypotheses and the essential ingredients of the analyses.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors investigated the chemotaxis of E. coli swimming close to the bottom surface in gradients of attractant in channels of increasingly smaller width but fixed height = 30 µm and length ~160 µm. In relatively large channels, they find that on average the cells drift in response to the gradient, despite cells close to the surface away from the walls being known to not be chemotactic because they swim in circles.</p>
<p>They find that this average drift is due to the cell localization close to the side walls, where they slide along the wall. Whereas the bacteria away from the walls have no chemotaxis (as shown before), the ones on the left side wall go down-gradient on average, but the ones on the right side wall go up-gradient faster, hence the average drift. They then study the effect of reducing channel width. They find that chemotaxis is higher in channels with a width of about 8 µm, which approximately corresponds to the radius of the circular swimming R. This higher chemotactic drift is concomitant to an increased density of cells on the RSW. They do simulations and modeling to suggest that the disruption of circular swimming upon collision with the wall increases the density of cells on the RSW, with a maximal effect at w = ~ 2/3 R, which is a good match for their experiments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The overall result that confinement at the edge stabilises bacterial motion and allows chemotaxis is very interesting although not entirely unexpected. It is also important for understanding bacterial motility and chemotaxis under ecologically relevant conditions, where bacteria frequently swim under confinement (although its relevance for controlling infections could be questioned). The experimental part of the study is nicely supported by the model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Several points of this study, in particular the interpretation of the width effect, need better clarification:</p>
<p>(1) Context:</p>
<p>There are a number of highly relevant previous publications that should have been acknowledged and discussed in relation to the current work:</p>

<p>(2) Experimental setup:</p>
<p>a) The channels are built with asymmetric entrances (Figure 1), which could trigger a ratchet effect (because bacteria swim in circle) that could bias the rate at which cells enter into the channel, and which side they follow preferentially, especially for the narrow channel. Since the channel is short (160 µm), that would reflect on the statistics of cell distribution. Controls with straight entrances or with a reversed symmetry of the channel need to be performed to ensure that the reported results are not affected by this asymmetry.</p>
<p>b) The authors say the motile bacteria accumulate mostly at the bottom surface. This is strange, for a small height of 30 µm, the bacteria should be more-or-less evenly spread between the top and bottom surface. How can this be explained?</p>
<p>c) At the edge, some of the bacteria could escape up in the third dimension (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1039/c5sm00939a">http://doi.org/10.1039/c5sm00939a</ext-link>). What is the magnitude of this phenomenon in the current setup? Does it have an effect?</p>
<p>d) What is the cell density in the device? Should we expect cell-cell interactions to play a role here? If not, I would suggest to de-emphasize the connection to chemotaxis in the swarming paper in the introduction and discussion, which doesn't feel very relevant here, and rather focus on the other papers mentioned in point 1.</p>
<p>e) We are not entirely convinced by the interpretation of the results in narrow channels. What is the causal relationship between the increased density on the RSW and the higher chemotactic drift? The authors seem to attribute higher drift to this increased RSW density, which emerges due to the geometric reasons. But if there is no initial bias, the same geometric argument would induce the same increased density of down-gradient swimmers on the LSW, and so, no imbalance between RSW and LSW density. Could it be the opposite that the increased RSW density results from chemotaxis (and maybe reinforces it), not the other way around? Confinement could then deplete one wall due to the proximity of the other, and/or modify the swimming pattern - 8 µm is very close to the size of the body + flagellum. To clarify this point, we suggest measuring the bacterial distributions in the absence of a gradient for all channel widths as a control.</p>
<p>(3) Simulations:</p>
<p>The simulations treat the wall interaction very crudely. We would suggest treating it as a mechanical object that exerts elastic or &quot;hard sphere&quot; forces and torques on the bacteria for more realistic modeling. Notably, the simulations have a constant (chemotaxis independent) rate of wall escape by tumbling. We would expect that reduced tumbling due to up-gradient motility induces a longer dwell time at the wall.</p>

<p>This paper addresses through experiment and simulation the combined effects of bacterial circular swimming near no-slip surfaces and chemotaxis in simple linear gradients. The authors have constructed a microfluidic device in which a gradient of L-aspartate is established to which bacteria respond while swimming while confined in channels of different widths. There is a clear effect that the chemotactic drift velocity reaches a maximum in channel widths of about 8 microns, similar in size to the circular orbits that would prevail in the absence of side walls. Numerical studies of simplified models confirm this connection.</p>
<p>The experimental aspects of this study are well executed. The design of the microfluidic system is clever in that it allows a kind of &quot;multiplexing&quot; in which all the different channel widths are available to a given sample of bacteria.</p>
<p>While the data analysis is reasonably convincing, I think that the authors could make much better use of what must be voluminous data on the trajectories of cells by formulating the mathematical problem in terms of a suitable Fokker-Planck equation for the probability distribution of swimming directions. In particular, I would like to see much more analysis of how incipient circular trajectories are interrupted by collisions with the walls and how this relates to enhanced chemotaxis. In essence, there needs to be a much clearer control analysis of trajectories without sidewalls to understand the mechanism in their presence.</p>
<p>The authors argue that these findings may have relevance to a number of physiological and ecological contexts. Yet, each of these would be characterized by significant heterogeneity in pore sizes and geometries, and thus it is very unclear whether or how the findings in this work would carry over to those situations.</p>
