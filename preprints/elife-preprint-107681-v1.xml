<title>Abstract</title><p>Big-conductance, Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ (BK) channels consist of Ca²⁺- and voltage-sensing, pore-forming α (BKα) subunits and regulatory auxiliary β or γ subunits. Concatenated subunit constructs are powerful tools for elucidating subunit stoichiometry in ion channel gating and regulation, allowing control over subunit arrangement, stoichiometry, and mutation. However, the additional S0 transmembrane segment in BKα places its N- and C-termini on opposite sides of the membrane, preventing tandem BK channel subunit construction by conventional methods. To investigate the atypical “all-or-none” modulatory function of γ subunits and the subunit stoichiometry of BK channel gating, we developed concatenated constructs containing 2 or 4 BKα subunits by splicing them into modular forms that can be co-expressed to form functional channels. These constructs retained voltage and Ca²⁺ gating properties similar to intact BK channels. By fusing the LRRC26 (γ1) subunit to the N-terminus of tandem BKα constructs, we found that a single γ1 subunit per BKα tetramer is sufficient to fully modulate the channel. Furthermore, the L312A mutation in the deep pore region exhibited a stoichiometrically graded effect on voltage-gated BK channel activation. In contrast, a V288A mutation at the selectivity filter induced channel inactivation only when present in all four BKα subunits. Thus, by engineering concatenated BKα constructs, we identified three distinct stoichiometric modes of BK channel gating control by LRRC26, the pore, and the selectivity filter. This study offers new molecular tools and advances our understanding of subunit stoichiometry in BK channel gating and modulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The big-conductance, calcium- and voltage-activated K<sup>+</sup> (BK) channel is a unique member of the potassium channel family, characterized by exceptionally large single-channel conductance and dual regulation by membrane voltage and intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The BK channel is a homotetramer composed of four identical pore-forming, Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and voltage-sensing α (BKα) subunits (∼130 kDa) and variable auxiliary subunits. BK channels exhibit prominent features in molecular architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) and allosteric gating mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). In the transmembrane (TM) domains, BK channels differ from most voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> (Kv) channels by possessing an extra S0 TM helix, lacking domain swapping between the S1-S4 voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and the S5-S6 pore-gate domain (PGD), and exhibiting tight VSD-PGD packing via extensive S4-S5 interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). The BKα subunit also contains a large cytosolic C-terminus composed of two tandem RCK domains (RCK1, RCK2) responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). The RCK domains from all BKα subunits assemble into a tetrameric two-layer gating ring that expands and shifts toward the membrane in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> bindings, leading to S6 movement and channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>).</p>
<p>BK channel function is regulated by auxiliary β and γ subunits and by LINGO1, conferring tissue-specific gating and pharmacological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). The four γ subunits (γ1-γ4), also known as LRRC26, LRRC52, LRRC55, and LRRC38, are leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). The γ subunits facilitate BK channel activation by shifting the voltage dependence of channel activation in the hyperpolarizing direction by ∼140 mV (γ1), 100 mV (γ2), 50 mV (γ3), and 20 mV (γ4), in terms of half-maximal activation voltage (V<sub>1/2</sub>) in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The γ1 subunit likely modulates BK channels by enhancing the allosteric coupling between VSD activation and the pore opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). All γ subunits share a common topology, including an N-terminal signal peptide, an extracellular LRR domain, a single TM segment, and a short intracellular C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Their modulatory effects on BK channel voltage gating are mainly determined by the TM segments and C-terminal clusters of positively charged residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), while the LRR domains regulate the γ subunits’ expression and surface trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Recent cryo-EM structures of BKα/γ1 complexes show that the LRRC26’s TM segment binds peripherally to the BKα VSD, involving S0, S2, S3, and pre-S1 helices, while the LRR domains tetramerizes extracellularly without directly contacting BKα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>
<p>A fundamental question in ion channel gating and regulation is the structural and functional subunit stoichiometry. BK channel modulation by the γ subunits exhibits an atypical binary “all-or-none” phenotype: voltage-dependence (V<sub>1/2</sub>) is either fully shifted or unchanged under limited γ1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). In tetrameric ion channels, auxiliary proteins typically follow 4-fold symmetry, producing graded modulation based on subunit stoichiometry relative to the pore-forming principal subunit, as observed with BK β subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), KCNE subunits on KCNQ channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), and KChIP subunits on Kv4 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Consistent with previous reports detecting up to four γ1 subunits per channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), Cryo-EM structures also show a symmetric presence of four γ1 subunits in BKα/γ1 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). However, single-channel recordings using a β2-γ1 chimeric subunit suggest that even a single γ1 subunit is sufficient for full modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). It is of note that the evidence remains inconclusive due to several limitations: the chimeric construct lacks the LRR domain, which may influence γ1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>); the inferred subunit number is indirectly based on the β2 N-terminal blockade effect; and the sample size in number of channels is limited by the single-channel recording method. Moreover, given the largely independent impact of the individual VSDs to BK channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) and the symmetric presence of γ1 near all VSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), an alternative concerted “all-subunits-required” model, involving extracellular LRR domain tetramerization, has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Therefore, direct biochemical determination of the functional stoichiometry of γ1 in BK channel modulation is needed.</p>
<p>Concatenated subunit constructs with 2 or 4 channel subunits fused together in a C-to-N-terminal arrangement have been powerful tools for dissecting subunit stoichiometry and cooperativity in various voltage- and/or ligand-gated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). However, the additional S0 segment in BKα prevents straightforward concatenation, as its N- and C-termini reside on opposite sides of the membrane. BK channels, owing to their unique biophysical properties, serve as a value model for studying allosteric gating mechanisms of multimodal ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Yet, the unavailability of functional BKα concatemers has hindered precise stoichiometric investigations of channel gating and modulation at both intra- and inter-subunit levels.</p>
<p>To address this, we engineered modular BKα constructs that reassemble into functional concatenated channels with biophysical properties comparable to intact BK channels. Using these, we demonstrate that a single γ1 subunit per BKα tetramer is sufficient to fully modulate the channel. Given the central role of the PGD in BK channel gating, we further applied this system to mutational analyses of the deep pore and selectivity filter. We revealed distinct stoichiometric requirements for gating control by LRRC26, the pore, and the selectivity filter. This study provides new molecular tools and mechanistic insights into the stoichiometry of BK channel gating and regulation.</p>

<title>Construction of functional BK channels with concatenated tandem repeats of the α subunits</title>
<p>We employed multiple strategies to generate concatenated BKα subunit constructs that enable expression of functional channels with biophysical properties that are comparable to intact (i.e., unsplit) BK channels and facile amplification and manipulation at the plasmid DNA level. Given the extracellular location of the N-terminus of BKα (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), which precludes direct C-to-N-terminal concatenation, we first attempted to split BKα into the N-terminal S0 part and the remaining major portion. This was based on the report that co-expression of these two parts can form functional channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). However, plasmids of tandem constructs lacking only S0 proved difficult to generate and use due to large plasmid size and instability during cloning. Since the C-terminal RCK2 domain can also be expressed as a module that forms functional channels when split and co-expressed with the rest of BKα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), we thus further split BKα into a main part (residues 94-649), designated as BKα<sub>M</sub>, and the rest by deletion of the main part, designated as BKα<sup>ΔM</sup>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). The BKα<sub>M</sub> module contains the major transmembrane region (S1 to S6) and the RCK1 domain. The BKα<sup>ΔM</sup> construct retains the N-terminal residues 1-93 including S0 and the C-terminal residues 652-1113 including the RCK2 domain.</p>

<p>To prevent homologous recombination within the concatenated tandem repeat constructs during molecular cloning and to facilitate site-directed mutations on specific subunits, we designed each BKα subunit in the repeats to have distinct DNA sequences. This was achieved by utilizing codon-optimized cDNA sequences for the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 4<sup>th</sup> repeats of the main part, which differ by ∼ 25% in nucleotide sequence from the original 1<sup>st</sup> repeat and from each other. With these strategies, we generated a single unit and tandem constructs of double and quadruple repeats of BKα<sub>M</sub>, named BKα<sub>M(mono)</sub> (BKα<sub>M</sub>), BKα<sub>M(dual)</sub> (BKα<sub>MM</sub>), and BKα<sub>M(quad)</sub> (BKα<sub>MMMM</sub>), respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). To evaluate the expression and stability of the concatenated tandem BKα<sub>M</sub> constructs, we performed immunoblot analysis of the C-terminally V5-tagged constructs transfected in HEK293 cells. The result showed predominant protein bands of BKα<sub>MM</sub> and BKα<sub>MMMM</sub> at expected protein sizes recognized by the anti-V5 antibody (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), confirming the expression and lack of major degradation of the concatenated BKα<sub>M</sub> constructs.</p>
<p>By co-expression of the C-terminally GFP-tagged BKα<sup>ΔM</sup> (BKα<sup>ΔM</sup>-GFP) with single, double, or quadruple repeat constructs of BKα<sub>M</sub>, we observed formation of functional BK channels that resemble the intact BKα channel in their voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of channel activation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D, E</xref>). The V<sub>1/2</sub> values of the BK channels formed by the single-unit BKα<sub>M</sub> construct, when co-expressed with BKα<sup>ΔM</sup>-GFP, were 192 and 16 mV at virtual 0 and 10 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, respectively. The tandem double repeat constructs, BKα<sub>MM</sub>, when co-expressed with BKα<sup>ΔM</sup>-GFP, produced functional BK channels with V<sub>1/2</sub> values of 186 mV at virtual 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and 16 mV at 10 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, the channels formed by tandem quadruple repeat construct BKα<sub>MMMM</sub> and BKα<sup>ΔM</sup>-GFP had V<sub>1/2</sub> values of 184 and 29 mV at virtual 0 and 10 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These V<sub>1/2</sub> values of engineered BK channels formed by single, double, and quadruple repeat constructs of BKα<sub>M</sub> are close to those of the intact BKα channels, which had V<sub>1/2</sub> = 172 and 19 mV at virtual 0 and 10 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These results show that the voltage- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gating properties are largely unaltered in the engineered BK channels formed by engineered concatenated BKα subunit constructs.</p>

<title>A single LRRC26 (γ1) subunit per channel is sufficient to fully modulate BK channels</title>
<p>The γ1 subunit’s “all-or-none” modulatory effect on BK channels has remained mechanistically elusive, despite the recent availability of 3D structures of the BKα/γ1 complexes. To directly investigate the functional stoichiometry of BK channel modulation by the γ1 subunit, we fused the C-terminus of the γ1 subunit to the N-terminus of the first BKα<sub>M</sub> repeat in the BKα<sub>MM</sub> and BKα<sub>MMMM</sub> constructs, generating the BKγ1α<sub>MM</sub> (BKγ1α<sub>M(dual)</sub>) and BKγ1α<sub>MMMM</sub> (BKγ1α<sub>M(quad)</sub>) fusion constructs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Immunoblot analysis of the V5-tagged constructs using an anti-V5 antibody showed a major band at the expected size for both BKγ1α<sub>MM</sub> (∼150 kDa) and BKγ1α<sub>MMMM</sub> (∼270 kDa) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), confirming proper expression and stability. Upon co-expression of these constructs with BKα<sup>ΔM</sup>-GFP in HEK293 cells, we observed that the N-terminally fused γ1 subunit induced a V<sub>1/2</sub> shift of 125 mV with the BKγ1α<sub>MM</sub> construct (V<sub>1/2</sub> = 62 ± 5 mV) and 145 mV with the BKγ1α<sub>MMMM</sub> construct (V<sub>1/2</sub> = 38 ± 4 mV) in the virtual absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, E</xref>). These large V<sub>1/2</sub>-shifting effects in stoichiometrically defined γ1:α = 1:2 and 1:4 channel complexes clearly indicate that a single γ1 subunit per tetrameric channel is sufficient to fully modulate BK channels. This “one-subunit-sufficient” effect provides a mechanistic explanation for the observed binary, all-or-none modulation by the γ1 subunit when its expression is limited.</p>

<title>L312A mutation reveals stoichiometrically graded gating and confirms functional integrity of concatenated constructs</title>
<p>To ensure that the concatenated BKα<sub>M</sub> constructs are suitable for studying the stoichiometry of BK channel gating and regulation, the constructs must demonstrate two additional aspects of functional integrity beyond simply forming functional channels. First, each BKα<sub>M</sub> repeat within the construct should contribute equally to channel formation. Second, the concatenated dual and quadruple BKα<sub>M</sub> repeats in the BKα<sub>M(dual)</sub> and BKα<sub>M(quad)</sub> constructs should assemble primarily as complete units, i.e., two BKα<sub>M(dual)</sub> constructs or one BKα<sub>M(quad)</sub> construct should form a single channel. The latter ensures that heterogeneous channels with uncontrolled subunit stoichiometry are unlikely to form and confound the results.</p>
<p>To evaluate the functional integrity of the concatenated constructs and to examine the stoichiometry of activation gating in the PGD, we investigated the mutational effects of the deep pore residue L312 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), which plays a pivotal role in BK channel activation gating. Most mutations at this site resulted in constitutively active channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). The L312A mutation, in particular, causes a substantial shift of the V<sub>1/2</sub> toward hyperpolarization potentials in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). We first confirmed that the L312A mutation on the single-repeat BKα<sub>M</sub> construct caused a similarly large (∼130 mV) shift in V<sub>1/2</sub> toward hyperpolarization in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, C</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We then introduced the L312A mutation into the dual- and quad-repeat BKα<sub>MM</sub> and BKα<sub>MMMM</sub> constructs in a repeat-specific manner. For the BKα<sub>MM</sub> construct, introducing L312A mutation into either the first or second repeat resulted in a similar shift (65 or 68 mV) in V<sub>1/2</sub>, approximately half of the total shift seen when both repeats (i.e., all subunits) were mutated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For the BKα<sub>MMMM</sub> construct, we observed that the voltage dependence of the channel activation shifted progressively with each additional L312A mutation introduced. Specifically, the initial L312A mutation on the first repeat shifted V<sub>1/2</sub> by 31 mV, with further increases of 20, 35, and 37 mV in V<sub>1/2</sub> shifts observed for the additional mutation on the second, third, and fourth repeats, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The L312A mutation also caused a substantial delay in deactivation evident as a slowed decay in tail currents at negative voltages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) compared to unmutated channels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Fitting the current decay kinetics revealed that the time constant (τ) of the decay was increased with the number of L312A mutations present in the channels formed by BKα<sub>MM</sub> and BKα<sub>MMMM</sub> constructs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). It is worth noting that the tail current decay rates for channels with zero or one L312A mutation were likely overestimated due to rapid closure at very negative voltages (−120 mV) in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conditions, exceeding the detection limit of the 2 kHz-filtered recordings. These results demonstrate a stoichiometrically incremental effect of the L312A mutation on BK channel voltage gating. Importantly, they also indicate that individual BKα<sub>M</sub> repeats in both the dual- and quad-repeat constructs contribute similarly to the gating properties of the assembled channels.</p>

<title>V288A triggers selectivity filter inactivation through an all-subunit mechanism</title>
<p>The selectivity filter in K<sup>+</sup> channels is directly involved in C-type inactivation. Given its potential role in BK channel activation gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), we examined the subunit stoichiometric effects of structural perturbations within the selectivity filter on BK channel gating. We found that the V288A mutation, located within the K<sup>+</sup>-selective signature sequence (<sup>286</sup>ST<underline>V</underline>GYGD<sup>292</sup>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), produced profound effects on BK channel gating. We previously reported that mutations near the selectivity filter, e.g., in the P-helix (Y279) or at the extracellular side of the filter (Y294), can induce an atypical closed-state-coupled C-type inactivation in BK channels under low extracellular K<sup>+</sup> conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Interestingly, V288A, even without reduced extracellular K<sup>+</sup>, induced a similar slow inactivation process, causing a gradual decrease in the availability of activatable channels under conditions (e.g., negative voltages) that promote channel closure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Consequently, compared to WT channels, V288A mutant channel currents developed very slowly in response to depolarization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, following a long pre-depolarization, the mutant channels fully recovered from the inactivated state and behaved similarly to WT channels in the kinetics and voltage-dependence of activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>Using the concatenated BKα<sub>M</sub> constructs, we investigated the subunit stoichiometry of V288A-induced gating effects by introducing the mutation into different numbers of BKα subunits within a single channel. With the BKα<sub>M(dual)</sub> construct, we generated BKα<sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>WT</sup> and BKα<sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup> constructs, harboring the mutation on half or all subunits, respectively. We introduced one (BKα<sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>WT</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>WT</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>WT</sup>), two (BKα<sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>WT</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>WT</sup>), three (BKα<sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>WT</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup>), or four (BKα<sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup>) mutations on the BKα<sub>M(quad)</sub> construct. Interestingly, unlike the one-subunit-sufficient effect of LRRC26 or the stoichiometrically incremental effects of the L312A mutation, V288A exerted an “all-subunit-required” modulatory effect: the V288A-induced changes occurred only when all four BKα subunits in a channel were mutated. Channels partially mutated, originated from BKα<sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>WT</sup>, BKα<sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>WT</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>WT</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>WT</sup>, BKα<sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>WT</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>WT</sup>, or BKα<sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>WT</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup>, showed no significant differences from WT channels in the time course (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D, E</xref>) or voltage-dependence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>) of depolarization-induced currents. In contrast, channels with all BKα<sub>M</sub> repeats mutated (BKα<sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup> and BKα<sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup><sub>M</sub><sup>V288A</sup>) displayed markedly slowed current development, approximately 100-fold slower than WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D, E</xref>). These fully mutated channels also showed an apparently higher V<sub>1/2</sub> in their G-V relationships (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). However, since the V288A mutation has no significant effect on the channel’s normal activation gating (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C, F</xref>), this apparent shift in G-V curves likely resulted from incomplete recovery of inactivated channels during 50 ms depolarization phase used in the voltage protocol used. Together, these results demonstrate that V288A induces an “all-subunit-required” inactivation process at the selectivity filter, while the activation/deactivation processes of normal channel gating remain largely unchanged.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Concatenated constructs have been extensively used to study ion channel subunit stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), enabling a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying channel gating and regulation by homo- or heteromeric subunits, voltage, ligands, and mutations. However, the BK channel is one of the few channels whose principal subunits have their N-termini located on the extracellular side. This unique membrane topology prevents the direct application of the traditional N-to-C-terminal concatenation method for generating the concatenated constructs. In this study, we employed a strategy that involved splitting and fusing BKα subunits into two modular constructs that reconstitute functional BK channels. We validated the functionality of these concatenated constructs by demonstrating that the resulting channels closely resemble intact BK channels in their voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of activation. Furthermore, we confirmed that each repeat with the constructs contributes similarly to channel function, as evidenced by the stoichiometrically incremental effect of the L312A mutation on voltage gating. Previous studies have reported that, in some cases, subunits from different quadruple-repeat concatemers can assemble aberrantly, leading to the formation of mixed channels with altered properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). The large functional effect of the L312A mutation on BK channel gating allowed us to distinguish between properly assembled channels and potential inter-subunit crossover products. Our results showed that the concatenated tandem constructs assemble predominantly as intended, i.e., each channel is formed by two dual-repeat constructs or a single quadruple-repeat construct, as evidenced by the absence of significant heterogeneity in channel gating properties. Using these well-defined concatenated constructs, we identified three distinct types of subunit stoichiometry in BK channel gating or modulation. These rule out the possibility that the observed stoichiometric effects are artifacts arising from the construct design or assembly defects. Thus, we have demonstrated that our engineered concatenated BKα constructs serve as effective molecular tools for probing the subunit stoichiometry in BK channel gating and regulation.</p>
<p>Most auxiliary proteins of the K<sup>+</sup> channels exhibit stoichiometrically incremental effects on channel modulation. However, the auxiliary γ1 subunit displays an unusual binary “all-or-none” modulatory effect on BK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), despite being able to bind to BKα subunits at a 1:1 molecular ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). In recently reported cryo-EM structures of channel complexes, the four γ1 subunits display an apparent four-fold symmetry in TM domain interactions with their LRR domains tetramerized on the extracellular side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). These structural features raise the possibility that the four γ1 subunits might act collectively in BK channel modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), which appears to contradict the “one-subunit-sufficient” mechanism previously inferred from single channel gating properties of BK channels modulated by a β2-γ1 chimeric construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). With the concatenated modular BKα constructs developed in this study, we were able to directly control the subunit stoichiometry of γ1 subunits relative to BKα subunits. The intracellular location of the N-terminus in the concatenated BKα constructs enabled us to fuse the γ1 subunit to the N-terminal side of the BKα<sub>M</sub> module. With γ1-fused concatenated BKα<sub>M</sub> dual- and quadruple-repeat constructs, we provide direct evidence that one and two copies of the γ1 subunits per BKα tetramer are sufficient to produce the full modulatory effect of the γ1 subunit on BK channel gating. Thus, our findings unequivocally confirm the “one-subunit-sufficient” mechanism of the γ1 subunit in BK channel modulation by using the full length γ1 subunit, stoichiometrically defined BKα/γ1 channel complexes, and macroscopic currents from large channel populations. This result, combined with the structural observation of symmetrical binding of γ1 to all four voltage-sensor domains, raises the intriguing possibility that γ1 modulation may occur through asymmetric allosteric coupling, despite symmetric structural binding—a phenomenon warranting further mechanistic investigation.</p>
<p>Through conformational linkage to the voltage- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensors, the movement of the lower half of the pore-lining S6 helix ultimately controls BK channel pore gating. According to the Horrigan-Aldrich gating model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), BK channel activation involves a rate-limiting process of pore-gate opening, regulated by four independent and identical voltage- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensors. However, the subunit stoichiometry underlying the S6 movement-induced pore-gate opening in BK channels remains unclear and warrants investigation. The deep pore residue L312 on S6 is unique in that it lies adjacent to the double-glycine gating hinge residues (G310 and G311), is positioned immediately below the selectivity filter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), and appears to be the most mutation-sensitive residue affecting channel activation gating, as most of its substitution mutations result in constitutively open channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Thus, L312 appears to represent a structural endpoint for the voltage- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced conformational changes in S6 and plays an essential role in stabilizing the channel’s closed state. In classic Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channels, a mutation of the neighboring glycine hinge residue (G466 in Shaker, corresponding to G311 in BKα) in concatenated tetrameric constructs was reported to display a concerted, “one-subunit-sufficient” effect, where all mutant subunit combinations produced similar effects on channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), a phenomenon reminiscent of the modulatory behavior of the LRRC26 (γ1) subunit on BK channel gating. In contrast, our current study reveals a stoichiometrically graded (independent) effect of the L312A mutation on BK channel voltage gating, which is consistent with the modeled independence of individual voltage- and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors in channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). This stoichiometric independence likely reflects a fundamental difference in the location and mechanism of the activation gate. In Shaker and related Kv channels, the classical activation gate resides at the bundle crossing of the lower S6 helices, where concerted subunit movements are required for highly cooperative transitions from closed to open states. In contrast, the graded, additive effects of L312A mutations in BK channels provide new evidence that no such concerted gating structure exists within the lower S6 or at least not within the deep pore region.</p>
<p>Currently, the fundamental question of pore gate location in BK channels remains unsettled. In most K<sup>+</sup> channels, a hydrophobic “bundle-crossing” gate near the intracellular end of the pore controls channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). However, BK channels appear to lack such a gate, as the pore remains structurally wide open in the presumed closed-state (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free) structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) and is readily accessible to large intracellular blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>) or cysteine-modifying reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) even when the channel is closed. The selectivity filter, known to govern C-type inactivation in many channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), may also serve as activation gate in some, such as the ligand-gated CNG channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Accordingly, direct involvement of the selectivity filter in BK channel activation gating has long been speculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), but compelling experimental validation remains lacking. While C-type inactivation doesn’t normally occur in BK channels, we previously found that it can be induced by mutations near the selectivity filter in combination with low extracellular K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Interestingly, the induced C-type inactivation in BK channels is closed-state coupled, opposite to the open-state coupled C-type inactivation commonly observed in other channels. In this study, we report that the V288A mutation, located within the K<sup>+</sup>-selective signature sequence, also induces pronounced inactivation even under normal extracellular K<sup>+</sup> conditions. Our analysis of the subunit stoichiometric effects of V288A using concatenated BKα dual- and quadruple-repeat constructs clearly showed that modifications in all four subunits are required to elicit the mutation-induced inactivation, whereas all other mutant subunit combinations produced minimal effects on BK channel gating. This all-subunits-required inter-subunit cooperation is consistent with classical C-type inactivation mechanisms at the selectivity filter in other K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), and supports our interpretation that V288A induces a form of C-type inactivation, as previously observed with mutations at the extracellular mouth and P-helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). These new findings reveal distinct subunit stoichiometry requirements between the deep pore activation gating and selectivity filter inactivation gating, as evidenced by contrasting behaviors of L312A and V288A mutations in concatenated BKα<sub>M</sub> constructs. Nonetheless, the tight inter-subunit cooperativity observed at the selectivity filter makes it a plausible candidate for serving as the activation gate, a property not yet demonstrated for the lower S6 segment. It is possible that the selectivity filter functions as the physical gate for two gating processes, activation and inactivation, that can occur on different timescales and through distinct structural mechanisms. Previously, we found that the voltage- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of inactivation and activating gating were well correlated in BK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), suggesting a shared or coupled energetic pathway. L312 lies in close proximity to and physically interacts with the selectivity filter, providing a possible structural link for transmitting energy from S6 movement to the selectivity filter during activation gating. Further investigation of inactivation and its relationship to activation will likely help elucidate the role of the selectivity filter in BK channel activation gating.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study employed an innovative strategy to generate concatenated subunit constructs and investigate the subunit stoichiometry and modulation of BK channels. The development of these constructs enabled detailed exploration of the intricate gating and regulatory mechanisms of BK channels in a stoichiometrically subunit-specific manner. Using these concatenated constructs, we identified three distinct types of subunit stoichiometry in BK channel modulation: an additive (independent) type and two contrasting all-or-none types, namely, “one-subunit-sufficient” and “all-subunit-required”. These represent divergent stoichiometric modes of gating control by the pore, LRRC26 (γ1), and selectivity filter, respectively. This study offers new molecular tools and advances our understanding of subunit stoichiometry in BK channel gating and modulation.</p>

<title>Generation of concatenated tandem BKα repeat constructs and expression of BK channels</title>
<p>We first generated a pcDNA6-based plasmid, pcDNA6-myc-BKα-V5-His, carrying <italic>KCNMA1</italic> cDNA (GenBank: U11058). This plasmid expresses the full-length (1113 amino acids) human BKα (GenBank: AAB65837) with an N-terminal Myc tag and C-terminal V5 and 6×His tags, serving as the template for further plasmid constructions. To express BKα’s main region (residues 44-651) as a protein module, we created pcDNA6-myc-BKα<sub>M</sub>-V5-His by deleting the nucleotide sequences encoding N-terminal residues 1-43 (extracellular N-terminus and S0 TM segment) and C-terminal residues 652-1113 (RCK2 domain and C-terminal tail). Next, we constructed a complementary plasmid, pcDNA6-myc-BKα<sup>ΔM</sup>-GFP-V5-His, by replacing residues 94-651 of BKα with a flexible peptide linker (SSGGGGSGGGSGGAR) and tagging monomeric enhanced GFP to the C-terminus. This complementary plasmid enables functional channel formation when co-expressed with a plasmid encoding a single BKα<sub>M</sub> or concatenated BKα<sub>M</sub> repeats. To construct structurally stable plasmids expressing concatenated BKα<sub>M</sub> repeats, we synthesized three codon-optimized DNA sequences encoding the same BKα<sub>M</sub> module, each differing by ∼ 25% in nucleotide sequence from each other and the original <italic>KCNMA1</italic> cDNA. Using these synthesized sequences, we constructed the dual-repeat expressing plasmid, pcDNA6-BKα<sub>M1</sub>α<sub>M2</sub>-V5-His, in which α<sub>M1</sub> (residues 43-649) is preceded by a short initiation sequence (MGS) and linked to α<sub>M2</sub> (also residues 43-649) via a flexible linker (GGGGSGSAG). A NotI restriction site with a peptide spacer (GGGKPIPNAAA) was inserted between α<sub>M2</sub> and the V5 tag. We also generated a second dual-repeat expressing plasmid, the pcDNA6-BKα<sub>M3</sub>α<sub>M4</sub>-V5-His, in which α<sub>M3</sub> (residues 44-649) is preceded by an N-terminal sequence (MGAAAA) containing a NotI site and linked α<sub>M4</sub> (residues 43-649) via a flexible linker (GGGSAAGSG). As the two dual-repeat constructs produce highly similar proteins and exhibit no difference in electrophysiological properties, both are referred to as BKα<sub>(dual)</sub> or BKα<sub>MM</sub>. To generate a quadruple-repeat expressing plasmid, pcDNA6-BKα<sub>M1</sub>α<sub>M2</sub>α<sub>M3</sub>α<sub>M4</sub>-V5-His, we subcloned the α<sub>M3</sub>α<sub>M4</sub> dual-module fragment from pcDNA6-BKα<sub>M3</sub>α<sub>M4</sub>-V5-His into pcDNA6-BKα<sub>M1</sub>α<sub>M2</sub>-V5-His using NotI and AgeI (located between the V5 and 6×His tags). The expressed protein is referred as BKα<sub>(quad)</sub> or BKα<sub>MMMM</sub>. For γ1 (LRRC26) fusion constructs, we generated pcDNA6-BKγ1α<sub>M1</sub>α<sub>M2</sub>-V5-His and by inserting the γ1 (LRRC26) sequence at the N-terminus of α<sub>M1</sub>α<sub>M2</sub> (pcDNA6-BKα<sub>M1</sub>α<sub>M2</sub>-V5-His) via a 16-residue flexible linker (SSGSGSESKSTGGSGS). The expressed fusion protein is designated as BKγ1α<sub>MM</sub> or BKγ1α<sub>M(dual)</sub>. To express the BKγ1α<sub>MMMM</sub> (also referred as BKγ1α<sub>M(quad)</sub>) fusion construct, we created pcDNA6-BKγ1α<sub>M1</sub>α<sub>M2</sub>α<sub>M3</sub>α<sub>M4</sub>-V5-His by subcloning α<sub>M3</sub>α<sub>M4</sub> from pcDNA6-BKα<sub>M3</sub>α<sub>M4</sub>-V5-His into pcDNA6-BKγ1α<sub>M1</sub>α<sub>M2</sub>-V5-His using NotI and AgeI. For DNA manipulation and amplification, we used the Long Fragment DNA Ligation Kit (TaKaRa) and CopyCutter competent E. coli (Lucigen). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene). Mutations for the quadruple-repeat construct were first introduced into either the α<sub>M1</sub>α<sub>M2</sub> or α<sub>M3</sub>α<sub>M4</sub> dual-repeat construct, followed by fusion of α<sub>M1</sub>α<sub>M2</sub> and α<sub>M3</sub>α<sub>M4</sub> as described above. HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were transfected with plasmids using PEI “MAX” (Polysciences Inc.) and subjected to electrophysiological assays 16-72 hours post-transfection.</p>

<p>BK channel currents were recorded from excised inside-out patches of HEK293 cells using patch-clamp recording techniques as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Both intracellular and extracellular (pipette) solutions contained 136 mM KMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 4 mM KCl, and 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.20). The extracellular solution was supplemented with 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, while the intracellular solution contained 5 mM HEDTA either with or without Ca<sup>2+</sup> to achieve 10 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>free. Recording pipette electrodes were pulled from borosilicate filamented glass tubes (Cat #: BF150-110-10, Sutter Instrument) with a P-1000 micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument), and polished by heat with an MF-830 microforge (Narishige) to a resistance of 1-2 MΩ. Data were acquired using PatchMaster (HEKA) with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and ITC-18 digitizer (InstruTECH) or with an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA). Data were sampled at 20 µs and filtered at 2 kHz (Axopatch 200B) with the amplifiers’ 4-pole Bessel filter or at 2.9 kHz (EPC-10). Capacitive and leak currents were subtracted using a P/4 protocol at holding potentials of −120 mV or −150 mV (for γ1 or 10 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions). Steady-state activation, expressed as normalized conductance (G/Gmax) versus voltage (G-V), was calculated from the tail current amplitudes (at −120 mV) and fitted using a single-Boltzmann function G/Gmax= 1/(1+e<sup>−ZF(V-VH)/RT</sup>) or a double-Boltzmann function G/Gmax = Pa/(1+ e<sup>−ZaF(V-VHa)/RT</sup>) + (1 − Pa)/(1 + e<sup>−ZbF(V-VHb)/RT</sup>) where V, VH, Z, F, R, T, Pa, a and b denote voltage, V<sub>1/2</sub>, gating charge (z), Faraday constant, gas constant, Kelvin temperature, component portion (0–1), and component identity (a or b), respectively. Values are reported as means ± SEM.</p>

<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Proteins were enriched by immunoprecipitation as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) and immunoblotted after SDS-PAGE. Briefly, proteins were solubilized from cells in 2% Dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside (DDM) in TBS buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.6). Lysates were incubated with mouse anti-V5 monoclonal antibody agarose gel (Cat# A7345, Millipore Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. After three 10 min washes in with 2% DDM-containing TBS, bound proteins were eluted with 4% SDS. Protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) was used throughout the procedure. Eluted proteins were separated by 4% to 20% gradient SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Immunoblotting was performed with mouse anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Cat# R96125, Invitrogen) at 1:10,000 dilution.</p>

<p>In this <bold>important</bold> contribution, Yan and colleagues describe a powerful and <bold>compelling</bold> strategy to generate concatamers of the BK channel and their fusion constructs with the auxiliary gamma subunits, which allows exploring contributions of individual subunits of the tetrameric channel to its gating and the study of heteromeric channel complexes of defined composition. Distinct examples are presented, which illustrate great diversity in the stoichiometric control of BK channel gating, depending on the site and nature of molecular perturbations. The molecular approaches could be extended to other membrane proteins whose N and C termini face opposite sides of the membrane.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>BK channels are widely distributed and involved in many physiological functions. They have also proven a highly useful tool for studying general allosteric mechanisms for gating and modulation by auxiliary subunits. Tetrameric BK channels are assembled from four separate alpha subunits, which would be identical for homozygous alleles and potentially of five different combinations for heterozygous alleles (Geng et al., 2023, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1085/jgp.202213302">https://doi.org/10.1085/jgp.202213302</ext-link>). Construction of BK channels with concatenated subunits in order to strictly control heteromeric subunit composition had not yet been used because the N-terminus in BK channels is extracellular, whereas the C-terminus is intracellular. In this new work, Chen, Li, and Yan devise clever methods to construct and assemble BK channels of known subunit composition, as well as to fix the number of γ1 axillary subunits per channel. With their novel molecular approaches, Chen, Li and Yan report that a single γ1 axillary subunit is sufficient to fully modulate a BK channel, that the deep conducting pore mutation L312A exhibited a graded effect on gating with each addition mutated subunit replacing a WT subunit in the channel adding an additional incremental left shift in activation, and that the V288A mutation at the selectivity filter must be present on all four alpha subunits in order to induce channel inactivation. Chen, Li, and Yan have been successful in introducing new molecular tools to generate BK channels of known stoichiometry and subunit composition. They validate their methods and provide three examples of their use with useful observations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Powerful new molecular tools for the study of channel gating have been developed and validated in the study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One example each of auxiliary, deep pore, and selectivity filter allosteric actions is presented, but this is sufficient for the purposes of the paper to establish their methods and present specific examples of applicability.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes novel BK channel concatemers as a tool to study the stoichiometry of the gamma subunit and mutations in the modulation of the channel. Taking advantage of the modular design of the BK channel alpha subunit, the authors connected S1-S6/1st RCK as two- and four-subunit concatemers and coexpressed with S0-RCK2 to form normal function channels. These concatemers avoided the difficulty that the extracellular N-terminus of S0 was unable to connect with the cytosolic C-terminus of the gamma subunit, allowing a single gamma subunit to be connected to the concatemers. The concatemers also helped reveal the required stoichiometry of mutant BK subunits in modulating channel function. These include L312A in the deep pore region that altered channel function additively with each additional subunit harboring the mutation, and V288A at the selectivity filter that altered channel function cooperatively only when all four subunits were mutated. These results demonstrate that the concatemers are robust and effective in studying BK channel function and molecular mechanisms related to stoichiometry. The different requirement of the gamma subunit and the mutations stoichiometry for altering channel function is interesting, which may relate to the fundamental mechanism of how different motifs of the channel protein control function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript presents well-designed experiments with high-quality data, which convincingly demonstrate the BK channel concatemers and their utility. The results are clearly presented.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This reviewer did not identify any major concerns with the manuscript.</p>
