<title>Abstract</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wong et al. (2019)</xref> used a sensory preconditioning protocol to examine how sensory and fear memories are integrated in the rat medial temporal lobe. In this protocol, rats integrate a sound-light (sensory) memory that forms in stage 1 with a light-shock (fear) memory that forms in stage 2 to generate fear responses (freezing) across test presentations of the sound in stage 3. Here, we advance this research by showing that: 1) how/when rats integrate the sound-light and light-shock memories (online in stage 2 or at test in stage 3) changes with the number of sound-light pairings in stage 1; and 2) regardless of how/when it occurs, the integration requires communication between two regions of the medial temporal lobe: the perirhinal cortex and basolateral amygdala complex. Thus, “event familiarity” determines how/when sensory and fear memories are integrated but not the circuitry by which the integration occurs: this remains the same.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Memory is the means by which the past connects with the present to guide our future interactions with the environment. One of the ways it achieves this feat is by integrating the sensory and emotional elements of experiences that are separated in time (e.g., experiences that occur days, weeks or months apart). This allows people and animals to better anticipate and react to different types of situations. For example, after being assaulted by person A, you may be apprehensive when you encounter their known-associate, person B, who was not present at the time of the assault; after being attacked by a dog in the street, a child may avoid places where the dog had been previously encountered (e.g., the park); and after learning the relationship between a particular smell and danger, an animal may avoid places where it had previously encountered that smell.</p>
<p>How does the brain integrate sensory and emotional memories so that animals/people can anticipate and react to different types of situations? This question can be addressed through the study of sensory preconditioned fear in rats. A standard protocol to produce sensory preconditioned fear consists in three stages. In stage 1, rats are exposed to pairings of two relatively innocuous stimuli, e.g., a sound followed by a light. In stage 2 (typically 24 h later), one of these stimuli, e.g., the light, is paired with danger in the form of brief but aversive foot shock. Finally, in stage 3, rats exhibit fear responses, e.g., suppression of food-reinforced lever pressing or freezing, when tested with the light that had been paired with danger or the sound that had never paired with danger. Importantly, fear of the sound is not due to generalization from the conditioned light, as controls exposed to explicitly unpaired presentations of the relevant stimuli in either stage of training do not show this fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fam et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Holmes &amp; Westbrook, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kikas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Michalcheck et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rizley &amp; Rescorla, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wong et al., 2019</xref>). Instead, fear of the sound is due to integration of memories that form in each stage of training: the sensory sound-light memory that forms in stage 1 is integrated with the emotional light-shock memory that forms in stage 2 to generate fear of the sound when it is tested in stage 3.</p>
<p>When are the two memories integrated? In a previous study published in <italic>eLife</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wong et al. (2019)</xref> showed that integration of the sound-light and light-shock memories occurs “online” at the time of the light-shock pairings in stage 2. This conclusion was based on a series of experiments which examined the involvement of the perirhinal cortex (PRh) in stage 2 of the protocol described above. The PRh was selected as the region of interest as it encodes the sound-light memory that forms in stage 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Qureshi et al., 2023</xref>) but plays no role in formation of the directly conditioned light-shock memory in stage 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bang &amp; Brown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Campeau &amp; Davis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kholodar-Smith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lindquist et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Romanski &amp; LeDoux, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wilensky et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, Wong et al. confirmed past findings that neuronal activity in the PRh is <italic>not</italic> needed for acquisition of directly conditioned fear to the light. By contrast, the same testing revealed that neuronal activity in the PRh <italic>is</italic> needed for acquisition of sensory preconditioned fear to the sound. Wong et al reasoned that, if fear of the sound was due to chaining of sound-light and light-shock memories at the time of testing (the alternative hypothesis; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), it should have been intact as the two component memories were unaffected by the PRh manipulations. That is, as the manipulations were administered days after the session of sound-light pairings, the sound-light memory will have been intact; and the manipulations had no effect on acquisition of fear to the light showing that the light-shock memory was also intact (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Holmes et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, the finding that fear of the sound was abolished shows that, when it occurs, it must be supported by some “online” process across the session of light-shock pairings. Specifically, the results were taken to imply that, when the light is paired with shock in stage 2, it activates a PRh-dependent memory of its past associate, the sound, resulting in a direct light-shock memory as well as an indirect or mediated sound-shock memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Holland, 1981</xref>; Holmes et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lingawi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wong et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, when either stimulus is presented at test, rats expect the shock and freeze in its anticipation.</p>

    <caption><title>Illustration of the two types of integration.</title>
    <p><bold>A)</bold> The sound-light and light-shock memories can be integrated “online” during stage 2. When the subject is exposed to light-shock pairings in stage 2, the light activates the memory of its past associate, the sound, thereby allowing it to associate with the shock (i.e., subjects form a mediated sound-shock association). Test presentations of the sound then retrieve this mediated sound-shock association, resulting in the expression of fear. This type of integration is hypothesized to occur after few sound-light pairings in stage 1. Under these circumstances, subjects do not encode the order in which the events occur, resulting in mediated learning about the sound across direct conditioning of the light. <bold>B)</bold> The sound-light and light-shock memories can be integrated at the time of testing. Here, when the sound is presented at test, the subject retrieves the sound-light memory formed in stage 1 and integrates (or chains) it with the light-shock memory formed in stage 2, resulting in the expression of fear. This type of integration is hypothesized to occur after many sound-light pairings in stage 1. Under these circumstances, subjects learn that the sound is followed by the light (sound➔light) and that that light is followed by nothing (light➔nothing). Hence, during the session of light-shock pairings in stage 2, the light does <italic>not</italic> activate the memory of the sound and the mediated sound-shock association does not form. Instead, during testing with the sound in stage 3, the light and its shock associate are strongly called to mind via the chain, sound➔light➔shock, resulting in the expression of fear responses.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>The findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wong et al. (2019)</xref> raise two questions. The first is whether integration of the sound-light and light-shock memories <italic>always</italic> occurs online across conditioning of the light. While Wong et al. provided evidence for such online integration, under some circumstances it may become more dependent on chaining of the sound-light and light-shock memories at test. One of the ways in which this could occur is by increasing the number of sound-light pairings from that used by Wong et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Holland, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Holmes et al., 2022</xref>). Such an increase could alter what is encoded across preconditioning from a bidirectional sound↔light associative structure to one which just encodes the order in which the events were presented; namely, a unidirectional sound➔light structure. The shift from the former to the latter with an increase in the number of sound-light pairings would thus undermine the ability of the light to activate the memory of the sound across conditioning and, hence, mediate conditioning of the sound. At the same time, such an increase would strengthen the ability of the sound to activate the representation of the now-conditioned light at test, initiating the memorial chain that enables the sound to elicit freezing (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). That is, increasing the number of sound-light pairings may allow rats to encode information about stimulus order in stage 1 and, thereby, shift the locus of integration from mediated conditioning in stage 2 to chaining at test in stage 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Holmes et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The second question raised by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wong et al. (2019)</xref> findings concerns the neural substrates underlying integration. Regardless of when it occurs, integration must involve interactions between the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) and the PRh. Neuronal activity in the BLA, but not the PRh, is critical for the formation of the light-shock memory and its expression in fear responses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Maren et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Schafe et al., 2000</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Duvarci &amp; Pare, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rodrigues et al., 2004</xref> for reviews); whereas neuronal activity in both the PRh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wong et al., 2019</xref>) and BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>) is required for the expression of fear responses to the sensory preconditioned sound. These findings suggest that communication between the PRh and BLA may be required for successful integration of the memories formed in training and, thereby, expression of fear to the sound. However, it remains to be determined whether this is, in fact, the case. That is, it remains to be determined whether communication between the PRh and BLA is required for “online” integration of the sound-light and light-shock memories in stage 2 and/or completion of a sound➔light➔shock memory chain at test in stage 3.</p>
<p>The present study addressed both of the questions raised by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wong et al. (2019)</xref> findings. It had two specific aims. The first aim was to determine whether the type of integration depends on the number of sound-light pairings in stage 1: i.e., whether the sound-light and light-shock memories are integrated “online” via mediated conditioning after few sound-light pairings, and via chaining at the time of testing after many sound-light pairings. We addressed this aim by examining whether sensory preconditioned fear of the sound requires activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the PRh across the session of light-shock pairings in stage 2. If integration occurs via mediated conditioning, as we have shown in the case of rats exposed to few sound-light pairings in stage 1, then blocking NMDA receptors in the PRh (via an infusion of the NMDA receptor antagonist, DAP5) immediately prior to the session of light-shock pairings should disrupt fear of the sound at test (measured in freezing). If, however, integration occurs through chaining of the sound-light and light-shock memories at test, as we expect in the case of rats exposed to many sound-light pairings in stage 1, blocking NMDA receptors in the PRh in stage 2 should have no effect on fear of the sound at test.</p>
<p>The second aim of this study was to determine whether integration of the sound-light and light-shock memories depends on communication between the PRh and BLA: i.e., whether this communication is required for mediated conditioning of the sound across the light-shock pairings in stage 2, and/or chaining of the sound-light and light-shock memories across testing of the sound in stage 3. We addressed this aim by functionally disconnecting the PRh and BLA immediately prior to the session of light-shock pairings in stage 2 or testing with the sound in stage 3. If communication between the PRh and BLA is required for mediated conditioning of the sound, disconnecting the PRh and BLA prior to the session of light-shock pairings should disrupt fear of the sound at test; and if communication between the PRh and BLA is required for completion of the sound➔light➔shock memory chain, disconnecting the PRh and BLA before the test session should again disrupt fear of the sound.</p>

<title>Experiment 1 – A demonstration of sensory preconditioned fear after few or many sound-light pairings in stage 1</title>
<p>The aim of Experiment 1 was to demonstrate sensory preconditioned fear among rats exposed to either the same number (eight) of sound-light pairings used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wong et al. (2019)</xref> or four times as many (32) pairings. Four groups of rats were exposed to presentations of a sound and light in stage 1. Two of these groups were exposed to just eight presentations of each stimulus (Groups P8 and U8); while the remaining two groups were exposed to 32 presentations of each stimulus (Groups P32 and U32). For one group in each of these pairs, the sound and light were paired (P) such that every sound presentation was immediately followed by a presentation of the light (Groups P8 and P32); while, for the remaining group, the sound and light were unpaired (U) such that each sound and light presentation occurred several minutes apart (Groups U8 and U32). All rats were then exposed to light-shock pairings in stage 2 (which commenced 24 h after stage 1) and, finally, tested with presentations of the sound alone and light alone in stage 3 (which commenced 48-72 h after stage 2).</p>
<sec id="s2a1">
<title>Conditioning</title>
<p>During conditioning in stage 2 and testing in stage 3, the baseline levels of freezing were low (&lt;10%) and did not differ between the groups (largest <italic>F</italic> &lt; 3.993). Conditioning of the light in stage 2 was successful in all groups. The mean (± SEM) levels of freezing to the light on its final pairing with shock were 72.5 ± 9.2% in Group P8, 88.6 ± 6.0% in Group U8, 67.5 ± 13.6% in Group P32, and 82.9 ± 11.9% in Group U32. There was a significant linear increase in freezing across the light-shock pairings (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,26)</sub> = 158.68; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; <italic>n<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> = .859, 95% CI: [1.929, 2.681]. The rate of increase did not differ between groups that had been exposed to either eight or 32 sound and light presentations in stage 1 (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,26)</sub> = 1.306; <italic>p</italic> = .264); nor between groups that had been exposed to paired or unpaired sound and light presentations in stage 1 (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,26)</sub> = 1.852; <italic>p</italic> = .185). There was no interaction between the rate of increase, the number of sound and light presentations, and the relation between the sound and light (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,26)</sub> = .283; <italic>p</italic> = .599). The overall comparisons of freezing to the light (averaged across the four conditioning trials) between groups that received either paired or unpaired stimulus presentations in stage 1 (factor 1), and between groups that received either eight or 32 sound and light exposures in stage 1 (factor 2), were not significant (<italic>F</italic>s &lt; .45, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .508). The interaction between these two between-subject factors was also not significant (<italic>F</italic> &lt; .45, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .508).</p>

<title>Test</title>
<p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> shows the mean (± SEM) levels of freezing to the sound alone (left panel) and light alone (right panel) averaged across the eight test presentations of each stimulus in Experiment 1. Rats that had been exposed to 32 presentations of the sound and light in stage 1 froze significantly more to the sound than rats that had been exposed to just eight presentations of the sound and light (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,26)</sub> = 38.986; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; <italic>n<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> = .600; 95% CI: [0.757, 1.500]); and rats that had been exposed to sound-light <italic>pairings</italic> in stage 1 froze significantly more to the sound than rats that had been exposed to <italic>unpaired</italic> presentations of the sound and light (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,26)</sub> = 75.983; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; <italic>n<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> = .745; 95% CI: [1.204, 1.947]). Importantly, there was a significant interaction between the number of stimulus presentations in stage 1 and the relation between the two stimuli (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,26)</sub> = 12.802; <italic>p</italic> = .001; <italic>n<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> = .330; 95% CI: [0.275, 1.018]). Inspection of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> shows that this was due to the difference in freezing to the sound between Groups P32 and U32 being greater than the difference in freezing to the sound between Groups P8 and U8. Together, these and our previous findings indicate that freezing to the sound requires formation of sound-light and light-shock memories in training (i.e., it is not due to generalization), and does not decrease as the number of sound-light pairings in stage 1 is increased: in fact, the evidence for sensory preconditioned fear increased with the number of sound-light pairings. Finally, there were no significant differences between the groups in levels of freezing to the light alone (<italic>F</italic>s &lt; 1.21; <italic>p</italic> &gt; .281).</p>

<title>Experiments 2A and 2B – The two types of integration can be dissociated by a stage 2 infusion of the NMDA receptor antagonist, DAP5</title>
<p>The sensory memory produced by pairings of an auditory and visual stimulus (e.g., sound-light) requires activation of NMDA receptors in the PRh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>); whereas the fear memory produced by pairings of an auditory or visual stimulus with foot shock (e.g., light-shock) requires activation of NMDA receptors in the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bauer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Keidar et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rodrigues et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Williams-Spooner et al., 2022</xref>). Accordingly, Experiments 2A and 2B examined whether sensory preconditioned fear of a sound requires activation of PRh NMDA receptors during the stage 2 session of light-shock pairings; and, critically, whether any such requirement depends on the number of sound-light pairings in stage 1.</p>
<p>In Experiment 2A, two groups of rats were exposed to eight sound-light pairings in stage 1 and a session of light-shock pairings in stage 2. Immediately prior to the stage 2 session, rats in one group received a PRh infusion of the NMDA receptor antagonist, DAP5, while rats in the other group received a PRh infusion of vehicle only. All rats were then tested with presentations of the sound alone and light alone in stage 3. Experiment 2B also involved two groups of rats. The treatment of these groups differed from their Experiment 2A counterparts in just one respect: in stage 1, they were exposed to 32 sound-light pairings.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wong et al (2019)</xref> showed that, among rats exposed to eight sound-light pairings in stage 1, acquisition of fear to the sound requires neuronal activity in the PRh in stage 2. Accordingly, among rats that received this number of sound-light pairings (Experiment 2A), we expected that acquisition of fear to the sound would require activation of PRh NMDA receptors in stage 2 and, hence, be impaired by the PRh infusion of DAP5 in stage 2. Such results would add further support to the claim that integration of the sound-light and light-shock memories in the protocol used by Wong et al. occurs through formation of a mediated sound-shock memory in stage 2, at the time of conditioning to the light.</p>
<p>By contrast, we expected the effects of the PRh DAP5 infusion to be different among rats exposed to 32 sound-light pairings in stage 1 (Experiment 2B). Specifically, we hypothesized that increasing the number of sound-light pairings from eight to 32 would change the way that rats integrate the sound-light and light-shock memories: they would cease to be integrated through formation of a mediated sound-shock memory and, instead, be integrated through chaining at the time of testing with the sound. Hence, we expected that, among rats exposed to 32 sound-light pairings in Experiment 2B, acquisition of fear to the sound would <italic>not</italic> require activation of PRh NMDA receptors in stage 2 and, hence, be unaffected by the PRh infusion of DAP5 immediately prior to stage 2: i.e., rats that receive a PRh infusion of DAP5 in stage 2 would freeze just as much during test presentations of the sound alone as the vehicle-infused controls.</p>

<p>This experiment has replicated previous findings that the PRh is not involved in the conditioning of fear responses to a stimulus that is directly paired with foot shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bang &amp; Brown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Campeau &amp; Davis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kholodar-Smith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lindquist et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Romanski &amp; LeDoux, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wilensky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wong et al., 2019</xref>). It has also revealed two new findings. The first is that, after few (eight) sound-light pairings in stage 1, acquisition of fear to the sound requires activation of PRh NMDA receptors across the session of light-shock pairings in stage 2 (Experiment 2A). The second is that, after many (32) sound-light pairings in stage 1, acquisition of fear to the sound does not require activation of PRh NMDA receptors in stage 2. Taken together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that increasing the number of sound-light pairings changes the way that rats integrate the sound-light and light-shock memories in a sensory preconditioning protocol. After few sound-light pairings, rats form a mediated sound-shock memory during conditioning of the light. After many sound-light pairings, rats no longer form a mediated sound-shock memory but, instead, chain the sound-light and light-shock memories when tested with the sound.</p>

Here, we examined whether communication between the PRh and BLA is necessary for integration of the sound-light and light-shock memories that form in sensory preconditioning. We first examined this communication requirement in stage 2 of the protocols involving either few (eight; Experiment 3A) or many (32; Experiment 3B) sound-light pairings in stage 1. In each of these experiments, rats underwent surgery in which an excitotoxic lesion of the PRh was created in one hemisphere and a single cannula was implanted in the BLA in either the same hemisphere (i.e., ipsilateral to the lesion; Groups IPSI) or the opposite hemisphere (i.e., contralateral to the lesion; Groups CONTRA). After recovery, these rats were exposed to either eight (Experiment 3A) or 32 (Experiment 3B) sound-light pairings in stage 1, and a session of light-shock pairings in stage 2. Immediately prior to this session, rats received a BLA infusion of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist, muscimol, which is widely used to silence neuronal activity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Helmstetter &amp; Bellgowan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wilensky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>). This infusion transiently disconnects the PRh and BLA for rats in Groups CONTRA, as these rats do not have a functioning PRh <italic>and</italic> BLA in either hemisphere, but spares PRh-BLA connectivity for rats in Groups IPSI, as these rats have a functioning PRh and BLA in one hemisphere. Finally, all rats were tested with presentations of the sound alone and light alone in stage 3.</p>
<p>The previous experiment showed that increasing the number of sound-light pairings in stage 1 changes how rats integrate the sound-light and light-shock memories to generate fear of the sound: it functionally shifts the integration from mediated (sound-shock) learning in stage 2 to chaining at test in stage 3. Accordingly, we hypothesized that, among rats exposed to eight sound-light pairings in stage 1 (Experiment 3A), integration of the sound-light and light-shock memories would require communication between the PRh and BLA in stage 2; and, hence, be impaired by the PRh-BLA disconnection in Group 8-CONTRA. That is, relative to rats in Group 8-IPSI, we expected that rats in Group 8-CONTRA would freeze just as much when tested with presentations of the directly conditioned light but significantly less when tested with presentations of the preconditioned sound. By contrast, among rats exposed to 32 sound-light pairings in stage 1 (Experiment 3B), we hypothesized that fear of the sound would not require communication between the PRh and BLA in stage 2; and, hence, would not be impaired by the PRh-BLA disconnection in Group 32-CONTRA.

This communication is also not needed for expression of fear to the sound among rats exposed to many sound-light pairings in stage 1: that is, after 32 sound-light pairings, disconnecting the PRh and BLA in stage 2 had no effect on the level of freezing to the sound during its testing in stage 3.

<title>Experiments 4A and 4B – After many sound-light pairings, integration requires communication between the PRh and BLA at test; after a few sound-light pairings, it does not</title>
<p>We next examined whether communication between the PRh and BLA is necessary for chaining of the sound-light and light-shock memories during testing with the sound. In each of Experiments 4A and 4B, rats underwent surgery in which an excitotoxic lesion of the PRh was created in one hemisphere and a single cannula was implanted in the BLA in either the ipsilateral hemisphere (Groups IPSI) or contralateral hemisphere (Groups CONTRA). After recovery, these rats were exposed to either eight (Experiment 4A) or 32 (Experiment 4B) sound-light pairings in stage 1, followed a day or so later by a session of light-shock pairings in stage 2. Two days later, all rats were tested with the sound alone and, the next day, with the light alone. Immediately prior to each test session, rats received a BLA infusion of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist, muscimol. As noted previously, this infusion transiently disconnects the PRh and BLA for rats in Groups CONTRA, as these rats do not have a functioning PRh <italic>and</italic> BLA in either hemisphere, but spares PRh-BLA connectivity for rats in Groups IPSI, as these rats have a functioning PRh and BLA in one hemisphere.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that, among rats exposed to eight sound-light pairings in stage 1 (Experiment 4A), the mediated sound-shock memory that forms in stage 2 may require communication between the PRh and BLA for its retrieval/expression in stage 3. We additionally hypothesized that, among rats exposed to 32 sound-light pairings in stage 1 (Experiment 4B), chaining of the sound-light and light-shock memories at test would also require communication between the PRh and BLA at the time of testing with the sound: e.g., because the sound activates the PRh-dependent sound-light memory; which, in turn, activates the BLA-dependent light-shock memory. Hence, we expected that the test level of freezing to the sound would be impaired by the PRh-BLA disconnection in Groups 8-CONTRA (Experiment 4A) and 32-CONTRA (Experiment 4B). That is, relative to rats in Groups 8-IPSI, we expected that rats in Groups 8-CONTRA and 32-CONTRA would freeze just as much when tested with presentations of the directly conditioned light but significantly less when tested with presentations of the preconditioned sound.</p>

<title>Experiment 4B – Rats exposed to 32 sound-light pairings in stage 1</title>

<title>Conditioning</title>
<p>The baseline levels of freezing during conditioning and test sessions were low (&lt;10%) and did not differ between groups (largest <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,18)</sub> = 1.956; <italic>p</italic> = .176). Conditioning was successful. The mean (± SEM) levels of freezing to the light on its final pairing with shock were 62.5 ± 12.8% in Group 32-IPSI and 60 ± 7.8% in Group 32-CONTRA. Freezing to the light increased across its four pairings with shock in stage 2 (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,18)</sub> = 76.364; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; <italic>n<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> = .809; 95% CI: [1.724, 2.815]). The rate of this increase did not differ between groups (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,18)</sub> = .041; <italic>p</italic> = .842), and there were no significant group differences in overall levels of freezing (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,18)</sub> = .142; <italic>p</italic> = .711).</p>

<title>Test</title>
<p><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> shows mean (± SEM) levels of freezing averaged across the eight test presentations of the sound alone (left panel) and light alone (right panel) in Experiment 4B. Both groups showed equivalent levels of freezing to the directly conditioned light (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,18)</sub> = .033; <italic>p</italic> = .858). However, Group 32-CONTRA showed significantly lower levels of freezing to the sensory preconditioned sound compared to Group 32-IPSI (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,18)</sub> = 7.963; <italic>p</italic> = .011; <italic>n<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> = .307; 95% CI: [0.178, 1.218]).</p>
<p>This experiment has shown that communication between the PRh and BLA is not necessary for the retrieval/expression of a direct light-shock fear memory: regardless of the number of sound-light pairings in stage 1, disconnecting the PRh and BLA prior to testing had no effect on freezing to the light. This communication is also not needed for expression of fear to the sound among rats exposed to just a few sound-light pairings in stage 1: that is, after eight sound-light pairings, disconnecting the PRh and BLA prior to testing had no effect on the level of freezing to the sound. By contrast, communication between the PRh and BLA is needed for expression of fear to the sound among rats exposed to many sound-light pairings in stage 1: that is, after 32 sound-light pairings, disconnecting the PRh and BLA prior to testing disrupted freezing to the sound. We take these results to mean that communication between the PRh and BLA is <italic>not</italic> needed for retrieval/expression of the mediated sound-shock memory after few sound-light pairings; but <italic>is</italic> needed for chaining of the sound-light and light-shock memories at test after many sound-light pairings. They are considered further in the General Discussion.</p>

<title>General discussion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wong et al. (2019)</xref> provided evidence for online integration of sensory and emotional memories in the rat medial temporal lobe. Specifically, they showed that rats integrate a past sound-light memory with an emotional light-shock memory during formation of the latter; and that this integration takes the form of a mediated sound-shock association. The present study has advanced the Wong et al. findings in three ways. First, it has shown that the way in which rats integrate the sound-light and light-shock memories depends on the number of sound-light pairings in stage 1: after just a few sound-light pairings, integration is achieved through mediated learning about the sound in stage 2; and after many sound-light pairings, integration is achieved through chaining of the sound-light and light-shock memories during testing with the sound. Second, it has shown that mediated conditioning of the sound involves activation of NMDA receptors in the PRh. Mediated conditioning also involves communication between the PRh and BLA across the light-shock pairings but does not require such communication for expression of fear to the sound at test. Third, it has shown that, when integration occurs through chaining of the sound-light and light-shock memories at test, this process also involves communication between the PRh and BLA.</p>
<p>Why does increasing the number of sound-light pairings change the way that rats integrate the sound-light and light-shock memories? One possibility is that increasing the number of sound-light pairings in stage 1 reduces the ability of each stimulus to activate the memory of the other. This is consistent with findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Holland (1998)</xref>, who showed that the likelihood of mediated learning in rats decreases with the amount of training (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Holland, 2005</xref>); but inconsistent with our findings that, after extended training, rats continue to integrate the sound-light and light-shock associations through chaining at the time of testing (as chaining is predicated on the sound activating the memory of the light after extended training). Instead, we propose that the change in integration occurs because the increased number of sound-light pairings allows the rats to learn about the order in which the sound and light are presented (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>; for evidence that rats acquire order information in sensory preconditioning, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barnet et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hart et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Leising et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Miller &amp; Barnet, 1993</xref>). This order hypothesis is consistent with evidence showing that the way in which animals represent an audio-visual compound changes across repeated compound exposures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bellingham &amp; Gillette, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Holmes &amp; Harris, 2009</xref>). It can be tested using a so-called “backward” sensory preconditioning protocol, which reverses the order of stimulus presentations in stage 1 (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ward-Robinson &amp; Hall, 1996</xref>). That is, rather than rats being exposed to the “forward” sound-light pairings used here and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wong et al. (2019)</xref>, rats in a backward protocol are exposed to light-sound pairings. Increasing the number of light-sound pairings in this protocol should result in rats learning that the light is followed by the sound (light➔sound) and that the sound is followed by nothing (sound➔nothing). Hence, during the session of light-shock pairings in stage 2, the light should continue to activate the memory of the sound, resulting in formation of the mediated sound-shock association (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ward-Robinson &amp; Hall, 1996</xref>). That is, if our order hypothesis is correct, increasing the number of light-sound pairings in the backward protocol should preserve the likelihood of mediated learning in stage 2 and, if anything, diminish the likelihood of chaining at test in stage 3 (as the sound is never followed by a light). Hence, PRh manipulations that fail to affect fear of the sound when administered after many sound-light pairings (e.g., infusion of DAP5) should disrupt that fear when administered after many light-sound pairings in the backward protocol. This will be assessed in future work.</p>
<p>The present findings advance those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wong et al. (2019)</xref> by showing that, after just a few sound-light pairings in stage 1, formation of the mediated sound-shock association requires activation of NMDA receptors in the PRh, and communication between the PRh and BLA during conditioning of the light. Communication between the PRh and BLA is likely required so that information about the sound, which is encoded in the PRh during stage 1, can be integrated with information about the shock, which is processed in the BLA. It may also be required to consolidate the mediated sound-shock association in long-term memory. That is, we have previously shown that neuronal activity in the PRh is necessary for consolidation of the mediated sound-shock association in stage 2 as well as retrieval/expression of this association at the time of testing in stage 3: i.e., rats do not display fear responses to the sound when activity in the PRh is silenced immediately after the session of light-shock pairings in stage 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wong et al., 2019</xref>), or prior to testing with the sound alone in stage 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wong et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, communication between the PRh and BLA is not only needed for acquisition of the mediated sound-shock association: it must also be needed to consolidate the mediated association through changes in activity in the PRh. Accordingly, we propose that formation of the mediated sound-shock association requires bidirectional communication between the PRh and BLA: acquisition of the mediated sound-shock association requires communication from the PRh-to-BLA, which is the presumed locus of the mediated sound-shock association; whereas consolidation of this association requires communication from the BLA-to-PRh, which ultimately stores the mediated sound-shock association in long-term memory.</p>
<p>While the PRh and BLA clearly communicate to support mediated learning about the sound, this communication is not required for retrieval/expression of the mediated sound-shock association at the time of testing. This result is somewhat surprising as activity in the PRh is needed for expression of fear to the sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wong et al., 2019</xref>) and raises the question: how does the PRh-dependent sound-shock association come to be expressed in fear responses? One possibility is through projections from the PRh to other sub-territories of the amygdala. For example, in addition to its strong reciprocal connections with the BLA, the PRh projects to the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">McDonald, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pitkänen et al., 2000</xref>; but see Shi &amp; Casell, 1999), which interacts with midbrain regions (e.g., periaqueductal gray, hypothalamus; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">LeDoux et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Rizvi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Weera et al., 2021</xref>) to coordinate different components of the fear response (autonomic, endocrine, behavioral). Importantly, this projection from the PRh-to-CeA is unidirectional and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been assessed for its involvement in sensory preconditioning. We hypothesize that this pathway is the means by which the mediated sound-shock association comes to be expressed in fear responses; and, further, that the PRh-to-BLA and PRh-to-CeA pathways may be differentially involved in the acquisition and retrieval/expression of the mediated sound-shock association. Formation of the mediated sound-shock association in stage 2 of the preconditioning protocol requires communication between the PRh and BLA but may not require communication between the PRh and CeA. By contrast, retrieval/expression of the mediated sound-shock association during testing in stage 3 does not require communication between the PRh and BLA but may require communication between the PRh and CeA.</p>
<p>The present study has also shown that, after many sound-light pairings in stage 1, communication between the PRh and BLA is needed for chaining of the sound-light and light-shock memories at the time of testing with the sound. Importantly, this communication requirement was specific to the time of testing: disconnecting the PRh and BLA across the session of light-shock pairings had no effect on fear of the sound or light at test. It was also specific to the generation of fear responses to the sound: disconnecting the PRh and BLA prior to testing in stage 3 had no effect on fear responses to the directly conditioned light. We propose that, after many sound-light pairings, communication between the PRh and BLA is needed for completion of the sound-light-shock associative chain at test, as the first link in this chain (sound-light) was encoded in the PRh in stage 1 and the second link (light-shock) was encoded in the BLA in stage 2. Future work will examine whether communication between the PRh and BLA is always required for this type of integration (chaining at test). Specifically, we will examine whether communication between the PRh and BLA is required for chaining of the sound-light and light-shock memories under circumstances where the sound-light memory was not encoded in the PRh: e.g., after just one sound-light pairing in stage 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Qureshi et al., 2023</xref>), or when the sound-light pairings are administered in a dangerous context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2018</xref>). We will also examine whether integration always occurs through chaining after many sound-light pairings, or whether there are manipulations that can restore the potential for mediated learning (e.g., manipulations that restore the relative novelty of the sound and light in stage 2, such as the lapse of time).</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that the procedure used to disconnect the PRh and BLA permits inferences about whether these regions communicate to support sensory preconditioned fear but leaves open the question of whether any communication requirement is direct or indirect. Indeed, several brain regions have been shown to regulate aspects of sensory preconditioned fear in rats, including the orbitofrontal cortex, prelimbic cortex and dorsal hippocampus (for a review, see Holmes et al., 2021); and the two cortical regions have direct, reciprocal connections with <italic>both</italic> the PRh and BLA. As such, it remains for future work to determine whether the PRh and BLA communicate directly or indirectly to support mediated learning and/or chaining of the sound-light and light-shock memories at test; and, if found to communicate indirectly, whether the indirect communication involves neuronal activity in the orbitofrontal and/or prelimbic cortex.</p>
<p>In summary, the present study has advanced the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wong et al. (2019)</xref> findings by showing that how rats integrate sensory and emotional memories in sensory preconditioning depends on the novelty/familiarity of the auditory and visual stimuli. When the stimuli are relatively novel (i.e., after just a few sound-light pairings in stage 1), the sensory and emotional memories are integrated through mediated learning, and when the stimuli are relatively familiar (i.e., after many sound-light pairings in stage 1), those same memories are integrated through chaining at test. It has also shown that both forms of integration are critically dependent on communication between two regions of the medial temporal lobe, the PRh and BLA; and that this communication is specifically needed for integration of the sensory and emotional memories: i.e., communication between the PRh and BLA was not needed for acquisition, consolidation or retrieval/expression of the emotional light-shock memory. Future work will examine whether this communication requirement is direct or indirect, and how the PRh and BLA work with other regions of the brain (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex, prelimbic cortex, hippocampus) to achieve successful integration.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Subjects were experimentally naïve male and female Long-Evans rats, obtained from a colony maintained by the Biological Resources Centre at the University of New South Wales. The rats were housed by sex in plastic cages (40 cm wide x 22 cm high x 67 cm long), with four rats per cage and food and water continuously available. The cages were located in an air-conditioned and humidity-controlled colony room maintained on a 12 h light-dark cycle (lights on at 7 a.m. and off at 7 p.m.) at a temperature of approximately 21°C.</p>

<title>Surgery</title>
<p>Prior to behavioral training and testing in Experiments 2A and 2B, rats were surgically implanted with cannulas targeting the perirhinal cortex (PRh). Rats were anesthetized using isoflurane, which was delivered in a steady stream of oxygen. The rat was then mounted onto a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments) and incisions made over the skull. Two holes were drilled through the skull and 26-gauge guide cannulas (Plastic Ones) were implanted into the brain, one in each hemisphere. The tips of the cannulas targeted the PRh at coordinates 4.30 mm posterior to Bregma, 5.00 mm lateral to the midline, 8.4 mm ventral to Bregma, and angled at approximately 9° (Paxinos &amp; Watson, 2007). Guide cannulas were secured in place with four jeweller’s screws and dental cement. A dummy cannula was kept in each guide cannula at all times except during drug infusions. Immediately after surgery, rats received a subcutaneous (SC) injection of a prophylactic dose (0.1 ml/kg) of Duplocillin (Merck &amp; Co, NJ, USA). Rats were allowed seven days to recover from surgery, during which they were monitored and weighed daily.</p>
<p>Prior to behavioral training and testing in Experiments 3A, 3B, 4A and 4B, rats underwent surgery for excitotoxic lesion of the PRh in the right hemisphere and the implantation of a single 26-gauge cannula (PlasticsOne) targeting the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA). Excitotoxic lesion of the PRh was achieved via two micro-injections of 0.09M NMDA. These injections were made using a 1μl Hamilton syringe fixed to an infusion pump (Harvard Apparatus). The pump was programmed to inject a total of 0.25μl at a rate of 0.1μl/min. The needle remained in place for an additional 5 min after injection was complete to allow for diffusion of the drug. The tip of the needle targeted the PRh at coordinates 4.00 mm and 4.50 mm posterior to Bregma, 5.00 mm and 5.1 mm lateral to the midline, 8.9 mm ventral to Bregma, and angled at approximately 9° (Paxinos &amp; Watson, 2007). The cannula targeted the BLA at coordinates 2.4 mm posterior to Bregma, 4.9 mm lateral to the midline, and 8.4 mm ventral to Bregma (Paxinos &amp; Watson, 2007). For rats in the contralateral condition (Groups CONTRA), the cannula was implanted into the opposite hemisphere to the lesion, and for rats in the ipsilateral condition (Groups IPSI), the cannula was implanted into the same hemisphere as the lesion.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Drug infusions</title>
<p>In Experiments 2A and 2B, the NMDA receptor antagonist, DAP5, or vehicle was infused bilaterally into the PRh. In Experiments 3A, 3B, 4A and 4B, muscimol or vehicle was infused unilaterally into the BLA. For these infusions, infusion cannulas were connected to 25 μl Hamilton syringes via polyethylene tubing. These syringes were fixed to an infusion pump (Harvard Apparatus). The infusion procedure began by removing the dummy caps from the guide cannulas on each rat and inserting 33-gauge infusion cannulas in its place. The pump was programmed to infuse a total of 0.5 μl of DAP5 at a rate of 0.25 μl/min, and a total of 0.3 μl of muscimol at a rate of 0.1 μl/min, which resulted in a total infusion time of two min and three min respectively. The infusion cannulas remained in place for an additional two min after the infusion was complete to allow for diffusion of the drug into the PRh or BLA tissue and to avoid reuptake when the infusion cannula was withdrawn. This resulted in a total infusion time of four min for DAP5 and five min for muscimol. After the additional two min, the infusion cannulas were removed and replaced with dummy cannulas. The day prior to infusions, the dummy cannula was removed and the infusion pump was activated to familiarize the rats with the procedure and thereby minimize any effect of procedure on the day of infusions.</p>

<p>NMDA (Sigma, Australia) was dissolved in 10x phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) to yield a final concentration of 0.09M and injected into the PRh during surgery. The NMDA receptor antagonist, DAP5 (Sigma, Australia) was prepared in the manner described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Williams-Spooner et al. (2022)</xref>. Briefly, it was dissolved in ACSF to a concentration of 10 μg/μl and injected into the PRh as described above. The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist, muscimol, (Tocris Bioscience, UK) and prepared in the manner described by Parkes and Westbrook (2010).

<title>Histology</title>
<p>After behavioral training and testing, rats were euthanized with a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital. The brains were extracted and sectioned into 40 μm coronal slices. Every second slice was mounted onto a glass microscope slide and stained with cresyl violet. The placement of the cannula tip was determined under a microscope using the boundaries defined by Paxinos and Watson (2006). Rats with misplaced cannulas were excluded from statistical analysis. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> shows placement of the most ventral portion of these cannulas in the PRh for all rats that were included in the statistical analyses of data from Experiments 2A and 2B. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> shows the approximate lesion size in the PRh and the most ventral point of the cannulas in the BLA, respectively, for all rats included in the statistical analysis from Experiments 3A, 3B, 4A and 4B.

<title>Behavioral apparatus</title>
<p>All experiments were conducted in four identical chambers (30 cm wide x 26 cm long x 30 cm high). The side walls and ceiling were made of aluminum, and the front and back walls of clear plastic. The floor consisted of stainless steel rods, each two mm in diameter and spaced 13 mm apart (center-to-center). A waste tray containing bedding material was located under the floor. At the end of each session, the chambers were cleaned with water and any soiled bedding was removed from the waste trays and replaced with fresh bedding. Each chamber was enclosed in a sound- and light-attenuating wooden cabinet. The cabinet walls were painted black. A speaker and LED lights within a fluorescent tube were mounted onto the back wall of each cabinet. The speaker was used to deliver a 1000 Hz square-wave tone stimulus, presented at 75 dB when measured at the center of the chamber (digital sound meter: Dick Smith Electronics, Australia). The LED lights were used to deliver a flashing light stimulus, presented at 3.5 Hz. A custom-built, constant current generator was used to deliver a 0.5 s duration, 0.8 mA intensity shock to the floor of each chamber. Each chamber was illuminated with an infrared light source, and a camera mounted on the back wall of each cabinet was used to record the behavior of each rat. The cameras were connected to a monitor and a high-definition digital image recorder located in an adjacent room. This room also contained the computer that controlled stimulus and shock presentations through an interface and appropriate software (MATLAB, MathWorks, USA).</p>

<sec id="s4g2">
<title>Sensory preconditioning</title>
<p>Rats received either eight presentations of the sound and eight of the light in a single session, or 32 presentations of the sound and 32 of the light across four daily sessions. On Day 3, all rats received eight presentations of the sound and eight of the light. Each presentation of the sound was 30 s in duration and each presentation of the light was 10 s in duration. The first stimulus presentation occurred five min after rats were placed into the chambers. The offset of one stimulus co-occurred with the onset of the other stimulus for groups that received paired presentations of the sound and the light, while these stimuli were presented separately for groups that received explicitly unpaired presentations. The interval between each paired presentation was five min while the interval between each separately presented stimulus was 150 s. After the last stimulus presentation, rats remained in the chambers for an additional one min. They were then returned to their home cages. This training was repeated on Days 4-6 for rats that received 32 presentations of the sound and 32 of the light. All rats proceeded to first-order conditioning (details below) the day after their final session of sound and light exposures, which was Day 4 for rats exposed to eight presentations of the sound and light and Day 7 for rats exposed to 32 presentations of the sound and light.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the sound and the light were fully counterbalanced for all experiments. That is, for half of the rats in each group, the sound was the preconditioned stimulus and the light was the conditioned stimulus; while for the remainder, the light was the preconditioned stimulus and the sound was the conditioned stimulus. However, for convenience of explanation, all designs will be described with reference to one half of the counterbalancing: that for which the sound was the preconditioned stimulus and the light was the conditioned stimulus.</p>

<p>On Day 4 (eight sound and light exposures) or Day 7 (32 sound and light exposures), all rats received four presentations of the light and four presentations of foot shock. The first light presentation occurred five min after rats were placed in the chambers. Each 10 s light co-terminated with foot shock and the interval between light-shock pairings was five min. Rats remained in the chambers for an additional one min after the final stimulus presentation and were then returned to their home cages.</p>

<title>Context extinction</title>
<p>On Day 5 (eight sound and light exposures) or Day 8 (32 sound and light exposures), rats received two 20 min exposures to the chambers, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon. These exposures were intended to extinguish any freezing elicited by the context and thereby provide a measure of the level of freezing to the sound and the light unconfounded by context elicited freezing. On Day 6 (eight sound and light exposures) or Day 9 (32 sound and light exposures), rats received a further 10 min extinction exposure to the context.</p>

<title>Test</title>
<p>On Day 6 (eight sound and light exposures) or Day 9 (32 sound and light exposures), approximately two hours after the context extinction session, rats were tested for their levels of freezing to the preconditioned sound. On Day 7 (eight sound and light exposures) or Day 10 (32 sound and light exposures), rats were tested for their levels of freezing to the conditioned light. For each test, the first stimulus was presented two min after rats were placed in the chambers. Each test consisted of eight stimulus alone presentations, with a three min interval between each presentation. Each sound presentation was 30 s in duration and each light presentation was 10 s. Rats remained in the chamber for an additional min after the final stimulus presentation.</p>

<title>Scoring and statistics</title>
<p>Conditioning and test sessions were recorded. Freezing, defined as the absence of all movements except those required for breathing (Fanselow, 1980), was used as a measure of conditioned fear. Freezing data were collected using a time-sampling procedure in which each rat was scored as either ‘freezing’ or ‘not freezing’ every two seconds by an observer blind to the rat’s group allocation. A percentage score was then calculated by dividing the number of samples scored as freezing by the total number of samples. The baseline level of freezing was established by scoring the first two min at the start of each experimental session: i.e., we divided the total number of samples scored as freezing by the total number of observed samples, which was 60. The levels of freezing to the 10 s conditioned stimulus and 30 s preconditioned stimulus were established in a similar manner: we scored the entire period of each stimulus presentation and divided the number of samples scored as freezing by the total number of observed samples, which was 5 for each presentation of the conditioned stimulus and 15 for each presentation of the preconditioned stimulus. A second blind observer scored a randomly selected 50% of the data. The correlation between the scores was high (Pearson &gt; 0.9). The data were analyzed using a set of planned orthogonal contrasts (Hays, 1963), with the Type 1 error rate controlled at α = 0.05. Standardized 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported for significant results, and partial eta-squared (<italic>n<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup></italic>) is reported as a measure of effect size (where 0.01, 0.06, and 0.14 is a small, medium and large effect size respectively). The required number of rats per group was determined during the design stage of the study. It was based on our prior studies of sensory preconditioning which indicated that eight subjects per group (or per comparison in the contrast testing procedure) provides sufficient statistical power to detect effect sizes &gt; 0.5 with the recommended probability of 0.8-0.9.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study is an important follow-up to their prior work - Wong et al. (2019), starting with clear questions and hypotheses, followed by a series of thoughtful and organized experiments. The method and results are convincing. Experiment 1 demonstrated the sensory preconditioned fear with few (8) or many (32) sound-light pairings. Experiments 2A and 2B showed the role of PRh NMDA receptors during conditioning for online integration, revealing that this contribution is present only after few sound-light pairings, not after many sound-light pairings. Experiments 3A and 3B showed the contribution of PRh-BLA communication to online integration, again only after few but not after many. Contrary to Experiments 3A and 3B, Experiments 4A and 4B showed the contribution of PRh-BLA communication to integration at test only after many but not few sound-light pairings.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Throughout the manuscript, the methods and results are clearly organized and described, and the use of statistics is solid, all contributing to the overall clarity of the research. The discussion section was also well written, effectively comparing the current research with the prior work and offering insightful interpretations and potential future directions for this line of research.</p>
<p>All my previous concerns have been well addressed in this revised version. I do not have further concerns about the current version of this manuscript.</p>

<p>This manuscript builds on the authors' earlier work, most recently Wong et al. 2019, in which they showed the importance of the perirhinal cortex (PRh) during the first-order conditioning stage of sensory preconditioning. Sensory preconditioning requires learning between two neutral stimuli (S2-S1) and subsequent development of a conditioned response to one of the neutral stimuli after pairing of the other stimulus with a motivationally relevant unconditioned stimulus (S1-US). One highly debated question regarding the mechanisms of learning of sensory preconditioning has been whether conditioned responses evoked by the indirectly trained stimulus (S2) occur through a mediated representation at the time of the first-order US training, or whether the conditioned responses develop through a chained evoked representation (S2--&gt; S1 --&gt; US) at the time of test. The authors' prior findings provided strong evidence for PRh being involved in mediated learning during the first-order training. They showed that protein synthesis was required during the first-order S1-US learning to support the conditioned response to the indirectly trained stimulus (S2) at test.</p>
<p>One question remaining following the previous paper was whether certain conditions may promote a chaining mechanism over mediated learning, as there is some evidence for chained representations at the time of test. In this paper, the authors directly address this important question and find unambiguous results that the extent of training during the preconditioning stage impacts the involvement of PRh during the first-order conditioning or stage 2. They show that putative blockade of synaptic changes in PRh, using an NMDA antagonist, disrupts responding to the preconditioned cue at test during shorter duration preconditioning training (8 trials), but not during extended training (32 trials). They also show that this is the case for communication between the PRh and BLA during the same stage of training using a contralateral inactivation approach. This confirms their previous findings in 2019 of connectivity between these regions for the short duration training, while they observe here for the first time that this is not the case for extended training. Finally, they show that with extended training, communication between BLA and the PRh is required at the final test of the preconditioned stimulus, but not for the short duration training.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The results are clear and extremely consistent across experiments within this paper as well as with earlier work. The experiments here are thorough, well-conceived, and address an important and highly debated question in the field regarding the neural and psychological mechanisms underlying sensory preconditioning. This work is highly impactful for the field as the debate over mediated versus chaining mechanisms has been an important topic for more than 70 years.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>Thank you for addressing all of my concerns in considerable detail. I have no more suggestions for the authors. This is a fantastic paper both in the experimental design and the execution as well as in the high quality of writing.</p>

<p>The authors tested whether: 1. The number of stimulus-stimulus pairings alters whether preconditioned fear depends on online integration during formation of the stimulus-outcome memory or during the probe test/mobilization phase, when the original stimulus, which was never paired with aversive events, elicits fear via chaining of stimulus-stimulus and stimulus-outcome memories. They found that sensory preconditioning was successful with either 8 or 32 stimulus-stimulus pairings. Perirhinal cortex NMDA receptor blockade during stimulus-outcome learning impaired preconditioning following 8 but not 32 pairings during preconditioning. Therefore, perirhinal cortex NMDA activity is required for online integration or mediated learning. Perirhinal-basolateral amygdala had nearly identical effects with the same interpretation: these areas communicate during stimulus-outcome learning, and this online communication is required for later expressing preconditioned fear. Disconnection prior to the probe test, when chaining might occur, had different effects: it impaired the expression of preconditioned fear in rats that received 32, but not 8, pairings during preconditioning. The study has several strengths and provides a thoughtful discussion of future experiments. The study is highly impactful and significant; the authors were successful in describing the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms of mediated learning versus chaining in sensory preconditioning, which is often debated in the learning field. Therefore this study will have a significant impact on the behavioral neurobiology and learning fields.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Careful, rigorous experimental design and statistics</p>
<p>The discussion leaves open questions that are very much worth exploring. For example - why did perirhinal-amygdala disconnection prior to the probe have no effect in the 8-pairing group, when bilateral perirhinal inactivation did (in Wong et al, 2019)? The authors propose that perirhinal cortex outputs bypass the amygdala during the probe test, which is an excellent hypothesis to test.</p>
<p>The experiments are very explicitly hypothesis-driven, and the authors provide evidence of how and why mediated learning and chaining occur during sensory-sensory learning.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study is an important follow-up to their prior work - Wong et al. (2019), starting with clear questions and hypotheses, followed by a series of thoughtful and organized experiments. The method and results are convincing. Experiment 1 demonstrated the sensory preconditioned fear with few (8) or many (32) sound-light pairings. Experiments 2A and 2B showed the role of PRh NMDA receptors during conditioning for online integration, revealing that this contribution is present only after a few sound-light pairings, not after many sound-light pairings. Experiments 3A and 3B showed the contribution of PRh-BLA communication to online integration, again only after a few but not after many. Contrary to Experiments 3A and 3B, Experiments 4A and 4B showed the contribution of PRh-BLA communication to integration at test only after many but not few sound-light pairings.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Throughout the manuscript, the methods and results are clearly organized and described, and the use of statistics is solid, all contributing to the overall clarity of the research. The discussion section was also well-written, effectively comparing the current research with the prior work and offering insightful interpretations and potential future directions for this line of research. I have only a limited amount of concerns about some results and some details of experiments/statistics.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Could you provide further interpretation regarding line 171: the observation that sensory preconditioned fear increased with the number of sound-light pairings? Was this increase due to better sound-light association learning during Stage 1? Additionally, were there any experimental differences between Experiment 1 and the other experiments that might explain why freezing was higher in the P32 group compared to the P8 group? This pattern seemed to be absent in the other experiments. If we consider the hypothesis that the online integration mechanism is more active with fewer pairings and the chaining mechanism at the test is more prominent with many pairings, we wouldn't expect a difference between the P8 and P32 groups. Given the relatively small sample size in Experiment 1, the authors might consider conducting a cross-experiment analysis or something similar to investigate this further.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s point and thank them for the question. The heightened level of sensory preconditioned fear among rats that received many sound-light pairings in the initial control experiment (Group P32) may reflect the combined effects of both mediated learning and chaining at test. We are, however, reluctant to offer a strong interpretation of this result as it was not replicated in the subsequent experiments: i.e., the levels of freezing to the sensory preconditioned stimulus at test were almost identical among vehicle-injected controls that received either few (8) or many (32) sound-light pairings in Experiments 2A and 2B; and this was also true in Experiments 3A and 3B, and again in Experiments 4A and 4B. A key difference between the initial and subsequent experiments is that, in contrast to the initial experiment, rats in subsequent experiments underwent surgery for one reason or another (implantation of cannulas, lesion of the perirhinal cortex). The implication is that surgical interventions in the perirhinal cortex and/or basolateral amygdala might affect the way that rats integrate the sound-light and light-shock associations in sensory preconditioning: i.e., they may force rats to rely on one type of integration strategy or the other. This is, of course, purely speculative – it will be addressed in future research.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript builds on the authors' earlier work, most recently Wong et al. 2019, in which they showed the importance of the perirhinal cortex (PRh) during the first-order conditioning stage of sensory preconditioning. Sensory preconditioning requires learning between two neutral stimuli (S2-S1) and subsequent development of a conditioned response to one of the neutral stimuli after pairing of the other stimulus with a motivationally relevant unconditioned stimulus (S1-US). One highly debated question regarding the mechanisms of learning of sensory preconditioning has been whether conditioned responses evoked by the indirectly trained stimulus (S2) occur through a mediated representation at the time of the first-order US training, or whether the conditioned responses develop through a chained evoked representation (S2--&gt; S1 --&gt; US) at the time of test. The authors' prior findings provided strong evidence for PRh being involved in mediated learning during the first-order training. They showed that protein synthesis was required during the first-order S1-US learning to support the conditioned response to the indirectly trained stimulus (S2) at the test.</p>
<p>One question remaining following the previous paper was whether certain conditions may promote a chaining mechanism over mediated learning, as there is some evidence for chained representations at the time of the test. In this paper, the authors directly address this important question and find unambiguous results that the extent of training during the preconditioning stage impacts the involvement of PRh during the first-order conditioning or stage 2. They show that putative blockade of synaptic changes in PRh, using an NMDA antagonist, disrupts responding to the preconditioned cue at test during shorter duration preconditioning training (8 trials), but not during extended training (32 trials). They also show that this is the case for communication between the PRh and BLA during the same stage of training using a contralateral inactivation approach. This confirms their previous findings in 2019 of connectivity between these regions for the short-duration training, while they observe here for the first time that this is not the case for extended training. Finally, they show that with extended training, communication between BLA and the PRh is required at the final test of the preconditioned stimulus, but not for the short duration training.</p>
<p>The results are clear and extremely consistent across experiments within this paper as well as with earlier work. The experiments here are thorough, and well-conceived, and address an important and highly debated question in the field regarding the neural and psychological mechanisms underlying sensory preconditioning. This work is highly impactful for the field as the debate over mediated versus chaining mechanisms has been an important topic for more than 70 years.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors tested whether the number of stimulus-stimulus pairings alters whether preconditioned fear depends on online integration during the formation of the stimulus-outcome memory or during the probe test/mobilization phase, when the original stimulus, which was never paired with aversive events, elicits fear via chaining of stimulus-stimulus and stimulus-outcome memories. They found that sensory preconditioning was successful with either 8 or 32 stimulus-stimulus pairings. Perirhinal cortex NMDA receptor blockade during stimulus-outcome learning impaired preconditioning following 8 but not 32 pairings during preconditioning. Therefore, perirhinal cortex NMDA activity is required for online integration or mediated learning. Perirhinal-basolateral amygdala had nearly identical effects with the same interpretation: these areas communicate during stimulus-outcome learning, and this online communication is required for later expressing preconditioned fear. Disconnection prior to the probe test, when chaining might occur, had different effects: it impaired the expression of preconditioned fear in rats that received 32, but not 8, pairings during preconditioning. The study has several strengths and provides a thoughtful discussion of future experiments. The study is highly impactful and significant; the authors were successful in describing the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms of mediated learning versus chaining in sensory preconditioning, which is often debated in the learning field. Therefore this study will have a significant impact on the behavioral neurobiology and learning fields.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Careful, rigorous experimental design and statistics.</p>
<p>The discussion leaves open questions that are very much worth exploring. For example - why did perirhinal-amygdala disconnection prior to the probe have no effect in the 8-pairing group, when bilateral perirhinal inactivation did (in Wong et al, 2019)? The authors propose that perirhinal cortex outputs bypass the amygdala during the probe test, which is an excellent hypothesis to test.</p>
<p>The authors provide evidence that both mediated learning and chaining occur.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the positive assessment – we fully intend to identify the circuitry that regulates retrieval/expression of sensory preconditioned fear when it is based on mediated learning in stage 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This is inherent to all neural interference and behavioral experiments: biological/psychological functions do not typically operate binarily. There is no single clear number or parameter at which mediated learning or chaining happens, and both probably happen to some extent. Addressing this is even more difficult given behavioral variability across subjects, implant sites, etc. Thus, this is not so much a weakness particular to this study as much as an existential problem, which the authors were able to work around with careful experimental design and appropriate controls.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We completely agree with the point raised here and thank the reviewer for their assessment.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) It appears that the method description for Sensory Preconditioning was copied from their previous Wong et al. (2019) paper, which is fine, but in the current research, the authors use 8 or 32 presentations, which is not reflected in the description.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. This is now addressed in the method section on page 27 (beginning at line 655):</p>
<p>“Rats received either eight presentations of the sound and eight of the light in a single session, or 32 presentations of the sound and 32 of the light across four daily sessions. On Day 3, all rats received eight presentations of the sound and eight of the light. Each presentation of the sound was 30 s in duration and each presentation of the light was 10 s in duration. The first stimulus presentation occurred five min after rats were placed into the chambers. The offset of one stimulus co-occurred with the onset of the other stimulus for groups that received paired presentations of the sound and the light, while these stimuli were presented separately for groups that received explicitly unpaired presentations. The interval between each paired presentation was five min while the interval between each separately presented stimulus was 150 s. After the last stimulus presentation, rats remained in the chambers for an additional one min. They were then returned to their home cages. This training was repeated on Days 4-6 for rats that received 32 presentations of the sound and 32 of the light. All rats proceeded to first-order conditioning (details below) the day after their final session of sound and light exposures, which was Day 4 for rats exposed to eight presentations of the sound and light and Day 7 for rats exposed to 32 presentations of the sound and light.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Line 148: Could the authors clarify how the &quot;significant linear increase&quot; was assessed? From similar descriptions in later experiments, it seems it was based on a comparison of freezing across the four presentations, but the F(1,26) statistic suggests there seemed to be a half-split test. The same questions exist in all the experiments. Please clarify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Conditioning data were analysed using contrasts with repeated measures in ANOVA. The repeated measures (or within-subject) factor was “trial” as all rats were exposed to four light-shock pairings in this stage of training. We examined whether there was a significant linear increase in freezing across trials using a standard within-subject contrast. The specific coefficients for this contrast, given the four trials, were -3, -1, 1, and 3. The reason that the degrees of freedom remain 1 and 26 in this analysis is because the within-subject contrast is part of a set of planned orthogonal contrasts. That is, in any planned analysis of the sort conducted here, the df1 will always be 1, indicating the very nature of the analysis. There was no splitting of the data, or comparisons between the split halves.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Line 154: Could the authors clarify what is meant by &quot;other main effects and their interactions&quot;? It is not clearly inferable from the context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Apologies for the confusion here. “Other main effects” refer to the two between-subject factors in isolation: i.e., the overall comparison of freezing to the light (averaged across the four trials) between groups that received either paired or unpaired stimulus presentations in stage 1 (factor 1 à main effect 1), and between groups that received either eight or 32 sound and light exposures in stage 1 (factor 2 à main effect 2). “Their interaction” refers to the assessment of whether the overall difference in freezing to the light (averaged across the four trials) between Groups P8 and U8 differs from the overall difference in freezing to the light (averaged across the four trials) between Groups P32 and U32. We have edited the text near line 153 to indicate that:</p>
<p>“The overall comparisons of freezing to the light (averaged across the four conditioning trials) between groups that received either paired or unpaired stimulus presentations in stage 1 (factor 1), and between groups that received either eight or 32 sound and light exposures in stage 1 (factor 2), were not significant (Fs &lt; .45, p &gt; .508). The interaction between these two between-subject factors was also not significant (F &lt; .45, p &gt; .508).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The use of sound and light as preconditioned and conditioned cues are counterbalanced. Was there any difference in the increase of freezing during conditioning depending on the type of conditioned cues? Was there any difference in the preconditioned fear? While it is hard to assess statistical significance due to the sample size limit, even observing a trend could be interesting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We examined whether the levels of freezing to the conditioned and preconditioned stimuli depend on their physical identity. In general, there was a slight trend towards more freezing to the preconditioned stimulus when it was a tone, and <italic>less</italic> freezing to the conditioned stimulus when it was a tone. These are, however, simply indications. None of the statistical comparisons between rats for which the preconditioned stimulus was the tone (and, thereby, conditioned stimulus was the light) and rats for which the preconditioned stimulus was the light (and, thereby, conditioned stimulus was the tone) reached the conventional level of significance.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) General suggestion on reporting non-significant statistics: the authors reported a small F statistic value a few times to suggest non-significance. But without clearly specifying degrees of freedom, it is hard to get a sense of statistical significance (e.g. Line 227, largest F&lt;3.10). I recommend adding p values alongside the F statistics and reporting exact statistics whenever possible.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Apologies for the omission. The p values have now been included alongside all non-significant F statistics.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Another general suggestion is to use non-parametric statistical testing with such small sample sizes. I recommend using the Kruskal-Wallis H test (the non-parametric equivalent of F-statistic) to replace the ANOVA result. Also, given many tests only involve comparing two independent groups, using Mann-Whitney U test (the non-parametric equivalent of independent t-test) would be sufficient.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand that small sample sizes can occasionally lead to unequal variances between groups, which necessitates the use of non-parametric statistics. However, as non-parametric statistics raise a different set of issues for data analysis (e.g., power) and interpretation, our general view for the type of data collected in this study is that parametric analyses are appropriate and should be retained (particularly in the absence of unequal variances between groups). We hold this view for two reasons. First, the hypotheses tested in the present series were derived from past work in which parametric analyses revealed meaningful patterns of results at the same level of statistical power. Second, the application of these analyses then yielded results consistent with our hypotheses: for the most part, we observed between-group differences where we expected there to be such differences and did not observe between-group differences where we did not expect there to be such differences. As such, we have not switched from a parametric to non-parametric analysis strategy. We do, however, appreciate the suggestion and will apply a non-parametric approach where it is warranted in our future work.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>I have a few very minor comments for the authors regarding the discussion and interpretation of the very nice experimental results.</p>
<p>(1) In Figures 4 and 5, the authors provide a schematic of the experiment. It's very clearly indicated whether the BLA inactivation is ipsi- or contralateral, but the unilateral PRh lesion isn't mentioned. I'd recommend including that here so that someone reading through the figures can more easily understand the experiment. The hypothesis is clear and the experiment is so well designed that a read through of the figures can relay most information to an experienced reader.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion – we have included information about the unilateral PRh lesion in the schematic for Figures 4 and 5.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors have an extended description of backward conditioning in the discussion. It seems like the authors are suggesting this as an important future direction, but they never explicitly say this, resulting in a bit of confusion as to what this section refers to. Also, Ward-Robinson and Hall 1996 showed backward sensory preconditioning using a serial auditory-visual association and argued for a mediated solution based on their results. It may be worth citing that paper here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Apologies for the lack of clarity. We have revised this point in the discussion (page 18, beginning line 434) and referenced Ward-Robinson and Hall (1996):</p>
<p>“Why does increasing the number of sound-light pairings change the way that rats integrate the sound-light and light-shock memories? One possibility is that increasing the number of sound-light pairings in stage 1 reduces the ability of each stimulus to activate the memory of the other. This is consistent with findings by Holland (1998), who showed that the likelihood of mediated learning in rats decreases with the amount of training (see also Holland, 2005); but inconsistent with our findings that, after extended training, rats continue to integrate the sound-light and light-shock associations through chaining at the time of testing (as chaining is predicated on the sound activating the memory of the light after extended training). Instead, we propose that the change in integration occurs because the increased number of sound-light pairings allows the rats to learn about the order in which the sound and light are presented (Figure 1; for evidence that rats acquire order information in sensory preconditioning, see Barnet et al., 1997; Hart et al., 2022; Leising et al., 2007; Miller &amp; Barnet, 1993). This order hypothesis is consistent with evidence showing that the way in which animals represent an audio-visual compound changes across repeated compound exposures (e.g., Bellingham &amp; Gillette, 1981; Holmes &amp; Harris, 2009). It can be tested using a so-called “backward” sensory preconditioning protocol, which reverses the order of stimulus presentations in stage 1 (e.g., Ward-Robinson &amp; Hall, 1996). That is, rather than rats being exposed to the “forward” sound-light pairings used here and by Wong et al. (2019), rats in a backward protocol are exposed to light-sound pairings. Increasing the number of light-sound pairings in this protocol should result in rats learning that the light is followed by the sound (light→sound) and that the sound is followed by nothing (sound→nothing). Hence, during the session of light-shock pairings in stage 2, the light should continue to activate the memory of the sound, resulting in formation of the mediated sound-shock association (e.g., Ward-Robinson &amp; Hall, 1996). That is, if our order hypothesis is correct, increasing the number of light-sound pairings in the backward protocol should preserve the likelihood of mediated learning in stage 2 and, if anything, diminish the likelihood of chaining at test in stage 3 (as the sound is never followed by a light). Hence, PRh manipulations that fail to affect fear of the sound when administered after many sound-light pairings (e.g., infusion of DAP5) should disrupt that fear when administered after many light-sound pairings in the backward protocol. This will be assessed in future work.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Line 467 in the discussion suggests that the results are surprising that PRh-BLA communication is not needed at test when learning putatively occurs through a mediated mechanism during first-order conditioning. I was a bit surprised by this comment since I was under the assumption that only BLA was required at this point after consolidation of the mediated learning. Holmes et al., 2013 showed that BLA is required for extinction to S2 after first-order conditioning. In that experiment they inactivated BLA during S2- presentations (typically considered the extinction test), and showed that reduction to S2 did not occur the subsequent day, indicating the memory was stored in BLA and may not necessarily require PRh-BLA communication.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The result noted here was somewhat surprising as our past studies showed that silencing activity in the PRh prior to testing attenuates freezing to a sensory preconditioned stimulus (i.e., an S2). We took this to mean that the PRh is necessary for retrieval/expression of fear to S2 and supposed that this retrieval/expression would be achieved through communication between the PRh and BLA. However, the results of the PRh-BLA disconnection at test show that this communication is not required, leaving us to speculate that retrieval/expression of fear to S2 may be achieved through communication between the PRh and CeA.</p>
<p>We have edited the opening of the relevant paragraph to clarify why the result noted here was surprising (page 20, beginning line 485):</p>
<p>“While the PRh and BLA clearly communicate to support mediated learning about the sound, this communication is not required for retrieval/expression of the mediated sound-shock association at the time of testing. This result is somewhat surprising as activity in the PRh is needed for expression of fear to the sound (Holmes et al., 2013; Wong et al., 2019) and raises the question: how does the PRh-dependent sound-shock association come to be expressed in fear responses?”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors reference Holland 1981 and 1998, yet there's not much discussion of these findings. I think there should be a bit more emphasis on these studies since they show how mediated learning greatly depends on the extent of training. Also, it may be worth considering Holland's theory of why mediated conditioning is more effective with shorter training. His theory may be consistent with the authors, but I believe he suggests that early in training a stronger mediated representation is evoked which tends to dissipate with time. I think this is a valid hypothesis to consider in this paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Holland papers show that rats form mediated associations (Holland, 1981) and that the likelihood of them doing so decreases with the amount of training (Holland, 1998). These findings are paralleled by those reported in the present series of experiments. However, the protocols used by Holland were very different to those used in the present study; and the explanation for his 1998 findings (which is the more relevant of the two papers) simply does not apply to the case of sensory preconditioning.</p>
<p>To be clear: Holland (1998) exposed rats to either “few” or “many” tone-food pairings in stage 1, tone-lithium chloride pairings in stage 2 and, finally, tested rats with the food alone in stage 3. He predicted and showed that those exposed to few tone-food pairings showed an aversion to the food at test (i.e., they consumed less of the food than controls) whereas those exposed to many tone-food pairings showed no such aversion (i.e., they consumed the same amount of food as the controls). This was taken to mean that, across the series of tone-lithium pairings, the tone activated the memory of food among rats in the few condition, resulting in a mediated food-lithium association; but failed to do so among rats in the many condition, resulting in no food-lithium association. According to Holland, the tone failed to activate the memory of food in the many condition because, by the end of training in stage 1, it was not needed for them to know <italic>what to do</italic> when the tone was presented: they simply had to run to the magazine to collect the food when delivered. That is, the tone eventually associated with the responses that rats emitted in the training situation, thereby obviating any need for activation of the food memory.</p>
<p>While this explanation is both elegant and interesting, it cannot be applied to the results obtained in the present study where the initial stage of training involved few or many sound-light pairings. That is, unlike in the Holland study where rats in the many condition eventually learned a stimulus-“run to magazine” association that maintained performance in the absence of any mental image of food, in the present study, any stimulus-response association acquired in stage 1 (e.g., orienting responses towards the sources of the auditory and visual stimuli) cannot have contributed to the expression of sensory preconditioned fear at test. Hence, stimulus-response learning in the many condition cannot be invoked to explain the pattern of results in the present study, even if it adequately explains what-appears-to-be a similar finding in the Holland study.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we have included a reference to the general style of explanation that was considered and rejected by Holland in his 1998 and 2005 papers. This appears on page 18 (beginning line 434) and reads:</p>
<p>“Why does increasing the number of sound-light pairings change the way that rats integrate the sound-light and light-shock memories? One possibility is that increasing the number of sound-light pairings in stage 1 reduces the ability of each stimulus to activate the memory of the other. This is consistent with findings by Holland (1998), who showed that the likelihood of mediated learning in rats decreases with the amount of training (see also Holland, 2005); but inconsistent with our findings that, after extended training, rats continue to integrate the sound-light and light-shock associations through chaining at the time of testing (as chaining is predicated on the sound activating the memory of the light after extended training). Instead, we propose that the change in integration occurs because the increased number of sound-light pairings allows the rats to learn about the order in which the sound and light are presented (Figure 1; for evidence that rats acquire order information in sensory preconditioning, see Barnet et al., 1997; Hart et al., 2022; Leising et al., 2007; Miller &amp; Barnet, 1993)…”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) There is also a Holland 2005 paper in which he tests whether extended training of the initial stimulus associations may result in a reduced associability of those stimuli. This would potentially result in lower mediated learning due to a decreased associability of the mediated representation, thereby explaining why extended training reductions in mediated learning occur. Using a probabilistic design, Holland shows that this reduction in mediated learning is likely not due to a change in associability.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the note re Holland (2005) and have included a reference to it in our General Discussion. We agree with Holland that the reduction in mediated learning across extended training is not due to reduced associability of the retrieved stimulus representation. If this were the case, it would remain to explain why stimulus representations continue to be activated at test, which must occur for successful chaining of the sound-light and light-shock associations upon presentations of the sound alone. This is included in the modified text on page 18 (beginning line 434), which is part of our response to point 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) I think the 4th intro paragraph is essentially saying that more pairings during preconditioning encourage chaining as opposed to mediated learning - I might recommend clarifying this a bit. It took me a while to put it together.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Apologies for the confusion. We have clarified the argument at this point in the Introduction with the following insertion on page 4 (beginning line 84):</p>
<p>“That is, increasing the number of sound-light pairings may allow rats to encode information about stimulus order in stage 1 and, thereby, shift the locus of integration from mediated conditioning in stage 2 to chaining at test in stage 3 (Holmes et al., 2022).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In analyzing test data I am assuming percent freezing is the average of the entire 30s or 10s CS period - could this be clarified?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is correct and has been clarified in the section for ‘Scoring and Statistics’ on page 29 (beginning line 708):</p>
<p>“Freezing data were collected using a time-sampling procedure in which each rat was scored as either ‘freezing’ or ‘not freezing’ every two seconds by an observer blind to the rat’s group allocation. A percentage score was then calculated by dividing the number of samples scored as freezing by the total number of samples. The baseline level of freezing was established by scoring the first two min at the start of each experimental session: i.e., we divided the total number of samples scored as freezing by the total number of observed samples, which was 60. The levels of freezing to the 10 s conditioned stimulus and 30 s preconditioned stimulus were established in a similar manner: we scored the entire period of each stimulus presentation and divided the number of samples scored as freezing by the total number of observed samples, which was 5 for each presentation of the conditioned stimulus and 15 for each presentation of the preconditioned stimulus.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Complementary to the above - during the probe test is there a difference during the first/last 2s of the CS? This would be interesting with respect to understanding the associative structure encoded.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have previously examined whether freezing responses change across the duration of a 30 s preconditioned stimulus and a 10 s conditioned stimulus. We have never seen any such changes: in our past work and in the present series of experiments, the expression of freezing is largely uniform across each presentation of a preconditioned or conditioned stimulus.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It is sort of unclear to me why more CS-CS pairings produced stronger preconditioned fear - is it that both mediated learning and chaining occur and giving 32 pairings permits both processes more than 8 pairings?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a very reasonable explanation for the heightened level of sensory preconditioned fear among rats that received many sound-light pairings in the initial control experiment. We are, however, reluctant to offer a strong interpretation of this result as it was not replicated across subsequent experiments in the series: i.e., the levels of freezing to the sensory preconditioned stimulus at test were largely the same among vehicle-injected controls that received either few (8) or many (32) sound-light pairings in Experiments 2A and 2B, and again in Experiments 3A and 3B as well as Experiments 4A and 4B.</p>

<p>(6) There are other citations that would strengthen arguments for the idea that unidirectional/temporal associative structure can be acquired during (appetitive) sensory preconditioning: Leising 2007 Learning and Behavior, Hart 2022 Current Biology, for example.</p>

<p>Thank you for these citations. We have included references to the Leising et al (2007) and Hart et al (2022) papers in our discussion on page 18-19 (beginning line 442):</p>
<p>“Instead, we propose that the change in integration occurs because the increased number of sound-light pairings allows the rats to learn about the order in which the sound and light are presented (Figure 1; for evidence that rats acquire order information in sensory preconditioning, see Barnet et al., 1997; Hart et al., 2022; Leising et al., 2007; Miller &amp; Barnet, 1993)…”</p>

<p>Editor's note:</p>
<p>We agree with the suggestions about full statistical reporting for non-significant results and about putting individual data points, perhaps coded to identify sex, on top of the bar graphs. Both will increase the transparency of the rigor of the work for readers.</p>
