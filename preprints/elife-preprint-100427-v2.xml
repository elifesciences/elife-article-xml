<title>Abstract</title><p>Non-inheritable antibiotic or phenotypic resistance ensures bacterial survival during antibiotic treatment. However, exogenous factors promoting phenotypic resistance are poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic> are recalcitrant to killing by a broad spectrum of antibiotics under high magnesium. Functional metabolomics demonstrated that magnesium modulates fatty acid biosynthesis by increasing saturated fatty acid biosynthesis while decreasing unsaturated fatty acid production. Exogenous supplementation of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids increased and decreased bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics, respectively, confirming the role of fatty acids in antibiotic resistance. Functional lipidomics revealed that glycerophospholipid metabolism is the major metabolic pathway remodeled by magnesium, where phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis is reduced and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) production is increased. This process alters membrane composition, increasing membrane polarization, and decreasing permeability and fluidity, thereby reducing antibiotic uptake by <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>. These findings suggest the presence of a previously unrecognized metabolic mechanism by which bacteria escape antibiotic killing through the use of an environmental factor.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Non-inheritable antibiotic or phenotypic resistance represents a serious challenge for treating bacterial infections. Phenotypic resistance does not involve genetic mutations Phenotypic resistance does not involve genetic mutations and is transient, allowing bacteria to resume normal growth. Biofilm and bacterial persisters are two phenotypic resistance types that have been extensively studied (Brandis <italic>et al</italic>., 2023; Corona &amp; Martinez, 2013). Biofilms have complex structures, containing elements that impede antibiotic diffusion, sequestering and inhibiting their activity (Ciofu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022). Biofilm-forming bacteria and persisters also have distinct metabolic states that significantly reduce their antibiotic susceptibility (Yan &amp; Bassler, 2019). These two types of phenotypic resistance share the common feature in their retarded or even cease of growth in the presence of antibiotics (Corona &amp; Martinez, 2013). However, specific factors that promote phenotypic resistance and allow bacteria to proliferate in the presence of antibiotics remain poorly defined.</p>
<p>Metal ions have a diverse impact on the chemical, physical, and physiological processes of antibiotic resistance (Booth <italic>et al</italic>, 2011; Lu <italic>et al</italic>, 2020; Poole, 2017). This includes genetic elements that confer resistance to metals and antibiotics (Poole, 2017) and metal cations that directly hinder (or enhance) the activity of specific antibiotic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). The metabolic environment can also impact the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics (Jiang <italic>et al</italic>., 2023; Lee &amp; Collins, 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Peng <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Light metal ions, such as magnesium, sodium, and potassium, can behave as cofactors for different enzymes (Du <italic>et al</italic>., 2016) and influence drug efficacy. Heavy metal ions, including Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>, confer resistance to antibiotics (Yazdankhah <italic>et al</italic>., 2014; Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2018). Recent reports suggest that sodium negatively regulates redox states to promote the antibiotic resistance of <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>), while actively growing <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> cope with ribosome-targeting antibiotics by modulating ion flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). In Gram-negative bacteria, by contrast, zinc enhances antibiotic efficacy by potentiating carbapenem, fluoroquinolone, and β-lactam-mediated killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Isaei <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Magnesium influences bacterial structure, cell motility, enzyme function, cell signaling, and pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). This mineral also modulates microbiota to harvest energy from the diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Garcia-Legorreta <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), allowing <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> to cope with ribosome-targeting antibiotics by modulating ion flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). However, the role of magnesium in promoting phenotypic resistance is less well understood.</p>
<p>Vibrios inhabit seawater, estuaries, bays, and coastal waters, regions full of metal ions such as magnesium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kumarage <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Magnesium is the second most dissolved element in seawater after sodium. At a salinity of 3.5% seawater, the magnesium concentration is about 54 mM (Potis, 1968), and in deep seawater, can be as high as 2,500 mM (Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2024). <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>V. alginilyticus</italic> are two representative Vibrio pathogens that infect humans and aquatic animals, resulting in illness and economic loss, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Grimes, 2020</xref>). (Fluoro)quinolones such as balofloxacin are used to treat Vibrio infection, however, resistance has emerged due to overuse (Suyamud <italic>et al</italic>., 2024). Indeed, (fluoro)quinolones are one of China’s two primary residual chemicals associated with aquaculture (Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2017). Vibrio can develop quinolone resistance through mutations in the DNA gyrase gene or through plasmid-mediated mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Dutta <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Thus, the use of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>V. alginilyticus</italic> as bacterial representatives, and balofloxacin as a quinolone-based antibacterial representative, can help to define novel magnesium-dependent phenotypic resistance mechanisms of pathogenic Vibrio species.</p>
<p>The current study evaluated whether magnesium induces phenotypic resistance in Vibrio species and defined the molecular/genetic basis for this resistance. Genetic approaches, GC-MS analysis of metabolite and membrane remodeling upon antibiotic exposure, membrane physiology, and extensive antimicrobial susceptibility testing were used for the evaluations.</p>

<title>Mg<sup>2+</sup> promotes phenotypic resistance to antibiotics</title>
<p>Marine environments and agriculture, where antibiotics are commonly used, are rich in magnesium. To investigate whether this mineral impacts antibiotic activity, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> ATCC33787 and <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> VP01, which we referred as ATCC33787 and VP01 afterwards, isolated from marine aquaculture, to balofloxacin (BLFX) in Luria-Bertani medium (LB medium) plus 3% NaCl as LBS medium and “artificial seawater” (ASWT) medium that included the major ion species in marine water (Wilson, 1975) (LB medium plus 210 mM NaCl, 35 mM Mg<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 7 mM KCl, and 7 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) were assessed (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Suppl. Table 1</xref>). The MICs of ATCC33787 to BLFX were 54 and 1 μg/mL in ASWT and LBS medium, respectively. Similarly, the MICs to VP01 were 25 and 3 μg/mL in ASWT and LBS medium, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The role of exogenous NaCl in antibiotic resistance was investigated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). The current study found that the MIC for BLFX was the same in LB and M9 minimal medium (M9 medium) plus 7 mM KCl or 7 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig 1</xref>). However, the MIC for BLFX was higher in ASWT medium supplemented with Mg<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> or MgCl<sub>2</sub> than in LB medium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). And Mg<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> or MgCl<sub>2</sub> had no difference on MIC, suggesting it is Mg<sup>2+</sup> not other ions contribute to the MIC change. The MIC for BLFX increased at higher concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> in ASWT medium. Specifically, adding 50 mM or 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> increased the MIC for BLFX by 200- or 1600-fold, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). At balofloxacin doses of 1.56, 3.125, 6.25, and 12.5 µg, the zone of inhibition decreased with increasing MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Exogenous MgCl<sub>2</sub> also increased the MICs for other quinolone (<italic>e.g.</italic> nalidixic acid, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and moxifloxacin) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>) and non-quinolone antibiotics including antibacterial peptides (colistin), macrolides (roxithromycin), tetracyclines (oxytetraycline), β-lactams (ceftriaxone, ceftazidime), and aminoglycosides (amikacin, kanamycin, and gentamicin) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). Notably, magnesium had a reduced effect on ceftriaxone and gentamicin than other antibiotics. Importantly, exogenous MgCl<sub>2</sub> also increased MICs of clinic isolates, carbapenem-resistant <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, carbapenem-resistant <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae,</italic> carbapenem-resistant <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and carbapenem-resistant <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> to balofloxacin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>). These findings indicate that Mg<sup>2+</sup> promotes phenotypic resistance.</p>

<title>MgCl<sub>2</sub> affects bacterial metabolism</title>
<p>To investigate how magnesium regulates phenotypic resistance, other effects of magnesium, including its ability to quench balofloxacin activity and induce efflux pump expression and LPS biosynthesis, were excluded (Suppl. Text; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig 2</xref>). While Mg<sup>2+</sup> is a co-factor for enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Garfinkel and Garfinkel, 1985</xref>), whether this mineral can promote antibiotic resistance independent of this function remains unknown.</p>
<p>To better understand how magnesium affects bacterial metabolism, <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> was cultured in M9 medium in the presence of various amounts of MgCl<sub>2</sub> (0, 0.78, 3.125, 12.5, 50, or 200 mM) and the levels of 54 metabolites were assessed by GC-MS. Five biological and two technical replicates were evaluated for each treatment (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig 3</xref>). The levels of 41 metabolites were differential (p &lt;0.05) and are presented as Z-values (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig 4</xref>). Orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was conducted that separated the six treatments into three groups: Group 1 included 0 mM, 0.78 mM, and 3.125 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; Group 2 was a singlet of 12.5 mM; Group 3 included 50 mM and 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Component t[1] distinguishes Group 1 from Groups 2 and 3; component t[2] distinguishes Group 3 from Groups 1 and 2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Discriminating variables are shown as S-plot, where cut-off values are ≥ 0.05 absolute value of covariance p and 0.5 for correlation p(corr). Six biomarkers/metabolites were selected from component t[1] and p[1]. More specifically, the abundance of cadaverine, urea, palmitic acid, aminoethanol, and fumaric acid were increased, but pyroglutamic acid and glutamic acid were decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig 5A</xref>). Pathway enrichment analysis suggests that twelve pathways are involved. Notably, one of the pathways is biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (terminology in the software. Actually, it is biosynthesis of fatty acids) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>), where the abundance of palmitic acid and stearic acid were increased in an Mg<sup>2+</sup> dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig 6</xref>). Moreover, palmitic acid was a crucial biomarker (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig 6</xref>). The increase in fatty acid biosynthesis could be partially explained by an imbalanced pyruvate cycle/TCA cycle, in which fumarate levels increased at higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> while succinate levels increased at lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig 5B</xref>). These findings indicated that glycolysis fluxes into fatty acid biosynthesis rather than the pyruvate cycle/TCA cycle. The relevance of fatty acids and BLFX was demonstrated by the observation that exogenous palmitic acid increased bacterial resistance to balofloxacin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). These results suggest that fatty acid metabolism may be critical to magnesium-based phenotypic resistance.</p>

<title>Mg<sup>2+</sup> regulates fatty acid biosynthesis</title>
<p>Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, the first step of fatty acid synthesis.

The expression of <italic>tesA</italic>, <italic>tesB</italic>, and <italic>yciA</italic>, which convert unsaturated to saturated fatty acids, increased at 50 or/and 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). FabA and FabF play key roles in unsaturated fatty acid and fatty acid biosynthesis, respectively (Feng &amp; Cronan, 2009; Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2013). Western blot analysis showed that FabA levels declined and FabF levels increased at higher MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Oxazole-2-amine and triclosan inhibit the synthesis of fatty acids and decrease bacterial survival in the presence of balofloxacin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). These results indicate that Mg<sup>2+</sup> inhibits the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and promotes the synthesis of saturated fatty acids.</p>

<p>In addition, we also quantified gene expression during fatty acid degradation to determine whether Mg<sup>2+</sup> affects this process (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of genes involved in unsaturated fatty acid degradation decreased in an MgCl<sub>2</sub> dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed that FadL levels decreased with increasing MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3I</xref>). FadH degrades unsaturated fatty acids and influences the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids. Together, these results suggest that MgCl<sub>2</sub> inhibits fatty acid degradation.</p>
<p>FabR, FadR, ArcA, and cAMP/CRP are transcriptional factors involved in regulating fatty acid biosynthesis. FabR inhibits unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, FadR promotes fatty acid biosynthesis and inhibits degradation, and ArcA and cAMP/CRP inhibit and promote fatty acid degradation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Feng and Cronan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Fujita et al., 2007</xref>). The expression of <italic>fabR</italic> and <italic>arcA</italic> increased, while the expression of <italic>fadR</italic> decreased. The expression of N646_1885, which encodes CRP, increased only in the presence of 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3J</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed that FadR levels declined with increasing MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3K</xref>). Viability of Δ<italic>fadR</italic> and Δ<italic>arcA</italic> was reduced in the presence of MgCl<sub>2</sub>, balofloxacin, or both in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3L</xref>). Thus, FadR and ArcA may play roles in bacterial resistance to balofloxacin, presumably by a mechanism dependent on the abundance of saturated/unsaturated fatty acids.</p>
<p>To investigate whether Mg<sup>2+</sup> functions through FadR and ArcA, expression of eight fatty acid biosynthetic genes (<italic>accA, accC, fabD, fabH, fabR, fabG, fabV,</italic> and <italic>yciA</italic>) and five fatty acid degradation genes (<italic>fadL, fadD, fadB, fadA,</italic> and <italic>fadH</italic>) were quantified in wildtype, Δ<italic>fadR</italic> or/and Δ<italic>arcA</italic> bacterial strains. As expected, fatty acid biosynthetic gene expression was reduced in Δ<italic>fadR</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3M</xref>). While higher expression of <italic>fadD, fadB,</italic> and <italic>fadA</italic> (elevated <italic>fadA</italic> only for Δ<italic>fadR</italic> without 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) was detected in Δ<italic>fadR</italic> or Δ<italic>acrA</italic> strains, the expression of these genes was negatively regulated by 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3N</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3O</xref>). These results indicate that Mg<sup>2+</sup> promotes fatty acid biosynthesis by positively regulating <italic>fadR</italic>, and inhibits the degradation of fatty acids through <italic>fadR</italic> and <italic>arcA</italic>.</p>

<title>MgCl<sub>2</sub> affects 16-carbon and 18-carbon fatty acid metabolism</title>
<p>To investigate the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on the biosynthesis of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, LC-MS was used to quantify the levels of 16-carbon and 18-carbon fatty acids, the main precursors of lipid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Zhang and Rock, 2008b</xref>). The abundance of the saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid (C16:0), was higher while the abundance of five unsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic acid (C16:1), linoelaidic aid (C18:2), linoleic acid (C18:2), alpha-linoleic acid (C18:3), and stearidonic acid (C18:4) was reduced with increasing MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). The levels of stearic acid (C16:0) and vaccenic acid (C18:1) remained unaffected.

<p>Direct exposure to palmitic acid also inhibited balofloxacin-mediated killing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>) while linolenic acid promoted balofloxacin-mediated killing in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Increasing exogenous palmitic acid and linolenic acid increased intracellular palmitic acid and linolenic acid levels, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). When cells were co-treated with palmitic acid, linolenic acid, and balofloxacin, the two fatty acids appeared to antagonize each other, as demonstrated by the Bliss model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Furthermore, magnesium had a minimal effect on the antagonistic effect of palmitic acid, linolenic acid, and balofloxacin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>), suggesting that this mineral functions through lipid metabolism. These results indicate that saturated and unsaturated fatty acids have an antagonistic effect on balofloxacin resistance.</p>

<title>Mg<sup>2+</sup> promotes phospholipid biosynthesis</title>
<p>Fatty acids are biosynthetic precursors of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and phosphatidic acid (PA), two key cell membrane components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zhang and Rock, 2008a</xref>). Thus, LC-MS was used to assess the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on membrane lipid composition (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig 7A</xref>).

The abundance of 11, 32, and 53 lipids was increased in 3.125, 50, and 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>-treated bacteria, respectively, while the abundance of 26, 52, and 107 lipids was decreased in 3.125, 50, and 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>-treated bacteria, respectively (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl.

A total of 52 lipids were quantified, including 17 high-abundance lipids (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig 7E</xref>). Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) had the first and second highest abundance (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl.

A similar effect was observed for the unsaturated derivatives of PE and PG (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that component t [1] differentiated 0 and 3.125 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> from 50 and 200 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, while component t [2] separated 50 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> from 0 and 200 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and variants in 3.125 mM of Mg<sup>2+</sup> treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>).

<p>The efficacy of antibiotics is strongly influenced by bacterial membrane permeability and fluidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Saeloh <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Thus, fluorescence microscopy was used to visualize these functions after incubating <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> cells with FM5-95 and various concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub>. FM5-95 staining decreased with increasing concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and no staining was observed in the presence of 200 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). SYTO9, a green fluorescent dye that binds to nucleic acid, enters and stains bacteria cells when there is an increase in membrane permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lehtinen <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">McGoverin <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Staining decreased with increasing MgCl<sub>2</sub>, indicating that bacterial membrane permeability declined in an Mg<sup>2+</sup> dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>). These results indicate that exogenous Mg<sup>2+</sup> reduces bacterial membrane permeability.</p>
<p>Exogenous palmitic acid also shifted the fluorescence signal peaks to the left in an MgCl<sub>2</sub>-dependent manner while palmitic acid only slightly shifted the peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig 7F</xref>). In contrast, exogenous linolenic acid shifted the peak to the right in a dose-dependent manner at 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>). These results indicate that exogenous palmitic acid and linolenic acid decrease or increase membrane permeability, respectively. Membrane permeability was increased in Δ<italic>fadR</italic> cells than in WT cells and was reduced by Mg<sup>2+</sup>, remaining higher than the control (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6H</xref>). However, Δ<italic>arcA</italic> cells had lower membrane permeability at lower MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6I</xref>).

<p>Relative membrane permeability appeared to correlate with relative intracellular balofloxacin and antibiotic efficacy.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study explored the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on the phenotypic antibiotic resistance of <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>. Exogenous Mg<sup>2+</sup> was found to promote saturated fatty acid biosynthesis and inhibit unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. Mg<sup>2+</sup> was also shown to upregulate PGS activity and PG abundance while downregulating PSS activity and PE abundance, decreasing membrane permeability and antibiotic uptake (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6L</xref>) and enabling phenotypic resistance. These findings are consistent with the known impact of exogenous Mg<sup>2+</sup> on bacterial survival in the presence of balofloxacin and other antibiotics, and the association between membrane permeability and drug efficacy. This study further showed that exogenous fatty acids influence membrane permeability and bacterial survival in the presence of balofloxacin.</p>
<p>Mg<sup>2+</sup> is the most abundant divalent cation in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pohland and Schneider, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pontes et al., 2015</xref>) playing many essential roles, including stabilizing macromolecular complexes and membranes, binding cytoplasmic nucleic acids and nucleotides, interacting with phospholipid head groups and cell surface molecules, and acting as an essential cofactor in many enzymatic reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Groisman <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). The present study showed for the first time that exogenous Mg<sup>2+</sup> influences palmitic acid and linolenic acid levels and upregulates PGS while downregulating PSS. These findings extend our current understanding of the biological functions of Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</p>
<p>Recent findings suggest a link between fatty acid biosynthesis and the antibiotic resistance of <italic>E. tarda</italic> and <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Su <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). The current study found that Mg<sup>2+</sup> had opposing effects on the abundance of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, stimulating saturated fatty acid biosynthesis at moderately high levels, while inhibiting unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis at ≥3 mM. Thus, the ratio of saturated fatty acids to unsaturated fatty acids should help in predicting antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>Prior studies of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kumariya <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Said <italic>et al</italic>., 1987</xref>) found that 10–20 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> disrupts <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> membranes and kills stationary-phase <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells but does not influence the survival of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Xie and Yang, 2016</xref>).

However, the impact of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on antibiotic resistance by regulating PGS and PSS activity was not reported. More importantly, exogenous MgCl<sub>2</sub> was shown to target these enzymes in opposing ways to increase the PE/PG ratio, a previously unknown mechanism of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-mediated antibiotic resistance.</p>

In response to Mg<sup>2+</sup>-limited growth, enteric Gram-negative bacteria show higher lipid A acylation, which alters membrane permeability and reduces the uptake of cationic antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Guo <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). Mg<sup>2+</sup> reduces the high sensitivity of rough <italic>Salmonella typhimurium, S. minnesota</italic>, and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 08 (which includes defects in the lipopolysaccharide carbohydrate core) mutants to several antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Stan-Lotter <italic>et al</italic>., 1979</xref>). Mg<sup>2+</sup> (1 mM) inhibited aminoglycoside-mediated outer membrane permeabilization in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hancock <italic>et al</italic>., 1981</xref>). However, mechanisms underlying the impact of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on antibiotic resistance have remained largely unknown. The current study revealed that Mg<sup>2+</sup> plays a critical role in regulating the membrane permeability required for antibiotic resistance by modulating PE and PG during phospholipid metabolism.</p>
<p>Aquaculture is an environmental gateway to the development and globalization of antimicrobial resistance due to the excessive use of these drugs to prevent and treat bacterial contaminants (Cabello <italic>et al</italic>., 2020; Millanao <italic>et al</italic>., 2018). The current study found that Mg<sup>2+</sup> increased antibiotic resistance, providing a reasonable explanation of why antibiotics are being excessively used in aquaculture and a possible solution to Mg<sup>2+</sup>-induced antibiotic resistance by balancing phospholipid metabolism. This finding should promote an overall reduction in antibacterial use that will improve environment and food safety.</p>
<p>In summary, Mg<sup>2+</sup> modulated the phenotypic resistance of <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> to balofloxacin and potentially other quinolones and other classes of antibiotics by altering membrane permeability and thus reducing antibiotic uptake. These findings inform the development of methods to improve the therapeutic effect of antibiotics on magnesium-induced phenotypic resistance.</p>

<title>Magnesium and balofloxacin binding only partially contributes to phenotypic resistance</title>
<p>Prior studies suggest that the chelation of antibiotics by magnesium ions inhibits antibiotic uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Deitchman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lunestad and Goksøyr, 1990</xref>). To investigate whether magnesium binds to balofloxacin, balofloxacin was pre-incubated with magnesium, and zone of inhibition (ZOI) analysis was conducted. Six different concentrations of balofloxacin were separately incubated with six different concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and then spotted on filter paper so that a defined amount of balofloxacin could be used for ZOI. While lower concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub>, (0.78, 3.125, or 12.5 mM) did not alter the ZOI, higher concentrations, including 50 and 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, decreased the ZOI (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig 2A</xref>), suggesting that even high doses of magnesium had only a partial effect on balofloxacin through direct binding. For example, at 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 5 or 10 μg/mL balofloxacin, the balofloxacin ZOI was 53.2 and 70.3% of the ZOI at 0 mM MgCl2, suggesting that ≥50% of the antibiotics were still functional. Intracellular BLFX also decreased with increasing MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig 2B</xref>), while exogenous Mg<sup>2+</sup> increased intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels in a dose-dependent manner. For example, exogenous 50 and 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> increased intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels to 1.21 and 1.31 mM, respectively (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig 2C</xref>). The relationship between TolC, an efflux pump that transports quinolones from bacterial cells, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> was also assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kobylka <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Song <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). The expression of TolC/<italic>tolC</italic> was unaffected by Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig 2D</xref>). Magnesium is critical for LPS stability. LPS levels increased at 200 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig 2E</xref>), however, the loss of <italic>waaF, lpxA</italic>, and <italic>lpxC</italic>, three key genes involved in LPS biosynthesis, did not influence balofloxacin sensitivity/resistance in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig 2F</xref>). These findings suggest that magnesium-induced LPS biosynthesis does not contribute directly to BLFX resistance and demonstrate that Mg<sup>2+</sup> influx is involved in balofloxacin resistance.</p>

<p>The study explored the influence of magnesium on phenotypic antibiotic resistance in two strains of Vibrios: V. alginolyticus ATCC33787 and V. parahaemolyticus VP01. This research is <bold>fundamental</bold> for revealing the phenotypic antibiotic resistance mechanism utilized by the specified model bacteria in elevated levels of magnesium. The study produced <bold>convincing</bold> evidence indicating that in high concentrations of magnesium, the efficacy of selected antibiotics was diminished due to decreased biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and PE, along with an increase in the biosynthesis of PG.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript entitled &quot;Magnesium modulates phospholipid metabolism to promote bacterial phenotypic resistance to antibiotics&quot;, Li et al demonstrated the role of magnesium in promoting phenotypic resistance in V. alginolyticus. Using standard microbiological and metabolomic techniques, the authors have shown the significance of fatty acid biosynthesis pathway behind the resistance mechanism. This study is significant as it sheds light on the role of an exogenous factor in altering membrane composition, polarization and fluidity which ultimately leads to antimicrobial resistance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Authors have used different approaches to demonstrate the effect of Mg+2 on drug resistance in Vibrio alginolyticus. The revised version of the manuscript is much improved, with a very informative introduction and a variety of methodologies with clear explanation of the experiments performed. Also, additional experiments were performed as suggested by the reviewers which certainly enhanced the quality of the paper. I believe the findings of this study will be of high impact in the bacterial community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are a few grammatical mistakes.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have done a comprehensive job of addressing all my concerns in their revised version.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors aimed to identify if and how magnesium affects the ability of two particular bacteria species to resist the action of antibiotics. In my view, the authors succeeded in their goals and present a compelling study that will have important implications for the antibiotic resistance research community. Since metals like magnesium are present in all lab media compositions and are present in the host, the data presented in this study certainly will inspire additional research by the community. These could include research into whether other types of metals also induce multi-drug resistance, whether this phenomenon can be observed in other bacterial species, especially pathogenic species that cause clinical disease, and whether the underlying molecular determinants (i.e. enzymes) of metal-induced phenotypic resistance could be new antimicrobial drug targets themselves.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study's strengths include that the authors used a variety of methodologies, all of which point to a clear effect of exogenous Mg2+ on drug resistance in the targeted species. I also comment the authors for carrying out a comprehensive study, spanning evaluation of whole cell phenotypes, metabolic pathways, genetic manipulation, to enzyme activity level evaluation. The fact that the authors uncovered a molecular mechanism underlying Mg2+-induced phenotypic resistance is particularly important as the key proteins should be studied further.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I thank the authors for improving their manuscript based on my previous suggestions. I still believe the Results section is long and bogs down at times.</p>
<p>In general, the conclusions drawn by the authors are justified by the data, except for the interpretation of some experiments. Importantly, this paper has discovered new antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and has also pointed to potential new targets for antimicrobials.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I just wanted to thank the authors for addressing most of my previous comments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript entitled &quot;Magnesium modulates phospholipid metabolism to promote bacterial phenotypic resistance to antibiotics&quot;, Li et al demonstrated the role of magnesium in promoting phenotypic resistance in V. alginolyticus. Using standard microbiological and metabolomic techniques, the authors have shown the significance of fatty acid biosynthesis pathway behind the resistance mechanism. This study is significant as it sheds light on the role of an exogenous factor in altering membrane composition, polarization, and fluidity which ultimately leads to antimicrobial resistance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The experiments were carried out methodically and logically.</p>
<p>(2) An adequate number of replicates were used for the experiments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The introduction section needs to be more informative and to the point.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your suggestion. We have revised the introduction to make it more informative and to the point as following:</p>
<p>“Non-inheritable antibiotic or phenotypic resistance represents a serious challenge for treating bacterial infections. Phenotypic resistance does not involve genetic mutations Phenotypic resistance does not involve genetic mutations and is transient, allowing bacteria to resume normal growth. Biofilm and bacterial persisters are two phenotypic resistance types that have been extensively studied (Brandis <italic>et al</italic>., 2023; Corona &amp; Martinez, 2013). Biofilms have complex structures, containing elements that impede antibiotic diffusion, sequestering and inhibiting their activity (Ciofu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). Biofilm-forming bacteria and persisters also have distinct metabolic states that significantly reduce their antibiotic susceptibility (Yan &amp; Bassler, 2019). These two types of phenotypic resistance share the common feature in their retarded or even cease of growth in the presence of antibiotics (Corona &amp; Martinez, 2013). However, specific factors that promote phenotypic resistance and allow bacteria to proliferate in the presence of antibiotics remain poorly defined.</p>
<p>Metal ions have a diverse impact on the chemical, physical, and physiological processes of antibiotic resistance  (Booth <italic>et al</italic>, 2011; Lu <italic>et al</italic>, 2020; Poole, 2017). This includes genetic elements that confer resistance to metals and antibiotics (Poole, 2017) and metal cations that directly hinder (or enhance) the activity of specific antibiotic drugs (Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014). The metabolic environment can also impact the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics (Jiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023; Lee &amp; Collins, 2012; Peng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015; Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020; Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021). Light metal ions, such as magnesium, sodium, and potassium, can behave as cofactors for different enzymes (Du <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016) and influence drug efficacy. Heavy metal ions, including Cu2+ and Zn2+, confer resistance to antibiotics (Yazdankhah <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014; Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018). Recent reports suggest that sodium negatively regulates redox states to promote the antibiotic resistance of <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic> (Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018), while actively growing <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> cope with ribosome-targeting antibiotics by modulating ion flux (Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2019). In Gram-negative bacteria, by contrast, zinc enhances antibiotic efficacy by potentiating carbapenem, fluoroquinolone, and β-lactam-mediated killing (Isaei <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016; Zhang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014). Magnesium influences bacterial structure, cell motility, enzyme function, cell signaling, and pathogenesis (Wang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019). This mineral also modulates microbiota to harvest energy from the diet (Garcia-Legorreta <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020), allowing <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> to cope with ribosome-targeting antibiotics by modulating ion flux (Lee <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019). However, the role of magnesium in promoting phenotypic resistance is less well understood.</p>
<p>Vibrios inhabit seawater, estuaries, bays, and coastal waters, regions full of metal ions such as magnesium (Kumarage <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022). Magnesium is the second most dissolved element in seawater after sodium. At a salinity of 3.5% seawater, the magnesium concentration is about 54 mM (Potis, 1968), and in deep seawater, can be as high as 2,500 mM (Wang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2024). <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>V. alginilyticus</italic> are two representative Vibrio pathogens that infect humans and aquatic animals, resulting in illness and economic loss, respectively (Grimes, 2020). (Fluoro)quinolones such as balofloxacin are used to treat Vibrio infection, however, resistance has emerged due to overuse (Suyamud <italic>et al.,</italic> 2024). Indeed, (fluoro)quinolones are one of China's two primary residual chemicals associated with aquaculture (Liu <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017). Vibrio can develop quinolone resistance through mutations in the DNA gyrase gene or through plasmid-mediated mechanisms (Dutta <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021). Thus, the use of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>V. alginilyticus</italic> as bacterial representatives, and balofloxacin as a quinolone-based antibacterial representative, can help to define novel magnesiumdependent phenotypic resistance mechanisms of pathogenic Vibrio species.</p>
<p>The current study evaluated whether magnesium induces phenotypic resistance in Vibrio species and defined the molecular/genetic basis for this resistance.

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors aimed to identify if and how magnesium affects the ability of two particular bacteria species to resist the action of antibiotics. In my view, the authors succeeded in their goals and presented a compelling study that will have important implications for the antibiotic resistance research community. Since metals like magnesium are present in all lab media compositions and are present in the host, the data presented in this study certainly will inspire additional research by the community. These could include research into whether other types of metals also induce multi-drug resistance, whether this phenomenon can be observed in other bacterial species, especially pathogenic species that cause clinical disease, and whether the underlying molecular determinants (i.e. enzymes) of metal-induced phenotypic resistance could be new antimicrobial drug targets themselves.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study's strengths include that the authors used a variety of methodologies, all of which point to a clear effect of exogenous Mg2+ on drug resistance in the targeted species. I also commend the authors for carrying out a comprehensive study, spanning evaluation of whole cell phenotypes, metabolic pathways, genetic manipulation, to enzyme activity level evaluation. The fact that the authors uncovered a molecular mechanism underlying Mg2+-induced phenotypic resistance is particularly important as the key proteins should be studied further.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I believe there are weaknesses in the manuscript, however. The authors take for granted that the reader is familiar with all the assays utilized, and do not properly explain some experiments, and thus I highly suggest that the authors add a brief statement in each situation describing the rationale for each selected methodology (more details are in the private review to the authors). The Results section is also quite long and bogs down at times, and I suggest that the authors reduce its length by 10 to 20%. In contrast, the Introduction is sparse and lacks key aspects, for example, there should be mention of the study's main purpose and approaches, plus an introduction to the authors' choice of species and their known drug resistance properties, as well as the drug of choice (balofloxacin). Another notable weakness is that the authors evaluated Mg2+-induced phenotypic resistance only against two closely related species, and thus the generalizability of this mechanism of drug resistance is not known. The paper would be strengthened if the authors could demonstrate this type of phenotypic resistance in at least one more Gram-negative species and at least one Gram-positive species (antimicrobial susceptibility evaluations would suffice), each of which should be pathogenic to humans. Demonstrating magnesium-induced phenotypic drug resistance in the WHO Priority Bacterial Pathogens would be particularly important.</p>
<p>In general, the conclusions drawn by the authors are justified by the data, except for the interpretation of some experiments. Importantly, this paper has discovered new antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and has also pointed to potential new targets for antimicrobials.</p>

<p>(2) The introduction could be more informative. A little more description of magnesium - such as what it does to antibiotics and how it's known to affect the microbiome - might be helpful for the general readers. The question remains why out of all the metal ions that might affect antibiotic resistance (many of them are less explored), authors particularly decided to work on the effect of magnesium. The introduction should cover the rationale of their hypothesis. Also, the authors might want to briefly talk about the model organisms (V. algonolyticus and V. parahemolyticus) describing how threatening they are and how they are becoming resistant to antibiotics.</p>

<p>We appreciate this comment! The figure 2 is now removed to Suppl. Fig 2, and the description of figure 2 is moved to Suppl. Text. We revise the description of the result as following, which is in Suppl. Text:</p>
<p>“Prior studies suggest that the chelation of antibiotics by magnesium ions inhibits antibiotic uptake (Deitchman et al., 2018; Lunestad and Goksøyr, 1990). To investigate whether magnesium binds to balofloxacin, balofloxacin was pre-incubated with magnesium, and zone of inhibition (ZOI) analysis was conducted. Six different concentrations of balofloxacin were separately incubated with six different concentrations of MgCl2, and then spotted on filter paper so that a defined amount of balofloxacin could be used for ZOI. While lower concentrations of MgCl2, (0.78, 3.125, or 12.5 mM) did not alter the ZOI, higher concentrations, including 50 and 200 mM MgCl2, decreased the ZOI (Suppl. Fig 2A), suggesting that even high doses of magnesium had only a partial effect on balofloxacin through direct binding. For example, at 200 mM MgCl2 and 5 or 10 μg/mL balofloxacin, the balofloxacin ZOI was 53.2 and 70.3% of the ZOI at 0 mM MgCl2, suggesting that  50% of the antibiotics were still functional.

Fig 2B), while exogenous Mg2+ increased intracellular Mg2+ levels in a dose-dependent manner. For example, exogenous 50 and 200 mM MgCl2 increased intracellular Mg2+ levels to 1.21 and 1.31 mM, respectively (Suppl. Fig 2C). The relationship between TolC, an efflux pump that transports quinolones from bacterial cells, and Mg2+ was also assessed (Kobylka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020; Song <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020). The expression of TolC/<italic>tolC</italic> was unaffected by Mg2+ (Suppl. Fig 2D). Magnesium is critical for LPS stability. LPS levels increased at 200 mM Mg2+ (Suppl. Fig 2E), however, the loss of <italic>waaF, lpxA</italic>, and <italic>lpxC</italic>, three key genes involved in LPS biosynthesis, did not influence balofloxacin sensitivity/resistance in the presence of Mg2+ (Suppl. Fig 2F). These findings suggest that magnesium-induced LPS biosynthesis does not contribute directly to BLFX resistance and demonstrate that Mg2+ influx is involved in balofloxacin resistance.”</p>

<p>(6) For the metabolomics results, it will help immensely if the authors provide a volcano plot of the identified metabolites and plot the heat map according to the -log2 metabolite intensities. In Figure 3A, it's not clear what information is conveyed through Euclidean distance calculations of the heat map. In Figure 3 B, the authors mentioned that the OPLS-DA test was conducted, although the figure shows a PCA plot, so it's not clear how these two are connected. Figure 3 E: the figure legend says scattered plot, but the panel represents color-coded numerical values, not a scattered plot. Also, it's not clear how they got those values.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment! We quite agree with you that if the differential metabolites could be shown as volcano plot. However, we didn’t adopt volcano plot in this study because this is a magnesium concentration-dependent metabolomes that includes 6 groups in parallel. Volcano plots may give a complex view of the comparison among different groups. We also tried to plot the heat map according to the -log2 metabolite intensities. Although this analysis cluster 200 mM and 50 mM groups better, the data of low magnesium concentrations was not consistent, which may be due to the minor metabolic change of low concentrations magnesium. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>For Euclidean distance calculations, we explain in the figure legend as following:</p>
<p>“Euclidean distance calculations were used to generate a heatmap that shows clustering of the biological and technical replicates of each treatment.”</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors)</bold>:</p>
<p>(1) As mentioned in the Public Review, I strongly believe that the impact of this study will be more significant if magnesium-induced phenotypic drug resistance could be demonstrated in at least one other Gram-negative and one other Grampositive species, both of which should be human pathogens. The full suite of experiments would not be necessary for this suggestion; evaluation of the effect of Mg concentration in growth media on the drug resistance of other species, testing the different antibiotic types used in this study, would be sufficient.</p>

Mg2+ has the similar effect on carbapenem-resistant <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, carbapenem-resistant <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae,</italic> carbapenem-resistant <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and carbapenem-resistant <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> as the similar as on the Vibrio species in shown in Figure 1G.

<p>(2) I recommend that the Introduction section be expanded. I recommend one or two sentences introducing the two Vibrio species selected for study. I.e. why did the authors choose these two species? What is known about their phenotypic drug resistance in the literature? Why did the authors select balofloxacin for their studies, is it a common antimicrobial used vs Vibrios? As well, the end of the Introduction section ends abruptly with no transition to the present study itself. The end of the introduction should include one or two sentences introducing the main purpose of the study, its approach, and the techniques undertaken. For example, &quot;In this study, we evaluated whether magnesium induces phenotypic resistance in Vibrio species and the molecular/genetic basis for such resistance. We used genetic approaches, GC-MS analysis of metabolite and membrane remodeling upon antibiotic exposure, membrane physiology, and extensive antimicrobial susceptibility evaluations.&quot;</p>

<p>We appreciate this comment! We revise the introduction by providing additional information as following:</p>
<p>“In Gram-negative bacteria, by contrast, zinc enhances antibiotic efficacy by potentiating carbapenem, fluoroquinolone, and β-lactam-mediated killing (Isaei <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016; Zhang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014). Magnesium influences bacterial structure, cell motility, enzyme function, cell signaling, and pathogenesis (Wang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019). This mineral also modulates microbiota to harvest energy from the diet (Garcia-Legorreta <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020), allowing <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> to cope with ribosome-targeting antibiotics by modulating ion flux (Lee <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019). However, the role of magnesium in promoting phenotypic resistance is less well understood.</p>
<p>Vibrios inhabit seawater, estuaries, bays, and coastal waters, regions full of metal ions such as magnesium (Kumarage <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022). Magnesium is the second most dissolved element in seawater after sodium. At a salinity of 3.5% seawater, the magnesium concentration is about 54 mM (Potis, 1968), and in deep seawater, can be as high as 2,500 mM (Wang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2024). <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>V. alginilyticus</italic> are two representative Vibrio pathogens that infect humans and aquatic animals, resulting in illness and economic loss, respectively (Grimes, 2020). (Fluoro)quinolones such as balofloxacin are used to treat Vibrio infection, however, resistance has emerged due to overuse (Suyamud <italic>et al.,</italic> 2024). Indeed, (fluoro)quinolones are one of China's two primary residual chemicals associated with aquaculture (Liu <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017). Vibrio can develop quinolone resistance through mutations in the DNA gyrase gene or through plasmid-mediated mechanisms (Dutta <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021). Thus, the use of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>V. alginilyticus</italic> as bacterial representatives, and balofloxacin as a quinolone-based antibacterial representative, can help to define novel magnesiumdependent phenotypic resistance mechanisms of pathogenic Vibrio species.</p>
<p>The current study evaluated whether magnesium induces phenotypic resistance in Vibrio species and defined the molecular/genetic basis for this resistance. Genetic approaches, GC-MS analysis of metabolite and membrane remodeling upon antibiotic exposure, membrane physiology, and extensive antimicrobial susceptibility testing were used for the evaluations. ”</p>

<p>(8) MgCl2 clearly induces increasing levels of BLFX resistance, and to high levels, but not for every antibiotic. For example, the level of increased resistance to blactams is low (ceftriaxone) and plateaus (ceftazidime). As well, resistance to gentamicin plateaus at a lower level than the other aminoglycosides. These observations do not take away from the conclusion that Mg induces multi-drug resistance, but since the behaviour of the MICs for these drugs is different than the other drugs, they should be mentioned. Also, Figure 1F - tetracyclines (plural) is used for vertical axis label - does this refer to the tetracycline itself or the class itself, and if the class, which one was tested?</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment! These have been rewritten following as  “To investigate whether magnesium binds to balofloxacin, balofloxacin was preincubated with magnesium, and zone of inhibition (ZOI) analysis was conducted. Six different concentrations of balofloxacin were separately incubated with six different concentrations of MgCl2, and then spotted on filter paper so that a defined amount of balofloxacin could be used for ZOI. While lower concentrations of MgCl2, (0.78, 3.125, or 12.5 mM) did not alter the ZOI, higher concentrations, including 50 and 200 mM MgCl2, decreased the ZOI (Suppl. Fig 2A), suggesting that even high doses of magnesium had only a partial effect on balofloxacin through direct binding. For example, at 200 mM MgCl2 and 5 or 10 μg/mL balofloxacin, the balofloxacin ZOI was 53.2 and 70.3% of the ZOI at 0 mM MgCl2, suggesting that  50% of the antibiotics were still functional.

Fig 2B), while exogenous Mg2+ increased intracellular Mg2+ levels in a dose-dependent manner. For example, exogenous 50 and 200 mM MgCl2 increased intracellular Mg2+ levels to 1.21 and 1.31 mM, respectively (Suppl. Fig 2C). The relationship between TolC, an efflux pump that transports quinolones from bacterial cells, and Mg2+ was also assessed (Kobylka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020; Song <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020). The expression of TolC/<italic>tolC</italic> was unaffected by Mg2+ (Suppl. Fig 2D). Magnesium is critical for LPS stability. LPS levels increased at 200 mM Mg2+ (Suppl. Fig 2E), however, the loss of <italic>waaF, lpxA</italic>, and <italic>lpxC</italic>, three key genes involved in LPS biosynthesis, did not influence balofloxacin sensitivity/resistance in the presence of Mg2+ (Suppl. Fig 2F). These findings suggest that magnesium-induced LPS biosynthesis does not contribute directly to BLFX resistance and demonstrate that Mg2+ influx is involved in balofloxacin resistance.”</p>

<p>- Section: MgCl2 affects bacterial metabolism. Authors switched to M9 medium - why? This contrasts with other sections using SWT and should be explained. Also, I cannot evaluate whether the statistical analysis of the data here was performed correctly and was appropriate for this type of experiment. I advise the authors to move the details in lines 166-169 to the Materials and Methods and replace this section instead with a more accessible description of the statistical analysis that a non-expert would be able to appreciate. Furthermore, analysis of Figure 3A indicates that the levels of asparagine, 4-hydroxybutyric acid, uracil, cystathionine, fumaric acid, and aminoethanol have significantly changed at high MgCl2, but these are not mentioned in the text. I suggest the authors mention these if they are relevant to the 12 enriched pathways, especially the biosynthesis of fatty acids.</p>

<p>We have carefully examined the abundance of the metabolites and the enriched pathway. Among the listed metabolites, only fumarate is within the enriched pathways. We mention this point in our revised manuscript as following:</p>
<p>“The increase in fatty acid biosynthesis could be partially explained by an imbalanced pyruvate cycle/TCA cycle, in which fumarate levels increased at higher Mg2+ while succinate levels increased at lower Mg2+ (Suppl. Fig 5B). These findings indicated that glycolysis fluxes into fatty acid biosynthesis rather than the pyruvate cycle/TCA cycle. The relevance of fatty acids and BLFX was demonstrated by the observation that exogenous palmitic acid increased bacterial resistance to balofloxacin (Fig 2F). These results suggest that fatty acid metabolism may be critical to magnesium-based phenotypic resistance.”</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment! We clarify the reason we use FM5-95 in the Methods and Materials section as following:</p>
<p>“Measurement of fluidity by fluorescence microscopy</p>
<p>Measurement of membrane fluidity is performed as previously described (Wen et al., 2022). Briefly, ATCC33787 were cultured in medium with indicated concentrations of MgCl2, collected and then adjusted to OD 0.6. Aliquot of 100 μL bacteria cells of each sample were diluted to 1 mL and 10 μL (10 mg/mL) FM5-95 (Thermo Fisher</p>
<p>Scientific, USA) was added. FM5-95 is a lipophilic styryl dye that insert into the outer leaflet of bacterial membrane and become fluorescence. This dye preferentially bind to the microdomains with high membrane fluidity(Wen et al., 2022). After incubated for 20 min at 30 ℃ at vibration without light, the sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm. The pellets were resuspended with 20 μL of 3% NaCI. Aliquot of 2 μL sample was dropped on the agarose slide, and take photos under the inverted fluorescence microscope.”</p>
<p>This data is presented as micrographs in Fig. 6D, which shows the decreased FM5-95 staining with increasing concentrations of MgCl2. We make this description clear with the following revision:</p>
<p>“FM5-95 staining decreased with increasing concentrations of Mg2+, and no staining was observed in the presence of 200 mM Mg2+ (Fig 6D).”</p>
<p>We explain the reason why we use SYTO9 as following:</p>
<p>“SYTO9, a green fluorescent dye that binds to nucleic acid, enters and stains bacteria cells when there is an increase in membrane permeability (Lehtinen <italic>et al.,</italic> 2004; McGoverin <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020). Staining decreased with increasing MgCl2, indicating that bacterial membrane permeability declined in an Mg2+ dose-dependent manner (Fig 6E).”</p>
<p>We didn’t use FACS in this study, while we only analyze the fluorescence distribution with the equipment. To make it clear, we revise the sentence as following:</p>
<p>“After incubated for 15 min at 30 ℃ at vibration without light, the mixtures were filtered and measured by flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, USA).”</p>

<p>“Exogenous palmitic acid also shifted the fluorescence signal peaks to the left in an MgCl2-dependent manner while palmitic acid only slightly shifted the peaks (Fig 6F). In contrast, exogenous linolenic acid shifted the peak to the right in a dose-dependent manner at 50 mM MgCl2 (Fig 6G).”</p>

<p>We appreciate this comment! We provide the reference in the revised manuscript as following:</p>
<p>““artificial seawater” (ASWT) medium that included the major ion species in marine water (Wilson, 1975) (LB medium plus 210 mM NaCl, 35 mM Mg2SO4, 7 mM KCl, and 7 mM CaCl2)”</p>

<p>Page 4 line, number 93: the he full names of the bacterial strains (e.g., ATCC33787 and VP01) should be provided instead of just the strain numbers.</p>

<p>We appreciate this comment! We revised the sentence as following:</p>
<p>“To investigate whether this mineral impacts antibiotic activity, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> ATCC33787 and <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> VP01, which we referred as ATCC33787 and VP01 afterwards,”</p>

<p>Finally, there appears to be a potential contradiction between the statements on page 12, lines 211-212 and 214-216, regarding the effects of Mg2+ on the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Further explanation may be needed to reconcile these seemingly contradictory points.</p>

<p>We appreciate this comment! For line 221-226, which was previously line 211-212, is about the gene expression for fatty acid biosynthesis. While, Line 228 and 233, which was previously line 214-216 is about the gene expression for fatty acid degradation. We agree that the previous description is a little bit confuse. We revise the sentence to emphasize that we focus on fatty acid degradation so that the readers can tell them apart.</p>
<p>In the text, we revised it as following:</p>
<p>“In addition, we also quantified gene expression during fatty acid degradation to determine whether Mg2+ affects this process”  In the figure legend, we also indicate that</p>
<p>“H. qRT-PCR for the expression of genes encoding fatty acid degradation in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of MgCl2”</p>
