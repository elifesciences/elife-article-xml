<title>Abstract</title><p>Impaired respiratory motor output contributes to morbidity and mortality in many neurodegenerative diseases and neurologic injuries. We investigated if expressing designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) in the mid-cervical spinal cord could effectively stimulate phrenic motor output to increase diaphragm activation. Two primary questions were addressed: 1) does effective DREADD-mediated diaphragm activation require focal expression in phrenic motoneurons (vs. non-specific mid-cervical expression), and 2) can this method produce a sustained increase in inspiratory tidal volume? Wild type (C57/bl6) and ChAT-Cre mice received bilateral intraspinal (C4) injections of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding the hM3D(Gq) excitatory DREADD. In wild-type mice, this produced non-specific DREADD expression throughout the mid-cervical ventral horn. In ChAT-Cre mice, a Cre-dependent viral construct was used to drive neuronal DREADD expression in the C4 ventral horn, targeting phrenic motoneurons. Diaphragm EMG was recorded in isoflurane-anesthetized spontaneously breathing mice at 4-9 weeks post-AAV delivery. The DREADD ligand JHU37160 (J60) caused a bilateral, sustained (&gt;1 hour) increase in inspiratory EMG bursting in both groups; the relative increase was greater in ChAT-Cre mice. Additional experiments in ChAT-Cre rats were conducted to determine if spinal DREADD activation could increase inspiratory tidal volume (VT) during spontaneous breathing, assessed using whole-body plethysmography without anesthesia. Three-to-four months after intraspinal (C4) injection of AAV driving Cre-dependent hM3D(Gq) expression, intravenous J60 resulted in a sustained (&gt;30 min) increase in VT. Subsequently, phrenic nerve recordings performed under urethane anesthesia confirmed that J60 evoked a &gt; 200% increase in inspiratory output. We conclude that targeting mid-cervical spinal DREADD expression to the phrenic motoneuron pool enables ligand-induced, sustained increases in phrenic motor output and VT. Further development of this technology may enable application to clinical conditions associated with impaired diaphragm activation and hypoventilation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many respiratory disorders are associated with reduced or impaired activation of respiratory motoneurons. Neurologic injuries (e.g., traumatic spinal cord injury, stroke) and neurodegenerative conditions (e.g., ALS, Pompe disease) will often result in decreased respiratory motor output, including impaired activation of the phrenic motoneurons which innervate the diaphragm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Another prominent example is obstructive sleep apnea, in which pharyngeal motoneurons have reduced output during sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Treatment options that increase respiratory motoneuron activation to improve breathing are limited. However, designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) may have use in this regard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Structurally derived from naturally occurring G-protein coupled receptors, DREADDs have been engineered to respond exclusively to exogenous ligands that are otherwise biologically inert<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. This provides a means to selectively stimulate cells expressing the DREADD. Prior studies have used DREADDs to stimulate upper airway muscle activation during breathing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. For example, following expression of DREADDs in murine hypoglossal motoneurons, tongue electromyogram (EMG) activity can be increased using DREADD ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. This response is functionally beneficial as shown by increased patency of the upper airway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The present study focused on chemogenetic activation of the phrenic neuromuscular system. Phrenic motoneurons provide motor innervation of the diaphragm muscle and are located in the mid-cervical (C3-5) spinal cord<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. We tested the hypothesis that expressing DREADDs in the mid-cervical spinal cord would enable systemic (intravenous or intraperitoneal) delivery of a selective DREADD ligand to produce sustained increases in the respiratory-related activation of the diaphragm. In doing so, we addressed two important questions. First, we determined if effective diaphragm activation requires focal DREADD expression targeting phrenic motoneurons, or if non-specific expression in mid-cervical interneurons and phrenic motoneurons would be sufficient. This question derives from prior studies of cervical spinal cord stimulation. A compelling body of work, with studies in multiple species, demonstrates that non-specific activation of cervical spinal networks can be highly effective at increasing diaphragm activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. One theory to explain this result is that a general increase in the excitability of cervical propriospinal networks leads to increased phrenic motoneuron activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. There is also evidence that phrenic motoneurons can integrate multiple synaptic inputs in a manner that produces orderly recruitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Accordingly, DREADD-induced activation of mid-cervical neurons or networks may be sufficient for ligand-induced diaphragm activation. On the other hand, DREADD expression may need to be restricted to phrenic motoneurons if the goal is to produce inspiratory-related diaphragm activation. To address this question, we studied diaphragm responses in two mouse models: 1) a wild-type model in which DREADDs were non-specifically expressed in the C3-5 spinal cord, encompassing interneurons populations and motoneurons, and 2) a choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-Cre transgenic model in which DREADD expression was restricted to ChAT-positive neurons in the ventral C3-5 spinal cord, targeting the phrenic motoneuron pool.</p>
<p>The second question we addressed was if phrenic motoneuron activation via cervical spinal cord DREADDs could produce a sustained increase in inspiratory tidal volume in unanesthetized, spontaneously breathing animals. While the previous results from the hypoglossal motor system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> provide a proof-of-concept that DREADDs can stimulate respiratory motoneuron activity, whether a sustained increase in tidal volume could be evoked by expressing DREADDs in phrenic motoneuron was uncertain. For example, during spontaneous breathing, a DREADD-induced increase in phrenic motoneuron excitability, and thus diaphragm activation, could be rapidly offset by decreases in bulbospinal neural drive to the phrenic motor pool, secondary to reduced arterial CO<sub>2</sub> or increased vagal-mediated inhibition. An increase in diaphragm activation could also trigger a decrease in accessory respiratory muscle activation, thereby attenuating or preventing increases in tidal volume. Lastly, data from the hypoglossal motor system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, as well as our initial results in the anesthetized mouse indicated that both phasic (i.e., during the inspiratory period) and tonic (i.e., occurring across the respiratory cycle) activation of the diaphragm would increase after DREADD activation, and how this would impact tidal volume was not clear. Accordingly, we studied ChAT-Cre rats using whole-body plethysmography and a direct measure of phrenic motor output via nerve recordings. The plethysmography studies allowed us to determine if DREADD activation of phrenic motoneurons causes a sustained increase in tidal volume and ventilation during spontaneous breathing in the unanesthetized rat. The nerve recordings were done under urethane anesthesia and enabled direct quantification of DREADD activation on the neural drive of the diaphragm while controlling variables including arterial CO<sub>2</sub> and lung volume.</p>
<p>Collectively the results of this work demonstrate that mid-cervical spinal DREADD expression enables the J60 ligand to produce a sustained increase in the neural drive to the diaphragm, producing an increase in tidal volume during spontaneous breathing. Further development of this technology may enable application to clinical conditions associated with impaired diaphragm activation and hypoventilation.</p>

<title>Diaphragm EMG responses in wild-type mice</title>
<p>Wild-type mice underwent bilateral injections of AAV9-hSyn-HA-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry into the ventral horns at spinal segment C4. Following a four-to-five-weeks incubation period, mice underwent terminal diaphragm EMG recordings before and after application of the selective DREADD ligand, J60. On average, wild-type mice showed increases in diaphragm EMG output in at least one hemidiaphragm after J60 administration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The area under the curve (AUC) of the rectified and integrated diaphragm EMG was significantly increased after DREADD activation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>) in both the left (p = 0.002; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1650">Table S1</xref>) and right (p = 0.002; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1650">Table S1</xref>) hemidiaphragm. Additionally, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the rectified and integrated diaphragm EMG burst activity increased bilaterally following J60 administration (Left hemidiaphragm: p = 0.056; Right hemidiaphragm: p = 0.01; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1650">Table S1</xref>). Lastly, the tonic activity of the diaphragm was assessed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>). Similar to the previous measures of EMG output both the left (p = 0.052; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1650">Table S1</xref>) and right (p &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1650">Table S1</xref>) hemidiaphragm exhibited a significant increase in tonic activity following J60 administration. Respiratory rate was consistent for the duration of the experiment. Notably, there was no substantial change in the respiratory rate of these spontaneous breathing mice after J60 administration (p = 0.863; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1650">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<p>In all experiments, the selective DREADD ligand, J60, produced an increase in diaphragm EMG burst amplitude during inspiration. However, this increase was not always detected in both the left and right hemidiaphragm EMG recordings. Five mice showed a bilateral increase in diaphragm output after J60 administration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), four mice showed a response that was limited to the right hemidiaphragm, and two showed a response that was limited to the left hemidiaphragm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Diaphragm EMG responses in ChAT-Cre mice</title>
<p>ChAT-Cre mice received bilateral intraspinal injections of AAV9-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry into the ventral horns at C4. ChAT-Cre mice underwent terminal diaphragm EMG recording using the same protocol as wild-type mice, following a four-to-nine-week incubation. All mice (n = 9/9) showed an increase in diaphragm EMG output in response to the J60 DREADD ligand in at least one hemidiaphragm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).

<title>Wild type vs. ChAT-Cre comparison</title>
<p>Diaphragm EMG responses of wild-type and ChAT-Cre mice were compared at the 30-minute post-J60 time point (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).

<p>The <italic>a priori</italic> expected recording duration for these experiments in anesthetized and spontaneously breathing mice was 90-minute. However, five of the eleven total wild-type mice in this experiment did not survive for this duration. It is unclear if this was a non-specific result associated with prolonged anesthesia, or if this was physiologically related to DREADD activation. No mice had evidence of adverse reaction in the initial 30-minutes following delivery of J60. Of the five mice which did not survive, three mice died between the 30- and 60-minute time points after J60, and two mice died just prior to the 90-minute time point. In contrast, all mice in the ChAT-Cre cohort (9 of 9) survived the total duration of the experimental protocol. A chi-square evaluation of the survival proportions was not statistically significant (Chi-squared = 3.2997, df = 1, p = 0.06929). However, considering the sample size, the results suggest some association between mouse strain (i.e., wild type, ChAT-Cre) and death, suggesting that non-specific DREADD activation may be contraindicated.</p>

<title>ChAT-Cre rats â Plethysmography and Phrenic Nerve Recordings</title>
<p>A small cohort of ChAT-Cre rats underwent anesthetized diaphragm EMG recordings to ensure DREADD responses similar to the mouse cohorts could be obtained in rats. ChAT-Cre rats (n = 4) underwent bilateral, intraspinal injections of AAV9-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry into the ventral horns at C4 to introduce the hM3D(Gq) DREADD transgene into phrenic motoneurons. Four of four rats showed increased diaphragm EMG output after DREADD activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1650">Figure S2</xref>). With that knowledge, we used a separate group of ChAT-Cre rats (n = 9; n = 3 females) to assess the effects of DREADD activation on ventilation. Whole-body plethysmography was used to measure breathing frequency, tidal volume, and minute ventilation before and after intravenous delivery of saline (sham) and J60 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).

<p>Patterns of expression were relatively homogenous in wild-type animals. In this cohort, the number of mice with positive mCherry expression in the grey matter increased on the rostral-caudal axis. Positive mCherry counts were comparable on both the dorsal-ventral and left-right axes, with a majority of mice expressing mCherry in all four quadrants. The diaphragm EMG responses to J60, on average, exhibited similarity between the left and right hemidiaphragm in these mice, aligning with the observed pattern of mCherry expression. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d-f</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, mCherry expression in the ChAT-Cre mice cohort was more prevalent in the ventral horns and the right side of the cord. Like the wild-type mice, there was a slight trend for increased mCherry expression moving rostral to caudal. Clear mCherry expression was detectable in the spinal cord in of all nine ChAT-Cre mice included in the final data set. One additional ChAT-Cre mouse was excluded from analysis as it showed no evidence of mCherry in the mid-cervical spine. Interestingly, this particular mouse appeared to show a modest increase in diaphragm output in response to the J60 ligand in the left-hemidiaphragm only (â¼45% increase compared to baseline activity). While this animal was ultimately excluded from our analysis, it is possible that this mouse did express hM3D(Gq) in the mid-cervical spinal cord but an issue in tissue processing resulted in an inability to visualize the mCherry fluorophore in the spinal tissue. All other ChAT-Cre mice showed robust mCherry expression in the ventral horns of at least one spinal segment from C3-C6. These mice demonstrated a larger average DREADD response in the right hemidiaphragm than the left (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d-f</xref>), possibly stemming from the fact that a greater number of mice exhibited mCherry expression on the right side compared to the left (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1650">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
<p>ChAT-Cre rats showed expression predominately in the ventral horns throughout the mid-cervical spinal cords with the highest levels of expression in spinal segments C4 and C5. Expression in this cohort was slightly more prominent on the right side of the cord and in the ventral horn. These histological findings were consistent with the physiological results. Although the magnitude of DREADD response between the left and right phrenic nerves for this cohort was not statistically different, there was a trend of slightly higher right phrenic tonic response compared to the left (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b-e</xref>). This trend is mirrored in the pattern of mCherry expression, where expression levels were approximately equal between spinal segments but tended to be slightly higher in the right ventral horns compared to the left.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We describe a novel method to increase diaphragm EMG output by expressing the excitatory DREADD, hM3D(Gq), in the mid-cervical spinal cord, targeting phrenic motoneurons. Following AAV-driven expression of the DREADD in the spinal cord, application of the J60 ligand caused sustained increases in diaphragm output as measured through EMG in spontaneously breathing animals. This response was also verified using direct recordings of phrenic nerve discharge. Additionally, the DREADD ligand was able to produce an increase in inspiratory tidal volume in awake, freely behaving animals. These proof-of-concept studies provide a foundation for further development of this technology towards clinical application for restoring diaphragm activation in conditions such as cervical spinal cord injury.</p>

<title>Targeted gene delivery to the phrenic motor pool</title>
<p>The intraspinal AAV delivery used here was based on previous studies demonstrating successful gene delivery to phrenic motoneurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. For example, mid-cervical spinal injections of an AAV5 vector encoding the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) in animals with Pompe disease (<italic>Gaa</italic> null) effectively restores spinal GAA enzyme activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Spinal-delivered viral vectors have also been used to successfully drive local expression of channelrhodopsin-2 to enable light activation of diaphragm output<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, and to drive expression of the astrocyte glutamate transporter GLT1 in the area of the phrenic motor nuclei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Other methods that have been employed to drive gene expression in phrenic motoneurons include intrapleural- and intramuscular diaphragm injection of viral vectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Intrapleural delivery requires microinjection to the âpleural spaceâ between the visceral pleura that lines the lungs and the parietal pleura that covers the thoracic cavity. This technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> effectively targets phrenic motoneurons in rodent models of cervical spinal cord injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and Pompe disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Intramuscular diaphragm injection allows the vector to enter phrenic nerve terminals and reach phrenic motoneuron soma via retrograde movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Direct diaphragm injection allows for a relatively high target specificity, with the gene of interest expressed almost exclusively in phrenic motoneurons (although expression can also occur in diaphragm myofibers, depending on the promoter sequence used). In pilot experiments, we tested intrapleural and intramuscular diaphragm injections using AAV9 vectors encoding GFP (AAV9-CAG-GFP) or DREADD (AAV9-hSyn-HA-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry &amp; AAV9-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry). We did not, however, observe histological or physiological evidence of phrenic motoneuron transduction with these AAV9 vectors. Direct intraspinal injection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> was therefore used to introduce the hM3D(Gq) into the phrenic motor nucleus. While this enabled proof-of-concept for targeting DREADDs to the cervical spinal cord and phrenic motoneurons, the intrapleural or diaphragmatic injection delivery routes might ultimately prove better for selective phrenic motoneuron targeting. We predict that using different AAV serotypes or viruses with better retrograde movement (e.g., âAAV retroâ) could optimize the targeting of phrenic motoneurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>DREADD-mediated motoneuron activation</title>
<p>DREADD technology is widely used for studying brain and spinal cord neurons and networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Relatively few studies, however, have examined if and how DREADDs can be used to activate (or inhibit) lower motoneurons. Regarding the spinal cord, we are aware of only a few prior publications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Two of these studies used pharmacologically selective actuator module (PSAM), a type of ionotropic chemogenetic receptor, to activate lumbar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> motoneurons, in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In the remaining studies, excitatory DREADDs were applied to spinal motoneurons to improve axon regeneration following peripheral nerve injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. A small but growing body of work has employed DREADDs to activate hypoglossal (XII) motoneurons in the brainstem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Collectively, these studies show that once hM3D(Gq) is expressed in XII motoneurons, DREADD ligands will rapidly produce an increase in the EMG activation of tongue muscles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. This increase in tongue muscle output tends to manifest as an increase in the inspiratory-related activation and tonic discharge across the respiratory cycle. Since increased tongue muscle activation can promote patency of the upper airway, XII motoneuron DREADD expression has been suggested as a possible treatment for obstructive sleep apnea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. For the present study, the primary innovation is the first application of DREADD technology to phrenic motoneurons. This approach was highly effective at driving sustained activation of the diaphragm muscle, and the underlying mechanisms are discussed next.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Chemogenetic stimulation of breathing</title>
<p>An important consideration is how DREADD-induced increases in the excitability of spinal neurons, including phrenic motoneurons, interacts with the endogenous neural control of breathing. Phrenic motoneurons receive a rhythmic, monosynaptic, glutamatergic synaptic input from medullary neurons. Acting via NMDA and AMPA receptors, this produces phrenic motoneuron depolarization and subsequent diaphragm muscle contraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Activating DREADDs on phrenic motoneurons should lower the threshold for activation via excitatory glutamatergic synaptic inputs, which would produce a greater output during the inspiratory phase. Alternatively, DREADD activation could directly lead to phrenic motoneuron action potentials even in the absence of synaptic input from the brainstem. This latter possibility could explain the tonic discharge (i.e., EMG output across the entire respiratory cycle) that was noted to occur after delivery of the DREADD ligand. Non-specific spinal cord DREADD expression, as occurred in the wild-type mice (e.g., <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), would likely produce an increase in the excitability and/or activation of phrenic motoneurons as well as propriospinal neurons in the immediate vicinity. Neurophysiological<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, as well as anatomical data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, confirm synaptic connections between mid-cervical interneurons and phrenic motoneurons, making it possible that DREADD activation of these interneurons impacted the diaphragm motor response in the wild-type mice.</p>
<p>The control of breathing is also impacted by well-established âclosed loopâ physiologic feedback mechanisms regulating lung volume and arterial blood gases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. For example, if DREADD-induced activation of the diaphragm leads to increased alveolar ventilation, and metabolic rate is not impacted, then arterial CO<sub>2</sub> values will decrease and the overall neural drive to breathe will also decrease. Vagal afferent feedback corresponding to increased lung volume also has a powerful inhibitory impact on inspiration and therefore diaphragm activation. However, the sustained increase in diaphragm EMG and tidal volume that we observed following application of the DREADD ligand indicates that these mechanisms, if activated, were not sufficient to fully inhibit the increased phrenic motoneuron output. In this regard, our additional experiments in which direct recordings of bilateral phrenic nerve discharge are informative. These nerve recording experiments were done to enable direct evaluation of the impact of spinal DREADD activation on phrenic motor output while keeping arterial blood gases and lung volume constant. Under these more rigorously controlled conditions, intravenous delivery of the DREADD ligand produced a rapid and sustained increase in inspiratory burst amplitude in the phrenic nerve, and with no impact on the rate of the inspiratory bursts. The relative increase in inspiratory motor output was considerably greater in the phrenic nerve recording experiments (â¼250% of baseline) as compared to the diaphragm EMG response in spontaneously breathing animals (â¼100% of baseline). This may indicate that vagal and/or blood gas-related inhibitory mechanisms, as mentioned above, somewhat constrained the response to the DREADD ligand in the spontaneously breathing animal.</p>

<sec id="s3d">
<title>Critique of methods</title>
<p>There are a few caveats that should be discussed. First, the precision of the AAV delivery could be improved by further refining spinal injection surgical techniques. In the current study, we used a stereotaxic frame and previously validated coordinates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> to guide the intraspinal AAV injections. However, we observed variability in the laterality (i.e., left vs. right side of the spinal cord) of mid-cervical mCherry expression as well as the physiological response to the DREADD ligand, particularly in the ChAT-Cre mice (e.g., <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This could have occurred due to subtle variations of the positioning of the animal within the stereotaxic frame, and/or placement of the needle tip, leading to slight deviations for the desired coordinates between the left and right phrenic nuclei. Second, we did not unequivocally verify that the DREADD was expressed in phrenic motoneurons using retrograde labeling methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. However, the phrenic motor nucleus has been well described in the mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> and the rat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, and the fluorophore (mCherry) expression observed in our experiments is very clearly in the expected location of phrenic motoneurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b-c<sub>i</sub></xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1650">Figure S4</xref>). Further, the robust increase in phrenic motor output after the DREADD ligand, particularly in the ChAT-Cre rat experiment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) is further evidence of effective phrenic motoneuron targeting.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our data support the conclusion that cervical spinal cord directed chemogenetic methods can be used to produce sustained increases in phrenic motor output, diaphragm activation, and inspiratory tidal volume. Collectively, the data indicate that DREADDs should be directed exclusively to phrenic motoneurons vs. non-specific expression in the immediate vicinity. In this regard, improvement of the AAV delivery methods will increase the selectivity of the approach for more precise targeting of phrenic motoneurons. Concerning the âtranslational valueâ of this work, spinal cord chemogenetics may have application to clinical conditions associated with an inability to activate the diaphragm. For example, incomplete cervical spinal cord injury is a condition in which the bulbospinal synaptic inputs to phrenic motoneurons are interrupted. After incomplete cervical spinal cord injury, focal expression of an excitatory DREADD in phrenic motoneurons could be used to increase the excitability of these cells, thereby improving the efficacy of spared bulbospinal synaptic inputs which convey âinspiratory driveâ.</p>

<title>Adeno-associated viral vectors</title>
<p>All animals underwent intraspinal injections (see section below) of an AAV vector encoding the excitatory DREADD (hM3D(Gq)) under a human synapsin promoter. Wildtype mice received injections of AAV9-hSyn-HA-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry (titer: 2.44Ã10<sup>13</sup> vg/mL) while ChAT-Cre mice and rats received injections of a similar construct with a double-floxed inverted open-reading frame (DIO) allowing for Cre-dependent transgene expression (AAV9-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry; titer: 2.07Ã10<sup>12</sup> vg/mL). The pAAV-hSyn-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry (Addgene plasmid # 50474; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene:50474">http://n2t.net/addgene:50474</ext-link>; RRID: Addgene_50474) and pAAV-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry (Addgene plasmid # 44361; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene:44361">http://n2t.net/addgene:44361</ext-link>; RRID:Addgene_44361) transgene plasmids were gifts from the laboratory of Dr. Brian Roth at the University of North Carolina. Viral preparations were generated and titered by the University of Florida Powell Gene Therapy Center Vector Core Lab. Vectors were purified by iodixanol gradient centrifugation and anion-exchange chromatography as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Intraspinal injections</title>
<p>An adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) encoding the gene for the excitatory DREADD, hM3D(Gq) was delivered to the mid-cervical spinal cord. Mice were 6-10 weeks old (WT cohort: 7-9 weeks; ChAT-Cre cohort: 6-10 weeks) at the time of injection while ChAT-Cre rats were 2-5 months old. Surgery was performed under aseptic conditions. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (induction: 3-4% isoflurane; maintenance: 2-3% isoflurane in 100% O<sub>2</sub>) while rats were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) delivered intraperitoneally. Animals were placed prone on a circulating water heating pad to maintain body temperature. A longitudinal incision was made starting at the base of the skull and extending caudally. The underlying back musculature was opened from the base of the skull to spinal segment C6. Using a micro-curette, the muscle and connective tissue overlying laminae C3 to C5 were removed. A laminectomy of the C4 dorsal lamina exposed the dura mater below. A bilateral durotomy was then performed exposing the spinal cord. A Hamilton syringe (34-gauge needle) held in a Kopf stereotaxic frame was used to inject 1 Âµl of AAV9-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry (ChAT-Cre mice and rats) or AAV9-hSyn-HA-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry (C57/bl6 mice), bilaterally into the ventral horns at C4. Injections were made 0.5 mm lateral to the spinal midline at a depth of 0.9 mm for mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and 1 mm lateral to midline at a depth of 1.5 mm for rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. The needle was left to dwell for 5 minutes. Following injections, the overlying muscle and fascia were sutured with absorbable suture, the skin closed, and the animal returned to its home cage. Animals received a post-operative analgesia regiment of subcutaneous buprenorphine (1 mg/kg; slow-release formulation) and carprofen (5 mg/kg) for the first three days after surgery.</p>

<title>Diaphragm EMG recordings</title>
<p>Recordings were conducted using wild-type (n = 11; n = 7 females) and ChAT-Cre mice (n = 9; n = 6 females; n = 1 excluded from analysis), 4-9 weeks following intraspinal injections of AAV-DREADD. Mice were anesthetized with 2-3% isoflurane in a closed chamber and then placed supine on a closed loop heating pad to maintain rectal temperature at 37 Â± 0.5 Â°C (model 700 TC-1000, CWE Inc.). Mice spontaneously inhaled 2% isoflurane in 100% O<sub>2</sub> for the duration of the experiment.</p>
<p>A laparotomy was performed and two sets of 50 Âµm tungsten wires were placed in the mid-costal region of the left and right hemidiaphragm. The tips of each wire were de-insulated, bent into small hooks, and inserted through the diaphragm approximately 3 mm apart. The recorded EMG signals were amplified (1000x) and filtered (100â1000 Hz) using a differential amplifier (AâM systems model 1700). Signals were digitized at 10 kS/s using a Power 1401 (CED, Cambridge, UK).</p>
<p>Once a stable plane of anesthesia was reached, mice underwent a 10-minute recording to establish baseline diaphragm EMG parameters. Subsequently, mice received injections of vehicle (100 Âµl of saline delivered intraperitoneally (IP)) followed by a 20-minute recording. Mice then received an intraperitoneal injection of the selective DREADD agonist, JHU37160 (J60; 0.1 mg/kg, HB6261, HelloBio), and recordings continued for 90 minutes. At the conclusion of each experiment, mice underwent transcardial perfusion with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Following perfusion, spinal cords were harvested for histological analysis.</p>

<sec id="s4e">
<title>J60 control experiments</title>
<p>A small cohort of animals (n = 2 C57/bl mice; n = 3 Sprague Dawley rats) was used to assess the impact of J60 (0.1 mg/kg) on diaphragm EMG activity in the absence of hM3D(Gq) expression. The animals used in this study include n = 2 C57/bl mice that had undergone intrapleural injection (i.e., injection to the thoracic cavity) of an AAV9 construct encoding the red fluorescent protein, mCherry and n = 3 vector naÃ¯ve Sprague Dawley rats.</p>
<p>Recordings in mice proceeded as described above (see <italic>Diaphragm EMG recordings</italic>). In rat recordings, rats were induced with 3% isoflurane in 100% O<sub>2</sub> and moved onto a closed-loop heating pad set to maintain rectal temperature at 37 Â± 1Â°C (model 700 TC-1000, CWE Inc.). Rats were tracheotomized and ventilated (Model 683; Harvard Apparatus Inc.) with a gas mixture of 50% O<sub>2</sub>, and 1% CO<sub>2</sub>, balanced with N<sub>2</sub>. End-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> was maintained at 45-47 mmHg throughout the experimental protocol (Capnogard; Novametrix). Rats were converted from isoflurane to urethane anesthesia (2.1 g/kg at 6 mL/hr; IV). At the competition of urethane dosing lactated Ringerâs was administered (2 mL/h; IV) to keep the animal hydrated and ensure the catheter remained viable for J60 administration. A femoral artery catheter (polyethylene tubing; PE 50; Intramedic) was placed to enable monitoring of arterial blood pressure via a transducer amplifier (TA-100, CWE).</p>
<p>At the beginning of the experimental period, rats underwent a 10-minute recording to establish baseline diaphragm EMG parameters. This was followed by an IV injection of vehicle (0.6 mL of saline) and a subsequent 20-minute recording. Next, rats received an IV infusion of the J60 agonist (0.1 mg/kg), and the recording continued for 90 minutes. At the end of the experiment, rats were euthanized via an overdose of pentobarbital sodium and phenytoin sodium (150 mg/kg) given intravenously. Death was confirmed by thoracotomy once breathing had ceased, and a heartbeat was no longer detectable.</p>

<sec id="s4f">
<title>Whole body plethysmography</title>
<p>ChAT-Cre rats (n = 9; n = 3 females) were studied using flow-through whole-body plethysmography 14-16 weeks after intraspinal delivery of AAV9-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry, as described above. A tail vein catheter was placed to allow for intravenous infusion (IV) of the J60 ligand and vehicle. An IV catheter was externalized via a port in the plethysmograph allowing for IV infusion during recording without handling the animal or opening the plethysmograph. Unanesthetized rats were sealed into the Plexiglas plethysmograph with airflow maintained at 6 L/min for the duration of the recording. The recording protocol consisted of a 40-minute acclimation period (inspired air: 21% O<sub>2</sub>, 79% N<sub>2</sub>), followed by a 7-minute ventilatory challenge (10% O<sub>2</sub>, 7% CO<sub>2</sub>, 83% N<sub>2</sub>) and a 10-minute normoxic recovery period (21% O<sub>2</sub>, 79% N<sub>2</sub>). Subsequently, rats underwent a 20-minute long, pre-vehicle, baseline under normoxic conditions (21% O<sub>2</sub>, 79% N<sub>2</sub>) followed by a 2-minute-long intravenous infusion of the J60 vehicle (saline; 0.6 mL). Following vehicle infusion recording continued for 30 minutes followed by a 7-minute ventilatory challenge (10% O<sub>2</sub>, 7% CO<sub>2</sub>, 83% N<sub>2</sub>) and 10 minutes of normoxic breathing (21% O<sub>2</sub>, 79% N<sub>2</sub>). After an additional 20-minute pre-J60 baseline (21% O<sub>2</sub>, 79% N<sub>2</sub>), an intravenous infusion of the J60 ligand was given (0.1 mg/ml dose; 2 minutes long; final volume standardized to 0.6 mL) and recordings continued for 30-minute followed by a final ventilatory challenge (10% O<sub>2</sub>, 7% CO<sub>2</sub>, 83% N<sub>2</sub>). The ventilatory challenges were performed to assess the ability to increase breathing.</p>

<sec id="s4g">
<title>Phrenic nerve recordings</title>
<p>Two-to-eight-weeks following plethysmography recordings, bilateral phrenic nerve recordings were performed. This procedure was done to directly assess the effect of DREADD activation on phrenic motor output under rigorously controlled experimental conditions. Anesthesia was induced by placing the rat in a closed chamber to inhale 3% isoflurane in 100% O<sub>2</sub>. Rats were then moved onto a closed-loop heating pad set to maintain rectal temperature at 37 Â± 1Â°C (model 700 TC-1000, CWE Inc.). Isoflurane anesthesia was maintained using a nose cone. Once a surgical plane of anesthesia was reached as evidenced by loss of corneal reflexes and hindlimb withdrawal, rats were tracheotomized and ventilated (VentElite, model 55-7040; Harvard Apparatus Inc.) with a gas mixture of 50% O<sub>2</sub>, 1% CO<sub>2</sub>, balanced with N<sub>2</sub>. End-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> was maintained at 45-47 mmHg throughout the surgery and experimental protocol (Capnogard; Novametrix). Ventilator frequency was maintained between 65 and 75 breaths/min, and tidal volume was set at 7 mL/kg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. The vagus nerves were transected bilaterally to prevent entrainment of phrenic efferent output with the ventilator.</p>
<p>A tail vein catheter was placed to allow for intravenous infusion of urethane anesthesia, supplementary fluids, and the J60 ligand. Rats were slowly converted from inhaled isoflurane to urethane anesthesia (2.1 g/kg at 6 mL/hr; IV). During this conversion, the depth of anesthesia was consistently monitored by evaluating the pedal withdrawal reflex. Following administration of the full urethane dose, a mixture of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate and lactated Ringerâs was administered (2 mL/h; IV) to maintain acid-base balance. To prevent movements and EMG contamination of the phrenic neurogram pancuronium bromide was administered (3 mg/kg IV, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis) to achieve neuromuscular blockade. A catheter (polyethylene tubing; PE 50; Intramedic) was placed in the femoral artery to enable monitoring of arterial blood pressure via a transducer amplifier (TA-100, CWE) and allow withdrawal of arterial blood samples (65 Î¼L) for measurement of partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) and O<sub>2</sub> (PaO<sub>2</sub>), pH, and base excess (ABL 90 Flex, Radiometer; Copenhagen, Denmark).</p>
<p>The phrenic nerves were exposed bilaterally using a dorsal approach as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Briefly, a midline incision was made at the base of the skull extending to spinal level T2. The muscles connecting the shoulder blades to the spinal column were separated to expose the phrenic nerves. The phrenic nerves were isolated, cut distal to the spinal cord, and suctioned into custom-made glass electrodes filled with 0.9% saline solution. Phrenic nerve activity was amplified (10 kHz) using a differential AC amplifier (Model 1700, A-M systems, Everett, WA), band-pass filtered (100Hz-3DkHz), and digitized at 25ks/second (Power 1401, CED).</p>
<p>At the beginning of the experiment, the apneic threshold was determined by slowly reducing the inspired CO<sub>2</sub> until phrenic nerve inspiratory activity ceased for 60 seconds. The recruitment threshold was established by slowly increasing the inspired CO<sub>2</sub> until phrenic bursting returned. The end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) was then maintained 2-3 mmHg above the recruitment threshold for the duration of the experiment. After achieving a stable phrenic nerve recording and blood gases a 15-minute-long baseline recording was collected (50% O<sub>2</sub>, 3% CO<sub>2</sub>) followed by a brief, 5-minute exposure to hypoxia (11.5% O<sub>2</sub>, 3% CO<sub>2</sub>) and 10â15-minute recovery period (50% O<sub>2</sub>, 3% CO<sub>2</sub>). Subsequently, intravenous infusion of vehicle (saline) was given followed by a 15-minute recording period. The J60 ligand (0.1 mg/kg) was then administered intravenously over a 2-minute infusion period followed by a 100-minute recording period.</p>
<p>Arterial blood samples were collected at specific intervals: initially at baseline, during the last minute of each hypoxia episode, 15 minutes post vehicle administration, and subsequently at 20-, 40,-60-, 80-, and 100-minutes post J60 administration. Baseline blood gas values served as references to assess if further arterial samples were isocapnic. To keep end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> and PaCO<sub>2</sub> near baseline (within Â± 2.0 mmHg), minor adjustments to inspired CO<sub>2</sub> and ventilation rate were made as needed. PaO<sub>2</sub> was kept above 150 mmHg, except during hypoxia; if it dropped below, O<sub>2</sub> intake was increased by 5%, and a new blood sample was analyzed within 5 minutes.</p>
<p>At the end of the experiment, rats were exposed to a second 5-min episode of hypoxia (11.5% O<sub>2</sub>) followed by a brief âmaximalâ chemoreceptor challenge induced by switching off the mechanical ventilator until the animal exhibited a âgasping-likeâ phrenic discharge pattern (approximately 20-30 seconds). If the increase in phrenic nerve amplitude in response to the âmaximalâ challenge was lower than the response observed during either hypoxic episode, it was considered a sign of deteriorating nerve-electrode contact, and the preparation was excluded from all formal analyses. Rats were then perfused transcardially with heparinized saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde and spinal cords were harvested for histological analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h">
<title>Histology</title>
<p>Spinal cords were harvested and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours. The cords were subsequently moved to a cryo-protecting solution (30% sucrose in 1x PBS) for a minimum of three days. Cervical and thoracic spinal cords were blocked in optimal cutting temperature media and cryosectioned at 20 Âµm. The viral constructs included a red fluorescent protein (mCherry) fused to the hM3D(Gq) DREADD which allowed evaluation of DREADD expression by assessing mCherry expression via fluorescence microscopy.</p>
<p>We performed a qualitative assessment of mCherry expression in the mid-cervical spinal cord. One intact section from the middle of each spinal segment (C3-C6) was chosen as a representative section and underwent assessment. Sections were segmented into the following quadrants: left dorsal, right dorsal, left ventral, and right ventral. The quadrant was scored as âpositiveâ if mCherry positive neurons or fibers were observed; otherwise, the sub-segment was marked ânegativeâ (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1650">Figure S4</xref> for example). The entirety of the grey matter from each section was analyzed for all animals, whether wild-type or ChAT-Cre. Although ChAT-Cre expression was expected to be limited primarily to motoneurons, which are the predominant ChAT-positive neuronal subtype in the spinal cord, there is also evidence of ChAT-positive interneuron populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> which we also wished to capture in our analysis. Results were compiled into a summary table showing the total positive counts by animal cohort, spinal segment, and quadrant (see Results section; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Animals that showed no positive mCherry labeling in the C3-C6 cord were excluded from analysis.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Custom MATLAB (MathWorks; Natick, MA) scripts were created, and are available upon request. These scripts were used to analyze diaphragm EMG, phrenic nerve, and plethysmography waveforms. EMG signals were digitally filtered using a second-order, bandpass Butterworth filter (100â 1000 Hz) and then rectified and integrated by taking the absolute value of the signal followed by applying a moving median filter (50 ms time constant for mice; 75 ms time constant for rats) and moving average filter (50 ms time constant for mice; 175 ms time constant for rats). The script identified each EMG burst and calculated peak amplitude, minimum amplitude (tonic activity), and AUC for each burst which was then averaged across animals and compared across experimental conditions.</p>
<p>Phrenic nerve signals were digitally filtered using a second-order, bandpass Butterworth filter (100â3 kHz) and then rectified and integrated by taking the absolute value of the signal followed by applying a moving median filter (50 ms time constant) and moving average filter (50 ms time constant). The analysis script calculated the peak phrenic burst amplitude and minimum amplitude for each burst which was then averaged across animals and compared across experimental conditions. Systolic (SP), diastolic (DP), and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP; formula: MAP = DP + 1/3 (SP - DP)) along with instantaneous heart rate were calculated from the arterial pressure trace.</p>
<p>In plethysmography experiments, airflow pressure, chamber temperature, chamber humidity, barometric pressure, and animal body temperature were used to calculate respiratory frequency, tidal volume, and ventilation via a custom MATLAB script. Tidal volume was calculated using the Drorbaugh and Fenn equation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaPlot 14 (Systat Software) and R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing; version 4.3.1). In mouse diaphragm EMG studies, one-way repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to statistically compare diaphragm EMG peak amplitude, area under the curve, tonic activity, and heart rate across time before and after J60 application. Paired t-tests were used to compare left and right hemidiaphragm EMG peak amplitude, area under the curve, tonic activity, and heart rate between ChAT-Cre and wild-type mice at the 30-minute post-J60 administration time point. Differences in mortality between wild-type and ChAT-Cre mice post-J60 application were assessed using Pearsonâs Chi-squared test with Yatesâ continuity correction using the chisq.test function in R. In instances where animals did not survive the entire duration of the anesthetized recording, data up until the time point preceding their death was included. In control EMG experiments, one-way RM ANOVA was used to compare EMG peak responses across baseline, sham injection, and J60 administration. These data were also assessed normalized to baseline, in which case EMG peak responses after sham injection and J60 application were compared using paired t-tests. In plethysmography experiments, two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare raw and normalized tidal volume, respiratory frequency, and minute ventilation across time and treatment (saline vs J60). Paired t-tests were used to compare responses to hypercapnic-hypoxic ventilatory challenges across treatments. One-way RM ANOVA was used to compare phrenic peak amplitude, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, mean arterial blood pressure, and respiratory rate across time for phrenic nerve recordings. The relationship between time post-AAV injection and average phrenic response to J60 was assessed for ChAT-Cre rats using the cor.test function in R to run a Pearsonâs product moment correlation. Both male and female animals were included in this study to improve the generalizability of the results. However, we were not adequately powered for sex comparisons and therefore did not perform any statistical analysis to assess sex differences.</p>
<p>In cases of significant main effects, the Tukey post-hoc test was used to assess differences between individual time points. For instances where data failed to meet general linear model assumptions (i.e., normality, homogeneity of variances), nonparametric equivalents of the previously mentioned statistical tests were used. Data were considered statistically significant when p â¤ 0.05. The mean data are presented along with the standard error of the mean.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors report that activation of excitatory DREADDs in the mid-cervical spinal cord can increase inspiratory activity in mice and rats. This is an important first step toward an ultimate goal of using this, or similar, technology to drive breathing in disorders associated with decreased respiratory motor output, such as spinal injury or neurodegenerative disease. Strengths to this study include a comparison of non-specific DREADD expression in the mid-cervical spinal cord versus specific targeting to ChAT-positive neurons, and the measurement of multiple respiratory-related outcomes, including phrenic inspiratory output, diaphragm EMG activity and ventilation. The data show convincingly that DREADDs can be used to drive phrenic inspiratory activity, which in turn increases diaphragm EMG activity and ventilation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study shows that when excitatory DREADD receptors are expressed in the ventral area of the cervical spinal cord containing phrenic motoneurons, systemic administration of the DREADD ligand J60 increases diaphragm EMG activity without altering respiratory rate. The authors took a non-selective expression approach in wild-type mice, as well as a more selective Cre-dependent approach in Chat-Cre mice and Chat-Cre rats to stimulate cervical motoneurons in the spinal cord. This is a proof of principle study that supports the use of DREADD technology to stimulate the motor output to the diaphragm.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the study lie in the use of both mice and rats to test whether the chomogenetic activation of phrenic motoneurons with multiple experimental approaches increases diaphragm EMG activity (both tonic and phasic) and tidal volume.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>Thanks for addressing my comments. One last comment that could be discussed or addressed is :</p>
<p>Line 295- was the time post-infection, which varies considerably between groups and across samples, taken into consideration when comparison of response was made between ChatCre mice (4-9 weeks post-infection) and WT mice (four to five weeks post-infection)?</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>Line 295 â was the time post-infection, which varies considerably between groups and across samples, taken into consideration when comparison of response was between ChatCre mice (4-9 weeks post-infection) and WT mice (four to five weeks post-infection)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We did not originally assess the effects of time post-injection on DREADD response. Generally, AAV transgene expression has been demonstrated to be long-term and stable in the CNS of mice.[1] However, there is some variation in the reporting time of peak transgene expression[2], and this may potentially impact our results.</p>
<p>In investigating this issue further, we discovered an error in our reporting as we did have n = 1 wild-type mouse that underwent EMG recordings 62 days (~9 weeks) post-AAV injection. This has been corrected in the manuscript (lines 87-88).</p>
<p>Addressing this question is challenging due to the uneven distribution of time points within the 4â9-week windows for each group. Essentially, there were two groups per cohort, one studied at 4-5 weeks and one at 8-9 weeks. More specifically:</p>
<p>- Wild-type cohort: n = 10 animals were studied 28â33 days post-injection, and n = 1 at 62 days.</p>
<p>- ChAT-Cre cohort: n = 4 animals were studied 28â30 days post-injection, and n = 5 at 56â59 days.</p>
<p>We performed Pearson correlation analyses between time post-injection and diaphragm EMG response to DREADD activation (peak amplitude and area under the curve, AUC) for both cohorts (Author response image 1):</p>
<p>- ChAT-Cre: No significant correlations were found (peak amplitude: r<sup>2</sup> = -0.117, r = -0.1492, p = 0.702, Figure 1a-b; AUC:r<sup>2</sup> = -0.0883, r = 0.2184, p = 0.572, Figure 1c-d).</p>
<p>- Wild type: Initial analysis of all data showed significant correlations (peak amplitude:r<sup>2</sup> = 0.362, r = 0.6523, p = 0.0296, Figure 1a; AUC: r<sup>2</sup> = 0.347, r = 0.6424, p = 0.033, Figure 1c), suggesting a moderate positive correlation between time post-injection and EMG response. However, when the single 8â9-week wild-type mouse was excluded, these correlations were no longer significant (peak amplitude: r<sup>2</sup> = 0.172, r = 0.5142, p = 0.128, Figure 1b; AUC: r<sup>2</sup> = 0.23, r = 0.5614, p = 0.0913, Figure1d).</p>
<p>Comparing wild-type and ChAT-Cre groups directly was unreliable due to the single wild-type mouse studied at the later time point. We attempted to model time post-injection as a continuous variable (i.e., exact days post-injection) using a restricted maximum likelihood mixed linear model in JMP; however, the analysis could not be performed because there were not sufficient overlapping time points between the two cohorts (i.e., not all days post-injection were represented in both groups). To mitigate this, we binned animals into two groups: 4â5 weeks and 8â9 weeks post-injection. This analysis returned a significant interaction between cohort and time post-injection (p = 0.0391), however there were no significant multiple comparisons upon Tukey post hoc test (i.e., p &gt; 0.05).</p>
<p>Based on these findings, we feel confident that time post-injection is unlikely to have a significant impact on diaphragm EMG response to DREADD activation in the ChAT-Cre cohort. However, in the wild-type cohort, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions, as only one animal was studied at the 8â9-week time point. For similar reasons, it remains unclear whether the relationship between time post-AAV transduction and DREADD response differs between cohorts. Given the inconclusive nature of these results, we have elected not to include this analysis in the manuscript. Nevertheless, to ensure transparency, we have provided Author response image 1 below of peak amplitude and AUC plotted against time, allowing readers to evaluate the data independently.</p>

<p><bold>Response to reviewerâs public reviews:</bold></p>
<p>We chose the dose of J60 based on a prior publication that established that off-target effects were possible at relatively high doses[1]. The dose that we used (0.1 mg/kg) was 30-fold less than the dose that was reported in that paper to potentially have off-target responses (3 mg/kg). Further, Author response image 1 shows the results of experiments in which J60 was given to animals that did not have the excitatory DREADD expressed in the spinal cord. This includes a sample of mice (n = 2) and rats (n = 3), recorded from using the same diaphragm EMG procedure described in the manuscript. The figure shows that there was no consistent response to the J60 at 0.1 mg/kg in the âcontrol experimentâ in which the DREADD was not expressed in the spinal cord.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>How old were the animals at the time of AAV injection, and in subsequent experiments?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The wildtype cohort of mice were 7-9 weeks old at time of AAV injection and DREADD experiments took place 4-5 weeks after AAV injection. ChAT-Cre mice were 6-10 weeks old at time of AAV injection and DREADD experiments took place 4-9 weeks after AAV injection. ChAT-Cre rats were 2-5 months old at time of AAV spinal injection. These animals underwent plethysmography recordings 3-4 months post-AAV injection and subsequently phrenic nerve recording 3-8 weeks later. These details have been added to the Method section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>How many mice were excluded from electrophysiology experiments due to deteriorating electrode contact?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>No mice were excluded from electrophysiology experiments due to deteriorating electrode contact. If you are referring to the n = 1 excluded ChAT-Cre mouse (line 368) this animal was excluded because it showed no histological evidence of DREADD expression (lines 200-206).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>What was the urethane dose?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The urethane dose for phrenic nerve recordings was 2.1 g/kg. See methods section line 395.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We agree that, in general, it is best practice to scatter individual data points. However, when we drafted the new figures, it was apparent that including individual scatter points, in this case, created very âclutteredâ figures that were very difficult to interpret.</p>

<p>More detail regarding the plethysmography studies is needed. Was saline/J60 infused via a tail vein catheter? Were animals handled during the infusion? How long is the &quot;IV&quot; period? What volume of fluid was delivered?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All IV infusions were delivered via a tail vein catheter. Animals were not handled during infusion nor at any point during the recording. An IV catheter was externalized via a port in the plethysmograph allowing for IV infusion without handling of the animal or opening the plethysmograph. The infusion period for both saline and J60 was standardized to 2 minutes. The volume of fluid of both saline and J60 was standardized to 0.6 mL. This information has been added to the methods section (lines 408-410, 415-16, 419-420).</p>

<p>The authors mention the use of both female and male rats but it is not indicated if they tested for and observed any differences between sexes across experiments.</p>

<p>We included the use of both male and female animals in this study to improve the generalizability of the results. However, we were not adequately powered for sex comparisons and therefore did not perform any statistical analysis to assess differences between sexes across experiments.

<p>Line 42. &quot;First, we determined if effective diaphragm activation requires focal DREADD expression targeting phrenic motor neurons, or if non-specific expression in the immediate vicinity of the phrenic motor nucleus would be sufficient....&quot; I don't think that in the experiments with wild-type mice the authors can claim that they selectively targeted the cervical propriospinal network (in isolation from the motoneurons). Given the fact that the histological analysis did not quantify interneurons or motoneurons in the spinal cord, authors should be cautious in proposing which neuronal population is activated in the non-specific approach.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree, and this was a poorly worded statement in our original text. We agree that wild-type DREADD expression was not limited to the cervical propriospinal networks but likely a mix of interneurons and motoneurons. The text has been edited to reflect that (see lines 56-60).</p>

<p>Line 126. Whole body plethysmography protocol. Three hypercapnic hypoxic challenges are a lot for a rat within a 3-hour recording session in freely behaving rats. Did the authors verify with control/ vehicle experiments that repeated challenges in the absence of J60 do not cause potentiation of the response? I understand that it is not possible to invert the order of the injections (due to likely long-term effects of J60) or it is too late to perform vehicle and J60 injections on different days, but controls for repeated challenges should be performed in this type of experiment, especially considering the great variability in the response observed in Figure 4 (in normoxic conditions).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not conduct control experiments to assess the impact of repeated hypercapnic hypoxic challenges on the naÃ¯ve response (i.e., in the absence of J60). However, our experimental protocol was designed such that each experimental period (i.e., post-vehicle or post-J60 infusion) was normalized to baseline recordings taken immediately prior to the vehicle or J60 infusion. While repeated exposure to hypercapnic hypoxic challenges may have altered respiratory output, we are confident that normalizing each experimental period to its respective baseline effectively captures the impact of DREADD activation on ventilation, independent of any potential potentiation that may have occurred due to gas challenge exposure. We have included raw values for all plethysmography outcomes (see Figure 4, panels a-c) to ensure full data transparency. Still, we believe that the baseline-normalized values more accurately reflect the impact of DREADD activation on the components of ventilation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, why the response to the hypercapnic hypoxic challenges are not reported? These could be very interesting to determine the effects of DREADD stimulation on chemosensory responses and enhance the significance of the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response to the hypercapnic hypoxic challenges has been added to the manuscript. See Figure S3 and results section lines 162-167. Briefly, there were no statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) differences in tidal volume, respiratory rate, or minute ventilation between J60 vs sham condition during hypercapnic-hypoxic ventilatory challenges.</p>

<p>Line 200 - what is the reason behind performing a qualitative analysis of mCherry in various quadrants? This limits the interpretation of the results. If the authors used Chat-cre rats, the virus should only be in Chat+ MN. Knowing how selective the virus is, and whether its expression was selective for Phrenic MN versus other MN pools, could address several technical questions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that detailed quantification of expression by motoneuron pool would be of value in future work.  However, for these initial proof-of-concept experiments, we performed the quadrant-based qualitative analysis of mCherry expression to provide a simple comparison of mCherry expression between groups (i.e., ChAT-Cre vs. wildtype mice). This analysis allowed us to: 1) show the reader that each animal included in the study showed evidence of mCherry expression and 2) give the reader an idea of patterns of mCherry expression throughout the mid-cervical spinal cord. Additionally, it is important to note that while ChAT is a marker of motoneurons some populations of interneurons also express ChAT(2-4).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Given the increased values of Dia EMG AUC and no changes in respiratory rate, did the authors determine if there was a change in the inspiratory time with J60 administration?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not assess inspiratory time.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>High death rate in DREADD WT mice - was histological analysis performed on these mice? Could it be due to the large volume injected into the spinal cord that affects not only descending pathways but also ascending ones? Or caused by neuronal death due to the large volume of viral solution in injected in mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Histological analysis was performed on these animals to assess mCherry expression only (i.e., no staining for NeuN or other markers was performed). While the reviewer's speculations are reasonable, we feel these reasons are unlikely to explain the death rate in DREADD WT mice as ChAT-Cre mice received the same volume injected into their spine and lived up until and during diaphragm EMG recordings. Additionally, WT mice lived for 4-5 weeks post-injection which would be past the acute phase that a large immune response to the viral dose would have occurred.</p>

<p>Given some of the unexpected results on cardiovascular parameters in urethane anesthetized rats, did the authors test the effects of J60 in the absence of AAV construct infection?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A small cohort (n = 2) of urethane anesthetized naÃ¯ve wildtype rats were given the J60 ligand (IV, 0.1 mg/kg dose). We did observe a sudden drop in blood pressure after J60 administration that was sustained for the duration of the recording. One animal showed a 12% decrease in mean arterial blood pressure following J60 administration while the other showed a 35% decrease. Thus, it does appear that in this preparation the J60 ligand is producing a drop in arterial blood pressure.</p>

<p>Figures 1 and 2. It would be informative to show raw traces of the Diaphragm EMG to demonstrate the increase in tonic EMG. It is not possible to determine that from the integrated traces in Figures 1A and B.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for bringing up this concern. While the mean data in Figures 1F and 2F do indicate that, on average, animals had tonic diaphragm EMG responses to DREADD activation, the examples given in Figures 1A and 2A show minimal responses. This makes it difficult to fully appreciate the tonic response from those particular traces. However, clear tonic activity can be appreciated from Figures 5A and S2. In these figures, tonic activity is evident from the integrated EMG signals, presenting as a sustained increase in baseline activity between burstsâessentially an upward shift from the zero point.</p>
