<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Influenza viruses are characterized by high mutation rates and extensive genetic diversity, which hinder effective vaccine development and facilitate immune evasion (Taubenberger &amp; Morens, 2006; Barr et al., 2010). These mutations primarily arise from the error-prone activity of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, generating highly heterogeneous viral populations within individual hosts. This phenomenon aligns with the quasi-species model, in which a cloud of related viral genomes evolves under selective pressures (Domingo et al., 2012). Accurate characterization of this intra-host diversity is crucial for understanding viral evolution and informing future vaccine design. However, conventional RNA sequencing technologies often fail to reliably detect low-frequency variants due to technical errors introduced during sample preparation and sequencing steps.</p>
<p>In this study, we implemented a single unique molecular identifier (sUMI) approach to minimize sequencing artifacts and achieve an error rate of approximately 10<sup>−5</sup>. This high-resolution method enabled precise quantification of quasi-species diversity from influenza virus populations isolated at the single-particle level. Comparative analyses revealed mutation frequencies well above background error levels, confirming that the observed variation was of biological origin.</p>
<p>Furthermore, application of information-theoretic metrics such as Shannon entropy and Jensen-Shannon divergence demonstrated that the mutation distribution was non-random, suggesting the presence of selective constraints.</p>
<p>Our findings establish a robust framework for studying intra-host viral evolution and provide critical insights that may enhance AI-driven prediction of mutational trajectories and support more effective influenza vaccine strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Influenza is a seasonal illness caused by the influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The influenza virus has been observed to exhibit a high mutation rate and antigenic diversity, which has the potential to trigger pandemics and exert significant social and economic impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of influenza, vaccine development has been a prominent preventive strategy. However, the rapid mutation of the virus can lead to fluctuations in vaccine efficacy on an annual basis, thereby complicating precise prediction and comprehensive prevention of infection difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>).</p>
<p>Mutations in influenza viruses are primarily introduced by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The high error rate characteristic of RdRp enables the virus to undergo rapid evolution, thereby acquiring the capacity to evade existing immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). It has been suggested that mutant strains that evade antibody-mediated immunity while retaining infectivity tend to exhibit specific patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Further research is necessary to elucidate these predictable mutation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Recently, bioinformatics analyses that employ artificial intelligence (AI) have played a key role in investigating viral evolution mechanisms and exploring strategies for future vaccine design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). However, enhancing the precision of AI-driven mutation prediction necessitates the consolidation of extensive global data. This effort is hampered by spatial and temporal limitations, which restrict the amount of data that can be collected and act as a bottleneck for enhancing the accuracy of predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>).</p>
<p>Currently, the genome sequences that are registered in viral genome databases represent the mean sequences of viral particle populations. However, due to the error-prone nature of viral RNA polymerase, viral populations exhibit high genetic diversity within a single host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). This genetic diversity within viral populations can be described by the quasi-species model, which envisions a cloud of related viral genomes centered around a dominant sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Quasi-species formation plays a crucial role in viral survival strategies, allowing the population to rapidly adapt to environmental pressures such as host immunity or antiviral drugs through collective evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). The development of technology capable of accurately measuring the distribution of genome sequences within a virus population would facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of the types and frequencies of such precursor variants. It is anticipated that these data will play a significant role in the field of AI-based mutation prediction. Accordingly, the quasi-species concept serves as a fundamental framework for understanding viral evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). The accurate quantification of quasi-species diversity is pivotal in facilitating a more profound comprehension of mutation dynamics, selective pressures, and evolutionary potential within a viral population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>)- crucial not only for anticipating future dominant variants but also for detecting low-frequency mutations associated with drug resistance or antigenic shifts.</p>
<p>In current RNA sequencing technology, is plagued by the presence of errors that are introduced during reverse transcription process. The error rate has been reported to be 10<sup>−4</sup> to 10<sup>−5</sup> per nucleotide when using SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase, as utilized in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Accordingly, a target sequencing error rate of 10<sup>−5</sup> was established, and the single UMI method was employed. This method has been shown to minimize sample loss and streamline procedures, thereby facilitating the quantification of genomic diversity within influenza virus particle populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that the sUMI method can effectively reduce sequencing error rates to the 10<sup>−5</sup> level. This method involves the ligation of UMIs directly to DNA amplified by cloning, followed by PCR and sequencing. Subsequently, an analysis of quasi-species was conducted on a population of influenza virus particles that had proliferated from a single particle and quantified the variation in their genome sequences was quantified. A subsequent comparison of this variation was compared with the mutation rate of RNA synthesized by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription revealed that the proportion of mutations in the viral population was significantly higher than the experimental error. This finding indicates that the detected mutations were introduced during viral replication. Furthermore, we employed information-theoretic metrics, including Jensen–Shannon divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) and Shannon entropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), to analyze the distribution of mutations. Our analysis revealed that specific positions within the viral genome demonstrate selective propagation of mutations.</p>
<p>These results provide a novel approach for high-accuracy detection of minor genetic mutations within influenza virus populations and offer valuable insights for understanding viral evolution and designing future vaccines.</p>

<title>Confirmation of Reduction of Error Rate by Sequencing UMI-ligated DNA</title>
<p>Initial findings indicate that establishing a threshold for UMI redundancy leads to a substantial reduction in sequencing errors attributable to the methodology. A single plasmid molecule was amplified via E. coli cloning and subsequently linearized by restriction enzyme digestion. An oligonucleotide containing a primer-binding site and a unique molecular identifier (UMI) sequence at its 5’ end was then ligated to the linearized plasmid. The resulting UMI-tagged linear plasmid was amplified by PCR and subjected to sequencing using the Revio system. The resulting single-molecule sequences were then subjected to analysis using the umierrorcorrect function. During the analysis, we applied GroupSize thresholds of 1, 2, and 3 were applied, and only reads that met each threshold were used to generate consensus sequences for identical UMIs. These consensus sequences were then mapped to the reference sequence. Consequently, the error rates for GroupSize thresholds of 1, 2, and 3 were 3.59×10<sup>−4</sup>, 1.35×10<sup>−4</sup>, and 3.81×10<sup>−5</sup>, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). These findings demonstrate that filtering sequences based on UMI redundancy can significantly reduce method-derived errors, improving sequencing accuracy by nearly an order of magnitude.</p>

<p>It is widely acknowledged that PacBio sequencers exhibit elevated error rates in homopolymer regions, defined as stretches of identical nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). In this study, the term “homopolymer region” was defined as a sequence containing three or more identical consecutive bases, including one base on each side. Subsequently, an analysis was conducted to compare the error rates observed in homopolymer and non-homopolymer regions. In accordance with preceding reports, elevated error rates were detected in homopolymer regions. In the sequencing data of UMI-tagged linear plasmids employing a GroupSize threshold of 3, the error rate in homopolymer regions was 7.11×10<sup>−5</sup>, whereas the error rate in non-homopolymer regions was 1.66×10<sup>−5</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). As the GroupSize threshold increased from 1 to 3, a decrease in the discrepancy between homopolymer and non-homopolymer regions was observed. This finding indicates that the averaging of sequences with identical UMIs effectively mitigates sequencing errors, particularly in homopolymer regions.</p>

<title>Quantification of Error Rate Caused by RT and Comparison with Virus-derived Mutation</title>
<p>In order to ascertain the mutation distribution of viral populations derived from a single virus particle, we sequenced viral genomic RNA was extracted from infected cells and subjected to sequencing. In order to differentiate between biological mutations and technical errors, a comparison was made with <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA derived from plasmids.</p>
<p>MDCK cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and infected with influenza virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05 PFU/well. Following a 72-hour incubation period, wells exhibiting cytopathic effects (CPE) were harvested. Of the 96 wells, four exhibited clear CPE, suggesting successful viral amplification from single particles. The supernatants from these wells were collected as independent viral populations, and total viral genomic RNA was extracted.</p>
<p>For each viral RNA sample, reverse transcription (RT) was performed with the ligation of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), followed by PCR amplification and sequencing. To control for errors introduced during RT-PCR and sequencing, we prepared plasmids containing sequences homologous to the PB2 and HA segments under a T7 promoter and synthesized RNA via <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription. These <italic>in vitro</italic> transcripts were subsequently processed using the same UMI-based RT-PCR and sequencing protocol.</p>
<p>In order to differentiate between biological mutations and technical errors, a method was developed that involved mapping viral reads to the consensus sequence obtained from each viral population and the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed reads to the reference plasmid sequence that was utilized for transcription. The observed error rates in the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcripts are considered to reflect technical errors associated with RT and sequencing. Conversely, the higher error rates observed in the viral RNA are attributed to a combination of biological mutations and technical noise.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that viral RNA exhibited a consistent pattern of elevated error rates across all genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). The mean error rate for viral RNA was 1.19 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, while that for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA was 2.22 × 10<sup>−6</sup>. Therefore, the probability that a detected mutation originates from viral replication rather than experimental error was calculated as:1 - (2.22 × 10<sup>−6</sup>)/(1.19 × 10<sup>−4</sup>) ≈ 98.1%.</p>

<p>These results demonstrate that the majority of detected mutations are derived from biological processes during viral replication rather than technical artifacts. Consequently, this approach facilitates single-molecule genome sequencing and precise profiling of mutation heterogeneity within viral populations.</p>

<title>Mutation Profile of RNA Extracted from a Virus Population Derived from a Single Virus Clone</title>
<p>Table S1 summarizes presents a summary of the mutation frequency, transition/transversion ratio (Ti/Tv), and the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) for each gene. The mutation detection rate across coding regions is illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>. The observed Ti/Tv ratios ranged from 2 to 5, which is consistent with previously reported values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). In the absence of any specific selection pressure was applied within the cell culture system, the dN/dS values were found to be generally below 1, thereby suggesting purifying selection as a mechanism for maintaining protein function. It is noteworthy that the NA gene exhibited dN/dS values approaching or exceeding 1, indicating a heightened degree of evolutionary plasticity.</p>
<p>An investigation was conducted into the presence of defective viral genomes that exhibited partial deletions. This investigation was motivated by the findings of prior studies, which reported the existence of internally deleted genomes in influenza viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Among the 546,580 molecules that were analyzed, 837 (0.15%) contained continuous deletions longer than 10 nucleotides. However, no such deletions were identified in the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNAs, suggesting that these deletions likely emerged during the viral replication process (Fig S3).</p>
<p>Conversely, a mere 13 molecules (0.0024%) exhibited insertions that spanned more than 100 nucleotides. It should be noted that the RT-PCR primer design strategy did not take into account sequences with consecutive deletions at the termini, but only sequences with consecutive deletions in the center of the genome.</p>
<p>On average, over 10,000 sequencing reads were obtained per gene. Independent digital particle counting estimated that each viral culture contained approximately ∼10<sup>13</sup> viral particles. Given the detection probability of rare variants (e.g., 0.1% frequency), the sequencing depth of 10,000 reads a probability of over 95% probability of detecting such mutations, thereby exceeding the background error rate shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>. This finding suggests that mutations present at a frequency of at least ≥0.1% frequency in the population can be reliably detected.</p>
<p>In order to assess the applicability of this approach for comprehensive detection of drug-resistant mutations, a model was developed to demonstrate how mutant frequencies change with fitness using a competitive logistic growth model. This model is predicated on the premise that host cell resources are limited, and that there is a transition from exponential growth to saturation. It is widely employed for the estimation of effective reproduction numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). The minimum relative fitness (compared to wild type) necessary for mutants to surpass this threshold, depending on their initial abundance is shown in Fig. S1. Even late-arising mutants (1 in 10<sup>11</sup>) with ≥5-fold fitness advantage could reach 0.1% of the population, indicating that such adaptive mutations can be detected by this method.</p>

<title>Characteristics of the Observed Mutation Distribution and Deviation from the Poisson Distribution</title>
<p>In order to investigate the characteristics of the mutation distribution in viral populations, a comparison was made between distribution of genome sequences derived from viral RNA and that of RNA synthesized by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription. For each specific nucleotide position, we constructed the distribution P was constructed by defining P(k) as the number of positions at which mutations were observed k times. Assuming that mutations introduced by T7 RNA polymerase, reverse transcriptase, and PCR enzymes occur randomly, the sequencing errors detected in <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA are expected to approximate a Poisson distribution. Conversely, if mutations introduced during viral replication are entirely random with respect to genomic location, then the mutation distribution of viral RNA should also adhere to a Poisson distribution. Conversely, substantial deviations from a Poisson distribution may indicate the presence of selection pressures, such as differences in replication efficiency associated with viral protein function or genomic sequence features.</p>
<p>The quantification of the discrepancy between the experimentally observed mutation count distribution observed through experimentation and the corresponding Poisson distribution with a mean count (λ) was achieved through the implementation of Jensen–Shannon (JS) divergence. The JS divergence is a symmetric and normalized measure of relative entropy that is both symmetric and normalized. It takes on values approaching 1, indicating greater dissimilarity between distributions. The results indicated that, the entire gene set, the mutation distributions of viral RNA exhibited a statistically significant deviation from the Poisson distribution when compared with those of <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). These findings imply that the observed mutation patterns in viral populations are not simply the result of neutral, randomly introduced mutations but reflect constraints imposed by selection related to protein function or replication efficiency. However, it is noteworthy that many minor mutations are introduced in a manner that approximately follows a Poisson distribution. These results clearly demonstrate that most mutations are introduced randomly, contributing to the formation of quasi-species.</p>

<p>(c) Shannon entropy of each gene extracted from the virus and the PB2-like gene synthesized via <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription. To ensure equal conditions across genes, sequencing results from 1000 molecules were randomly sampled, and the Shannon entropy was calculated for each sample.

<p>To further evaluate the phenotypic diversity within the viral population, we quantified the diversity of amino acid sequences encoded by the RNA was quantified Shannon entropy. Shannon entropy is a measure of uncertainty based on probability distributions, with higher values indicating greater variability. For each viral gene, we constructed the distribution of protein sequences derived from all sequencing fragments (with UMI count ≥ 3) was constructed, and compared the entropy values between viral RNA and <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA were compared.</p>
<p>The results demonstrated that, across the entire gene pool, viral RNA exhibited a higher degree of amino acid sequence diversity in comparison to <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). This increased diversity is likely indicative of the genetic variation accumulated during viral propagation and can serve as an indicator of the potential evolutionary capacity of the virus under the culture conditions utilized in this study.</p>

<title>Comparison Between Mutations Derived from Viral Propagation and Actual Evolutionary Lineages</title>
<p>The majority of the mutations measured in this study within viral populations are likely to be neutral mutations that have been randomly introduced. However, it is important to note that each of these mutations has the potential to become fixed and dominate the population, representing possible origins of emerging variants. A comparison of the viral genome sequences between the strain used in this experiment, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8), and its closely related strain, A/Alaska/1935, revealed three amino acid differences: I563R (PB1), D452E (HA), and M458V (HA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Of these, two mutations—I563R (PB1) and M458V (HA)—were detected in at least one of the four experimental populations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). These mutations manifested in non-homopolymeric regions, and their frequencies exceeded the mean mutation rate in these regions across all genes, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>. These findings suggest that these mutations may be preferentially introduced during replication or may be positively selected due to their capacity to increase their own copy numbers.</p>

</fig>
<p>Subsequently, under the assumption that mutations introduced at each nucleotide position follow a Poisson distribution, we identified mutations that occurred at frequencies with a probability of ≤5% as candidates for errors that were positively selected and proliferated. A comparison of these mutations with those found between PR8 and the recent pandemic strain A/California/01/2009 (CA01) revealed that 14 amino acid substitutions were shared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Among the 4,450 amino acid residues, 402 differed between PR8 and CA01, and a total of 596 non-synonymous mutations exceeding the threshold were identified in this study. Assuming random selection of positions, the probability that a randomly introduced mutation matches both the position and the resulting amino acid of any of the 402 known substitutions is calculated follows: The resulting percentage, 1.6%, is then calculated by dividing 402 by 4450 and then multiplying by 0.177. In this context, 0.177 represents the mean probability that two independent random point mutations on the same codon will result in the same amino acid substitution. The z-score for observing 14 coincident mutations is calculated as follows:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="658006v2_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The corresponding one-sided p-value is 0.0764. Consequently, no statistically significant difference was observed at the 5% level of significance, indicating that selective mutation introduction driving convergence toward recent pandemic strains cannot be concluded from this dataset.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we established a methodology for single-molecule genome RNA sequencing within cultured influenza virus populations and demonstrated the potential for experimental mutation prediction through sequence distribution analysis. To validate this approach, the sequencing of UMI-tagged linearized plasmids was conducted. The analysis revealed that focusing solely on sequences with three or more reads that shared the same UMI led to an enhancement in sequence accuracy by more than tenfold. This resulted in an error rate that was on the order of 10<sup>−5</sup> per bp per read. Assuming that PCR and sequencing introduce errors at a rate of approximately 10;<sup>−3</sup>, the probability of two or more errors occurring at the same base position among three reads theoretically decreases to the order of 10<sup>−6</sup>. The discrepancy between this theoretical value and our measured data is likely attributable to mutation-prone regions, such as homopolymers and amplification bias, where error-containing sequences were preferentially amplified and detected as majorities.</p>
<p>It is widely acknowledged that PacBio sequencers frequently generate errors in homopolymer regions, and our study observed analogous trends. Specifically, when setting the UMI redundancy threshold was set to three, error rates in homopolymer regions found to be higher than those in non-homopolymer regions. However, the integration of UMIs has led to a significant reduction in this error gap, thereby validating the efficacy of UMI technology in addressing erroneous reads. This finding indicates that UMI-based methods have the potential to enhance the accuracy of PacBio, especially for genes and sequences that contain homopolymer regions. The implications of this study extend to other single-molecule sequencing platforms such as nanopore.</p>
<p>A subsequent analysis of RNA from virus populations derived from single virus particles exhibited elevated error rates when compared to <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA, a phenomenon that is presumably attributable to mutations introduced during viral replication. The observed mutation distribution comprised both mutations consistent with a neutral, Poisson-like accumulation and mutations that deviated substantially from a Poisson distribution. This pattern indicates the coexistence of neutral and non-neutral mutations within the viral population, forming a quasi-species structure. The deviation from Poisson expectations suggests that certain mutations were subject to selective pressures, likely influencing replication efficiency or protein function under the specific culture conditions. For instance, the mutation detection rate near the HA antigenic site (amino acids 180–200) was 1.62×10<sup>−4</sup>, approximately 1.5 times higher than the genome-wide mutation rate, highlighting a potential hotspot under positive selection. This finding corroborates prior reports of higher sequence variability in antigenic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). On the other hand, the observed mutation rates among genes do not align with the findings from previous phylogenetic research<sup>45</sup> on ‘highly conserved’ and ‘highly divergent’ genes, suggesting a lack of correlation between the distribution size and the evolvability of each gene. Such discrepancies may reflect differences in observation timing. Traditional phylogenetic analyses capture fixed mutations shaped by long-term selection, while our study detects earlier-stage mutations that have yet to undergo full selective filtering. Thus, the weak correlation with phylogenetic conservation likely arises because many observed mutations are still under selection. A comparison between RNA extracted from viral populations and <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA revealed greater protein sequence diversity in the former, as quantified by Shannon entropy. This greater diversity reflects the accumulation of mutations during replication and the latent evolutionary potential of viral populations.</p>
<p>The reference sequences employed for mapping viral genomes in this study were derived from single particles that contributed to the formation of each virus population. Nevertheless, subtle differences were observed among the consensus sequences from four virus populations, suggesting that even within the same PR8 strain, various mutations had accumulated during laboratory passaging, resulting in genetically diverse populations at the outset. This finding suggests that the experimental strain already possessed a mutation pool, and the observed mutation distribution reflects this background diversity. A comprehensive understanding of the effects of long-term passaging on viral population structure and mutation origins is imperative to obtain significant insights.</p>
<p>As this study did not impose specific selective pressures, we did not observe a significant increase of particular mutations previously linked to drug resistance or host adaptation was not observed within the populations. However, resistance mutations such as I38M, which have been demonstrated to confer resistance to the endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), were detected (see Datasets S1 and S2 for a list of all mutations detected). Conversely, mutations fixed in PR8-related strains were already present in populations derived from single particles. These findings imply that the viral quasi-species may serve as a latent genetic reservoir, from which advantageous variants can be selected in response to environmental pressures. Thus, the real-time observation of mutation proliferation under diverse culture conditions will yield pivotal insights into the mechanisms underlying existing mutation expansion, thereby facilitating the prediction of novel mutations.</p>
<p>The predominant paradigm in evolutionary biology is the neutral evolution hypothesis, which posits that most evolutionary processes can be explained by random genetic drift. Consequently, elucidating the origins of these evolutionary processes is paramount for making accurate evolutionary predictions. A comprehensive analysis of neutral mutations necessitates the quantification of minor variants. The sUMI method was employed to detect mutations present at 0.1% frequency in populations by sequencing 10,000 molecules. Furthermore, the sequencing error rate was reduced to the order of 10<sup>−5</sup>, comparable to reverse transcriptase error rates. This enabled theoretical detection of mutations a frequency of 0.05% by analyzing over 100,000 molecules with high accuracy. It is anticipated that this approach will yield comprehensive insights into mutation the occurrence rates and distributions of mutations in neutral evolution.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have demonstrated the applicability of this method for mutation forecasting by using logistic modeling based on mutation fitness and initial frequencies. Subsequent applications will encompass the comprehensive detection and quantitative estimation of adaptive mutations under diverse environmental conditions, including the presence of drugs and different host species.</p>
<p>In summary, experimental evidence has demonstrated the efficacy of UMI technology in reducing sequencing errors and accurately measuring mutation distributions within viral populations. Furthermore, evidence was presented demonstrating that sequence distributions within individual populations manifest non-random directional biases. With the continued development of methods to quantify mutation bias and latent evolutionary potential, it is anticipated that laboratory-scale prediction of drug-induced mutations and pandemic-capable strains will become a reality. The broad distribution of mutations indicates that viral populations possess diverse mutation pools, where selective pressures enhance robustness through adaptive mutation selection. This mechanism signifies the ability of viruses to adapt to environmental changes with flexibility, thereby providing critical insights for predicting long-term viral evolution and pandemic emergence. A more thorough examination of the roles of mutations in the context of adaptive viral evolution in response to drug treatment is merited.</p>

<p>Tamao et al. aimed to quantify the diversity and mutation rate of the influenza (PR8 strain) in order to establish a high-resolution method for studying intra-host viral evolution. To achieve this, the authors combined RNA sequencing with single-molecule unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to minimize errors introduced during technical processing. They proposed an in vitro infection model with a single viral particle to represent biological genetic diversity, alongside a control model using in vitro transcribed RNA for two viral genes, PB2 and HA.</p>
<p>Through this approach, the authors demonstrated that UMIs reduced technical errors by approximately tenfold. By analyzing four viral populations and comparing them to in vitro transcribed RNA controls, they estimated that ~98.1% of observed mutations originated from viral replication rather than technical artifacts. Their results further showed that most mutations were synonymous and introduced randomly. However, the distribution of mutations suggested selective pressures that favored certain variants. Additionally, comparison with a closely related influenza strain (A/Alaska/1935) revealed two positively selected mutations, though these were absent in the strain responsible for the most recent pandemic (CA01).</p>
<p>Overall, the study is well-designed, and the interpretations are strongly supported by the data. However, the following clarifications are recommended:</p>
<p>(1) The methods section is overly brief. Even if techniques are cited, more experimental details should be included. For example, since the study focuses heavily on methodology, details such as the number of PCR cycles in RT-PCR or the rationale for choosing HA and PB2 as representative in vitro transcripts should be provided.</p>
<p>(2) Information on library preparation and sequencing metrics should be included. For example, the total number of reads, any filtering steps, and quality score distributions/cutoff for the analyzed reads.</p>
<p>(3) In the Results section (line 115, &quot;Quantification of error rate caused by RT&quot;), the mutation rate attributed to viral replication is calculated. However, in line 138, it is unclear whether the reported value reflects PB2, HA, or both, and whether the comparison is based on the error rate of the same viral RNA or the mean of multiple values (as shown in Figure 3A). Please clarify whether this number applies universally to all influenza RNAs or provide the observed range.</p>
<p>(4) Since the T7 polymerase introduced errors are only applied to the in vitro transcription control, how were these accounted for when comparing mutation rates between transcribed RNA and cell-culture-derived virus?</p>
<p>(5) Figure 2 shows that a UMI group size of 4 has an error rate of zero, but this group size is not mentioned in the text. Please clarify.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript presents a technically oriented application of UMI-based long-read sequencing to study intra-host diversity in influenza virus populations. The authors aim to minimize sequencing artifacts and improve the detection of rare variants, proposing that this approach may inform predictive models of viral evolution. While the methodology appears robust and successfully reduces sequencing error rates, key experimental and analytical details are missing, and the biological insight is modest. The study includes only four samples, with no independent biological replicates or controls, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Claims related to rare variant detection and evolutionary selection are not fully supported by the data presented.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study addresses an important technical challenge in viral genomics by implementing a UMI-based long-read sequencing approach to reduce amplification and sequencing errors. The methodological focus is well presented, and the work contributes to improving the resolution of low-frequency variant detection in complex viral populations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The application of UMI-based error correction to viral population sequencing has been established in previous studies (e.g., in HIV), and this manuscript does not introduce a substantial methodological or conceptual advance beyond its use in the context of influenza.</p>
<p>The study lacks independent biological replicates or additional viral systems that would strengthen the generalizability of the conclusions. Potential sources of technical error are not explored or explicitly controlled. Key methodological details are missing, including the number of PCR cycles, the input number of molecules, and UMI family size distributions. These are essential to support the claimed sensitivity of the method.</p>
<p>The assertion that variants at {greater than or equal to}0.1% frequency can be reliably detected is based on total read count rather than the number of unique input molecules. Without information on UMI diversity and family sizes, the detection limit cannot be reliably assessed.</p>
<p>Although genetic variation is described, the functional relevance of observed mutations in HA and NA is not addressed or discussed in the context of known antigenic or evolutionary features of influenza. The manuscript is largely focused on technical performance, with limited exploration of the biological implications or mechanistic insights into influenza virus evolution.</p>
<p>The experimental scale is small, with only four viral populations derived from single particles analyzed. This limited sample size restricts the ability to draw broader conclusions about quasispecies dynamics or evolutionary pressures.</p>
