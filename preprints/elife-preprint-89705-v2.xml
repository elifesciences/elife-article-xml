<title>Abstract</title><p>We previously showed that the germ cell specific nuclear protein RBMXL2 represses cryptic splicing patterns during meiosis and is required for male fertility. RBMXL2 evolved from the X-linked RBMX gene, which is silenced during meiosis due to sex chromosome inactivation. It has been unknown whether RBMXL2 provides a direct replacement for RBMX in meiosis, or whether RBMXL2 evolved to deal with the transcriptionally permissive environment of meiosis. Here we find that RBMX primarily operates as a splicing repressor in somatic cells, and specifically regulates a distinct class of exons that exceed the median human exon size. RBMX protein-RNA interactions are enriched within ultra-long exons, particularly within genes involved in genome stability, and repress the selection of cryptic splice sites that would compromise gene function. These similarities in overall function suggested that RBMXL2 might replace the function of RBMX during meiosis. To test this prediction we carried out inducible expression of RBMXL2 and the more distantly related RBMY protein in somatic cells, finding each could rescue aberrant patterns of RNA processing caused by RBMX depletion. The C-terminal disordered domain of RBMXL2 is sufficient to rescue proper splicing control after RBMX depletion. Our data indicate that RBMX and RBMXL2 have parallel roles in somatic tissues and the germline that must have been conserved for at least 200 million years of mammalian evolution. We propose RBMX family proteins are particularly important for the splicing inclusion of some ultra-long exons with increased intrinsic susceptibility to cryptic splice site selection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Efficient gene expression in eukaryotes requires introns and exons to be correctly recognised by the spliceosome, the macromolecular machine that joins exons together. The spliceosome recognises short sequences called splice sites that are present at exon-intron junctions within precursor mRNAs. In higher organisms there is some flexibility in splice site recognition, as most genes produce multiple mRNAs by alternative splicing. However, aberrant “cryptic” splice sites that are weakly selected or totally ignored by the spliceosome occur frequently in the human genome and can function as decoys to interfere with gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aldalaqan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sibley et al., 2016</xref>). Many cryptic splice sites are located amongst repetitive sequences within introns, where they are repressed by RNA binding proteins belonging to the hnRNP family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Attig et al., 2018</xref>). However, cryptic splice sites can also be present within exons, and particularly can shorten long exons (by providing competing alternative splice sites) or cause formation of exitrons (internal exon sequences that are removed as if they were introns)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marquez et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The testis-specific nuclear RNA binding protein RBMXL2 was recently shown to repress cryptic splice site selection during meiosis, including within some ultra-long exons of genes involved in genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ehrmann et al., 2019</xref>). RBMXL2 is only expressed within the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aldalaqan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ehrmann et al., 2019</xref>), raising the question of how these same cryptic splice sites controlled by RBMXL2 are repressed in other parts of the body. Suggesting a possible answer to this question, RBMXL2 is part of an anciently diverged family of RNA binding proteins. The <italic>RBMXL2</italic> gene evolved 65 million years ago following retro-transposition of the <italic>RBMX</italic> gene from the X chromosome to an autosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ehrmann et al., 2019</xref>). RBMX and RBMXL2 proteins (also known as hnRNP-G and hnRNP-GT) share 73% identity at the protein level and have the same modular structure comprising an N-terminal RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) and a C-terminal disordered region containing RGG repeats (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). RBMX and RBMXL2 are also more distantly related to a gene called <italic>RBMY</italic> on the long arm of the Y chromosome that is deleted in some infertile men (with only ∼37% identity between human RBMXL2 and RBMY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Elliott et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ma et al., 1993</xref>). The role of RBMY in the germline is almost totally unknown, but RBMY protein has been implicated in splicing regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Elliott et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Venables et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

<p>The location of <italic>RBMX</italic> and <italic>RBMY</italic> on the X and Y chromosomes has important implications for their expression patterns during meiosis. The X and Y chromosomes are inactivated during meiosis within a heterochromatic structure called the XY body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Turner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang, 2004</xref>). Meiosis is quite a long process, and to maintain cell viability during this extended period a number of autosomal retrogenes have evolved from essential X chromosome genes. These autosomal retrogenes are actively expressed during meiosis when the X chromosome is inactive. However, it is unknown whether RBMXL2 is functionally similar enough to RBMX to provide a direct replacement during meiosis, or whether RBMXL2 has evolved differently to control meiosis-specific patterns of expression. Suggesting somewhat different activities, RBMX was recently shown to activate exon splicing inclusion, via a mechanism involving binding to RNA through its C-terminal disordered domain facilitated by recognition of m6A residues and RNA polymerase II pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we have used iCLIP and RNA-seq to analyse the binding characteristics and RNA processing targets of human RBMX. We identify a novel class of RBMX-dependent ultra-long exons connected to genome stability and transcriptional control, and find that RBMX, RBMXL2 and RBMY paralogs have closely related functional activity in repressing cryptic splice site selection. Our data reveal an ancient mechanism of gene expression control by RBMX family proteins that predates the radiation of mammals, and provides a new understanding of how ultra-long exons are properly incorporated into mRNAs.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>RBMX primarily operates as a splicing repressor in somatic cells</title>
<p>We first set out to identify the spectrum of splicing events that are strongly controlled by RBMX across different human cell lines. We used RNA-seq from biological triplicate MDA-MB-231 cells treated with siRNA against RBMX (achieving &gt;90% depletion, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), followed by bioinformatics analysis using the SUPPA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Trincado et al., 2018</xref>) and MAJIQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Vaquero-Garcia et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">2016</xref>) splicing prediction tools. We identified 315 changes in RNA processing patterns in response to RBMX-depletion that were high enough amplitude to be visually confirmed on the IGV genome browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – Figure supplement 1A</xref>) (Figure 1 – Source Data 1). Analysis of these splicing events within existing RNA-seq data from HEK293 cells depleted for RBMX (GSE74085) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) revealed 148 high amplitude events that are controlled by RBMX in both HEK293 and MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). We concentrated our downstream analysis on these splicing events (Figure 1 – Source Data 1). 92% of the splicing events regulated by RBMX in human somatic cells were already annotated on Ensembl, Gencode or Refseq (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Strikingly two thirds of these events are repressed by RBMX, meaning they were increasingly used in RBMX depleted cells compared to control, and include exon inclusion, alternative 5ʹ and 3ʹ splice sites, exitrons, and intron retention (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of splice site strength revealed that, unlike splice sites activated by RBMX (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – Figure supplement 1B</xref>), alternative splice sites repressed by RBMX have comparable strength to more commonly used splice sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). This means that RBMX operates as a splicing repressor in human somatic cells to prevent use of ‘decoy’ splice sites that could disrupt normal patterns of gene expression.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Splicing control and sites of RBMX protein-RNA interaction are enriched within long internal exons</title>
<p>The above data indicated that RBMX has a major role in repressing cryptic splicing patterns in human somatic cells. To further correlate splicing regulation to patterns of RBMX protein-RNA interactions, we next mapped the distribution of RBMX-RNA binding sites in human somatic cells. We engineered a stable human HEK293 cell line to express RBMX-FLAG fusion protein in response to tetracycline addition. Western blotting showed that expression of RBMX-FLAG was efficiently induced after tetracycline treatment. Importantly, levels of the induced RBMX-FLAG protein were similar to those of endogenous RBMX (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We next used this inducible cell line to carry out individual nucleotide resolution crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) – a technique that produces a global picture of protein-RNA binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Konig et al., 2011</xref>). After crosslinking, RBMX-FLAG protein was immunoprecipitated, then infra-red labelled RNA-protein adducts were isolated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) and subjected to library preparation. Following deep sequencing of biological triplicate experiments, 5 to 10 million unique reads (referred to here as iCLIP tags, representing sites of RBMX protein-RNA cross-linking) were aligned to the human genome. Each individual iCLIP replicate showed at least 70% correlation with each of the others (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – Figure Supplement 1A</xref>). K-mer motif analysis revealed RBMX preferentially binds to AG-rich sequences (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – Figure Supplement 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>In line with previous work on other RNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Van Nostrand et al., 2020</xref>), only 31% of the RNA splicing events that are controlled by RBMX in both HEK293 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells were identified by iCLIP as direct targets for RBMX binding (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – Figure supplement 1C</xref>, and and Figure 2 – Source Data 1). Furthermore, when we plotted the fraction of RBMX iCLIP tags present near exons that contain splicing defects in the absence of RBMX, and compared it to iCLIP tags present near a set of exons unaffected by RBMX depletion, we did not detect significant enrichment of RBMX binding within exons that contain splice sites repressed by RBMX (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – Figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). However, RBMX-responsive internal exons that did contain RBMX iCLIP tags were significantly longer than the ones that are not bound by RBMX (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and Figure 2 – Source Data 1). We therefore compared the length of the internal exons regulated (identified by RNA-seq) and bound by RBMX (identified by iCLIP) within protein-coding genes to all internal mRNA exons expressed in HEK293 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). We reasoned that larger exons might have a higher chance to be bound by RBMX merely because of their large size. To minimise this effect, we did not take into account the density of RBMX binding and instead considered all exons that contained at least one iCLIP tag. Strikingly, we found that exons regulated and bound by RBMX were significantly longer than the median size of HEK293 mRNA exons which is ∼130 bp (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, and Figure 2 – Source Data 2). This led us to test whether RBMX protein is preferentially associated with long exons. For this we plotted the distribution of internal exons bound and regulated by RBMX together with all internal exons expressed from HEK293 mRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). We found that RBMX controls and binds two different classes of exons: the first have comparable length to the average HEK293 exon, while the second were extremely long, exceeding 1000 bp in length (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). We defined this second class as ‘ultra-long exons’, which represented the 18.9% of internal exons regulated by RBMX and 17.6% of the ones that contained RBMX iCLIP tags. These proportions were significantly enriched compared to the general abundance of internal ultra-long exons expressed from HEK293 cells, which was only 0.4% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). K-mer analyses also showed that while ultra-long exons within mRNAs are rich in AT-rich sequences compared to shorter exons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), the ultra-long exons that are either regulated or bound by RBMX displayed enrichment of AG-rich sequences (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>), consistent with our identified RBMX-recognised sequences (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Overall, this data revealed a function for RBMX in the regulation of splicing of a particular group of ultra-long exons.</p>

<title>RBMX is important for proper splicing inclusion of full-length ultra-long exons within genes involved in DNA repair and RNA polymerase II transcription</title>
<p>We next wondered whether ultra-long exons regulated by RBMX (which represented 11.6% of all ultra-long internal exons from genes expressed in HEK293) had any particular feature compared to ultra-long exons that were RBMX-independent. To determine whether RBMX regulates particular classes of genes we performed Gene Ontology analysis. Both the genes bound by RBMX (detected using iCLIP, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Figure supplement 1A</xref> and Figure 3 – Source Data 1) and regulated by RBMX in both MDA-MB-231 and HEK293 cell lines (detected using RNA-seq, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Figure supplement 1B and Figure 3</xref> – Source Data 1) each showed individual global enrichment in functions connected to genome stability and gene expression. Similarly, Gene Ontology analyses for genes that contained ultra-long exons bound by and dependent on RBMX for correct splicing were enriched in pathways involving cell cycle, DNA repair, and chromosome regulation, compared to all expressed genes with ultra-long exons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and Figure 3 – Source Data 1).

<p>The above data indicated that RBMX-RNA binding interactions and splicing control by RBMX are particularly associated with long internal exons and enriched within classes of genes involved in genome stability. These exons included the 2.1 Kb exon 5 of the <italic>ETAA1</italic> (<italic>Ewings Tumour Associated Antigen 1</italic>) gene, where RBMX potently represses a cryptic 3ʹ splice site that reduces the size of this exon from 2.1 Kb to 100 bp (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Figure supplement 2A</xref>). RT-PCR analysis confirmed that RBMX depletion causes a much shorter version of <italic>ETAA1</italic> exon 5 to prevail, particularly in MDA-MB-231 and NCI-H520 cells, but less in MCF7 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). <italic>ETAA1</italic> encodes a replication stress protein that accumulates at sites of DNA damage and is a component of the ATR signalling response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bass et al., 2016</xref>). Selection of RBMX-repressed cryptic 3ʹ splice sites within <italic>ETAA1</italic> exon 5 removes a long portion of the open reading frame (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Figure supplement 2B</xref>). Consistent with the penetrance of this <italic>ETAA1</italic> splicing defect being sufficiently high to affect protein production, no ETAA1 protein was detectable 72 hours after RBMX depletion from MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Another ultra-long exon is found within the <italic>REV3L</italic> gene that encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase ζ that functions in translesion DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Martin and Wood, 2019</xref>). RBMX similarly represses a cryptic 3ʹ splice site within the ultra-long exon 13 of the <italic>REV3L</italic> gene (∼4.2 Kb), that has an extremely high density of RBMX binding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). RT-PCR analysis confirmed a strong splicing switch to a cryptic splice site within <italic>REV3L</italic> exon 13 after RBMX was depleted from MDA-MB-231, MCF7 and NCI-H520 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>We also detected extremely high density RBMX protein binding within exon 9 of the <italic>ATRX</italic> gene (3 Kb in length) that encodes a chromatin remodelling protein involved in mitosis. Depletion of RBMX results in expression of a shortened version of <italic>ATRX</italic> exon 9, caused by formation of an exitron through selection of cryptic 5ʹ and 3ʹ splice sites within exon 9 (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>RBMX protein-RNA interactions may insulate important splicing signals from the spliceosome</title>
<p>The iCLIP data suggested a model where RBMX protein binding may insulate ultra-long exons so that cryptic splice sites cannot be accessed by the spliceosome. This model predicted that RBMX binding sites would be close to important sequences used for selection of cryptic splice sites. RBMX iCLIP tags mapped just upstream of the cryptic 3ʹ splice sites within <italic>ETAA1</italic> exon 5 in HEK293 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells after RBMX depletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that RBMX may bind close to the branchpoints used to generate these cryptic splicing patterns. However, although usually located close to their associated 3ʹ splice sites, in some cases branchpoints can be located far upstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gooding et al., 2006</xref>). We tested the prediction that RBMX may sterically interfere with components of the spliceosome by directly mapping the branchpoints associated with use of these cryptic <italic>ETAA1</italic> splice sites. To facilitate mapping of the branchpoint sequences used by the cryptic 3ʹ splice site within <italic>ETAA1</italic> exon 5, we made a minigene by cloning the ultra-long <italic>ETAA1</italic> exon 5 and flanking intron sequences between constitutively spliced β-globin exons (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Figure supplement 2D</xref>). Confirming that this minigene recapitulated cryptic splicing patterns, after transfection into HEK293 cells we could detect splicing inclusion of both the full-length and shorter (cryptic) versions of <italic>ETAA1</italic> exon 5 mRNA isoforms using multiplex RT-PCR (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Figure supplement 2E</xref>). We then used an RT-PCR assay (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Figure Supplement 2F</xref>) to monitor the position of branchpoints just upstream of the cryptic 3ʹ splice sites of <italic>ETAA1</italic> exon 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Královičová et al., 2021</xref>). Sanger sequencing of the amplification product made in this assay confirmed that the branchpoint sequences used by these cryptic 3ʹ splice sites are adjacent to RBMX binding sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Figure supplement 2G</xref>).</p>

<title>RBMXL2 and RBMY can replace the activity of RBMX in somatic cells</title>
<p>The above data showed that although RBMX can activate splicing of some exons, it predominantly operates as a splicing repressor in human somatic cells, and moreover has a key role in repressing cryptic splicing within ultra-long exons. This pattern of RBMX activity is thus very similar to that previously reported for RBMXL2 in the germline, where RBMXL2 represses cryptic splice sites during meiosis. RBMXL2 is expressed during male meiosis when the X chromosome is silenced. To directly mimic this switch in protein expression we constructed a HEK293 RBMXL2-FLAG tetracycline-inducible cell line, from which we depleted RBMX using siRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Western blots showed that RBMX was successfully depleted after siRNA treatment, and the RBMXL2-FLAG protein was strongly expressed after tetracycline induction, thus simulating their relative expression patterns in meiotic cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). We globally investigated patterns of splicing in these rescue experiments by performing RNA-seq analysis of each of the experimental groups. Strikingly, almost 80% of splicing defects that we could detect after RBMX-depletion were rescued by tetracycline-induced RBMXL2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, and Figure 4 Source Data 1). Notably, longer exons were much more likely to be rescued by RBMXL2 than shorter exons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), and most of the splice events that were restored by RBMXL2-expression had nearby RBMX binding sites evidenced by iCLIP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). We then validated three cryptic splicing patterns by RT-PCR. Confirming our previous finding, in the absence of tetracycline treatment depletion of RBMX led to increased selection of cryptic splice sites within <italic>ETAA1</italic> exon 5 and <italic>REV3L</italic> exon 13, and to formation of an exitron within <italic>ATRX</italic> exon 9 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-E</xref>, compare lanes 7-9 with lanes 10-12). Consistent with our RNA-seq analysis (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – Figure supplement 1A-C</xref>), tetracycline-induction of RBMXL2 was sufficient to repress production of each of these aberrant splice isoforms (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-E</xref>, compare lanes 1-3 with lanes 4-6). These experiments indicate that RBMXL2 is able to replace RBMX activity in regulating ultra-long exons within somatic cells.</p>

<p>RBMX and RBMXL2 are both more distantly related to the Y chromosome-encoded RBMY protein, with RBMX and RBMY diverging when the mammalian Y chromosome evolved (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). RBMY has also been implicated in splicing control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nasim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Venables et al., 2000</xref>), but its functions are very poorly understood. We thus tested whether RBMY might also be performing a similar function to RBMX. Employing a HEK293 cell line containing tetracycline-inducible, FLAG-tagged RBMY protein, we detected successful recovery of normal splicing patterns of the ultra-long exons within the <italic>ETAA1</italic>, <italic>REV3L</italic> and <italic>ATRX</italic> genes within RBMX-depleted cells 24 hours after tetracycline induction of RBMY (<xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – Figure supplement 2</xref>). These results indicate that even despite its more extensive divergence, RBMY can also functionally replace RBMX in cryptic splice site control within long exons. Thus, splicing control mechanisms by RBMX family proteins pre-date the evolution of the mammalian X and Y chromosomes</p>

<title>The disordered domain of RBMXL2 is required for efficient splicing control of ultra-long exons</title>
<p>The above data showed that RBMX predominantly operates as a splicing repressor in somatic cells, thus performing a functionally parallel role to RBMXL2 in the germline. Although RBMX contains an RRM domain that is the most highly conserved region compared with RBMXL2 and RBMY, splicing activation by RBMX depends on its C-terminal disordered domain that also binds to RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Moursy et al., 2014</xref>). We thus reasoned that if RBMX and RBMXL2 were performing equivalent molecular functions, rescue of splicing by RBMXL2 should be mediated by the disordered region of RBMXL2 alone, independent of the RRM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Moursy et al., 2014</xref>).

Tetracycline induction of this RBMXL2ΔRRM protein was able to rescue siRNA mediated depletion of RBMX (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C-E</xref>), directly confirming that the C-terminal disordered domain of RBMXL2 protein is responsible for mediating cryptic splicing repression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We previously showed that the germ cell-specific RBMXL2 protein represses cryptic splice site selection during meiotic prophase. Here we find that this is part of a bigger picture, where the closely related but more ubiquitously expressed RBMX protein also provides a similar activity within somatic cells. Supporting this conclusion, both RBMX and RBMXL2 proteins most frequently operate as splicing repressors in their respective cell types. We further find that RBMX binds and is key for proper splicing inclusion of a group of ultra-long exons, defined as exceeding 1 Kb in length. RBMXL2 similarly represses cryptic splice sites within ultra-long exons of genes involved in genome stability including <italic>Brca2</italic> and <italic>Meioc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ehrmann et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, RBMXL2 and even the more diverged RBMY protein are able to provide a direct replacement for RBMX splicing control within human somatic cells. Although many of the splice sites within ultra-long exons we find to be repressed by RBMX are already annotated, they are not usually selected in the human cell lines we investigated and thus represent potential decoy splice sites that would interfere with full-length gene expression.</p>
<p>Long human exons provide an enigma in understanding gene expression. Most human exons have evolved to be quite short (∼130 bp) to facilitate a process called exon definition, in which protein-protein interactions between early spliceosome components bound to closely juxtaposed splice sites promote full spliceosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Black, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Robberson et al., 1990</xref>). Exon definition also requires additional RNA binding proteins to recognise exons and flanking intron sequences.</p>
<p>These include members of the SR protein family that bind to exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) and activate exon inclusion, with exons typically having higher ESE content relative to introns. While the mechanisms that ensure proper splicing inclusion of long exons are not well understood, cryptic splice sites would be statistically more likely to occur within long exons compared to short exons, where they could prevent full-length exon inclusion. Cryptic splice sites within long exons could be particularly problematic (compared to an intronic location) since they would be embedded within a high ESE sequence environment. For example some long exons require interactions with the SR protein SRSF3 and hnRNP K and phase separation of transcription factors to be spliced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kawachi et al., 2021</xref>). Hence, although the functions of hnRNPs in repressing cryptic splice events has often concentrated on their role within introns, other hnRNPs as well as RBMX might also show enriched binding within ultra-long exons to help repress cryptic splice site selection.</p>
<p>The X chromosome is required for viability. This means that meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (inactivation of the X and Y chromosomes during meiosis) coordinately represses a panel of essential genes on the X chromosome, thus opening the need for alternative routes to fulfil their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Turner, 2015</xref>). A number of essential X-linked genes have generated autosomal retrogenes that are expressed during meiosis, although genetic inactivation of some of these retrogenes causes a phenotype that manifests outside of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang, 2004</xref>). An exception is exemplified by the RPL10 and RPL10L proteins that are 95% identical: <italic>RPL10</italic> mutation causes meiotic arrest, and RPL10L has been shown to directly replace its X-linked ortholog <italic>RPL10</italic> during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang, 2004</xref>). <italic>RBMXL2</italic> is the only other X-linked retrogene that has been shown to be essential for meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ehrmann et al., 2019</xref>). Here we show that ectopic expression of RBMXL2 can compensate for lack of RBMX in somatic cells. This is consistent with a recent model suggesting that RBMXL2 directly replaces RBMX function during meiosis because of transcriptional inactivation of the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aldalaqan et al., 2022</xref>). This general requirement for functionally similar RBMX family proteins across somatic and germ cells further suggest that RBMX-family functions in splicing control have been required for ∼200 million years, since before the divergence of separate <italic>RBMX</italic> and <italic>RBMY</italic> genes early in mammalian evolution.</p>
<p>The iCLIP data reported here show a high density of RBMX binding within ultra-long exons, consistent with a model in which RBMX protein binding to RNA masks sequences required for cryptic splice sites selection. Such RBMX binding would block access to spliceosome components or splicing activator proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Our data show that the C-terminal disordered domain of RBMXL2 protein is sufficient to control splicing inclusion of ultra-long exons. This is exactly analogous to the mechanism of control of splicing activation by RBMX, which occurs via recognition of m6A modified RNA targets via the C-terminal disordered domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, global studies have shown that m6A residues are enriched within some long internal exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dominissini et al., 2012</xref>), where they might help facilitate RBMX protein-RNA interactions. The C-terminal disordered region of RBMX is also reported to mediate protein-protein interactions, therefore shorter exons that show defective splicing in RBMX-depleted cells but are not directly bound by RBMX could rely on different regulatory mechanisms. RBMY, RBMX and RBMXL2 directly interact with the SR protein Tra2β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Elliott et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Venables et al., 2000</xref>) and have opposing functions during RNA binding and splicing regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nasim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Venables et al., 2000</xref>). Hence it is still possible that RBMX family proteins counteract recognition by SR proteins of ESEs near cryptic splice sites via a protein-protein interaction mechanism.</p>

<caption><p>Model of cryptic splice site repression within ultra-long exons by RBMX family proteins. Ultra-long exons are intrinsically fragile as they may contain cryptic splice sites within an environment rich in Exonic Splicing Enhancers (ESEs). RBMX protein binding within ultra-long exons may directly block access of spliceosome components to cryptic splice sites, and depletion of RBMX from somatic cells activates selection of cryptic splice sites. This means a shorter version of the originally ultra-long exon is included, that fits more easily with exon definition rules normally followed for median size exons. During meiosis, lack of RBMX caused by X chromosome inactivation is compensated by expression of RBMXL2 protein.</p></caption>

<p>Extensive literature shows that RBMX is important for genome stability, including being involved in replication fork activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Munschauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>), sensitivity to genotoxic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adamson et al., 2012</xref>) and cell proliferation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://orcs.thebiogrid.org/Gene/27316">https://orcs.thebiogrid.org/Gene/27316</ext-link>). Interestingly, many of the ultra-long exons controlled by RBMX are within genes important for genome stability, including <italic>REV3L</italic>, <italic>ATRX</italic> and <italic>ETAA1</italic>. This makes it likely that RBMX contributes to maintaining genome stability through ensuring full-length protein expression of genes important in this process. As an example, we show here that depletion of RBMX protein causes aberrant selection of a high amplitude cryptic splice site within <italic>ETAA1</italic> exon 5 which prevents detectable expression of ETAA1 protein, and contributes to genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bass et al., 2016</xref>). Cancer and neurological disorders are amongst the most common human diseases associated with defective DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jackson and Bartek, 2009</xref>). The double role of RBMX in genome maintenance via both direct participation in the DNA damage response and splicing regulation of genome stability genes could explain why mutations of <italic>RBMX</italic> are associated with an intellectual disability syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shashi et al., 2015</xref>), and why RBMX has been identified as a potential tumour suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adamson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Elliott et al., 2019</xref>). The data reported in this paper thus have implications for understanding the links between RNA processing of unusual exons, genome stability and intellectual disability.</p>

<p>iCLIP experiments were performed on triplicate samples in RBMX-FLAG expressing Flp-In HEK293 cells using the protocol described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huppertz et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly cells were grown in 10 cm tissue culture dishes and irradiated with 400 mJ cm−2 ultraviolet-C light on ice, lysed and sonicated using Diagenode Bioruptor® Pico sonicator for 10 cycles with alternating 30 secs on/ off at low intensity and 1 mg of protein was digested with 4 U of Turbo DNase (Ambion, AM2238) and 0.28 U/ml (low) or 2.5 U/ml (high) of RNAse I (Thermo Scientific, EN0602). The digested lysates were immunoprecipitated with Protein G Dynabeads™ (Invitrogen, #10003D) and either 5 μg anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804) or 5 μg IgG (Santa Cruz biotechnology, sc-2025). Subsequently a pre-adenylated adaptor L3-IR-App (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zarnegar et al., 2016</xref>) was ligated to the 3ʹ of the RNA fragments. The captured Protein-RNA complexes were visualised using Odyssey LI-COR CLx imager scanning in both the 700nm and 800nm channels. The RNA bound to the proteins was purified, reverse transcribed with barcoded RT oligos complementary to the L3 adaptor. The cDNAs were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter™, A63880), circularised and linearised by PCR amplification. The libraries were gel purified and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500. All iCLIP sequencing read analysis was performed on the iMaps webserver (<underline>imaps.goodwright.com</underline>) using standardised icount demultiplex and analyse work flow. Briefly, reads were demultiplexed using the experimental barcodes, UMIs (unique molecular identifiers) were used to remove PCR duplicates and reads were mapped to the human genome sequence (version hg38/GRCh37) using STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). Crosslinked sites were identified on the iMAPS platform and the iCount group analysis workflow was used to merge the replicate samples. For enrichment analysis of RBMX iCLIP around cassette exons we compared the number of exons that contained iCLIP binding events that were regulated by RBMX (either repressed or activated) versus non-responsive RBMX cassette exons sets (defined above) in each of the following regions: the proximal intronic region within 300 nt upstream of the 3ʹ splice site, the proximal intronic region within 300 nt downstream of the 5ʹ splice site, and the splice site proximal exonic regions within 50 nt of the 3ʹ splice site or the 5ʹ splice site.</p>

All transcripts for each non-overlapping protein coding gene from the Ensembl v.105 annotation were merged into a single transcript, used for this analysis, using cgat gtf2gtf --method=merge-transcripts (Sims et al., 2014). Each crosslinked base from the merged replicate bam file was extended 15 nucleotides in each direction. For every hexamer, the number of times a crosslink site overlaps a hexamer start position was counted within the gene and then summed across all genes. This occurrence was also calculated across 100 randomizations of the crosslink positions within genes. The z-score was thus calculated for each hexamer as (occurrence – occurrence in randomized sequences) / standard deviation of occurrence in randomized sequences. For motif enrichment analysis within ultra-long internal exons we compared hexamer occurrence within the set of internal exons from Ensembl v.105 mRNA canonical transcripts of 1000 nt or more and compared those to internal exons of less than 1000 nt and calculated a z-score for each hexamer. A similar analysis was done by stratifying the set of ultra-long internal exons to those with RBMX binding or splicing regulation compared to those with no evidence of RBMX activity.</p>

All PCR products were examined using the QIAxcel<sup>®</sup> capillary electrophoresis system 100 (Qiagen). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.5.0.</p>

<p>Harvested cells treated with either control siRNA or siRNA against RBMX were resuspended in 100mM Tris-HCL, 200mM DTT, 4% SDS, 20% Glycerol, 0.2% Bromophenol blue, then sonicated (Sanyo Soniprep 150) and heated to 95°C for 5 minutes. Protein separation was performed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, incubated in blocking buffer (5% Milk in 2.5% TBS-T) and stained with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer to the concentrations indicated below, at 4°C over-night. After incubation the membranes were washed three times with TBS-T and incubated with the secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. Detection was carried out using the Clarity™ Western ECL Substrate (Cytiva, RPN2232) and developed using medical X-ray film blue film in an X-ray film processor developer. The following primary antibodies were used at the concentrations indicated: anti-RBMX (Cell Signalling, D7C2V) diluted 1:1000, anti-ETAA1 (Sigma, HPA035048) diluted 1:1000, anti-Tubulin (Abcam, ab18251) diluted 1:2000, anti-GAPDH (Abcepta, P04406) diluted 1:2000 and anti-FLAG (Sigma, F1804) diluted 1:2000.</p>

<p>A genomic region containing <italic>ETAA1</italic> exon 5 and flanking intronic sequences were PCR amplified from human genomic DNA using the primers 5ʹ<italic>-AAAAAAAAACAATTGAGTTAAGACTTTTCAGCTTTTCTGA</italic>-3ʹ and 5ʹ-AAAAAAAAACAATTGAGTGCTGGGAAAGAATTCAATGT-3ʹ and cloned into pXJ41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bourgeois et al., 1999</xref>). Splicing patterns were monitored after transfection into HEK293 cells. RNA was extracted with TRIzol™ (Invitrogen, #15596026) and analysed using a One Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, #210210) following manufacturer’s instructions. RT–PCR experiments used 100 ng of RNA in a 5-μl reaction using a multiplex RT-PCR using primers: 5ʹ-GCTGGACATGTGGATTGGTG-3ʹ, 5ʹ-GTGGGAGCTGCATTTACAGATG-3ʹ and 5ʹ-GTGCTCCAAAAAGCCTCTGG-3ʹ.

<p>Using the RNA from the long minigene transfections with RBMX and RBMXΔRRM, total RNA was extraction using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies) following the standard manufacturer’s instructions, RNA concentration was quantified by NanoDrop UV-Vis spectrophotometer and treated with DNase I (Invitrogen, Am1906). 1μg of purified RNA was reverse transcribed with a SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, #18080093) using ETAA1 DBR R1 RT-PCR primer 5′-AAGTTCTTCTTCTTGACTTTGTGTT-3′ and treated with RNaseH (New England Biolabs, M0297S). 1μl of the cDNA was used for PCR amplification reactions using using GoTaq® G2 DNA Polymerase (Promega, #M7845) in the standard 25µl reaction following the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR amplification was carried out using 2 different primer sets ETAA1 DBR R2 5′-GCTCTTGAATCACATCTAGCTCT-3′ and ETAA1 DBR F1 5′-AGCCAAACTAACTCAGCAACA-3′, ETAA1 DBR R2 5′-GCTCTTGAATCACATCTAGCTCT-3′ and ETAA1 DBR F2 5′-AGCATTTGAATCCAGGCAGC-3′ with 18 cycles of amplification at an annealing temperature of 56°C. PCR products were sub cloned into the pGEM-T-Easy vector (Promega, A1360) using manufactures instructions. Plasmids were subjected to Sanger sequencing (Source BioScience) and the sequences were checked with BioEdit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hall, 1999</xref>) and aligned to the genome with UCSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Karolchik et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The article by Siachisumo, Luzzi and Aldalaquan et al. describes studies of RBMX and its role in maintaining proper splicing of ultra-long exons. They combine CLIP, RNA-seq, and individual example validations with manipulation of RBMX and its family members RBMY and RBMXL2 to show that the RBMX family plays a key role in maintaining proper splicing of these exons.</p>
<p>I think one of the main strengths of the manuscript is its ability to explore a unique but interesting question (splicing of ultra-long exons), and derive a relatively simple model from the resulting genomics data. The results shown are quite clean, suggesting that RBMX plays an important role in proper regulation of these exons. The ability of family members to rescue this phenotype (as well as only particular domains) is also quite intriguing and suggests that the mechanisms for keeping these exons properly spliced may be a quite important and highly conserved mechanism.</p>
<p>The revised manuscript addresses many of my earlier critiques and does an effective job of arguing that RBMX plays a large-scale role in regulating splicing of long exons. I think there are obvious open questions for future work (the mechanism of how RBMX/RBMXL2 achieve this splicing control is perhaps hinted at but not fully explored here), but I think the article provides an intriguing analysis of the role of RBMX that will activate interesting future studies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>One of the greatest challenges for the spliceosome is to be able to repress the many cryptic splice sites that can occur in both the intronic and exotic sequences of genes. Although many studies have focused on cryptic signals in introns (because of their common involvement in disease) the question still remained open as to the factors that repress cryptic exons in exons. Because exons are normally much shorter than introns, in many cases the problem does not exist. However, in human genes a significant proportion of exons can be considerably longer than the average 150 nt length and this raises the question of how cryptic splicing can be prevented in long exons. To address this question, the authors have focused on the possible role played by an ancient mammalian RBD protein called RBMX. Using a combination of high-throughput and classic splicing methodologies, they have shown that there is a class of RBMX-dependent ultra-long exons connected where the RBMX, RBMXL2 and RBMY paralogs have closely related functional activity in repressing cryptic splice site selection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In general, the present work sheds light on what has been a rather understudied process in splicing research. The use of iCLIP and RNA-seq data has not only allowed to identify the long exons where cryptic splicing is prevented by the RBMX proteins but has also allowed to identify a network of genes mostly involved in genome stability and transcriptional control where these proteins seem to play a prominent role. This can therefore also shed additional information on the way splicing has shaped evolutionary processes in the mammalian lineage and will therefore be of interest to many researchers in this field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are no major weaknesses, although some specific aspects of the findings could be addressed more in-depth in the recommendations to authors.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Siachisumo et al builds upon a previous publication from the same group of collaborators that showed that depletion of mouse RBMXL2 leads to a block in spermatogenesis associated with mis-splicing, particularly of large exons in genes associated with genome stability (Ehrmann et al Elife 2019). RBMXL2 is an RNA-binding protein and an autosomal retrotransposed paralog of the X-chromosomally encoded RBMX. RBMXL2 is expressed during meiosis when RBMX and the more distantly related RBMY (on the Y chromosome) are silenced. It is therefore an appealing hypothesis that RBMXL2 might provide cover for RBMX function during meiosis. To address this hypothesis the authors analysed the transcriptomic consequences of RBMX depletion by RNA-Seq in human cells (MDA-MB-231 and existing RNA-Seq data from HEK293 cells), complemented by iCLIP to analyze the binding targets of FLAG-tagged RBMX in HEK293 cells. The findings convincingly demonstrate that - like RBMXL2 - RBMX mainly acts as a splicing repressor and that it particularly acts to protect the integrity of very long (&quot;ultra-long&quot;) exons, defined as those over 1000 nt. Upon RBMX depletion, many of these exons are shortened due to the use of cryptic 5' and/or 3' splice sites. Moreover, affected genes are particularly enriched for functions associated with genome integrity - indeed &quot;comet assays&quot; show that RBMX depletion leads to DNA damage defects. Strikingly, RNA-Seq analysis showed that overexpression of RBMXL2 is able to complement the majority of splicing changes caused by RBMX depletion, particularly those involving ultra-long exons. In a smaller scale experiment RBMY was also able to complement effects of RBMX knockdown upon three target events in the ETAA1, REV3L and ATRX genes.</p>
<p>In addition to these core findings the manuscript also includes some experiments that begin to address more mechanistic questions, such as the potential for RBMX to sterically block access of spliceosome components to splice site elements, and preliminary structure-function analyses of RBMX showing that its RRM domain is not necessary for splicing regulatory activity on the ETAA1, REV3L and ATRX target events.</p>
<p>In summary, this manuscript provides clear and convincing evidence to support the role of RBMX in somatic cells as a repressor of cryptic splice sites in ultra-long exons, mirroring the function of RBMXL2 in meiotic cells. It therefore demonstrates how the RBMX/RBMXL2/RBMY family perform a key role in protecting the transcriptomic integrity of ultra-long exons.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) The conclusions in the text are very broad and general but often based on a limited number of examples. It would be important that the authors hit the appropriate tone when most of the analysis (in Figure 5) is derived from n=3 events.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have tried to hit the correct tone here by modifying our manuscript text. In particular we have we have added a pie chart to Figure 4 (Figure 4C, that summarises data from all RBMX targets, not just the original n=3, and shows that most RBMX targets are rescued by RBMXL2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The fractions of long/ultra-long exons actually bound by/regulated by RBMX are not clearly stated - which is in contrast to the general statement of the title (implying a global role for RBMX in proper splicing of ultra-long exons).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(i) We have changed our title (now “An anciently diverged family of RNA binding proteins maintain correct splicing of a class of ultra-long exons through cryptic splice site repression”).</p>
<p>(ii) We also include much more clear text about the fractions of long/ultralong exons bound by RBMX with the following text:</p>
<p>“…..This led us to test whether RBMX protein is preferentially associated with long exons. For this we plotted the distribution of internal exons bound and regulated by RBMX together with all internal exons expressed from HEK293 mRNA genes (Liu et al., 2017) (Figure 2 – Source Data 1). We found that RBMX controls and binds two different classes of exons: the first have comparable length to the average HEK293 exon, while the second were extremely long, exceeding 1000 bp in length (Figure 2F). We defined this second class as ‘ultra-long exons’, which represented the 18.9% of internal exons regulated by RBMX and 17.6% of the ones that contained RBMX iCLIP tags. These proportions were significantly enriched compared to the general abundance of internal ultra-long exons expressed from HEK293 cells, which was only 0.4% (Figure 2G)……”</p>
<p>“…….We next wondered whether ultra-long exons regulated by RBMX (which represented 11.6% of all ultra-long internal exons from genes expressed in HEK293) had any particular feature compared to ultra-long exons that were RBMX-independent……..”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors should state what fraction of ultra-long exons show cryptic splicing in the RBMX siRNA that are corrected by RBMXL2 overexpression (rather than just showing the 3 events). There's some confusion about the global nature of the conclusions relative to the data displayed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a good point. We have used the RNAseq information as suggested, and included a pie chart (Figure 4C) that includes this information.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It would be helpful if the authors could identify if there are some motifs more present in ultra-long exons than others.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Good point, we have included k-mer analysis of the ultra-long exons bound by RBMX, and also more generally ultra-long exons in the human genome, in Figure 2H and 2I. We also add the following text:</p>
<p>K-mer analyses also showed that while ultra-long exons within mRNAs are rich in AT-rich sequences compared to shorter exons (Figure 2H), the ultra-long exons that are either regulated or bound by RBMX displayed enrichment of AG-rich sequences (Figure 2I), consistent with our identified RBMX-recognised sequences (Figure 2C).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors should evaluate if RBMX-repressed 3' splice sites have similar or low splice site scores/strengths than natural 3' splice sites.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added splice site score analyses in Figure 1F and Figure 1 Supplement 1B. These show that the cryptic splice sites repressed by RBMX are not significantly different from those that are normally used. We add the following text to accompany these figure panels:</p>
<p>“Furthermore, analysis of splice site strength revealed that, unlike splice sites activated by RBMX (Figure 1 – Figure supplement 1B), alternative splice sites repressed by RBMX have comparable strength to more commonly used splice sites (Figure 1F). This means that RBMX operates as a splicing repressor in human somatic cells to prevent use of ‘decoy’ splice sites that could disrupt normal patterns of gene expression.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The section &quot;RBMX protein-RNA interactions may insulate important splicing signals from the spliceosome.&quot; is a very preliminary look at possible mechanisms. Can you integrate the RNA Seq and CLIP datasets to generate &quot;splicing maps&quot; that would provide more generalized insights? In fact, where possible, it would be great to integrate the iCLIP data from the same cell types to generate RNA splicing maps (with the KD RNA-seq data)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added “RNA map-type” plots to integrate iCLIP data with splicing patterns (Figure 2 Figure supplement 1D and 1E), and made corresponding changes to the text.</p>
<p>Additional changes</p>
<p>We also made some extra changes to respond to the further points raised by reviewers.</p>
<p>(1) We have carried out gene ontology analysis of those genes that contain RBMX-regulated ultra-long exons versus all ultra-long exons (now Figure 3A, and also Figure 3- Figure supplement 1A and 1B).</p>
<p>(2) We have corrected the cartoon summarising the branch point analysis (now Figure 3 – Figure Supplement 2F).</p>
