<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Phage satellites commonly remodel capsids they hijack from the phages they parasitize, but only a few mechanisms regulating the change in capsid size have been reported. Here, we investigated how a satellite from <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, PLE, remodels the capsid it has been predicted to steal from the phage ICP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). We identified that a PLE-encoded protein, TcaP, is both necessary and sufficient to form small capsids during ICP1 infection. Interestingly, we found that PLE is dependent on small capsids for efficient transduction of its genome, making it the first satellite to have this requirement. ICP1 isolates that escaped TcaP-mediated remodeling acquired substitutions in the coat protein, suggesting an interaction between these two proteins. With a procapsid-like-particle (PLP) assembly platform in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, we demonstrated that TcaP is a <italic>bona fide</italic> scaffold that regulates the assembly of small capsids. Further, we studied the structure of PLE PLPs using cryogenic electron microscopy and found that TcaP is an external scaffold, that is functionally and largely structurally similar to the external scaffold, Sid, encoded by the divergent satellite P4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Finally, we showed that TcaP is largely conserved across PLEs. Together, these data support a model in which TcaP directs the assembly of small capsids comprised of ICP1 coat proteins, which inhibits the complete packaging of the ICP1 genome and permits more efficient packaging of replicated PLE genomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Like the parasitism of bacteria by the phages that infect them, phages are parasitized by mobile genetic elements termed phage satellites. Satellites continue to be discovered across bacterial species and, despite the independent evolution of these elements, common themes have emerged (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Universally, satellites are integrated genetic elements that are dependent on infection by a helper phage for their lifecycle. Helper phage infection triggers satellites’ genome excision and replication. Following genome replication, satellites parasitize the helper phages’ structural components and selectively package satellite genomes into proteinaceous shells comprised of coat proteins, called capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The piracy of essential phage structural proteins affords the phage satellites the luxury of reducing their coding capacity and, therefore, their genome size. As such, satellites’ genomes can be packaged into smaller capsids compared to their helper phages. In all documented cases, the satellite encodes a strategy to direct the assembly of small capsids, a mechanism that excludes the complete packaging of the larger helper phage genome but permits the complete packaging of the smaller phage satellite genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). After the attachment of tails, also pirated from the helper phage, the mature virions harboring the satellite genome are released from the cell. Here, they transduce and integrate the satellite genome into neighboring susceptible bacteria.</p>
<p>PLEs (Phage inducible chromosomal island-Like Elements) are satellites of the lytic <italic>V. cholerae</italic> phage ICP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). PLEs are one of four families of phage satellites that have been identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). In addition to their specificity to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and unique complete inhibition of their helper phage, PLEs stand apart from other satellites in their genetic composition. They encode genes with similar functions, but without sequence identity, to those in other satellites. To date, 10 genetically distinct but related PLEs have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), with PLE1 being the most well-studied. PLEs, like other satellites, have a smaller genome (∼18 kb) than the phage they parasitize ICP1 (∼125 kb), and are dependent on their helper for excision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), and virion production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). PLE1 has been shown to produce virions with small ∼50 nm wide capsids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), while ICP1 produces virions with large ∼80 nm wide capsids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Based on similarities to other capsid-remodeling satellites and the evidence that depletion of ICP1’s coat protein by CRISPRi during infection results in reduced PLE transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), it is hypothesized that PLE capsids are comprised of ICP1 coat proteins. However, the mechanism that PLE1 uses to achieve this capsid remodeling has yet to be explored.</p>

<p>As capsids for large double-stranded DNA viruses assemble through a stepwise pathway, remodeling must occur at the first stage, nucleation of the procapsid. Procapsids are the empty shell capsid precursors into which DNA is packaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Procapsid size, referred to by a T number (which is the number of coat subunits divided by 60), and assembly are regulated by scaffolding proteins that guide coat proteins into their correct orientation around the pre-formed portal complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). These capsid scaffolds can either be separately encoded proteins or contained within a domain of the coat protein, as is seen in the phage HK97 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). So, to alter the size of the capsids, satellites must regulate the size of the procapsid.</p>
<p>Highlighting the convergent evolution across unique satellite families, four distinct strategies to produce small capsids have been characterized. Two representatives from different families of satellites exploit the role of scaffolds in the capsid assembly process to promote the formation of smaller capsids. First, some of the <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> Pathogenicity Islands (SaPIs) encode an alternative internal scaffold, CpmB, that binds to the helper phage’s coat proteins inside of the assembling procapsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). CpmB increases procapsid curvature, resulting in the smaller procapsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). The second example of capsid remodeling was described in the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> phage satellite, P4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Analogous to the satellite-encoded scaffold from SaPIs, P4 encodes an alternative scaffold, Sid, that functions to regulate assembly of the smaller procapsid, however, Sid binds to the outside of the procapsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Sid proteins form an external cage around the helper phage’s coat proteins which promotes the assembly of the small procapsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). An alternative strategy to redirect capsid size is found in a subfamily of SaPIs, including SaPIbov5, which encodes a homolog of their helper phage’s coat protein that exclusively forms the pentamers while the helper phage’s coat proteins form the hexamers of the small capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). These coat proteins encode their scaffolds within a domain of the coat, like HK97 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Exactly how the satellite-derived coat pentamers promote the assembly of small icosahedral capsids instead of the larger prolate capsid of the helper is not fully understood. The last characterized strategy used by satellites to make small capsids was recently discovered in the aptly named cfPICIs (capsid forming phage inducible chromosomal islands), which avoid altering the assembly of their helper phage capsids by instead encoding their own structural components of the capsid and stealing only the phage tails to construct satellite virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Interestingly, despite the divergence in capsid remodeling strategies, there is convergence on capsid size where each satellite assembles icosahedral capsids with 240 subunits, or T=4 capsids. PLE’s small capsids are similar in size to these T=4 capsids but PLE does not encode obvious homologs of CpmB or Sid nor capsid homologs, making it unclear how capsid remodeling is achieved in this divergent satellite. Notably, other helper phages have similar genome sizes, ∼30-45 kb, while ICP1 has a significantly larger genome, ∼125 kb and is the only known helper packaged into T=13 capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). This may suggest that PLE uses a unique mechanism to remodel the ICP1 coat proteins into the smaller ∼50 nm wide PLE-sized capsids made from a considerably smaller number of subunits.</p>
<p>Here, we studied how PLE remodels the ICP1 capsid. We found a PLE-encoded protein that has an essential role in making small capsids, named TcaP for its <underline>t</underline>iny <underline>cap</underline>sid phenotype. TcaP’s activity was necessary and sufficient to make small capsids, which inhibited the production of infectious ICP1 virions and increased the efficiency of PLE transduction. We studied TcaP’s mechanism of capsid remodeling using a heterologous procapsid-like-particle (PLP) assembly platform in <italic>E. coli</italic> and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These data revealed TcaP as an external scaffolding protein that directs the assembly of ICP1 coat proteins into small, PLE-sized capsids. Finally, we analyzed the known PLE variants and found TcaP is largely conserved in PLEs. Our work uncovered the mechanism of capsid remodeling in the phage satellite PLE and provides the first example of small capsid production benefitting satellite transduction.</p>

<title>PLE encodes a single gene product, TcaP, that is necessary and sufficient to direct the assembly of small capsids</title>
<p>Given the observation that PLE virions have smaller capsids than ICP1 virions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A&amp;B</xref>), we hypothesized that PLE encodes a single protein responsible for assembling these smaller capsids. We reasoned that the generation of small capsids would limit the amount of DNA that could be accommodated within the capsids and block the complete packaging of the larger ICP1 genome, reducing ICP1 plaquing. In line with this prediction, other satellites’ proteins that redirect capsid assembly are inhibitory to their helper phages for this reason (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Using this logic and PLE1 as the representative PLE, we identified one candidate PLE protein, TcaP (previously Orf17 (AGG09411.1)), as a putative capsid remodeling protein.</p>
<p>First, to assess the capsid remodeling capacity of TcaP, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to evaluate the morphology of virions produced after a single round of ICP1 infection in a PLE(-) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strain expressing <italic>tcaP</italic> from a plasmid (p<italic>tcaP</italic>). Lysates collected from the p<italic>tcaP</italic> host showed an abundance of small, ∼50 nm round particles reminiscent of PLE-sized procapsids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Rarer particles in these samples resembled virions produced from a PLE(+) infection with small capsids and attached tails, though apparently lacking DNA (Figure S1A). In comparison, many virions produced from the empty vector control were ICP1-sized virions with large capsids, as expected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Other particles observed in the control samples were full ICP1 capsids without tails, empty ICP1 procapsids or empty expanded capsids (Figure S1B). Importantly, these data demonstrate that <italic>tcaP</italic> expression during ICP1 infection, in the absence of other PLE-encoded products, results in the production of small capsids.</p>
<p>In agreement with the expectation that small capsid formation would be inhibitory to ICP1, p<italic>tcaP</italic> inhibited ICP1 plaque formation by 100-fold (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). We then asked if ICP1 could escape TcaP-mediated inhibition through genetic mutation. Rare plaques isolated on the p<italic>tcaP</italic> strain were picked and serially propagated on the restrictive strain. Two escape phages were whole genome sequenced, and each harbored a single nonsynonymous mutation in the gene encoding the coat protein, resulting in substitutions R223H or E234K (Table S1). Substitutions at unique but proximal positions in coat protein from independent escape phages suggest that TcaP interacts with the coat protein, an expected feature of TcaP’s predicted role as a capsid remodeling protein. Collectively, these genetic escapes coupled with TcaP’s inhibition of ICP1 plaquing, which is accompanied by the production of small capsids, strongly support that TcaP is a capsid remodeling protein.</p>
<p>While expression of TcaP during ICP1 infection was sufficient to redirect capsid size, we wanted to address if TcaP was necessary for PLE to generate particles with small capsids. Other capsid remodeling satellites have been shown to use either a single protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) or two proteins that act in concert to direct small capsid assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). To assess if TcaP is required to assemble ICP1’s coat protein into small capsids, virions resulting from ICP1 infection of wild type PLE and PLE∆<italic>tcaP</italic> were concentrated by centrifugation and their morphology was assessed by TEM. The wild type PLE control produced PLE-sized virions with small capsids as expected and no ICP1-sized virions were observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The PLE∆<italic>tcaP</italic> strain produced only virions with large, ICP1-sized capsids and no PLE-sized particles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), a phenotype that was rescued following the expression of <italic>tcaP in trans</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly, <italic>tcaP</italic> is dispensable for PLE-mediated inhibition of ICP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), indicating that the increase in capsid size in the absence of TcaP is specific to its role in capsid-size redirection and not a result of ICP1 escaping PLE. These data demonstrate that TcaP is necessary for PLE’s redirection of ICP1 coat protein into small capsids and that PLE does not encode a redundant mechanism for capsid remodeling.</p>

<p>To further address the effect of deleting <italic>tcaP</italic> from PLE, we measured the transduction of PLE’s genome following ICP1 infection in PLE<italic>∆tcaP</italic> hosts using a previously described assay using an antibiotic resistance marker in PLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Interestingly, in the absence of <italic>tcaP</italic>, PLE transduction was 10-fold less efficient than wild type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The defect in the transduction of the PLE∆<italic>tcaP</italic> strain was largely restored with p<italic>tcaP</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Together with the morphological data of transducing particles, these data suggest that TcaP-mediated capsid remodeling facilitates more efficient horizontal spread of the PLE genome to recipient <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. PLE is the first satellite to show dependency on small capsids for efficient transduction.</p>

<title>PLE-encoded TcaP is a <italic>bona fide</italic> capsid scaffold</title>
<p>Capsid scaffolding proteins are characteristically responsible for directly promoting the assembly of coat proteins and controlling capsid size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). TcaP expression results in the formation of small capsids during ICP1 infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), which suggests that it has scaffolding activity. However, it is possible that TcaP does not act directly on the coat proteins as a scaffold, but rather interferes with ICP1’s capsid morphogenesis pathway in some way that decreases capsid size. To directly address if TcaP is a scaffold, we set up a heterologous procapsid-like-particle (PLP) assembly platform in <italic>E. coli</italic> similar to those previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Briefly, we co-expressed ICP1’s coat and putative scaffolds from either ICP1 or PLE and monitored the production of PLPs. By adding a C-terminal six-histidine (6xHis) tag to the coat protein, we were able to purify coat-containing complexes by affinity chromatography, examine their protein content by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie staining, and their morphology by TEM. First, as a control, coat::6xHis (referred to as “coat” for simplicity) was expressed and purified. The coat proteins eluted as complexes, but they were irregular in size and shape, often forming spirals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A.1</xref>), as is expected for coat proteins in the absence of scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). As a second control, we confirmed that ICP1’s putative scaffold could assemble coat proteins into uniform, ICP1-sized PLPs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A.2</xref>). The presence of scaffold in these PLPs was supported by SDS-PAGE analysis in which we observed a band corresponding to the predicted size of the scaffold (39.3 kDa), indicating, as expected, that the scaffold co-eluted with coat-containing complexes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A.2</xref>). Interestingly, two smaller bands of approximately 23 and 17 kDa also appeared in these samples. The size of these bands is consistent with the cleavage of the scaffold resulting in two fragments. As scaffolds are generally not a part of the mature capsid, they are removed from the procapsid by self-cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) or cleavage by a protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Indeed, in the presence of protease inhibitors during purification, these bands were not observed, but the same-sized particles were produced, suggesting scaffold cleavage is not a prerequisite for assembly (Figure S2A). Analysis of ICP1 PLPs by mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) further supported the presence of ICP1’s putative scaffold (Table S2). Together, these data confirm the predicted role of ICP1’s scaffold and demonstrate that PLPs can be assembled and purified using this platform.</p>

<p>As other known satellite systems have varying dependencies on the phage-encoded scaffold and/or additional satellite-encoded factors for the assembly of small procapsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), we wanted to address what proteins were required to make small capsids in the ICP1-PLE system. To test whether TcaP requires ICP1’s scaffold to produce small PLPs, we co-expressed coat with either just TcaP, or with both TcaP and ICP1’s scaffold simultaneously. First, analysis of the stained SDS-PAGE gel following co-expression of coat and TcaP showed that TcaP bound to coat and was co-eluted (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A.3</xref>). TEMs showed that TcaP was sufficient to assemble ICP1’s coat into PLPs that were homogenously PLE-sized. These data demonstrate that TcaP has scaffolding activity for ICP1’s coat protein and that it does not require additional factors to assemble small PLPs. Next, we tested if the scaffolding activity of TcaP could compete with the activity of ICP1’s scaffold. To achieve the triple protein expression construct, the scaffold through coat was cloned downstream of one of the promoters in the plasmid as it occurs natively in ICP1’s genome. Here, the putative decoration protein, Gp123, is encoded by the gene between the scaffold and coat. The decoration protein was not expected to incorporate into the PLPs as decoration proteins are typically added after genome packaging and capsid expansion exposes their binding site, as has been shown for phage Lambda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). In line with this, the stained gel of the resulting purified ICP1-sized PLPs indicated that while the ICP1 scaffold co-eluted with coat-containing complexes as expected, the decoration protein was produced but not incorporated into the assembled particles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A.4</xref> and Figure S3). Interestingly, when we co-expressed ICP1 coat, decoration, and scaffold along with TcaP, we did not observe any large particles, suggesting TcaP is dominant over ICP1’s scaffold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A.5</xref>).</p>
<p>SDS-PAGE analyses of particles produced in the presence of ICP1’s scaffold and TcaP confirmed the presence of TcaP as well as the phage-encoded scaffold and its cleavage products, suggesting TcaP does not block the incorporation of ICP1’s scaffold into procapsids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A.5</xref>). This experiment was repeated in the presence of protease inhibitors which eliminated the ICP1 scaffold cleavage products but reproduced the small particle morphology (Figure S2B). Collectively, these data demonstrate scaffolding activity for both ICP1’s scaffold and PLE’s TcaP and show that TcaP can assemble small PLPs in the absence or presence of ICP1’s scaffold.</p>
<p>Having observed that TcaP is sufficient to make small PLPs in the heterologous assembly platform as well as when expressed from a plasmid during ICP1 infection, we next sought to determine if coat<sup>R223H</sup> and coat<sup>E234K</sup>, the previously identified <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic escapes of TcaP activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), demonstrate escape from TcaP-mediated remodeling in the assembly platform. The coat<sup>E234K</sup> variant was not assembly competent in our heterologous assembly platform (Figure S4), so we only continued with the coat<sup>R223H</sup> variant. As expected, in the absence of any scaffolding proteins, coat<sup>R223H</sup> formed similar spiral complexes as those observed with the wild type coat (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B.1</xref>). These data demonstrate that the R223H substitution does not compromise the protein’s ability to bind to itself, nor does the substitution provide a means for the coat to form PLPs independent of a scaffold. Next, we expressed coat<sup>R223H</sup> with TcaP, anticipating we would observe the formation of large ICP1-sized PLPs because this substitution was sufficient for ICP1 to avoid TcaP’s inhibitory activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Unexpectedly, TcaP still directed the assembly of small PLPs comprised of coat<sup>R223H</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B.3</xref>). However, TcaP was not robustly evident in the purified complexes as assessed by SDS-PAGE, and some particles were spirals, similar to those seen when the coat is expressed without a scaffold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B.3</xref>). These data suggest that TcaP’s scaffolding activity was partially compromised when the coat protein carried the R223H substitution. We hypothesized that with ICP1’s scaffold, the coat<sup>R223H</sup> proteins could be assembled into ICP1-sized PLPs. Leveraging the dual expression from a single promoter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A.4</xref>), we confirmed that the ICP1 scaffold alone directed the assembly of ICP1-sized PLPs with coat<sup>R223H</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B.4</xref>) but, we observed a mix of PLE and ICP1-sized PLPs following addition of TcaP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B.5</xref>). We can attribute this phenotype to the substitution in the coat and not to the presence of protease inhibitors used during the purification as the addition of protease inhibitors during purification of the coat<sup>wild type</sup> co-expressed with the ICP1 scaffold and TcaP resulted in only small PLPs (Figure S2B). These data suggest that the R223H substitution in ICP1’s coat can only partially escape TcaP-mediated small capsid formation, but <italic>in vivo</italic> this level of escape is sufficient to allow for approximately equal levels of viable progeny production as is seen in the absence of TcaP.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM reveals TcaP is an external scaffold</title>
<p>The data obtained from the assembly of PLPs in <italic>E. coli</italic> demonstrate that TcaP has scaffolding activity; however, these data do not distinguish between TcaP acting as an internal or an external scaffold. To identify the localization of TcaP in PLE PLPs and address how TcaP interacts with the coat protein to assemble small capsids, we validated the protein content of PLE PLPs produced from co-expression of TcaP and coat by LC-MS/MS and subjected them to cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). As anticipated, LC-MS/MS confirmed PLE PLPs were comprised of coat and TcaP (Table S3).</p>
<p>Representative micrographs from negatively stained samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) and vitrified particles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) show a distinctly bumpy surface on the PLE PLPs, suggestive of external proteins. 379,643 particles were used for icosahedral reconstruction of the PLE PLP particle, with a final resolution of 3.4 Å (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The external density of the PLPs corresponded to TcaP, demonstrating that it functions as an external scaffold. Internal density was assigned to coat proteins with a canonical HK97-like fold, which exist as pentamers and hexamers within the 48 nm, T=4 icosahedral PLP. We used AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) to predict the structures of the coat protein and TcaP, which were fitted into density from the Cryo-EM and aided in modeling nearly all of the coat protein and approximately half of TcaP (residues 34–172) for which only a few side chains could be modeled. As expected, the A-domains of the coat proteins were centered in both pentamers and hexamers. TcaP dimers meet and form trimeric interactions at the three-fold axes between hexamers. Broadly, the reconstruction of PLE PLPs shows TcaP functions as an external scaffold and provides context for how TcaP’s higher order structure regulates the number of coat proteins that can be accommodated within the assembling PLP.</p>

<p>Further, the reconstruction reveals details of the residues that were substituted in phages that escape TcaP-mediated capsid remodeling (R223H and E234K). Both residues are found in the A-domain which is oriented near the center of the hexamer where TcaP binds (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). The arginines at position 223 were clearly visible in the map. Due to the two-fold symmetry in the hexamer, there are identical interactions between each half of the hexamer and the TcaP dimer. Importantly, there are three distinct interactions between TcaP and R223 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). First, R223 from coatD is in proximity to TcaP’s residues 87-93, while coatB has R223 positioned near TcaP’s residues 63-70, and R223 from coat<sub>B</sub> lies close to the second TcaP subunit. In this third interaction, the negatively charged aspartic acid at position 218 from the coat coordinates with the positive charges from the arginine residues from coat (R223) and TcaP (R133) and creates a salt bridge with residues measuring less than 4 Å apart. The electrostatics of the complex show TcaP’s R133 fitting into a negatively charged pocket on the coat (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). The side chain for the other residue substituted in the escape phage, E234, could not be confidently modeled, but its localization within the capsid is outside of the TcaP binding region. The exact nature of E234 is not yet clear, but perhaps it has a role in stabilizing the A-domain. Together, these data support the conclusion that ICP1 escapes TcaP’s scaffolding activity by altering the coat to affect TcaP’s binding site.</p>
<p>We next asked if these coat substitutions were observed in natural isolates of ICP1, as may be expected if ICP1 is under selective pressure to escape PLE-mediated capsid remodeling in nature. When we compared the coat alleles from 67 genetically distinct ICP1 isolates we found no differences within the A-domain of the alleles. These data show that ICP1 does not naturally encode mutations in the A-domain that would escape TcaP-mediated capsid remodeling.</p>

<title>TcaP is conserved in PLEs</title>
<p>Having established that PLE1’s TcaP acts as an alternative external scaffold that directs the assembly of ICP1’s coat protein into small capsids, we wanted to assess the conservation of <italic>tcaP</italic> across genetically distinct PLEs. While PLE1 is the most well-studied PLE, there are nine additional PLEs that have been discovered to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Therefore, we sought to evaluate if TcaP was conserved in all PLEs or if alternative strategies of capsid modification may exist amongst this family of satellites.

<p>Curiously, the most divergent <italic>tcaP</italic> allele, <italic>tcaP</italic><sup>PLE5</sup>, is 237 nucleotides (∼26%) shorter than <italic>tcaP</italic><sup>PLE1</sup> due to an apparent truncation of the N-terminal coding region. However, a nucleotide alignment of the <italic>tcaP</italic><sup>PLE1</sup> sequence with the <italic>tcaP</italic><sup>PLE5</sup> 5’-UTR through the end of the coding sequence revealed two small deletions, one of which results in a frameshift and premature stop codon in the <italic>tcaP</italic><sup>PLE5</sup> allele (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). The alternative start site downstream of the deletions would restore the original reading frame for <italic>tcaP</italic><sup>PLE5</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Given the conservation of full-length <italic>tcaP</italic> alleles in other PLEs, and the structural data highlighting interactions between the TcaP<sup>PLE1</sup> with ICP1’s coat proteins, we wanted to assess if the truncated TcaP<sup>PLE5</sup> was functional to redirect ICP1 virion assembly.</p>
<p>To start, we generated PLE particles from the wild type PLE5 strain carrying an empty vector and assessed their morphology by TEM. We found the PLE5 virions did not have small capsids, but rather they had large, ICP1-size capsids (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), similar to virions from the PLE1∆<italic>tcaP</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistent with this, when we directly addressed the scaffolding activity of the truncated allele by expressing it <italic>in trans</italic> during ICP1 infection and assessing plaque formation, we found that unlike p<italic>tcaP</italic><sup>PLE1</sup>, which inhibited ICP1 plaquing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), p<italic>tcaP</italic><sup>PLE5</sup> did not inhibit ICP1 plaque formation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), supporting the conclusion that TcaP<sup>PLE5</sup> is not a functional scaffold. The reconstruction of the PLE1 PLPs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) revealed residues 63-70 in TcaP<sup>PLE1</sup> that specifically contact coat<sub>B</sub>. That region is notably lacking from the truncated TcaP (Figure S5C). Further, we predict that a TcaP protein missing 79 amino acids would not be long enough to form the scaffolding cage around an assembling T=4 procapsid explaining the lack of scaffolding activity for this TcaP variant.</p>
<p>Next, we wanted to address the transduction efficiency of PLE5. The efficiency of PLE1’s transduction decreased in the absence of TcaP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), demonstrating an advantage to packaging the PLE genome into smaller capsids. To test if PLE5 had a transduction defect due to its inability to assemble small capsids, we measured the transduction efficiency of PLE5 in the presence of an empty vector or p<italic>tcaP</italic><sup>PLE1</sup>. Previous work reported similar transduction efficiency for PLEs1-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), and we recapitulated those results here, showing PLE5 has only a subtle, ∼2-fold decrease in transduction efficiency relative to PLE1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). As this seemed in conflict with the PLE1∆<italic>tcaP</italic> data, where there was over a 10-fold decrease in PLE1 transduction without TcaP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), we wanted to directly examine the effect of small capsid production on PLE5 transduction. First, we confirmed that p<italic>tcaP</italic><sup>PLE1</sup> in PLE5(+) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> during ICP1 infection directed the assembly of small capsids (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), which supported our hypothesis that the unmodified capsids produced by PLE5 are the result of this PLE encoding a nonfunctional TcaP allele. Next, we found that PLE5 transduction increased with p<italic>tcaP</italic><sup>PLE1</sup>, exceeding the transduction efficiency of PLE5 and PLE1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). This result suggests that the capacity for transduction is different for PLE1 and PLE5, but still nonetheless demonstrates that small capsids promote PLE transduction.</p>
<p>Since both PLE1 and PLE5 transduction efficiency was higher when small capsids were made, this raised the question of PLE5’s maintenance in the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> population while lacking a functional scaffold. A recent analysis of sequenced <italic>V. cholerae</italic> isolates outlined a pattern where a PLE variant emerges, often rises to dominance, then is replaced by a different variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). This pattern revealed that after its dominance from before 1960 until its disappearance in 1991 (for which there are 21 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> isolates harboring identical PLE5 sequences), PLE5 re-emerged in 2016 and 2017. Genetic drift within a given PLE variant appears to be very rare: a particular PLE variant is typically 100% conserved at the nucleotide level across the entire mobile genetic element despite residing in different isolates of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). However, on rare occasions, single nucleotide polymorphisms between the same PLE variant are found in different <italic>V. cholerae</italic> isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Strikingly, the <italic>tcaP</italic><sup>PLE5</sup> sequence from 2017 showed a 14-nucleotide insertion which restored a full-length <italic>tcaP</italic> allele (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref> and Figure S5B). The reestablishment of the full length <italic>tcaP</italic> allele in the contemporary PLE5 along with the preservation of full-length alleles in other PLEs support conservation of TcaP for its role in capsid remodeling to promote PLE transduction and inhibit ICP1.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we characterized the mechanism of capsid remodeling in the phage-satellite system ICP1-PLE. We identified a PLE-encoded scaffold, TcaP, and demonstrated its necessity and sufficiency to redirect the assembly of ICP1’s coat proteins into small capsids. Using a heterologous assembly system and cryo-EM, we discovered that TcaP functions as an external scaffold that assembles into a cage-like structure around the procapsid, favoring the smaller T=4 morphology (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We found that TcaP is conserved in all PLEs. Further, TcaP-mediated small capsid assembly is advantageous to PLE as the production of small capsids leads to more efficient transduction of PLE’s genome, a unique feature not seen in other capsid-remodeling satellites. The data presented here further highlight similarities between PLE and other satellites while underscoring features that make PLE unique.</p>

<p>Initially, TcaP’s function was unknown since homology-based and structural prediction searches were of low confidence and failed to identify known domains. However, the structure of PLE PLPs showed molecular details of the TcaP-coat interactions and revealed a striking resemblance to that of PLPs formed by the <italic>E. coli</italic> phage P2 coat protein (GpN), scaffold (GpO), and satellite P4 external scaffold (Sid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Despite the low sequence conservation between the ICP1 and P2 coat proteins (20% identity), both have an HK97-like fold and are assembled into T=4 icosahedral procapsids measuring ∼45 nm in diameter in the presence of their satellite-encoded external scaffolds. TcaP and Sid also share ∼20% amino acid identity, however, TcaP is 53 amino acids longer than Sid. TcaP, like Sid, assembles into long filaments that form dimers that span the two-fold axes and trimers of dimers meeting at the three-fold axes of the procapsid. Given how TcaP and Sid interact with themselves to form dimers and trimers wherein hexamers are linked to each other by the length of TcaP or Sid dimers, it is not surprising how the resulting scaffold cage accommodates only procapsids with T=4 symmetry. Additional hexamers would not be accommodated within the cage formed by the external scaffolds, and thus the capsid is blocked from forming higher T number structures. Despite their similarities, TcaP and Sid differ in their specific interactions with the coat proteins. Unlike Sid, which only contacts two proteins in the hexamer (both GpN<sub>B</sub> subunits), both TcaP monomers form interactions with three coat subunits, thus contacting all six coat subunits. TcaP and Sid also differ in their tertiary structures, further demonstrating the convergent evolution of the external scaffold capsid-remodeling strategy in divergent satellites.</p>
<p>Few external scaffolds have been described in viruses, and thus there are open questions about their role in capsid assembly, especially in relation to internal scaffolds. Outside of P4 and PLE, the only other identified external scaffolds are those in the ssDNA phages of the Microviridae family. A representative phage, ΦX174, requires an external scaffold (protein D) to form procapsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), however, the structure of this protein is different from TcaP and Sid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Unlike the trimers formed by the satellite scaffolds, protein D seems to form tetramers in solution and directs the assembly of the coat proteins into a ∼27 nm wide procapsid, despite the lack of direct coat-scaffold interactions. Notably, the small ΦX174 capsids still require an internal scaffold for assembly. Similarly, P4 is dependent on P2’s internal scaffold (GpO) to form viable progeny virions, likely because the internal scaffold is important for the incorporation of the portal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Curiously, SaPIbov1, a satellite which uses an alternative internal scaffold to direct assembly of small capsids, also requires 80α’s internal scaffold (Gp46) for viable satellite virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), likely for a similar reason. PLEs do not appear to encode portal proteins and thus we anticipate that PLE would similarly be dependent on ICP1 portal incorporation for progeny production. In the heterologous assembly assay, we show that TcaP’s scaffolding activity is dominant over ICP1’s scaffold, such that the resulting particles are satellite-sized in the presence of both scaffolds. These data suggest that if PLE depended on ICP1’s scaffold for portal incorporation, TcaP’s scaffolding activity would still be sufficient to direct the assembly of small capsids. It will be useful for future studies to directly address this requirement and to assess the complete protein makeup of PLE procapsids produced during ICP1 infection of PLE(+) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to validate what PLE and ICP1 components comprise the procapsids.</p>
<p>Like ICP1 escaping TcaP activity, P2 can escape Sid-mediated capsid remodeling through point substitutions in the coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Both of the two escape substitutions we identified in ICP1 lies in the A-domain, in the center of the hexamer across the 2-fold axis of symmetry where TcaP binds and one residue directly contacts TcaP. The A-domain has been implicated in regulating capsid size and assembly in many viral systems (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Similarly, the five suppressor substitutions that have been identified in P2’s coat protein lie in the hexamer along Sid’s binding site, but they lie slightly outside of the A-domain and are instead at the end of the P-loop. Three substitutions are in residues that directly contact Sid, like R223 in TcaP. The other two residues in P2’s coat likely function through other means to disrupt the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), as is probably the case for the second substitution seen in ICP1, E234K. Curiously, the PLP assembly data showed that the coat<sup>R223H</sup> only partially escaped TcaP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) while this substitution was sufficient <italic>in vivo</italic> to escape TcaP’s inhibition of plaque formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). These inconsistencies can likely be explained by the lack of the additional components that comprise PLE native procapsids in our assembly platform, as well as the relative protein concentrations and dynamic regulation that occurs during infection. However, despite the selection for phages that escape TcaP-mediated remodeling in the laboratory, no mutations in the A-domain exist in the current collection of 67 sequenced isolates of ICP1. Perhaps the mutations are not selected for in nature because the biophysical properties of these coat variants are incompatible with assembly in the natural conditions of the human gut or in estuaries where <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and ICP1 reside. In line with this hypothesis, one of the coat mutants we tested, coat<sup>E234K</sup>, was not assembly competent in the heterologous assembly system (Figure S4), likely due to its predicted role in stabilizing the coat protein. Moreover, PLE is severely inhibitory to ICP1, employing several redundant strategies that independently restrict phage production, and thus <italic>tcaP</italic> is dispensable for phage inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Instead of selecting for mutations that individually escape PLE’s inhibitory proteins, ICP1 encodes broader strategies that degrade the PLE genome, such as the phage-encoded CRISPR-Cas system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), Odn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), or Adi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>The inhibitory effects on the helper phage resulting from the production of small capsids from hijacked coat proteins are comparable between PLEs and other satellites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). PLE, like other satellites, has a genome size of ∼15-20 kb, which is compatible with the satellite-modified T=4 capsid size. However, the ICP1 genome does not follow the pattern seen in other helper phages, which typically are ∼30-40 kb and packaged into similarly sized capsids (icosahedral T=7 or prolate T<sub>end</sub>=4, T<sub>mid</sub>=14). ICP1 has a large ∼125 kb genome packaged into a T=13 capsid. Therefore, PLE and ICP1 have the most dramatic size difference between satellite and helper phage. The consistent level of inhibition is likely explained by the fact that regardless of how much smaller the capsid is, packaging anything less than the full length of the genome results in non-infectious virions. However, the effect of capsid size on the satellite packaging can be different. Phages and satellites that use <italic>cos</italic> site packaging strategies specifically cleave the genome only at those sites and thus package unit lengths of their genomes into a capsid. For satellites, if their genome is proportional to two or three lengths of their helper phages, they can package their genome into helper-sized capsids with no or reportedly little reduction in efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). On the other hand, with headful packaging systems, which have been predicted for ICP1 and PLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), replicated genome concatemers will be threaded into the capsid until the capsid is full, signaling the terminase to stop packaging and cut the genome. Most phage’s capsids accommodate 103-110% of their genome length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). While the SaPIs that use headful packaging are unaffected by packaging their genomes into large capsids, PLE’s transduction is severely reduced when packaged into ICP1-size capsids. The difference in capsid size between the SaPI helper, 80α (T=7), and PLE’s helper, ICP1 (T=13), explains this result.</p>
<p>Approximately two SaPI genomes would need to be packaged to fill the larger, T=7 capsid produced in the absence of its remodeling proteins CpmB and CpmA. Meanwhile, 6-7 PLE genomes would need to be packaged into ICP1’s large, T=13 capsids in the absence of TcaP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). This larger difference in genome copies per capsid supports why PLE is the only satellite to suffer a transduction defect in the absence of capsid remodeling. The negative effect on PLE transduction in the absence of capsid remodeling suggests that PLEs benefit from TcaP’s activity, explaining why it is largely conserved in all PLEs discovered to date.</p>
<p>By packaging each of its replicated genomes into capsids proportional to its size, PLE makes more transducing particles and increases the odds of horizontal transfer of its genome. Theoretically, high transduction efficiency would be advantageous and selected for in PLEs. If this is the case, the expectation would be that all PLEs encode a functional TcaP that directs the assembly of small capsids. However, older isolates of PLE5 lack such an allele and consequently package their genomes into large capsids (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). If the loss of TcaP decreased PLE5’s fitness by decreasing its ability to spread horizontally, it could be expected that this PLE would quickly be replaced by more fit PLEs in the population. Surveillance data show that PLE5 was detected in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genomes from as early as 1931 until 1991 and again in 2016 and 2017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), suggesting PLE5 was maintained in the population for relatively long periods of time. Curiously, in an isogeneic background and under lab conditions, PLE5 transduces nearly as efficiently as PLE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), though transduction efficiency is increased by the formation of small capsids (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). These data suggest that PLE5 encodes other factors that contribute to its transduction and promote its maintenance in the population. It is unclear at what frequency and/or efficiency PLE transduction occurs in native conditions in estuaries or in the human intestinal tract where ICP1 preys on <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. It may be that low levels of transduction are sufficient to maintain a PLE in the population. Alternatively, PLEs could be maintained primarily through vertical transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The arsenal of anti-ICP1 factors encoded by PLE, even in the absence of TcaP activity, seem beneficial for <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, supporting vertical transmission of PLE5 as a means for its maintenance in the population. However, the emergence of a restored full-length allele of <italic>tcaP</italic> in PLE5 in 2017, paired with the conservation of TcaP in other PLEs and evidence of horizontal PLE transfer in some clinical isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), suggests capsid remodeling is advantageous due to its role in transduction and is selected for in PLEs in nature.</p>
<p>PLE is a unique satellite and its helper phage ICP1 is also dissimilar from other helper phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). In addition to its large capsid size, ICP1 is different from other documented helper phages in that it is an obligate lytic phage. This raises questions about whether the characteristics of the ICP1-PLE parasitism are specifically due to the lytic nature of ICP1. For example, PLE’s anti-phage activity is the most potent of any satellite where ICP1 progeny production is completely blocked by PLE. Perhaps this more severe phage restriction is important for the protection of neighboring <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cells from lethal infection. In the case of temperate phages, the presence of many phage kin may promote lysogeny, and the infected cell would survive. As this is not a possibility for <italic>V. cholerae</italic> infected by ICP1, PLE’s reduction of ICP1 in the environment may be a necessary means of protection for the bacterial population. In support of the selection for phage inhibition, PLEs encode multiple redundant mechanisms to block ICP1. It will be interesting to see if other lytic phages are parasitized by satellites and if there is conservation of distinct inhibitory mechanisms. Recent work has highlighted distantly related elements in other <italic>Vibrio</italic> species that may be elements with similarities to PLEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), but putative helper phages have not been identified. A recent study described a density separation and sequencing technique to identify novel satellites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) that may help illuminate the diversity in phage-satellite pairings. As this work has highlighted, the convergent evolution of satellite strategies to hijack aspects of a helper phage’s lifecycle may not be obvious at the sequence level, and the characterization of novel satellites can reveal features that unite or separate different families of satellites.</p>

<title>Production and Purification of Procapsid-like-Particles</title>
<p>Using Gibson Cloning, the coat gene fused to 6xHistidine was inserted into the pETDUET vector or the untagged coat was cloned into pCDFDuet. Either the ICP1 or PLE scaffold proteins were similarly inserted via Gibson Assembly downstream of a second T7 promoter. In other variations of this plasmid, the genes were cloned with the intergenic sequences found in ICP1_2011_Dha_A. The pETDUET constructs were transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 and grown on LB agar or in LB broth supplemented with carbenicillin (50 µg/mL). To reduce aggregation of PLE PLPs for cryo-EM, a pETDUET construct encoding <italic>gp122</italic>::6xhis and <italic>tcaP</italic> was co-transformed with a pCDFDuet construct expressing <italic>gp122</italic> (untagged), grown on LB agar or in LB broth supplemented with carbenicillin (50 µg/mL) and streptomycin (100 µg/mL). For protein production, overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 in 0.5-1 L, grown to OD<sub>600</sub>=0.2-0.4, induced with 1 mM IPTG for 3-5 hours, and collected by centrifugation at 4,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 20 minutes at 4°C. Pellets were then resuspended in 10% of the volume of Phage Purification Buffer (Phage Buffer 2.0 supplemented with 20 mM imidazole, 1 mM BME, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors (cat#A32961/A32965, Pierce)), and frozen at -80°C. For protein purification, frozen samples were thawed, sonicated, and centrifuged at 12,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 60-90 minutes to remove membranes and debris. The particles were then pelleted at 26,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 90 minutes. The pellet was nutated overnight in Phage Purification Buffer, and the nutate was loaded onto a column packed with HisPur nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin (cat# PI88222, Thermo Scientific) pre-equilibrated with ice-cold Phage Purification Buffer. After two passes over the column, the flow-through was collected and the column was washed with wash buffer (Phage Buffer 2.0 supplemented with 50 mM imidazole, 1 mM BME, and 10% glycerol). Proteins were then eluted with one column volume of Elution Buffers 1-3 (Phage Buffer 2.0 supplemented with 1 mM BME and 10% glycerol and 150, 250, or 350 mM imidazole) and a final six column volume elution with Elution Buffer 4 (Phage Buffer 2.0 supplemented with 1 mM BME and 10% glycerol and 500 mM imidazole). For all experiments with coat<sup>R223H</sup> and the noted replicates of wild type coat, decoration, scaffold and TcaP, protease and phosphatase inhibitors were added to all purification and elution buffers. Aliquots of the fractions were either boiled in Laemlli buffer and assessed by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie or applied to a grid and imaged by TEM.</p>
<p>Cesium chloride-based purification following affinity purification were carried out as follows. PLE PLP (coat::6xHis + TcaP) samples from the final elutions from affinity chromatography were concentrated on a 100K MWCO Amicon ultra filter (cat#UFC810024, Millipore) to a final volume of ∼1 mL. 1 mL steps of 1.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, 1.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, 1.4 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, 1.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup> CsCl were made in Phage Buffer 2.0 (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> pH 8.0), filter sterilized, and layered in ultracentrifuge tubes (thinwalled WX 5 mL Cat#1131 Thermo Scientific) then topped with 500 µL of PLE PLP sample. Samples were spun for 2 hours at 36,000 rpm (∼110,000 x <italic>g</italic>) at 18°C (AH-650 swinging bucket rotor Thermo Scientific), then 250 µL fractions were manually collected. The protein content of fractions was assessed by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study reports on the structure and function of capsid size-determining external scaffolding protein encoded by a Vibrio phage satellite. The structural work is of high quality and the presented reconstructions are <bold>compelling</bold>, but some of the experiments could benefit from a more rigorous statistical analysis of capsid sizes and shapes. The paper offers an advance in the field of phage and virus structure and assembly with implications for understanding the evolution of phage satellites.</p>

<p>This paper describes the discovery, functional analysis and structure of TcaP, a protein encoded by the Vibrio phage satellite PLE that forms a size-determining scaffold around PLE procapsids made from helper phage ICP1 structural proteins. The system displays a fascinating similarity to the P2/P4 system, which had previously been unique in its use of a size-determining external scaffolding protein, Sid. The work is interesting, comprehensive and of high quality. The presentation could be improved as listed in the suggestions below.</p>
<p>An interesting observation is that PLE appears to be dependent on small capsids for efficient transduction. This is not completely surprising if the element uses a cos site type mechanism for packaging, since this requires an integer number of genomes to be packaged when the capsid is full, and this might be more difficult to accomplish when the helper capsid is much larger than the satellite, as is the case with ICP1. The authors mention in a few places that this is the first known satellite to have this requirement. However, this is not quite correct: a similar defect was seen in phi12/SaPIbov5, where the large phi12 capsid was not quite the right size for either two or three copies of the wild-type (&quot;unevolved&quot;) SaPIbov5 (Carpena et al. 2016).</p>
<p>The authors present several micrographs showing capsids formed in the presence or absence of wildtype or mutant TcaP and CP (Fig. 1, Fig 2., Fig 3). However, each micrograph shows only a handful of particles of the &quot;correct&quot; size, in addition to a few shells that are aberrant or of a different size. I miss a more statistically rigorous enumeration of shells of different size (PLE or ICP1 sized, or different), empty vs. full, aberrant shells etc. This could be presented as a size distribution graph, a histogram or in table form.</p>
<p>In the abstract, the term &quot;divergent satellite P4&quot; is vague and unclear. Divergent from what? Probably they mean distinct from or unrelated to PLE. Please clarify.</p>
<p>How do they know that gp123 is a decoration protein? Was this previously determined, does it have (sequence) similarity to other known decoration proteins, or is it simply the most likely designation based on its position in the genome?</p>
<p>Although the reconstruction and modeling statistics are good, it is difficult to assess the quality of the map and the model from the presented figures. Details of the density and FSC curves (half-map and model-to-map) should be shown. It is also difficult to see the TcaP structure and how it compares to Sid from the figures presented.</p>
<p>Introduction, Paragraph 3: &quot;...which is the number of coat proteins divided by 60&quot; is not strictly speaking the definition of T number. The T number corresponds to the number of subtriangles that one triangular face of the icosahedron is divided into. It corresponds to the number of coat proteins divided by 60 in the canonical case, but in tailed phages, 5 copies are removed to make way for the portal protein. (Other viruses could be described as having architecture corresponding to a specific T number, but with divergent numbers of subunits, e.g. adenoviruses or polyomaviruses.)</p>

<p>Phage satellites are fascinating elements that have evolved to hijack phages for induction, packaging, and transfer, promoting their widespread dissemination in nature. It is remarkable how different satellites use conserved strategies of parasitism, utilising unrelated proteins that perform similar roles in their cognate elements. In the current manuscript, Dr. Seed and coworkers elucidated the mechanism used by one family of satellites, the PLEs, to produce small capsids, a process that inhibits phage reproduction while increasing PLE transmission. The work is presented beautifully, and the results are astonishing. The authors identified the gene responsible for generating the small capsids, characterised its role in the PLE transfer and phage inhibition, and determined the structure of the PLE-sized small capsids. It is a truly impressive piece of work.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Boyd and co-authors &quot;A Vibrio cholerae viral satellite maximizes its spread and inhibits phage by remodelling hijacked phage coat proteins into small capsids&quot; reports important results related to self-defending mechanisms that bacteria are used against phages that infect them. It has been shown previously that bacteria produce phage-inducible chromosomal island-like elements (PLE) that encode proteins that are integrated into bacterial genome. These proteins are used by bacteria to amend the phage capsids and to create phage-like particles (satellites) that move between cells and transfer the genetic material of PLE to another bacteria. That study highlights the interactions between a PLE-encoded protein, TcaP, and capsid proteins of the phage ICP1.</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written, provides a lot of new information and the results are supported by biochemical analysis.</p>

<p>An interesting observation is that PLE appears to be dependent on small capsids for efficient transduction. This is not completely surprising if the element uses a cos site type mechanism for packaging, since this requires an integer number of genomes to be packaged when the capsid is full, and this might be more difficult to accomplish when the helper capsid is much larger than the satellite, as is the case with ICP1. The authors mention in a few places that this is the first known satellite to have this requirement. However, this is not quite correct: a similar defect was seen in phi12/SaPIbov5, where the large phi12 capsid was not quite the right size for either two or three copies of the wildtype (&quot;unevolved&quot;) SaPIbov5 (Carpena et al. 2016).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this point. First, we agree that for cos type packaging systems, this would not be surprising. However, ICP1 is a pac type phage and we have evidence that PLE is also a pac rather than a cos type packaging satellite; therefore, PLE is the first headful satellite to show such a defect. For cos packaging elements, both SaPIbov5 and P4, non-integer genome lengths have been shown to pack less efficiently into capsids as pointed out above and shown in Carpena et al 2016 and Shore 1978. However, in both of these cases, the genomes were manipulated to change their size, suggesting that naturally occurring cos satellites maintain their genome sizes to be proportional to their capsid sizes or in integer proportion to their helper capsids. We will include a short summary of these previous findings in the main text to provide context for the rare decreases in transduction efficiency reported in the cos satellites.</p>

<p>Yes, we did mean unrelated to PLE, and we will clarify in the text.</p>

<p>Gp123 was annotated based on its position. While there is sequence similarity to other annotated Vibrio phages’ decoration proteins, we will clarify in the text that Gp123 is a putative decoration protein.</p>
