<title>Abstract</title><p>The two arms of innate immunity consist of the cell-mediated cellular defenses and the systemic humoral immune responses. <italic>Drosophila</italic> humoral immune defenses in the context of antimicrobial immunity, particularly the regulation and activation of antimicrobial peptide secretion from the fat body, have been studied extensively. How <italic>Drosophila</italic> regulates humoral immunity against another major natural enemy, the parasitoid wasp, is less well-characterized. In this study, we focused on a gene crucial in anti-parasitoid immunity, <italic>lectin-24A</italic>, which is specifically induced following parasitization. We found that a fluorescent reporter driven by the region upstream of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> showed localized posterior expression in the larval fat body, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue mediating humoral immunity. Furthermore, with RNA sequencing of the anterior and posterior fat body sections, we found that components of JAK/STAT, GATA, and Toll pathways were regulated differentially in the anterior-posterior axis of the fat body and/or by infection. Predicted binding motifs for transcription factors in all three of these pathways were identified in the 444bp upstream region of the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> gene, where scrambling these motifs leads to reduced basal or induced expression of the fluorescent reporter. Investigating each of these pathways, we found that JAK/STAT, the GATA factor Pannier, and the NF-κB factor dorsal all modulate the expression of <italic>lectin-24A</italic>. The binding motifs associated with these transcription factors were also enriched in the upstream sequences of parasitism-induced genes in the fat body. Taken together, these results indicate that JAK/STAT, Pannier, and NF-κB signaling are involved in the regulation of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> and, more generally, <italic>Drosophila</italic> humoral anti-parasitoid immunity after infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Parasitoid wasps are major natural parasites of insects. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the most common parasitoids attack larvae. Females of species such as <italic>Leptopilina boulardi</italic> insert an egg via their ovipositor inside the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva, where the parasitoid larva, once emerged, feeds on host tissue during development. Without a successful immune response, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> host is eventually killed at the pupal stage. However, parasitization induces an anti-parasitoid defense in the larva termed melanotic encapsulation that involves both cellular and humoral immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune cells (hemocytes) are recruited to the parasitoid egg and surround it in a multi-layered cellular capsule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. This capsule then becomes melanized, killing the parasitoid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Several humoral immune effectors have been identified in the context of humoral anti-parasitoid immunity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Humoral immunity is mediated by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body, an insect-specific organ functionally similar to the mammalian liver, the metabolic hub of the organism. The invertebrate counterparts of the mammalian complement factors, called thioester-containing proteins (TEPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], a group of serine proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], and the fat body-derived peptide edin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], are some of the secreted immune effectors shown to be involved in this response. We have previously also shown that a C-type lectin, lectin-24A, secreted by the larval fat body, plays an important role in this immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. The induction of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> expression following parasitism, controlled by the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory upstream region of the gene, is associated with higher resistance to parasitoid infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Lectin-24A localizes to the surface of the parasitoid egg before hemocytes attach to it, suggesting that it may play a role in the recognition of the egg and subsequent recruitment of hemocytes.</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> humoral immunity against bacterial and fungal infections has been investigated intensively in the past and is well characterized. Following recognition of pathogens, humoral defenses are induced via the activation of the two hallmark NF-κB immune signaling pathways, Toll and Imd (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]). These two pathways are known for their roles in regulating the secretion of many immune-related genes by the fat body, most famously antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Dif and Dorsal are the two NF-κB family transcription factors (TFs) in the Toll pathway, which is mostly responsible for defense against Gram-positive bacteria, fungi and other pathogens. Relish is the transcription factor involved in Imd signaling, which mostly controls the defense against gram-negative bacteria. In some cases, a combination of the two pathways is responsible for the expression of immune effectors in the fat body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Other than its role in the induction of AMP expression, the Toll pathway is also involved in regulating the proliferation of hemocytes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Loss-of-function mutations in the Toll pathway components result in reduced capacity to melanize parasitoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], whereas overactivation of the Toll pathway leads to a spontaneous melanization phenotype reminiscent of the melanotic encapsulation response against parasitoid wasps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway has been shown to be involved in the cellular immune response through the regulation of hemocyte differentiation following parasitoid infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Downregulation of JAK/STAT signaling in the anterior lobes of the larval lymph gland plays an important role in regulating the differentiation of lamellocytes, a specialist type of hemocyte for the encapsulation response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. It was also found that the activation of JAK/STAT signaling in somatic muscles by hemocyte-derived cytokines Upd2 and Upd3 releases energy stored in the muscles as glycogen for use in the immune response and is key to the immune response against wasp infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Similar to the Toll pathway, overactivation of JAK/STAT signaling in the whole larva also results in an over-proliferation of hemocytes and spontaneous melanization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>].</p>
<p>A third group of transcription factors mediating <italic>Drosophila</italic> immunity is the GATA family of transcription factors, a conserved group of TFs with zinc finger domains that recognize variations of the GATA motif ((A/T) GATA (A/G)) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]). <italic>Drosophila</italic> has a total of five GATA factors: Pannier, Serpent, Grain, dGATAd, and dGATAe. Serpent is essential for the differentiation of fat body and hemocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], and Pannier has been found to play an important role in hemocyte differentiation and maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Strikingly, many immunity genes expressed by the fat body exhibit Rel-Serpent synergy, where closely linked NF-κB and GATA binding sites are found in the upstream regulatory region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. While Serpent is the principal GATA factor regulating the antimicrobial response in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body, other GATA factors were reported to regulate immune responses in other <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>].</p>
<p>The anti-parasitoid humoral response is mainly driven by wasp parasite-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], but the signaling pathways involved in the response remain unknown. Previous studies of the transcriptional response to parasitoid attack in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae have identified a series of genes that are differentially expressed in response to wasp oviposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. These studies have implicated the three pathways outlined above in the response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. In particular, Wertheim et al. found that transcription factor binding motifs (TFBMs) for NF-κB, STAT, and GATA significantly associate with genes differentially expressed after parasitism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. However, these observations were not followed up experimentally. Previous investigations have also focused on transcriptional changes in the whole larvae, where differential expression in different tissues can confound the interpretation of the results, or in hemocytes, where transcriptional changes reflect mainly hemocyte differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Based on these studies, here we investigated the regulation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> humoral anti-parasitoid immunity mediated by the larval fat body. We focused on the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> gene, a key humoral immune effector in this response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], and studied its induction with parasitization to understand the regulation of anti-parasitoid humoral immune mechanisms more broadly.</p>

<title>The upstream cis-regulatory region of the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> gene underlies a specific response to parasitoid wasp infection</title>
<p>We have previously found that the expression of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> increases resistance to parasitoids, and the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) line 437 carries a resistant allele of the gene whereas the DGRP-892 line carries a susceptible allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. These two alleles differed in their expression levels, where the resistant allele is expressed at a higher level than the susceptible one in homeostasis and when the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> is upregulated after infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. To investigate if the proximal upstream region of the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> gene responds specifically to parasitoid wasp infection, we infected <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae expressing a <italic>lectin-24A</italic> reporter driven by 444 bp of sequence upstream from the transcription start site (TSS) of the resistant DGRP-437 allele (<italic>Venus<sup>LP437</sup></italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. This upstream region was chosen because it is the entire intergenic sequence between <italic>lectin-24A</italic> and its adjacent gene <italic>Shaw</italic>. We infected larvae with virus, bacteria, or parasitoid wasps, and found that only parasitoid wasp infection significantly induces the expression of the reporter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Consistent with previous reports of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], when we observed infected larvae under a fluorescent dissecting microscope the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> reporter <italic>Venus<sup>LP437</sup></italic> construct was expressed in the larval fat body. We also confirmed the expression by removing the larval fat body through dissection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Microscopy imaging of the dissected larval fat body shows localization of expression after infection with parasitoid wasps, where the reporter is consistently expressed at higher levels in the posterior ends (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>RNA sequencing reveals humoral immune response is localized to the posterior larval fat body</title>
<p>As we observed localized expression of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> in the posterior ends of the larval fat body, we investigated whether this localized response is seen in other immune-responsive genes. We conducted fat body RNA sequencing comparing gene expression changes in the anterior and posterior of the fat body in response to parasitoid infection. The fat bodies were separated into anterior and posterior sections according to the red line indicated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>. After filtering out lowly expressed genes, we detected a total of 10499 genes expressed in the fat body. Under infected condition, there is a total of 213 significantly differentially expressed genes with absolute log<sub>2</sub>FC of greater than 1, between the anterior and posterior sections. The expression of homeobox (Hox)-containing transcription factor genes, <italic>abd-A</italic> and <italic>Abd-B</italic>, are known for determining the anteroposterior body axis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, including the fat body, and we see both genes differentially expressed between the anterior and posterior, indicating we have successfully separated the sections by dissection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. The results confirm our observation of localized <italic>Venus<sup>LP437</sup></italic> expression in the posterior ends of the fat body upon wasp infection, as <italic>lectin-24A</italic> is among the top upregulated genes in the posterior with infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Moreover, it seems that the posterior of the fat body showed generally higher immune responsiveness than the anterior to parasitoid infection. Following infection, 72 genes were significantly differentially expressed with an absolute log<sub>2</sub>FC of greater than 1 in the anterior, whereas in the posterior the number is 244 genes (Supplementary Figure 2). Most genes differentially expressed in the anterior after infection were also differentially expressed in the posterior, while there were 179 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in the posterior but not in the anterior after parasitization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). We also see that differentially expressed genes in the posterior are enriched for “extracellular” in Cellular Components Gene Ontology (GO) terms, suggesting that the posterior fat body is enriched for secreted proteins (Supplementary Figure 3). In particular, putative immune effectors, including the thioester-containing protein genes <italic>Tep1</italic> and <italic>Tep2</italic>, as well as a number of serine proteases (<italic>CG34436</italic>, <italic>CG33460</italic>, <italic>CG43124</italic>, <italic>CG43125</italic>, and <italic>CG43175</italic>), appear to be specifically upregulated in the posterior of the fat body with parasitization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Significantly downregulated genes in the larval fat body after parasitism suggest parasitoid infection is causing shifts in metabolism and other aspects of immunity. <italic>sug</italic> and <italic>daw</italic>, genes involved in sugar metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], are downregulated in the fat body after parasitoid infection. We also found certain immune factors to be downregulated with parasitism, including <italic>Lectin-galC1</italic> and the lysozyme <italic>CG8492</italic>, both involved in antimicrobial response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. <italic>RhoBTB</italic>, a Rho-related BTB domain-containing protein involved in anti-parasitoid response is downregulated in the posterior fat body after infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Key immune signaling pathway components are differentially expressed in the fat body after parasitism</title>
<p>There are also interesting patterns of localized immune signaling gene expressions: key components of the NF-κB and JAK/STAT pathways show up as top differentially expressed genes between posterior and anterior sections in both control and infected conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and Supplementary Figure 2). GO enrichment of significantly upregulated genes in the posterior of the fat body also showed enrichment of terms related to “receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT”, “immune system process”, and “defense response” (Supplementary Figure 3).</p>
<p>Selecting specific components from major immune signaling pathways including transcription factors, we analyzed their expression patterns in anterior/posterior and uninfected/infected conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). It is striking to see that different transcription factors show differential patterns of expression. The NF-κB transcription factor <italic>dl</italic> (<italic>dorsal</italic>) is induced specifically in the posterior of the fat body in response to infection, with <italic>Rel</italic> (<italic>Relish</italic>) showing a non-significant trend in the same direction. <italic>Dif</italic> shows similar levels of expression across the four conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The gene encoding the Toll receptor <italic>Tl</italic> is also upregulated with infection specifically in the posterior (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). While the Toll ligand, <italic>spz</italic>, is more highly expressed in the posterior regardless of infection status (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The JAK/STAT pathway transcription factor <italic>Stat92E</italic> shows an entirely spatial differential expression not affected by infection state, where it is constitutively upregulated in the posterior (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). However, some other JAK/STAT pathway components have different patterns of expression: <italic>hop</italic> and <italic>dome</italic> are induced specifically in the posterior with infection, while the negative regulator <italic>et</italic> shows the same pattern of posterior induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Another negative regulator, <italic>Socs36E</italic>, shows induction with infection in both anterior and posterior, but is more strongly induced in the posterior (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Overall, we see patterns of localized differential expression of immune pathway component genes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval fat body between the anterior and posterior sections in response to wasp parasitization. The expression patterns of these genes in relation to the localized expression of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> suggest potential roles of these pathways in the regulation of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> and the wider humoral immunity against parasitoid infections.</p>

<title>Truncation of the upstream promoter sequence of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> defines the minimal region to maintain fat body specific induction of the gene</title>
<p>We have limited understanding of the regulation of the anti-parasitoid immune response in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, particularly the early signaling that activates humoral immunity in the larval fat body. We investigated the upstream region of the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> gene to further define the specific sequences that underlie its induction with parasitization, and to understand the transcription factors involved in the regulation of its expression. We created truncated versions of the <italic>Venus<sup>LP437</sup></italic>reporter construct where we deleted the sequence from the 5’ end (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). While we saw little effect from the first two deletions to 420 bp and 314 bp upstream of the gene, we found that, when we truncated the sequence to be 146 bp upstream of the TSS, there were significant changes to the expression of the reporter where it becomes expressed in other tissues such as the gut with and without parasitization (Supplementary Figure 4). Therefore, the region 314 bp upstream of the gene is required for an inducible response of the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> gene that is restricted to the fat body tissue.</p>

<title>NF-κB, GATA, and STAT binding motifs are all involved in the regulation of <italic>lectin-24A</italic></title>
<p>Our RNAseq results suggest that the NF-κB, GATA, and JAK/STAT pathways may be involved in the regulation of the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> gene and humoral anti-parasitoid immunity in general. We also screened for transcription factors binding to the upstream region of both the resistant and susceptible alleles of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> in a Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) screen. In particular, we found that dorsal from the Toll pathway binds to both the resistant allele from DGRP-437 and the susceptible allele from DGRP-892 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). We then predicted TFBMs in the 444 bp upstream region according to the consensus binding motifs for transcription factors in each of the immune pathways. One consensus motif was used for the transcription factors Dif/dl, two motifs were used for STAT92E, and four motifs were used for the different GATA transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>] (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> &amp; Supplementary Table 1). We predicted TFBMs for each of these transcription factors in this region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, the GATA motif is predicted to bind all four of the GATA transcription factors (Supplementary Table 1).</p>
<p>To further study the role of TFBMs in the regulation of <italic>lectin-24A</italic>, we created promoter reporter constructs where motifs have been scrambled to abolish transcription factor binding. Since the truncated version with 314 bp upstream of the TSS showed similar expression as the full-length LP437 construct, we scrambled the TFBMs with this version of the reporter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, LP437<sup>314bp</sup>). The universally conserved STAT binding site is defined as “TT(<italic>n</italic>)AA”, with variable 4-6 <italic>n</italic> sites in the middle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> STAT binds “TTC(N)<sub>3</sub>GAA” sites with high affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. However, gene regulation can rely on STAT binding motifs that have lower affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. This includes <italic>Dome,</italic> which is upregulated by STAT binding “TTC(N)<sub>4</sub>GAA” sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>], and which we found to be upregulated in the posterior fat body after infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Here we scrambled three sites with the motif “TTC(N)<sub>5</sub>AA” in the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> upstream region, which are half-way between the universal STAT motif and the 4<italic>n Drosophila</italic> STAT motif (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, sites with asterisks &amp; Supplementary Table 2). We also scrambled motifs predicted to bind Dif/dl and GATA.</p>
<p>We found that the predicted TFBMs associated with Dif/dl, STAT92E, and GATA are all involved in the regulation of the gene. Scrambling of the TFBM for Dif/dl resulted in the abolishment of the upregulation of the reporter and reduction in the basal expression, whereas scrambling of the TFBMs for the GATA and STAT transcription factors resulted only in the reduction of the basal expression while the induction with infection is still present (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). These results suggest that all three of these pathways may bind to the upstream region of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> and be involved in the regulation of expression.</p>
<p>We previously found that the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences of the resistant and susceptible alleles of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> differed by three insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels) of 7 bp, 8 bp, and 21 bp in length, and six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, top two rows) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. The 21 bp indel was found to be primarily responsible for the differential regulation of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> expression between the two alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Based on the positions of the TFBMs in the region, we found that the NF-κB binding site is disrupted by the 21 bp deletion in the susceptible DGRP-892 <italic>lectin-24A</italic> allele (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). As scrambling this NF-κB binding site abolishes the basal expression and induction of the reporter, we conclude that the loss of this NF-κB binding site explains the differential expression we see from natural polymorphisms in the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> upstream region. This in turn controls susceptibility to infection in natural populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>

<title>The JAK/STAT pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of <italic>lectin-24A</italic></title>
<p>The JAK/STAT signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway with a variety of functions in hematopoiesis, immunity, and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. The canonical JAK/STAT signaling starts with ligand binding, resulting in receptor dimerization bringing two non-receptor tyrosine kinases (JAKs) together to trans-phosphorylate one another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Activated JAKs then phosphorylate the receptor which in turn phosphorylates the STAT transcription factors. This leads to the normally cytosolic STAT molecule translocating to the nucleus to activate gene expression. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> JAK/STAT pathway only has one JAK (<italic>hop</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>], one active type I cytokine receptor (<italic>dome</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>], and one STAT (<italic>Stat92E</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. To better characterize the role of the JAK/STAT pathway in the regulation of <italic>lectin-24A</italic>, we knocked down the expression of the transcription factor Stat92E in larvae expressing the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> reporter using the ubiquitously expressed <italic>da-GAL4</italic> to drive the expression of a hairpin RNAi construct. At 24 hpi, <italic>Stat92E</italic> knockdown abolished the induction of the reporter, suggesting that the JAK/STAT pathway is involved in the regulation of the gene (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>

<p>In our RNAseq analysis, we also found that the JAK/STAT pathway negative regulator <italic>et</italic> showed specific induction in the posterior of the fat body. et is structurally similar to the JAK/STAT receptor dome, and it can function as a negative regulator by forming inactive heterodimers with dome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. It was previously found that et is required for the downregulation of JAK/STAT activity in hematopoietic progenitors for lamellocyte differentiation after wasp infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. To further understand the role of JAK/STAT signaling in <italic>lectin-24A</italic> regulation, we analyzed the expression of the reporter in a genetic background where <italic>et</italic> is mutated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. We found that with a non-functional mutant <italic>et</italic>, the reporter shows constitutively upregulated expression in the larval fat body (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). In addition, to confirm this result, we used a dominant negative allele of Domeless (DomeΔCYT, cytoplasmic domain deleted), driven in the fat body by <italic>Cg-GAL4</italic> or ubiquitously by <italic>da-GAL4</italic>, to decrease JAK/STAT activity. We observed a general lowering of reporter expression both for basal and infected conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> JAK, <italic>hop</italic>, showed a similar expression pattern as <italic>et</italic> in our RNAseq analysis, being upregulated after infection in the posterior fat body. We therefore studied the expression of the reporter in a genetic background with a constitutively active form of <italic>hop</italic> (<italic>hop<sup>Tum</sup></italic>). As predicted, the reporter showed elevated basal expression in the <italic>hop<sup>Tum</sup></italic> background (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). When we then examined <italic>lectin-24A</italic> reporter expression in a background where we abolished <italic>hop</italic> in somatic cells using CRISPR/Cas9 and a guide RNA targeting the gene (somatic knock out), we found a reduction in the upregulation of the reporter after wasp infection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate clearly that the JAK/STAT pathway has a critical role in the induction of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> following parasitization.</p>

<title>GATA transcription factors modulate <italic>lectin-24A</italic> expression in the fat body</title>
<p>GATA transcription factors comprise a family of DNA binding proteins named after the consensus sequence (WGATAAR) they recognize. GATA factors are highly conserved across invertebrates and vertebrates, where they play major roles in development. <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian GATA factors share functional similarities in the regulation of developmental processes, such as hematopoietic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], blood cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>], and liver/fat body development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has a total of five GATA factors, of which only three display the canonical two zinc finger domains found in all mammalian GATA factors: Pannier (Pnr), Serpent (Srp) and Grain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>].</p>
<p>The DNA-binding activity of GATA factors is mainly mediated by the C-terminal zinc finger domain, whereas the N-terminal zinc finger domain is required for interactions between the GATA factor and its cofactor Friend of GATA (FOG) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. It has previously been shown that the FOG protein u-shaped (Ush) interacts with the N-terminal zinc finger of both Pnr and Srp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. In particular, Pnr and Ush form heterodimers, where Ush antagonizes the activator function of the Pnr transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>].</p>
<p>As we observed significant differential expression of <italic>pnr</italic> in our RNAseq analysis following parasitization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), we studied the effect of Pnr on <italic>lectin-24A</italic> expression. We utilized the <italic>pnr<sup>D4</sup></italic> mutant, which belongs to a class of <italic>pnr</italic> mutants with point mutations in the N-terminal zinc finger domain, resulting in very weak interactions with Ush [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. Using the fat body <italic>Cg-GAL4</italic> driver, we expressed the dominant <italic>pnr<sup>D4</sup></italic> in the fat body with the <italic>UAS-pnr<sup>D4</sup></italic> construct (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). As <italic>pnr<sup>D4</sup></italic> interacts poorly with the negative Pnr regulator Ush, it functions as a dominant positive mutant. Strikingly, <italic>Venus<sup>LP437</sup></italic> reporter showed constitutive high expression, even in the absence of parasitization (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We then analyzed the expression of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> Venus reporter in a genetic background where we knocked out <italic>pnr</italic> expression using somatic mutagenesis with CRISPR/Cas9. However, knock out of <italic>pnr</italic> expression in the whole larvae did not result in significant changes to the <italic>Venus<sup>LP437</sup></italic> reporter expression, which might reflect GATA factors may have redundant roles in regulating <italic>lectin-24A</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, our results indicate that Pnr is involved in the induction of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> following parasitoid infection, but it may not be the only or the main GATA factor playing this role.</p>

<title>NF-κB transcription factors dl regulates humoral antiparasitoid immunity</title>
<p>NF-κB transcription factors of the Toll and Imd pathways have major roles in the regulation of antimicrobial humoral immunity for <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

<title>Transcription factor binding motifs found in the upstream region of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> are generally enriched in the upstream sequences of parasitism-induced genes</title>
<p>As we have found the TFBMs of GATA, NF-κB, and STAT are important in the regulation of the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> gene, we were interested to find out if this generalizes to the other genes upregulated with infection. We searched for TFBMs in the 300 bp upstream region of all the genes detected in the larval fat body RNAseq (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Then we assessed if a TFBM is enriched in the upstream sequence of genes upregulated with infection in the posterior of the fat body, relative to the full set of genes detected. We found that GATA binding motifs are generally enriched around two-fold in the sequences upstream of upregulated genes. For instance, the Pannier binding motif (Supplementary Table 1) is found an average of 0.60 times per kilobase (kb) of sequence 5’ of TSSs for upregulated genes, whereas it is only found an average of 0.33 times per kb of upstream sequences in the full set of genes (Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test, t = 3.49, d.f. = 277.9, <italic>p</italic>-value = 5.65 × 10<sup>-4</sup>). A similar case is observed in the genes specifically upregulated in the posterior of the fat body after infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), showing even higher enrichment with a mean of 0.66 times per kb in these genes (Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test, t = 3.51, d.f. = 186.1, <italic>p</italic>-value = 5.72 × 10<sup>-4</sup>).</p>
<p>When we searched for STAT motifs in the upstream sequences, we found significant enrichment of the “TTC(N)<sub>4</sub>AA” motif in the posterior-specific upregulated genes with a mean of 8.46 instances per kb compared to 7.77 in the background (Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test, t = 2.10, d.f. = 188.84, <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.037). Although the same motif also appears to be enriched in the parasitism-induced gene set, with 8.27 occurrences per kb, it falls just below the significance threshold (Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test, t = 1.91, d.f. = 284.98, <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.058). On the other hand, the “TTC(N)<sub>5</sub>AA” motif only shows significant enrichment in the parasitism-induced gene set, with 6.29 occurrences per kb compared to 5.83 in the background set (Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test, t = 1.98, d.f. = 284.47, <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.048).</p>
<p>Moreover, previous studies have described a specific organization of TFBMs in the upstream region of fat body-specific immune genes, where NF-κB and GATA binding sites have been found to be in close association, with less than 50 bp in-between them and within 200-300 bp upstream of the TSSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. We specifically searched for NF-κB sites within 50 bp of a GATA site and checked for enrichment. Although, we see that NF-κB motifs linked to GATA motifs are also more highly enriched in the upstream region of parasitism-induced genes and posterior-specific anti-parasitoid genes, with a mean of 0.52 and 0.53 instances per kb, respectively, compared to 0.39 in the background set, the differences were not significant. Overall, the TFBMs of the GATA, NF-κB, and STAT transcription factors all appear to be enriched in the 5’ sequences of parasitism-induced genes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval fat body, suggesting that these transcription factors and the signaling pathways they belong to are generally involved in the regulation of genes in the humoral anti-parasitoid response.</p>

<p>Antimicrobial responses in the fat body are regulated by the NF-κB pathways, Toll and Imd. The Imd pathway is mostly activated by Gram-negative bacteria through the PGRP-LC receptor, whereas the Toll pathway is largely activated by fungi and Gram-positive bacteria through the Toll receptor. Activation of the Imd pathway leads to the NF-κB transcription factor Relish translocating into the nucleus after its cleavage and activation, and the transcription factors Dif and Dorsal are activated through Toll pathway signaling. These NF-κB transcription factors along with the GATA transcription factor Serpent induce the expression of genes encoding antimicrobial effectors in the fat body via closely linked GATA and κB binding sites in the upstream promoter region. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> humoral anti-parasitoid response is regulated by a combination of inputs from JAK/STAT, GATA and NF-κB pathways. After recognition of parasitism, hemocytes produce the cytokines, Upd2 and Upd3, which bind to the receptor Dome to activate JAK/STAT pathway signaling in the fat body. Dome dimerization after ligand binding leads to trans-phosphorylation of Hop, which then activates the transcription factor STAT92E. STAT92E binds the upstream region of anti-parasitoid genes including <italic>lectin-24A</italic>. ET and SOCS36E are negative regulators of the JAK/STAT pathway that suppress this signaling. STAT, GATA, and NF-κB TFBMs are found to be enriched in the upstream sequences of parasitism-induced genes. The GATA transcription factor Pannier and the NF-κB transcription factor Dorsal also participate in the regulation of anti-parasitoid genes in the larval fat body by binding to their respective binding sites in the promoter region.</p></caption>

<p>The transcriptional response induced by a parasitoid attack differs from that activated by microbial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. We found that <italic>lectin-24A</italic> is a gene specifically induced by parasitoid infection, providing a tool to understand broadly how wasp-responsive genes are regulated. Based on our current results, it seems that this specificity is potentially conferred by the coordinated inputs from different immune-signaling pathways: NF-κB, the GATA factor Pannier, and JAK/STAT. This regulation differs from the well-characterized antimicrobial defense, which mainly requires the two NF-κB pathways, Toll and Imd, with additional inputs from the GATA transcription factor Serpent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>].</p>
<p>It is likely that our results reflect mechanisms of regulation in the wider humoral anti-parasitoid response, not just limited to <italic>lectin-24A</italic>. Our analysis of upstream regulatory motifs found enrichment of NF-κB, GATA, and STAT binding sites in the upstream region of differentially expressed genes in the larval fat body in response to wasp infection. This result is consistent with a previous report of TFBMs significantly associated with anti-parasitoid genes in the whole larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. In that study, Wertheim et al. defined clusters of differentially expressed genes based on patterns of co-expression over nine time points in the 72 hours after parasitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. <italic>lectin-24A</italic> as well as the genes encoding three thioester-containing proteins (TEPs), which are structurally similar to mammalian complement proteins, were clustered together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Genes in this cluster showed significant over-representation of NF-κB, GATA, and STAT regulatory motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], supporting out conclusion that the anti-parasitoid humoral immune response mediated by the fat body is regulated by the concerted action of these pathways. Further support comes from analyses of TEP expression in flies where signaling pathways have been perturbed. TEPs are expressed mainly by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body and induced in response to various immune challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]. The loss of the four secreted TEPs, TEP1-4, results in reduced capacity to successfully encapsulate wasps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. <italic>Tep1</italic> shows constitutive expression in the absence of infection in the constitutively active <italic>hop<sup>Tum</sup></italic> mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]. Similarly, in a <italic>Toll</italic> gain-of-function mutant background, <italic>Tep1</italic> also displayed constitutive activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]. However, in this case, the Toll pathway effects were recognized to be indirect, and secreted TEPs were found to function upstream of Toll and promote Toll activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>].</p>
<p>It is still unknown how parasitoids are recognized by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> host. As hemocytes are responsible for the secretion of Upd cytokines that activate the JAK/STAT pathway in other tissues, they are likely to play a key role in the recognition of parasitoid attacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Our study shows a significant role of the JAK/STAT pathway in <italic>lectin-24A</italic> regulation. Interestingly, we see that JAK/STAT pathway negative regulators are strongly induced alongside the activation of the pathway itself (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>]. As we only investigated one time point (24 hpi) in our experiments, this result suggests potential negative feedback loops in the shutdown of the pathway that were not captured. In mammals, negative regulators of the pathway are known to be induced after infection and JAK/STAT activation, playing a key role in regulating the cytokine response and preventing damaging inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>]. This is also the case in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where expression of the negative regulator SOCS36E is activated by JAK/STAT signaling, creating feedback inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>].</p>
<p>In the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> upstream region, we predicted a GATA transcription factor binding site that contains the consensus binding motifs from four of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> GATA transcription factors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> &amp; Supplementary Table 1). We specifically focused on Pannier because it is the only GATA transcription factor showing differential expression in the larval fat body following parasitoid attack (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Our results indicate that Pannier is involved in regulating <italic>lectin-24A</italic> and likely the broader humoral anti-parasitoid response. However, we have yet to investigate whether upregulation of Pannier expression is a primary signal of infection or a consequence of activating other pathways such as JAK/STAT. Furthermore, whether the other <italic>Drosophila</italic> GATA transcription factors also contribute to regulation remains to be further studied. In particular, Serpent, which is known to be involved in the regulation of immune genes in the larval fat body, is also predicted to bind upstream of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> and might also have a role in the regulation of immunity against parasitoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>].</p>
<p>Based on our RNAseq data, components of the Toll pathway showed significant differential expression in the larval fat body following parasitism (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Particularly, of the NF-κB transcription factors, <italic>dl</italic> showed upregulation specifically in the posterior fat body with infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). We also found that a Dif/dl binding motif in the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> upstream region had a crucial role in the expression of the <italic>Venus<sup>LP437</sup></italic> reporter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Dif and dorsal, the two transcription factors in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NF-κB Toll pathway, are known to regulate the defense to Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. In the antimicrobial response, Dif and dl have different roles depending on developmental stage. In adults, Dif alone is required for the humoral immune response, whereas in larvae, it shows some redundancy with dl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>]. While there is evidence that in Dif and dl double mutants, expression of either transcription factors is sufficient to rescue the expression of AMPs such as <italic>Drosomycin</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>], some other reports show that induction of certain AMPs specifically require Dif and cannot be rescued with only dl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]. Furthermore, Dif and dl, as well as Rel, form homodimers and heterodimers during DNA binding, meaning that permutations of different dimers expand the regulatory possibilities from these NF-κB proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>]. Since NF-kB transcription factors activate transcription by translocating into the cell nucleus, our observation that the expression of <italic>Dif</italic> does not increase after infection does not preclude it playing a role in regulating the anti-parasitoid humoral response. Nevertheless, as <italic>dl</italic> but not <italic>Dif</italic> mutants reduced expression of the <italic>Venus<sup>LP437</sup></italic> reporter, dl is likely playing the key role in regulation of this immune response.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated individually how each of these pathways contributed to the regulation of <italic>lectin-24A</italic> expression, but it remains unclear how they work together. It was previously found that NF-κB and GATA regulatory synergy plays a key role in many immunity-related fat body-specific genes that are activated in response to microbial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. In particular, a fixed organization of NF-κB and GATA binding sites in the 5’ regulatory region within 1 kb of predicted transcription start sites (TSSs) was defined, where both sites are located in the proximal region within 200 or 300 bp from the TSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. The sites were found to be closely linked, within 50 bp from each other and in the same relative orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. The NF-κB and GATA binding sites we identified in the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> upstream region fit this criterion exactly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). According to the previous study, each individual NF-κB and GATA site has an essential role in the optimal expression of the genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, their results suggest that the GATA site is responsible for localizing the expression to the fat body, and the NF-κB site is responsible for the induction of the gene in response to infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Our analysis based on scrambling the binding sites in the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> reporter construct are also in line with this model, with the addition that STAT binding is also involved in regulation in a similar way as GATA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). However, notably, Pannier is strongly upregulated by parasitoid infection and this upregulation does not differ between anterior and posterior of the larval fat body (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). This result suggests that Pannier is not just playing a role to localize <italic>lectin-24A</italic> expression to the fat body, but is also involved in the induction of its expression. Nonetheless, when we manipulated specific genes in each of these pathways the effects on <italic>lectin-24A</italic> expression become less straightforward, suggesting more complex models of coordinated regulation and potential indirect effects from knockdown or knockout in the whole larva.</p>
<p>Immune systems evolve rapidly as hosts adapt to an ever-changing array of parasites and pathogens. We have previously shown that a polymorphic deletion upstream of Lectin-24A has led to reduced parasitoid resistance in wild populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], and here we provide an explanation of this by showing that it abolishes an NF-κB binding motif. Furthermore, a group of four single nucleotide polymorphisms cause a smaller reduction in Lectin-24A expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Notably, one of these is within a STAT binding motif, with the low expression allele predicted to bind STAT92E with lower affinity (TTC(N)<sub>4</sub>AA in the high expression DGRP-437 line becomes TTA(N)<sub>4</sub>AA in the low expression DGRP-892 line). Therefore, the cis-regulatory elements that respond to immune signaling pathways may be hotspots of host-parasite coevolution.</p>

<title>Lectin promoter reporter assay with bacterial, viral, or wasp infection</title>
<p>Six vials of cornmeal fly food (per 1200 ml water: 13g agar, 105g dextrose, 105g maize, 23g yeast, 35ml Nipagin 10% w/v) were prepared for overnight egg lay with the LP437 line, where three vials were used for wasp infection and three vials used as uninfected controls. Three hundred flies of the LP437 line, with approximately even distribution of males and females, were prepared in a cage for egg lay onto a 90mm agar plate coated with a thin layer of yeast paste. After an overnight egg lay in the cage onto an agar plate, the eggs were transferred onto 50mm plates containing cornmeal fly food and some yeast. The eggs were removed from the agar plate by washing them down with a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (prepared from tablets Oxoid# BR0024G) and dislodging the eggs with a clean plastic brush. The egg solution was transferred into a 15ml Falcon tube and fly eggs allowed to sink to the bottom, where 500μl were then transferred using a cut pipette tip into an Eppendorf tube. Using a cut 200μl pipette tip, 15μl of fly eggs were transferred onto each 50mm plate. Four plates were prepared. The vials and plates were all incubated at 25°C and 70% humidity, and on the fourth day infections were carried out: three female parasitoid wasps were added to each of the three vials for infection for three hours; bacterial and viral infections were carried out according to the protocol below. At 24 hours post-infection (hpi), larvae were collected from the fly food by adding 15% sugar solution to allow the larvae to float to the top of the vial. Groups of fifteen larvae were collected and transferred to a piece of filter paper to dry. They were then transferred to a PCR tube containing 5-10 1.0mm zirconia beads (BioSpec Products # 11079110zx) with 100μl PBS (Gibco# 10010-015).

RNA was isolated from each sample of pooled fat body sections, where for each sample the PBS supernatant was removed and 250μl of Tri-reagent (Ambion #10296010) was added. The fat bodies were homogenized using TissueLyzer II (Qiagen #85300) for 2 minutes at 30Hz. 62.5μl of chloroform was added to each sample and the tubes were shaken for 15 seconds followed by 3 minutes of incubation at room temperature. The samples were then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 12,000xg at 4°C. 66μl of the upper aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube and 156μl of propan-2-ol was added.

<p>To generate <italic>lectin-24A</italic> promoter fluorescence reporter with scrambled transcription factor binding sites, we used Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (NEB# E0554S). Primers were designed according to the sites to be scrambled as shown in the table below, where the lowercase letters represented changes made to the original promoter sequence. The truncated LP8 plasmid was used for scrambling instead of the full-length <italic>lectin-24A</italic> fluorescence promoter reporter.</p>

<title>JAK/STAT pathway <italic>et</italic> mutant and <italic>lectin-24A</italic> reporter recombination</title>
<p>The <italic>et</italic> mutant line is a kind gift from Michèle Crozatier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. The <italic>lectin-24A</italic> promoter fluorescence reporter was recombined with the <italic>et</italic> mutant, as both the construct and the gene are on the X chromosome. A line with attached-X chromosomes (genotype: C(1)DX, y w f/y cv v shi[ts1] f mal/y[+]Y) from the Genetics Department at the University of Cambridge was used to follow chromosomes with recombination events. Females from the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> promoter fluorescence reporter line was first crossed with <italic>et</italic> mutant line males, then the female offspring were crossed to <italic>lectin-24A</italic> promoter fluorescence reporter males. Individual male offspring of this cross, which might carry a recombined X chromosome are crossed to females of the attached-X line. As the X chromosomes of males are always inherited through the male offspring when crossed to an attached-X female, any recombined X chromosomes in the males are kept in males.</p>
<p>Male offspring from each of the cross above were first screened for fluorescence using an epifluorescence microscope. Stocks that show Venus fluorescence were then screened for <italic>et</italic> mutation by PCR. Genomic DNA was extracted from males of each stock. Two pairs of primers from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] were used to check <italic>et</italic> mutation. Fwd-1 &amp; Rev-1 give an amplicon of 1186bp, and Fwd-2 &amp; Rev-2 give an amplicon of 526bp. Stocks carrying the <italic>et</italic> mutation would not give a PCR product from either of these primer pairs. Male larvae from stocks that have successfully recombined were used in subsequent assays for <italic>lectin-24A</italic> promoter fluorescence.</p>

<title>DomeΔCYT assay</title>
<p>The stock expressing <italic>DomeΔCYT</italic> under UAS control is a kind gift from Michèle Crozatier. We crossed females expressing the larval fat body driver <italic>Cg-GAL4</italic> or the ubiquitous <italic>da-GAL4</italic> driver, as well as <italic>tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup></italic>, with males expressing <italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>DomeΔCYT</italic>. The stock also carried <italic>UAS-et</italic> with a balancer chromosome that could not be identified in larvae, so a portion of the F<sub>1</sub> progeny also expressed <italic>UAS-et</italic>. The control cross was with females expressing only the <italic>Venus<sup>LP437</sup></italic> reporter with no driver. We carried out egg lay and allowed the larvae to develop at 18°C, until the 7<sup>th</sup> day after egg lay, when we moved the larvae to 29°C 3 hours prior to infection with parasitoids. Sample collection was performed at 24 hpi. The assays were then carried out as stated in “<bold>Lectin promoter reporter assay</bold>”.</p>

<title><italic>hop<sup>Tum</sup></italic> assay</title>
<p>Females expressing the <italic>Venus<sup>LP437</sup></italic> reporter were crossed with males of the <italic>hop<sup>Tum</sup></italic> genotype. Larvae were allowed to develop at 25°C. Since both the reporter and <italic>hop</italic> are located on the X chromosome, only female F<sub>1</sub> heterozygotes were selected during sample collection at 24 hpi. The assays were then carried out as stated in “<bold>Lectin promoter reporter assay</bold>”.</p>

<title>Somatic mutagenesis of key immune pathway genes</title>
<p>In order to create somatic knockouts of immune pathway genes, we created a line that expresses the <italic>lectin-24A</italic> promoter reporter and <italic>Act5c-Cas9</italic>. We crossed virgins of this line to males expressing guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting each gene. The gRNA-expressing lines used are listed below.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study reports an extensive analysis of the way a humoral immune response to parasitoid wasp is expressed and regulated, building on previous work from the authors on an anti-parasitoid effector lectin. The <bold>solid</bold> evidence uses two complementary approaches to show which innate immune pathways are involved in the regulation of the anti-parasitoid response. The evidence would be stronger if some analytical and related concerns can be addressed. The work will be of relevance to the community of investigators studying insect immune cells as well as researchers interested in host defense against parasitism.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The signaling pathways regulating the immune response to bacteria and fungi have been well characterized in Drosophila. Using the recently identified anti-parasitoid effector Lectin24A as a read-out, this article describes the signaling pathways regulating the humoral response against parasites.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study reveals a role of JAK-STAT, Toll, and GATA in the fat body in the regulation of Lectin24A. They also observe an enrichment of binding sites for NF-kB, STAT, and GATA factors upstream of ORFs of genes induced upon encapsulation. Based on this observation, they generalize their findings on the involvement of JAK-STAT, Toll, and Gata in the humoral response to encapsulation. Although roles for the Toll and JAK-STAT pathways in capsule formation have previously been identified, the merit of this article is in analyzing the roles of these pathways in the humoral response using a new gene readout that will be a precious tool in the community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The data are mostly convincing, but not always analyzed with sufficient detail; their conclusions should be reinforced by monitoring Lectin24A gene expression by RT-qPCR, by adding additional time points and by using alternative genetic tools. Using read-outs of the Toll and Imd pathways as comparisons is also important. Thus, this paper is interesting and important in advancing our understanding of Drosophila immunity but not yet enough solid to reach definitive conclusions on the proposed claims.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In a previous study, the investigators had identified through genetic analysis of lines derived from natural populations that lectin-24A was an important gene required for protection against the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardii, albeit only in a specific genetic context depending on an unidentified locus on the third chromosome (Arunkumar, et al., PNAS, 2023). They had documented that the gene is induced upon wasp infection and that the corresponding Lectin-24A binds to the wasp egg prior to hemocyte, mediating a faster encapsulating cellular response. They had identified a polymorphism in susceptible lines that correlated with a 21 nt deficiency in the lectin-24A promoter that removed a proximal NF-kappaB binding site. Here, they follow up this work by first performing a transgenic dissection of this promoter, including the mutations of putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) of the JAK-STAT, the Toll pathway, and the GATA family transcription factors. Secondly, they directly affect the expression of genes of the JAK-STAT pathway, of the DIF or Dorsal NF-kappaB transcription factors (and also Relish), and of pannier, the one induced gene of five GATA family members. Of note, the lectin is preferentially expressed in the posterior part of the fat body.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The combination of the analysis of the expression of the lectin-24A gene in cis through mutations in putative TFBS for three families of transcription factors and the analysis in trans of either the genetic pathway (JAK-STAT) or the STAT/DIF/Dorsal/Pannier transcription factors provides a fine-grained description of the regulation of the expression of a humoral effector gene that is induced by parasitoid wasp infestation. Thus, this work goes much beyond the bioinformatics analysis by using a rather thorough experimental approach. The finding of an induction of lectin-24A in the posterior rather than the anterior fat body is interesting yet puzzling. Is it known whether this species of parasitoid wasps deposits its eggs preferentially in the posterior part of the larva?</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are some discrepancies between the &quot;cis&quot; and &quot;trans&quot; approaches as regards their effects on basal or induced expression of lectin-24A:</p>
<p>JAK-STAT:</p>
<p>
Figure 4D shows that mutating three of six predicted STAT TFBS in the 314 bp promoter leads to a reduction of both basal and induced lectin-24A expression levels, with the gene still being inducible. In contrast, knocking down or out the Drosophila JAK and STAT genes abolished the inducibility of the lectin-24A reporter down or close to basal levels. Conversely, the overactivation of the JAK-STAT pathway led to basal levels that increased to those of induced ones.</p>
<p>Toll pathway:</p>
<p>
Figure 4D shows that mutating the proximal Dif-Dorsal TFBS reduces both basal and induced levels of the reporter gene to a common level that is below that of the wild-type basal activity. These data suggest that NF-kappaB signaling is required for both basal and induced expression of Lectin-24A. Affecting either Dif or dorsal gene expression led to opposite changes essentially in the basal expression level of the lectin-24A reporter. Conversely, dorsal overexpression in the fat body and other tissues (hemocytes) led to an enhanced basal expression of the lectin gene.</p>
<p>GATA:</p>
<p>
The mutation of the single GATA TFBS in the promoter led to a reduced expression phenotype very similar to that of JAK-STAT TFBS mutations. In contrast, ubiquitous somatic KO mutations of pannier did not affect the basal or induced lectin-24A expression levels. The overactivation of pannier using an allele that cannot be negatively regulated leads to a higher induction of Lectin-24A gene expression, strikingly with basal expression going up to induced levels.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this very thorough manuscript, the authors provide further evidence that the lectin-24A gene in Drosophila melanogaster is directly involved in the anti-parasitoid wasp humoral immune reaction.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In this study in particular they use a fluorescent reporter and promoter-bashing to determine how this gene is regulated. They find that JAK/STAT, Pannier, and NF-κB signaling are integral to the regulation of lectin-24A and to the humoral anti-parasitoid immune response. These claims are well supported by the experimental design, results, and analysis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A bit of clarity is needed regarding Figure 4a as well as on the rationale for the lengths of the promoter intervals used.</p>
