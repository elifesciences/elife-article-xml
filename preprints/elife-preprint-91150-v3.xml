<title>Abstract</title><p>The endothelial blood-brain barrier (BBB) strictly controls immune cell trafficking into the central nervous system (CNS). In neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis, this tight control is, however, disturbed, leading to immune cell infiltration into the CNS. The development of in vitro models of the BBB combined with microfluidic devices has advanced our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating the multi-step T-cell extravasation across the BBB. A major bottleneck of these in vitro studies is the absence of a robust and automated pipeline suitable for analyzing and quantifying the sequential interaction steps of different immune cell subsets with the BBB under physiological flow in vitro.</p>
<p>Here we present the Under-Flow Migration Tracker (<sup>UFM</sup>Track) framework for studying immune cell interactions with endothelial monolayers under physiological flow. We then showcase a pipeline built based on it to study the entire multi-step extravasation cascade of immune cells across brain microvascular endothelial cells under physiological flow in vitro. <sup>UFM</sup>Track achieves 90% track reconstruction efficiency and allows for scaling due to the reduction of the analysis cost and by eliminating experimenter bias. This allowed for an in-depth analysis of all behavioral regimes involved in the multi-step immune cell extravasation cascade. The study summarizes how <sup>UFM</sup>Track can be employed to delineate the interactions of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with the BBB under physiological flow. We also demonstrate its applicability to the other BBB models, showcasing broader applicability of the developed framework to a range of immune cell-endothelial monolayer interaction studies. The <sup>UFM</sup>Track framework along with the generated datasets is publicly available in the corresponding repositories.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Immune cells continuously travel through our body to perform immune surveillance. They travel within blood vessels at a very high speed and slow down upon reaching their target organ by the sequential interaction with different adhesion and signaling molecules on the vascular endothelial cells.</p>
<p>The study of molecular mechanisms mediating this multi-step extravasation of immune cells has been significantly advanced by in vitro cultures of microvascular endothelial cell monolayers. The dynamic interaction of the immune cells with endothelial monolayers can be imaged over time in vitro in microfluidic devices under physiological flow. The 2-dimensional structure of the endothelial monolayer allows for reliable visualization of the extravasation process required for the study of the molecular mechanisms involved. The manual analysis of the acquired imaging data is time- consuming and prone to experimenter error. Analysis automation is, however, hampered by the similar appearance of the unlabeled immune and endothelial cells and by the flow causing rapid immune cell displacement.</p>
<p>Here we introduce <sup>UFM</sup>Track, the under-flow migration tracker framework allowing for automated analysis of immune cell interactions with microvascular endothelial cells under flow in vitro. <sup>UFM</sup>Track performs comparably to the manual analysis of an experienced researcher, eliminates experimenter’s bias, and improves the accuracy of the immune cell tracking. Taken together, <sup>UFM</sup>Track sets the stage for scalability of in vitro live cell imaging studies of immune cell extravasation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Immune cells continuously travel throughout our body as a means of immune surveillance. Moving within the bloodstream allows for their fast transport to even distant sites but requires extravasation once they have reached their target organ. Immune cell extravasation across the vascular wall is a multi-step process regulated by the sequential interaction of different signaling and adhesion molecules on the endothelium and the immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). These molecular interactions mediate distinct sequential steps, namely tethering and rolling to reduce travel speed, shear- resistant arrest, polarization and crawling of the immune cell on the luminal surface of the endothelium, and finally, immune cell diapedesis across the endothelial layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>The precise molecular mechanisms mediating the multi-step immune cell extravasation in each organ depend on the immune cell subset but also the specific characteristics of the vascular bed. For example, in the central nervous system, the endothelial blood-brain barrier (BBB) establishes a tight barrier that strictly controls the transport of molecules across the BBB, ensuring tissue homeostasis required for neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The BBB similarly controls immune cell trafficking into the CNS. Thus, accounting for these special barrier properties, unique characteristics of the multi-step T-cell migration across the BBB have been described. For instance, T cells crawl for very long distances against the direction of blood flow on the surface of the BBB endothelium in search of permissive locations for diapedesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Research on T-cell interaction with the BBB has already been successfully translated into therapies in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>Exploring the entire multi-step extravasation of immune cells across the BBB has been significantly advanced by making use of in vitro BBB models maintaining their barrier properties, and placing them into microfluidic devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Combined with microscopic setups that allow for in vitro live-cell imaging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref>) of the immune cell interaction with the brain endothelial monolayer under physiological flow over time, the molecular mechanisms mediating the sequential interaction of T cells during extravasation across the BBB have been delineated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). The live cell imaging is largely performed in the phase-contrast imaging modality (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), which does not require establishing fluorescent labels of the imaged cells and avoids potential photo-toxicity of the fluorescent imaging modality. These studies have shown that upon their arrest, T cells polarize and either crawl at speeds between 3 to 10 µm/minute over the brain endothelial monolayer or probe the endothelial monolayer by remaining rather stationary and sending cellular protrusions into the endothelial monolayer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Both behaviors can lead to diapedesis of the T cells across the brain endothelial monolayers. This process lasts at least 3 to 5 minutes, with some immune cells observed to protrude and retract several times prior to finalizing a prolonged diapedesis process to the abluminal side of the brain endothelial monolayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Finally, T cells that have successfully migrated across the brain endothelial monolayer usually continue to migrate underneath the endothelial monolayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>In vitro analysis of the multistep cascade of T-cell migration across the BBB model under physiological flow. A. In vitro under-flow assay setup. T cells were perfused on top of the pMBMEC monolayer, and their migration under flow was observed using phase-contrast imaging modality. Imaging was performed with a time step of 10 seconds/timeframe. B. In vitro flow assay timeline. During the accumulation phase under flow with the shear stress of 0.1 dynes/cm2, T cells adhered to the pMBMEC monolayer. After 5 minutes (timeframe 30), the shear stress was increased to 1.5 dynes/cm2, leading to rapid detachment of not firmly adhering T cells. Analysis of the post-arrest T-cell behavior was thus starting at 5.5 minutes (timeframe 33). tf = timeframe. C. Example of phase-contrast imaging data. Red arrow – crawling T cell; yellow arrow – fully transmigrated T cell; yellow arrow-head – transmigrated part of a partially transmigrated T cell; red V arrowheads – pMBMECs. D. Schematic representation of distinct T-cell behavior regimes detected and analyzed using the developed UFMTrack framework. Crawling cells migrate continuously while probing cells interact with the pMBMECs and move around the interaction point within two cell-size (20 <italic>μm</italic>) as indicated by the arrows.

<p>The data analysis of these “in vitro flow assays” requires time-consuming offline frame-by-frame analysis of the imaging data by individual experimenters, in which the dynamic interactions of each individual immune cell has to be followed over the entire time of the assay manually and assigned to specific categories. Such analysis is tedious, and accurately assigning the different T-cell behaviors requires experience. Thus, this manual analysis is prone to inevitable errors and subjective judgments of the various experiments. Furthermore, the time-consuming manual T-cell tracking limits the number of events that can be studied and, thus, the statistical power of the analysis.</p>
<p>Automation of the analysis of the recorded multi-step T-cell extravasation across the BBB in the microfluidic device would thus be highly desirable. It is, however, hampered as these assays are usually performed with unlabeled cells and imaged by phase contrast (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), which poses a challenge due to the similar grayscales and morphology of the immune cells interacting with the brain endothelial cells. Further challenges include perfused on top T cells that, in the presence of shear flow, instantly appear within the field of view (FoV) and are either suddenly displaced over a certain distance or completely detached and washed away (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Proper analysis of these events is mandatory for reliable T-cell tracking but also with respect to the study of the overall avidity of the dynamic T-cell interaction steps with the underlying brain endothelium. Thus, it was compulsory to establish a tracking solution that accounts for the effect of the flow on the migrating cells and the distinct migration regimes.</p>
<p>Segmenting of cells imaged in phase contrast migrating on top of cellular monolayer of similar appearance is a challenging task. Furthermore, the analysis of T cell interactions requires detection and quantification of the transmigration. While recent advances in computer vision established several frameworks for detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) or segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), no tool is readily available to complete both tasks simultaneously.</p>
<p>There is a large number of powerful cell tracking solutions developed that focus on different aspects of cell migration, and are embedded in different frameworks or solutions. The general- purpose Trackpy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) allows for simple particle tracking and is not suitable to track cells migrating under flow. It is used for the tracking of cells imaged in phase contrast in the Usiigaci framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). The widely used TrackMate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) plugin for ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) allows for tracking of particles performing either the Brownian motion or a linear motion, but not the combination of two. Instant appearance or disappearance as well as the resolving tracks of under-segmented cells cannot be easily established in this framework. Similarly, CellTraxx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) performs matching of cells in the adjacent frames, prohibiting it’s use for tracking of under-segmented, intersecting cells or under flow. The Bayesian Tracker (btrack) framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) is using spatial information as well as appearance information for track linking focusing on the cell divisions required for cell lineage tracing.</p>
<p>Here we introduce the developed under-flow migration tracker (<sup>UFM</sup>Track) framework that systematically addresses the hurdles mentioned above, allowing it to perform automated tracking and analysis of cell-cell interactions imaged in phase contrast. We also show a successful implementation of <sup>UFM</sup>Track to build an analysis pipeline for T-cell interactions with brain microvascular endothelial cells in vitro under physiological flow. <sup>UFM</sup>Track reaches 90% T-cell tracking efficiency, performing comparably to manual analysis while eliminating the experimenter’s bias and improving the accuracy of T-cell tracking. Therefore, it enables significant savings in the labor force and time for data analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To design and develop the automated T-cell under-flow migration analysis framework <sup>UFM</sup>Track framework presented here, we made use of in vitro imaging datasets following T-cell migration across primary mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (pMBMECs) under physiological flow in vitro. The framework combines three components: T-cell segmentation and transmigration detection, T-cell tracking under flow, and analysis of each of the multistep T-cell migration cascade steps. Segmentation and transmigration detection of the T cells, migrating on the pMBMECs, is performed with a 2D+T U-Net-like convolutional neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). The T-cell under-flow tracking algorithm was formulated as a constrained optimization problem.</p>
<p>Next, we describe the methods and algorithms employed to develop <sup>UFM</sup>Track. Links to the code and the datasets used for model training can be found in the Data Availability section.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>I. T-cell segmentation</title>
<p>Reliable cell segmentation is crucial for reliable cell tracking. In the phase-contrast imaging modality, it was impossible to achieve reliable differentiation between T cells and endothelial cells of the pMBMEC monolayer based on pixel intensity. For detection of T-cell transmigration across pMBMEC monolayers (diapedesis), sufficiently reliable cell segmentation of the transmigrated T cells was also required. To achieve this, we have designed 2D and 2D+T U-Net-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) fully convolutional neural network-based models for multitask learning. The models were trained to predict three maps: cell probability, the probability that the T cell is below the pMBMEC monolayer, and cell centroids. The models performed predictions based on the grayscale of the respective phase- contrast images in the case of the 2D model or sequences of 5 timeframes in the case of the 2D+T model. The models were implemented in TensorFlow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). The training was performed on a dataset corresponding to 154 Megapixels of raw image data using the annotation mask for T cells (“T cell mask”) and the mask of the transmigrated part of the T cells (“transmigration mask”), the centroids map, and the weight map (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). For validation 37 Megapixels of raw imaging data were used.</p>

<p>The models have approximately 3M and 8M parameters correspondingly, and the model architectures are summarized in Supplementary Tables 1, 2. Details on models’ implementation, training, and image processing can be found in the “Segmentation models” section of the Supplementary Material.</p>
<p>In the T cell mask prediction task, the 2D+T model outperformed the 2D model by a notable 9% according to the average precision (AP) metric (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). At the same time, for the transmigration mask, which is much more difficult to infer, the 2D model performance reached only 54%, which is insufficient for reliable detection of T cells migrating across the pMBMEC monolayer. In this task, the 2D+T model outperformed the 2D model by 32% AP. We observed that the 2D+T model was sensitive to frame misalignment, leading to false positive detection of transmigrated T cells. Thus, to generate the preliminary T-cell masks used for frame alignment and histogram normalization, we employed the 2D model. Afterward, for the T-cell segmentation and transmigration detection, we employed the 2D+T model, followed by a watershed algorithm based on the inferred T-cell mask and the cell centroids as seed points. A stitched phase-contrast image sequence can be seen in Supplementary Video 1 and overlayed with the segmented cells and highlighted transmigration mask in Supplementary Video 2.</p>

<p>After segmentation, we suppressed the noise by discarding small objects with an area below 30 pixels (the mean area of a T cell is about 400 pixels).

<title>II. T-cell tracking</title>
<p>The presence of flow causes several types of discontinuous events that were managed with a specialized tracking algorithm. These are: 1) the sudden appearance of T cells in the field of view (FoV), 2) the sudden detachment of a T cell followed by its disappearance from FoV, and 3) the displacement over significant distances (up to hundreds of micrometers) of T cells that do not adhere firmly to the pMBMECs. The primary inspiration for our approach was the Conservation Tracking algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). We could consistently reconstruct the T-cell tracks by performing global optimization constrained to controlled probabilities of T-cell appearance, disappearance, and displacement due to the flow at every time point. The standard tracking algorithms like tracking by association is either unable to detect track links with high displacement and thus reconstructs several disconnected segments of a cell track, or leads to a high number of false track links. Our procedure favors the reconstruction of long T-cell tracks while at the same time allowing for tracking of the T cells which detach or are displaced by the flow (“accelerated T-cell movement”) over a longer distance (&gt; 8 <italic>μm</italic>) with speed significantly higher than their crawling speed.</p>
<p>The tracking consists of four main steps: linking, searching for track candidates, global track consistency resolving, and resolving the track intersections. The inputs for the tracking are the segmented cells and the cell centroids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The centroids and the cell proximity are used to quantify under-segmentation by introducing the node multiplicity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, see section T-cell tracking of the supplementary information for details). At the linking step, we identified all possible connections of T cells between the timeframes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="522827v4_fig3.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Next, during the search for track candidates, we aimed to find continuous track segments of T cells or under-segmented groups of T cells crawling on top of or below the pMBMEC monolayer without accelerated movement segments on the T cell track characterized by rapid T cell displacements. The whole dataset of T cells across all time points was represented as a graph. Each vertex corresponds to a T cell (multiplicity m=1) or a group of potentially under-segmented T cells (m&gt;1). The vertices are connected according to links obtained at the linking step. Track segments were found by performing global optimization to find consistent connectivity of vertices across the time points (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) by employing an approach inspired by the conservation tracking algorithm summarized in Schiegg et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Optimization was performed using the CP-SAT constrained optimization procedure using the open source OR-Tools library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, resolving global track consistency was performed. In this step, the scope of T cell tracking is shifted from individual nodes (representing T cells at particular timeframes as well as groups of under-segmented T cells) to the track segments (unambiguous sequences of nodes) and vertices at the endpoints of the segments. These are track start and end points, points of merging and separation of track segments in case of under-segmentation, as well as ambiguous points on a track. The latter was identified by sudden T cell displacement, a hallmark of detaching and reattaching T cells and T cells transitioning from properly segmented to under-segmented T cells or vice versa (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). This was followed by the search for potential missing track segments due to accelerated T cell movement under flow and missing links in the track crossing points. Both are characterized by significant displacement lengths such that they were not detected during the linking step. Thus we will refer to both as “jumps” in this section. We have also eliminated short and therefore unreliable segments, as well as segments whose multiplicity was found to be <italic>M</italic> = 0 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Afterward, we separated the segments into two categories, namely segments with multiplicity <italic>M</italic> = 1, i.e., tracks of isolated T cells, and segments with multiplicity <italic>M</italic> &gt; 1, i.e., tracks of under-segmented groups of T cells, where tracks of several T cells intersected. Finally, we extended the tracks of isolated T cells into the intersection if the branching vertex had a multiplicity of <italic>n</italic> and was splitting in exactly <italic>n</italic> segments with multiplicity <italic>M</italic> = 1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, we resolved the track intersections to obtain reliable T cell tracks, i.e., identifying track segments corresponding to the same T cell before and after the under-segmented track region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Detailed information on the developed under-flow T cell tracking algorithm is given in the “T-cell tracking” section of the Supplementary Material.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>III. T-cell migration analysis</title>
<p>Next, we performed the T-cell migration analysis based on the reconstructed T cell tracks. We selected tracks inside the fiducial area of the FoV, namely coordinates of the T cell at all timepoints along the track were located at least 25 µm away from the bounding box enclosing all segmented T cells. Next, tracks of T cells touching another T cell at the end of the assay acquisition were excluded since T cells directly adjacent to each other can hide the start of T cell transmigration across the pMBMEC monolayer and thus compromise correct detection and quantification of this step.</p>
<p>Additionally, only tracks with T cells were assigned in at least 6 timeframes during the physiological flow phase. We also require T cells to be assigned for at least 75% of timeframes along the track.</p>
<p>Under-segmented parts of T cell tracks were not considered. Examples of selected tracks can be seen in Supplementary Video 3.</p>
<p>After exclusion of the tracks of the cellular debris, which were misclassified as T cells during the segmentation step, using a dedicated “not-a-T-cell” classifier, we performed identification of transmigration (Supplementary Figure 5), probing and crawling migration regimes, as well as accelerated movement along the T cell track. Detailed information on the analysis of the T cell tracks is given in the “T-cell migration analysis” section of the Supplementary Material.</p>
<p>Finally, for each track, we evaluated motility parameters for each of the following migration regimes: probing before the transmigration, crawling before the transmigration, all crawling above pMBMECs monolayer including T cell crawling segments after the first transmigration attempts, all crawling below pMBMECs monolayer, whole T-cell track excluding accelerated movement and tracking inefficiency regions, as well as whole T-cell track. Specifically, we evaluated the following T- cell motility parameters: duration of each migration regime, the total vector and absolute displacements, the migration path length, the average migration speed (displacement over time), average crawling speed (path length over time), and finally the mean and standard deviation of the instantaneous speed. We evaluated migration time, displacement, and average speed for the accelerated movement regime.</p>

<title>IV. Analysis of trafficking datasets</title>
<p>Having developed a full pipeline based on the <sup>UFM</sup>Track framework for automated analysis of the multi-step T-cell migration cascade across the BBB model, we next aimed to compare the results of the automated analysis with previous studies, assess the capacity of the framework to gain novel insight into T-cell migration under flow, and evaluate its performance as compared to manual analysis.</p>
<sec id="s2d1">
<label>1.</label><title>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell analysis</title>
<p>To this end, we first analyzed a total of 18 imaging datasets each corresponding to 32 minutes recording dedicated to understanding the multi-step migration of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells across non-stimulated (n= 6), TNF stimulated (n=5), and IL1-β-stimulated (n=7) pMBMEC monolayers under physiological flow with the developed pipeline.</p>
<p>In these in vitro live cell imaging datasets, phase-contrast imaging was performed as described in the “Data acquisition” subsection in the Materials and Methods section. The T-cell accumulation phase corresponding to the shear stress of 0.1 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> lasted for 32 timeframes (5 minutes), followed by conditions of physiological flow (shear stress 1.5 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>) for the subsequent 160 timeframes (27 minutes). The shear stress is controlled by an automated syringe pump. After increasing to physiological flow rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), a significant number of T cells detached from the pMBMEC monolayers, with higher numbers of T cells detaching from non-stimulated pMBMEC monolayers when compared to those stimulated with pro-inflammatory cytokines as detected by the distribution of the track ending times between 5 and 30 minutes.

<graphic xlink:href="522827v4_fig4.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Analyzing these datasets with the established <sup>UFM</sup>Track framework, the T-cell behavior type for each detected T-cell track and the aggregated T-cell behavior statistic were obtained for the stimulated and non-stimulated pMBMEC monolayers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The total number of analyzed T cell tracks is n=971, n=780, and n=1218 for the non-stimulated, TNF stimulated, and IL1-β stimulated pMBMEC monolayers correspondingly. The data obtained with <sup>UFM</sup>Track were in accordance with our previous observations obtained by manual frame-by-frame analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). We further obtained the data for T-cell migration speed, T-cell displacement, and T-cell path lengths for the crawling T cells, as these are the primary cell motility parameters. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-H</xref>, we observed statistically significant differences in the mean T-cell motility parameters depending on the pMBMECs stimulation condition. Furthermore, we observed differences in the shape of the distribution of T-cell crawling speeds, consistent with our previous reports of underlying differences in the mechanisms mediating T-cell crawling on non-stimulated versus cytokine-stimulated pMBMECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). While not statistically significant for the IL1-b and with a low significance for the TNF stimulations, an increased variance of the T cell instantaneous speed on stimulated compared to non-stimulated pMBMECs is observed(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). This suggests that T-cell crawling is often interrupted by T-cell recognizing specific cues on the stimulated endothelium. The T cell meandering index (MI) distribution was high on non-stimulated and lower on stimulated pMBMECs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>), underscoring that cytokine stimulation enhances directed T-cell movement on the pMBMEC monolayer.</p>
<p>Since the analysis was performed automatically with <sup>UFM</sup>Track, it allowed for deeper insights into the T-cell migration behavior on the pMBMEC monolayers than obtained by manual frame-by-frame analysis. Specifically, the detection of accelerated movement by <sup>UFM</sup>Track enables the researcher to quantify the kinetics of individual T-cell detachment from the endothelium rather than simply quantifying a bulk T-cell detachment rate. This detachment kinetics is reflected in the average speed experienced during accelerated movement, which is significantly lower for the IL1-b condition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>), suggesting the need to break more bonds with the endothelium when pro-inflammatory cytokines are present.</p>
<p>As our <sup>UFM</sup>Track workflow achieves sufficient segmentation efficiency to detect T cells below the pMBMEC monolayer and T-cell transmigration across the pMBMEC monolayer, it also enables investigation of T-cell movement after the transmigration step. In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>, we show the distribution of the migration speed for the transmigrated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Interestingly, cytokine stimulation of pMBMECs, although applied from the luminal side, also affected T-cell movement at the abluminal side of the pMBMEC monolayer. While in the microfluidic device used in the present study, the migration of T cells below the pMBMEC monolayer may not be biologically relevant, this analysis option will be valuable for future studies involving multilayer in vitro BBB models that include the vascular basement membrane in addition to pericytes and astrocytes to mimic the entire neurovascular unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, our <sup>UFM</sup>Track automatically detects and characterizes unusual events, such as reverse T-cell transmigration, that are easily overlooked with manual counting. We do not present the statistics here, as only a few such events were observed. However, when applied to the multilayer BBBs in forthcoming in vitro models, systematic detection and analysis of these rare events will be important to understand T-cell migration in immune surveillance.</p>

<label>2.</label><title>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells analysis</title>
<p>As we have previously shown that the multi-step T-cell extravasation across pMBMEC monolayers differs between CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), we next analyzed two datasets studying the multi-step migration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells across non-stimulated (NS) and TNF/ interferon-gamma (TNF/IFN-γ) stimulated pMBMEC monolayers under physiological flow over 161 timeframes (27 minutes). The CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were slightly different in size and appearance when compared to the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells used for training the segmentation model. To benchmark our established <sup>UFM</sup>Track pipeline in this more difficult configuration, the datasets were first manually analyzed by four experimenters: one advanced experimenter with four years of experience (AdEx) and three inexperienced experimenters who received comparable 2-hour introduction and training (Ex1-Ex3). The analyses were performed on the subset of the acquisition, 161 timeframes long starting from timeframe 31.</p>
<p>Manual cell analysis and tracking were performed as described in the “Materials and Methods” section separately for each of the 8 tiles of the tiled acquisition. Next, all crawling CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that did not perform transmigration were manually tracked for the timespan after the flow was increased to the physiological level using the manual tracking in ImageJ.</p>
<p>First, we compared the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell behavior statistics obtained manually and by our automated analysis pipeline (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>). The results obtained by the automated analysis were in full agreement with the manual analysis performed by the experienced experimenter. At the same time, the data highlight the variability of the results from the inexperienced experimenters, confirming the potential for significant experimenter bias.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="522827v4_fig5.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>We also show the detection efficiency of T cells by the <sup>UFM</sup>Track. To achieve this goal, we combined the numbers of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells detected in each tile by manual analysis. Due to the overlap between the individual tiles, some CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are seen more than once. To obtain an estimate of the total CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell count detected manually, we scaled the number of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells accordingly to the number of detected unique T-cell tracks (see next paragraph). By this approach, we found T-cell detection efficiency to be above 90% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). The increased T-cell density can explain lower efficiency in the NS condition. These findings set the appropriate T-cell density for automated analysis of their migration behavior on pMBMEC monolayers to 200-300 cells per FoV of the size of 3.8 mm<sup>2</sup> or 50-80 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Next, we compared the T-cells tracks as obtained manually by three experimenters as well as automatically by our <sup>UFM</sup>Track. To this end, we first matched the tracks in adjacent tiles to obtain the tracks on the whole imaging area, avoiding multiple counts of the same track. This was achieved by pattern matching with initial offsets between tiles obtained by an automatic frame alignment procedure performed as part of the automatic analysis. We considered T-cell tracks observed in different tiles to be tracks of the same T cell if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="522827v4_inline5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>in</italic></sub> is the fraction of timepoints along a track at which the distance between the T cells was below 17 µm and <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>out</italic></sub> was the fraction of timepoints along a track at which distance between cells was above 25 µm. We used the same approach to match the T-cell tracks obtained by each experimenter and the automated <sup>UFM</sup>Track. To compare performance in an objective manner, we excluded manually obtained tracks that lay outside of the fiducial volume of the automated analysis, as well as T cells that were touching another T cell at the end of the acquisition, as those were also excluded from the automated analysis. We then took as 100% the sum of all T-cell tracks detected manually. We evaluated the fraction of all T-cell tracks detected by each experimenter as well as automatically by our <sup>UFM</sup>Track.</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, we show that our pipeline achieves a comparable T-cell tracking efficiency when compared to the manual analysis. While its performance was not superior to that of the experimenter with four years of expertise in the analysis of the under-flow datasets, it does perform better than less experienced experimenters.</p>
<p>We also compared the T-cell motility parameters obtained manually and automatically for the non-stimulated and stimulated pMBMECs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F-I</xref>). Data obtained for the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell migration speed on pMBMECs was comparable between all experimenters and the automated analysis. In contrast, results obtained for the T-cell crawling speed were significantly different between the automated approach and manual analysis. Taking a closer look at the T-cell tracks (Supplementary Figure 6), we readily observed that the manual analysis contains significant errors in the assignment of the T-cell position. This leads to a jittery pattern in the T-cell migration tracks and overestimating the T-cell path and, thus, T-cell crawling speed. Employing our novel automated analysis pipeline eliminated this systematic error in the measurements.</p>
<p>To finally investigate the potential benefit in the time required for automated versus manual data analysis, we examined the time required for a given experimenter to analyze such datasets manually using the Clockify time tracker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>, we show the average time investment needed to perform a complete T-cell behavior analysis and T-cell tracking in each imaging tile, as well as on average. Clearly, the experienced experimenter outperforms the inexperienced experimenters by a factor of 3. On average, a researcher would thus spend 8.1 hours analyzing a dataset with 300 T cells when only the tracks of crawling T cells (50%, i.e., 150 cells) are analyzed. If all T-cell tracks were to be analyzed, this time would further increase to 12.9 hours. Given that on average 10 datasets can be produced per day, manual analysis becomes a bottleneck, leading to delays in exhaustive data analysis and thus ultimately in research progress. The <sup>UFM</sup>Track framework reduces analysis time by a factor of 3 when analyzing only crawling cells and 5 if all cell tracks are to be analyzed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>).</p>
<p>With an average analysis time of 2.3 hours, the 10 experiments carried out in one day can be thoroughly analyzed within one day of machine time. This enables the scalability of flow-based immune cell migration experiments while simultaneously lifting the burden of tedious and time- consuming manual analysis from the researchers.</p>

Nonetheless, due to the different appearance of the flattening crawling cells and the transmigrated cells, the transmigration detection trained on the mouse T cells does not perform sufficiently well for the robust detection of transmigrating macrophages.</p>

<p>Finally, we have analyzed datasets acquired in a different imaging modality. Seven datasets of human T cells interacting with immobilized recombinant BBB adhesion molecules, namely ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and their combination (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> l). In this case, the fluorescently labeled cells were imaged with epi-fluorescent microscopy. In the absence of a monolayer, transmigration detection is not necessary. Thus we performed cell segmentation directly on the fluorescent signal (See Materials and Methods for details) using the same segmentation strategy as for the T-cell masks. The tracking was then performed the same way as for other experiments. The T cells were successfully segmented and tracked, as confirmed by visual inspection. We compared T cell behavior and motility parameters for three conditions of the recombinant adhesion molecules: ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM1 + VCAM1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> M, O). Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) where the analysis was performed using the ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) either manually or with the TrackMate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) plugin, we observed that in the absence of ICAM-1, T cells were moving in the direction of flow (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> N).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have developed the under-flow migration tracker (<sup>UFM</sup>Track) framework. It consists of independent modules and allows for segmentation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), tracking (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), and motility analysis of immune cells, migrating on, across, and below (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) the monolayer of brain microvascular endothelial cells under physiological flow in vitro. The developed method relies exclusively on phase-contrast imaging data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Therefore, it does not require establishing fluorescent labels of the migrating immune cell population to be studied, avoids potential photo- toxicity to be considered for fluorescent imaging modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), and is thus the preferred choice for analyzing the trafficking of sensitive cell types. T-cell segmentation and prediction of the transmigrated T-cell areas are performed using a custom 2D+T U-Net-like convolutional neural network. It enables reliable segmentation of T cells both above and below the pMBMEC monolayer. The existing particle and cell tracking toolkits consider migration of one cell type and thus are not suitable for the detection of distinct migration regimes and cell interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, to our knowledge, none of the existing algorithms consider migration under the flow causing rapid cell displacement. The tracking of T-cell interactions with the pMBMECs during all migration regimes under physiological flow required designing a new tracking algorithm considering rapid T-cell appearance, disappearance, and displacement in the field of view caused by the flow.</p>
<p>We have also developed approaches that resolve track intersections, i.e., identifying track segments corresponding to the same T cell before and after under-segmented track regions, which are inevitable during T-cell migration. By establishing the detection of T-cell crawling, probing, transmigration, and accelerated movement combined with reliable T-cell tracking, we have enabled the in-depth analysis of distinct migration regimes on a cell-by-cell basis. By reducing the dataset analysis time by a factor of 5, <sup>UFM</sup>Track allows for performing a thorough analysis of 10 experiments that a researcher can carry out in one day within one day of machine-time. We have demonstrated that the automated analysis performs on par with manual analysis while improving accuracy and eliminating experimenter bias, and enables scalability of flow-based immune cell migration experiments by reducing the analysis cost and lifting the burden of time-consuming manual analysis.</p>
<p>In this work, we have demonstrated the applicability of the developed framework to the analysis of the multi-step extravasation of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells across non-stimulated or cytokine- stimulated pMBMEC monolayers under physiological flow. We have also demonstrated that the developed framework allows for automated analysis of T-cell behavior statistics and motility parameters of distinct T-cell migration regimes. Results of the automated analysis of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell behavioral statistics performed with <sup>UFM</sup>Track are in agreement with previous studies using manual data analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). The automated analysis of datasets of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell migration has shown comparable performance with manual analysis performed by one experimenter with four years of analysis experience and three less-experienced experimenters. At the same time, the variance of the results obtained manually showed significant experimenter bias that the automated analysis eliminated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Additionally, the automated analysis allowed for in-depth analysis of all T-cell migration categories and precise evaluation of T-cell motility parameters, which was not achieved by manual T-cell tracking, even by the most experienced user.</p>
<p>We have further demonstrated the applicability of the <sup>UFM</sup>Track framework to the analysis of different cell types (BMDM, PBMC), species (human-derived T cells, HBMEC, and EECM BMEC) as well as tracking and analysis of cell migration imaged using the fluorescent imaging modality. In all cases, the cells could be successfully segmented and tracked, and the cell migration analysis was performed on a cell-by-cell basis. The main challenge for the system is reliable segmentation of the T cells and the transmigrated T cells. In the case of HBMEC the monolayer has a dotted pattern unlike the rather smooth pMBMEC. This leads to more false positives in the T-cell segmentation at the level of individual frames, which nonetheless could be efficiently filtered at the level of cell tracking. In the case of the BMDMs, since they have significantly different appearances during transmigration from the T cells, reliable transmigration detection was not obtained. This prevents the system from quantifying the transmigration statistics of the BMDMs, yet the cell detection and thus motility parameter evaluation of BMDMs was successful (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 D-F</xref>). For all the other analyzed cell types, both the cell segmentation and transmigration detection model trained on the annotated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells also produced transmigration maps of sufficient quality for reliable transmigration detection.</p>
<p>The framework was able to successfully detect the cells of sizes that differ by almost a factor of two (Supplementary Figure 7). This demonstrates, that simply by discriminating cells by size, it is possible to extend <sup>UFM</sup>Track to study interaction of several types of immune cells migrating on top of a cellular monolayer under flow and imaged by phase contrast.</p>
<p>Quantifying the fraction of transmigrated T cells is crucial for studying the molecular mechanisms governing the infiltration of autoaggressive T cells across the BBB into the CNS parenchyma and the immune surveillance. The role of specific endothelial or T-cell adhesion molecules in influencing the dynamic interactions of T cells with pMBMECs can, e.g., be probed by quantifying the ratio of T-cell crawling behavior to T-cell probing (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6M</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). The analysis procedure established in the <sup>UFM</sup>Track framework is flexible and can be easily extended to evaluate further properties of the migrating cells. For example, the number of times a T cell interrupts its crawling regime by switching to short probing behavior on the endothelium can be evaluated, thus providing information on the distribution of “hot spots” on the endothelium. Additionally, experiment scalability and the analysis on a cell-by-cell basis enable the search for distinct populations of T-cells, e.g., according to the distribution of probing to crawling behavioral ratios. The strength of T-cell adhesion to the endothelium can be probed with the developed framework using the measure of T-cell detachment rate and the distribution of the previously overlooked T-cell accelerated movement occurrences and accelerated movement speed. Finally, the possibility of quantifying the motility parameters of the transmigrated T cells enables future studies involving multilayer in vitro BBB models that include the vascular basement membrane in addition to mural cells such as pericytes and astrocytes mimicking the entire neurovascular unit.</p>
<p>While in this work we have focused primarily on the analysis of mouse T cells interacting with pMBMEC under flow or other immune cells interacting with the endothelial monolayer, the methods we present establish a foundation for a broad range of studies involving in vitro under-flow studies of immune cell trafficking. The tracking algorithm and motility analysis developed in the <sup>UFM</sup>Track framework are also directly applicable to the analysis of immune cell interactions with recombinant BBB adhesion molecules under flow. In this case, either phase-contrast or epi-fluorescent imaging can be employed when studying fluorescently labeled immune cells, as demonstrated. The T-cell segmentation based on deep neural networks can be applied to studies of the trafficking of other immune cell subsets on and across the pMBMEC monolayer. We demonstrated the successful application of the <sup>UFM</sup>Track to cells with significantly different appearances, such as the HBMEC cellular monolayers.</p>
<p>We make UFMTrack available to the community to build upon it for addressing their specific research questions. The modularity of the framework simplifies the adaptation to analysis of different cell types. The application to immune cell trafficking across other endothelial monolayers, including those from different species or vascular beds as well as lymphatic endothelial cells where the cell appearance is drastically different from the ones demonstrated here, is possible but requires fine-tuning of the trained segmentation model. While training the models presented here required a large dataset of annotated T-cell masks, and transmigration masks, this can be largely avoided for future development. Future models can be developed more efficiently by leveraging our existing annotated dataset of T-cell migration on the pMBMECs while employing transfer learning approaches in a multitask framework with weak supervision and fluorescent labels as auxiliary learning targets to adapt the model for the segmentation of cells with different appearances. This can be further improved by adopting self-supervised contrastive or masked learning methods, which have demonstrated significant advancements in model pretraining in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). This is the subject of our future studies. The framework could be employed in combination of other methods, e.g. by incorporating fluorescently labeled endothelial adherens junctions one could differentiate the trans- from the paracellular transmigration in the migrating cells. In this case the transmigration locations detected by the <sup>UFM</sup>Track framework could be automatically extracted for analysis. One could employ the tracking under flow implemented in the <sup>UFM</sup>Track framework for tracking the immune cells migrating on the vascular wall <italic>in vivo</italic> to capture the accelerated movement of cells. By sharing the data and open-source code of the <sup>UFM</sup>Track framework, i.e., the training data used for the segmentation model training, trained models, as well as the model architecture, and full under-flow T-cell tracking and migration analysis pipeline, we hope to encourage the community to pursue these developments to advance the field.</p>
<p>One current limitation of the method is the performance reduction of the T-cell tracking when the density of migrating T cells significantly increases (&gt;250 cells/dataset). Thus, the recommended T cell concentration is about 100-150k/ml. However, to avoid non-physiological interactions between migrating T cells and T cell clumping, the T-cell density should be kept at moderate levels anyway.</p>
<p>Additionally, analyzing data from 8 stitched FoVs allows for obtaining comparable statistics. The current analysis of the behavioral statistics quantifies the fraction of different T-cell migration regimes with respect to the number of adhered cells instead of the total T-cell count passing through the microfluidic device. While the number of fast-moving T cells during the accumulation phase cannot be directly counted using the imaging modality employed here, it can be estimated indirectly from the imaging data with additional calibration experiments and a dedicated machine learning model. Another limitation is that currently, we do not consider dividing immune cells. While cell division events happen rarely (&lt;1% of T cells) and are not primary events for the study of immune cell interaction with the BBB model, the modular architecture of our framework will facilitate future extension to detect cell division.</p>
<p>By enabling experiment scalability, unbiased analysis with advanced accuracy, and an in-depth analysis of large datasets of T-cell dynamics under flow, the computational and analytical framework presented here contributes to the 3R principle when studying the interaction of cells derived from animal models by reducing the number of animals to be sacrificed. <sup>UFM</sup>Track can be employed for fundamental research of the molecular mechanisms governing immune cell trafficking across a range of vascular beds, screening of pharmaceutical treatments, as well as for personalized medicine based on the evaluation of treatment efficacy on patient-derived T-cell migration behavior on patient-derived endothelial monolayers. One can furthermore envisage that <sup>UFM</sup>Track can be suitable to study cancer cell metastasis across different endothelial cell monolayers. Eventually, the developed framework can be extended to real-time operation during image acquisition. Combined with transgenic photo-convertible immune cells allowing for the photoconversion of immune cells according to their behavior will allow for subsequent fluorescent cell sorting and scRNA-Seq analysis. Such advanced studies are needed to reveal the role of genetic differences governing T-cell migration regimes.</p>

In this modality the acquired images are gray scale, and the T cells, especially after the migration across the pMBMEC monolayer, have a similar appearance to the pMBMECs, making the T-cell segmentation task very challenging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The data was acquired in tiles of 870 × 650 µm<sup>2</sup> (1389 × 1041 pixels) with an overlap of 100 µm, leading to a total acquired image area of 3170 × 1220 µm<sup>2</sup>. For each experiment, the dataset consists of 30 timeframes of T-cell accumulation and 162 timeframes of dynamic T-cell interactions with the pMBMEC monolayer under physiological flow. The timestep between sequential timeframes for each tile is 10 s. The total acquired area is thus limited by the acquisition speed or by the flow chamber size.</p>

<p>The dataset of human T cells on immobilized recombinant BBB adhesion molecules was acquired as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). In brief, 2 tiles were acquired of total size 3891 × 1504 pixels with pixel size 0.69 µm and framerate 6 frames/minute. The accumulation phase was 4 minutes, and the physiological flow phase was 5 minutes. In this dataset, there is only one compartment, thus excluding any transmigration of the T cells. We, therefore, have employed the preprocessed fluorescent images instead of the cell probability map and transmigration map produced by the segmentation neural network. In this case, the centroids are defined as local maxima localized on the preprocessed fluorescent images. The fluorescent images were preprocessed first by performing Gaussian blur filtering in 2D with a standard deviation of 0.75. Next, thresholding was applied to eliminate the background noise, clipping high brightness values (color values with abundance &lt;0.3% of threshold abundance), scaling to 0-255 8 bit, and saving in a lossless format. Finally, the 2 tiles were stitched together by matching the integrated color distribution in the X direction in the overlapping area.</p>

<p>This work is <bold>important</bold> because it elucidates how immune cells migrate across the blood brain barrier. In the revised version of this study, the authors present a <bold>convincing</bold> framework to visualize, recognize and track the movement of different immune cells across primary human and mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells without the need for fluorescence-based imaging using microfluidic devices. This work will be of broad interest to the cancer biology, immunology and medical therapeutics fields.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>It is evident that studying leukocyte extravasation in vitro is a challenge. One needs to include physiological flow, culture cells and isolate primary immune cells. Timing is of utmost importance and a reproducible setup is essential. Extra challenges are met when extravasation kinetics in different vascular beds is required, e.g., across the blood-brain barrier. In this study, the authors describe a reliable and reproducible method to analyze leukocyte TEM under physiological flow conditions, including this analysis. That the software can also detect reverse TEM is a plus.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>It is quite a challenge to get this assay reproducible and stable, in particular as there is flow included. Also for the analysis, there is currently no clear software analysis program, and many labs have their own methods. This paper gives the opportunity to unify the data and results obtained with this assay under label-free conditions. This should eventually lead to more solid and reproducible results.</p>
<p>Also, the comparison between manual and software analysis is appreciated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper develops an under-flow migration tracker to evaluate all the steps of the extravasation cascade of immune cells across the BBB. The algorithm is useful and has important applications.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The algorithm is almost as accurate as manual tracking and importantly saves time for researchers. The authors have discussed how their tool compares to other tracking methods.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Applicability can be questioned because the device used is 2D and physiological biology is in 3D. However, the authors have addressed this point in their manuscript.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>It is evident that studying leukocyte extravasation in vitro is a challenge. One needs to include physiological flow, culture cells and isolate primary immune cells. Timing is of utmost importance and a reproducible setup essential. Extra challenges are met when extravasation kinetics in different vascular beds is required, e.g., across the blood-brain barrier. In this study, the authors describe a reliable and reproducible method to analyze leukocyte TEM under physiological flow conditions, including this analysis. That the software can also detect reverse TEM is a plus.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>It is quite a challenge to get this assay reproducible and stable, in particular as there is flow included. Also for the analysis, there is currently no clear software analysis program, and many labs have their own methods. This paper gives the opportunity to unify the data and results obtained with this assay under label-free conditions. This should eventually lead to more solid and reproducible results.</p>
<p>Also, the comparison between manual and software analysis is appreciated.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors stress that it can be done in BBB models, but I would argue that it is much more broadly applicable. This is not necessarily a weakness of the study but more an opportunity to strengthen the method. So I would encourage the authors to rewrite some parts and make it more broadly applicable.</p>

<p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. The barrier properties of the BBB influence the dynamic behavior of T cells during their multi-step extravasation cascade. The crawling of CD4 T cells against the direction of blood-flow is e.g. a unique behavior of T cells on the BBB  that is also observed in vivo(1-3). Nevertheless we fully agree that in principle UFMTrack is usable for studying in general immune cell interactions with endothelial monolayers under physiological flow. We have thus added a statement in the abstract and expanded the discussion to highlight availability of the framework and the potential necessary adaptations required when using UFMTrack for analyzing different experimental setups. Please also note, UFMTrack has been established as basic framework using the example of brain endothelial monolayers and one flow chamber devices while studying different immune cell subsets. The purpose of the publication is to make UFMTrack available to the community to address their specific questions.</p>
