<title>Abstract</title><p>The rapid and sustained proliferation of cancer cells necessitates increased protein production, which, along with their disrupted metabolism, elevates the likelihood of translation errors. Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), a recently identified mechanism, mitigates ribosome collisions resulting from frequent translation stalls. However, the precise pathophysiological role of the RQC pathway in oncogenesis remains ambiguous. Our research centered on the pathogenic implications of mitochondrial stress-induced protein carboxyl-terminal alanine and threonine tailing (msiCAT-tailing), a specific RQC response to translational arrest on the outer mitochondrial membrane, in glioblastoma (GBM). The presence of msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial proteins was observed commonly in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Exogenous introduction of mitochondrial ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha (ATP5α) protein with artificial CAT-tail mimicking sequences enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and inhibited mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) formation. These alterations in mitochondrial characteristics provided resistance to staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis in GBM cells. Consequently, msiCAT-tailing can foster cell survival and migration, whereas blocking msiCAT-tailing via genetic or pharmacological intervention can impede GBM cell overgrowth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Proteins are vital to biological processes, and their overproduction is crucial for rapidly proliferating cells, like cancer cells. To cope with this increased demand, cancer cells extensively reform the initiation, elongation, and termination phases of their protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). However, heightened protein translation elevates the chance of errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Coupled with metabolic perturbations such as energy fluctuations and redox imbalances, the capacity to address disruptions during translation becomes indispensable. Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) is a recently discovered suite of rescue mechanisms in eukaryotes that detect and resolve stalled, decelerated, or collided ribosomes during translation elongation or termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>RQC is a multi-step process initiated by the ZNF598/RACK1 complex recognizing the distinctive 40S-40S interface on collided ribosomes, which triggers ubiquitination of specific 40S subunit proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Subsequently, the ASC-1 complex separates the leading ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Following this, events that transpire include: ribosomal subunits dissociation and recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), modification of the nascent peptide chains by C-terminal alanine and threonine addition (CAT-tailing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), release of CAT-tailed products from the 60S subunits by ANKZF1/VMS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), and degradation of aberrant peptides by the Ltn1/VCP/NEMF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The functional significance of CAT-tailed proteins produced during RQC remains incompletely understood. They may facilitate Ltn1-mediated ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) and promote the degradation of defective nascent peptides by exposing lysine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Nonetheless, they are also prone to forming detergent-insoluble aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Furthermore, contingent upon the nature of the original protein and its subcellular location, CAT-tailed proteins might possess specific, albeit currently unclear, functions. Notably, CAT-tailed proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, indicating a significant role in their progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>Cancerous cells demonstrate increased translation irregularities, including stop codon readthrough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), frame-shifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), and oxidative stress-induced ribosomal arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), suggesting a potential function for the RQC pathway. While CAT-tail modification on mitochondrial proteins due to compromised RQC has been noted in HeLa cells, the mechanistic involvement of RQC factors in cancer biology remains largely unexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Notably, the expression profile of various RQC factors (e.g., ASCC3, ABCE1, ANKZF1, and VCP) is dysregulated in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Interestingly, RQC factors can display opposing functions in cancer development and suppression depending on specific circumstances, with some factors like ABCE1, ASCC3, and VCP suppressing cancer cell growth upon downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), while others like NEMF/Clbn and ZNF598 may promote it upon inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). This indicates a nuanced, context-dependent role for RQC components in cancer cells, subject to both genetic and environmental modulators. A recent study examined ANKZF1’s mechanism in mitochondrial proteostasis and its influence on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). However, this study employed a non-physiological mitochondria-targeted GFP to induce matrix proteotoxicity, leaving the role of endogenous mitochondrial proteins in this process ambiguous.</p>
<p>Mitochondrial stress leads to co-translational import anomalies, eliciting widespread CAT-tailing (mitochondrial stress-induced CAT-tail or msiCAT-tail) of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, including C-I30 (Complex-I 30 kDa subunit protein, NDUS3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). The functional ramifications of these msiCAT-tailed proteins in mitochondrial biology remain poorly elucidated. Given that CAT-tailing imparts new properties to proteins, it may contribute to distinctive features of cancer cell mitochondria, such as hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) and resistance to drug-induced apoptosis linked to high mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). This membrane potential across the inner membrane of mitochondria, essential for ATP production by OXPHOS, is sustained by the electron transport chain (Complexes I to IV), which pumps protons (H<sup>+</sup>) into the intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), and ATP synthase (Complex V), which leverages this gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). While numerous malignant cells exhibit reduced OXPHOS despite high energy demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), the mechanisms by which they maintain or elevate ΔΨm remain an unresolved question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated msiCAT-tailing modification on the mitochondrial ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha (ATP5α). We discerned that msiCAT-tailed ATP5α is present in GBM. The mimic short-tailed ATP5α (ATP5α-AT3 in subsequent studies) can integrate into the ATP synthase, leading to an augmented ΔΨm and attenuated mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) assembly and opening. Consequently, msiCAT-tailed ATP5α enhances GBM cell resistance to programmed cell death induced by staurosporine (STS) and temozolomide (TMZ), thereby fostering cancer cell survival, proliferation, and migration. Conversely, impeding msiCAT-tailing diminishes cancer cell growth and resensitizes GBM cells to apoptosis. Our findings underscore the involvement of CAT-tailed mitochondrial proteins in tumorigenesis and emphasize the significance of the RQC pathway in oncobiology. These outcomes suggest that components and products of the RQC pathway may offer promising therapeutic targets for GBM.</p>

<title>Presence of msiCAT-tailed Proteins in Glioblastoma Cells</title>
<p>While dysregulation of individual ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) factors is documented across various cancers (e.g., adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung, prostate, and colon carcinomas), a comprehensive analysis of the RQC pathway in glioblastoma (GBM) has been lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Our analysis of transcriptomic data from a cohort of 153 GBM patients and 206 healthy controls, sourced from public datasets, revealed significantly elevated expression (logFC (fold change) &gt; 1; adj.P.Val &lt; 0.001) of RQC pathway genes, such as <italic>ABCE1</italic>, <italic>ASCC1-3</italic>, <italic>RACK1</italic>, and <italic>VCP,</italic> in GBM cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Conversely, <italic>ANKZF1</italic> was significantly downregulated (logFC = −0.43, adj.P.Val = 0.0005) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, Table S1). The expression change in these genes implies RQC pathway activation and potential accumulation of CAT-tailed proteins in GBM. Mitochondrial stress-induced protein mitochondrial Complex-I 30 kDa (C-I 30, also known as NDUS3), an endogenous RQC substrate with msiCAT-tails, was previously identified in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Examination of patient-derived GBM stem cells (GSCs) and normal neural stem cells (NSCs) revealed that GSCs, unlike NSCs, exhibited several msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial proteins, including NDUS3, COX4 (Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit 4), and ATP5α (ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha). Consistent with the detection of these msiCAT-tailing signals, increased NEMF (Nuclear Export Mediator Factor) levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) and decreased ANKZF1 (Ankyrin Repeat and Zinc-finger Peptidyl tRNA Hydrolase 1) expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) were observed in patient-derived GSCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), further indicative of enhanced CAT-tailing activation, mirroring bioinformatics findings in GBM samples. A murine GBM model exhibited analogous RQC pathway alterations, with increased NEMF and decreased ANKZF1 expression in transplanted SB28 gliomas compared to normal brain tissue (Fig. S1A, B).</p>

<p>The subsequent experiments were conducted using two GBM cell lines, SF268 (SF in figures) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>) and GSC827 (GSC in figures) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), and two control cell lines, SVG p12 (SVG in figures) and Normal Human Astrocytes E6/E7/hTERT (NHA in figures) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). RQC protein expression analysis revealed decreased ANKZF1 and increased ABCE1, ASCC3, and NEMF expression in GSC827 and SF268 cells, consistent with findings in patient-derived GSCs (Fig. S1C). Intriguingly, induction of CAT-tailing on a Flag-tagged β-globin reporter via a non-stop protein translation system demonstrated significantly higher CAT-tailed protein (β-globin-nonstop) production in GBM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). This process was inhibitable by the CAT-tailing elongation inhibitor anisomycin and NEMF knockdown (sgNEMF), but not cycloheximide treatment, as evidenced by a decreased ratio of CAT-tailed (Red) to non-CAT-tailed bands (Green) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, to investigate the biological implications of CAT-tailing, artificial CAT-tails were introduced to mitochondrial proteins. Due to the variability in CAT-tailing, prior research simulated this process by adding alanine-threonine (AT) repeat tails to the C-terminus of mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). According to recent studies, the chosen tail sequence can be stabilized by its high threonine content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). ATP5α, a highly abundant mitochondrial protein with roles in cancer, was selected to study the unique functions of CAT-tailed forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). siATP5α knockdown first confirmed the upper band signal in GSCs as authentic ATP5α, demonstrated by its disappearance concurrent with the main band’s weakening (Fig. S2A). Then, we confirmed that this upper band signal corresponded to changes in CAT-tailing, which could be effectively inhibited by NEMF knockdown and anisomycin treatment (Fig. S2B). Due to the indistinct nature of the endogenous msiCAT-tailed ATP5α signal, exogenously expressed Flag-ATP5α was utilized here.</p>
<p>To investigate the potential new function provided by CAT-tailed proteins, control (SVG and NHA) and GBM (SF268 and GSC827) cell lines overexpressed ATP5α with three (ATP5α-AT3) or twenty (ATP5α-AT20) AT repeats. Consistent with earlier findings, only the long-tailed ATP5α-AT20 exhibited post-translational modifications and detergent-resistant insoluble aggregates, appearing as slower migrating bands and a high molecular weight smear in protein electrophoresis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Based on comparing exogenously expressed (indicated by red boxes) to endogenous proteins (indicated by green boxes), GBM cell lines (GSC827, SF268) showed increased accumulation of ATP5α-AT20 compared to control cells (SVG, NHA). This accumulation may occur due to increased stability and reduced degradation of long-tailed proteins, a malfunctioning protein quality control system, enhanced cellular tolerance to protein accumulation, or a combination of these factors. Subcellular localization analysis showed that the short AT tail (AT3) did not significantly alter ATP5α’s mitochondrial localization, similar to the tailless protein. However, a significant portion of ATP5α-AT20 was found in the cytoplasm near mitochondria, forming protein aggregates, with the highest proportion in highly malignant GSC cells (Fig. S2C, D). Notably, poly-glycine-serine tails (short, GS3, and long, GS20) did not induce insoluble protein aggregation or intracellular punctate distribution (Fig. S2E-G), highlighting the importance of specific amino acid composition.</p>
<p>Importantly, in GBM cells, both exogenous tailed proteins and the endogenous ATP5α formed clusters attached to the outer mitochondrial membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E, F</xref>). Similar aggregate formation in GBM cells was also observed with other mitochondrial proteins, such as NDUS3 (Fig. S3A, B). Furthermore, we examined the mouse GBM models. Akin to <italic>in vitro</italic> culture, ATP5α in transplanted SB28 glioma formed more punctate signals and did not always colocalize with the mitochondrial marker TOM20 (Fig. S3C-E). These findings collectively indicate a disruption of the RQC pathway, leading to the presence of msiCAT-tailed proteins in GBM cells.</p>

<p>Our next investigation of msiCAT tail proteins revealed their impact on mitochondrial function. Expression of Flag-tagged ATP511-AT3 and ATP511-AT20 in GBM and control cell lines elevated ΔΨm specifically in GBM cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Overexpression of ATP511-GS3 and ATP511-GS20 did not exhibit this effect (Fig. S4E). To our surprise, even with suppressed endogenous CAT-tailing through sgNEMF and oeANZKF1 in GSC cells, the introduced AT3 and AT20 proteins could still effectively elevate ΔΨm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F, G</xref>). This finding suggests that CAT- tailing of ATP511 may be a significant contributor to the observed mitochondrial phenotype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Blue Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) illustrated distinct effects based on CAT-tail length. ATP511-AT3 integrated into the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex, whereas ATP511-AT20 formed high molecular weight complexes or remained as monomers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). In mitochondrial physiological activity assays using the Agilent Cell Mitochondrial Stress Test, the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was directly measured to assess mitochondrial respiration. Our findings indicate that expressing both ATP511-AT3 and ATP511-AT20 negatively impacted mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This impairment leads to a reduction in ATP synthesis, basal respiration, and maximal respiration rates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I-L</xref>). These data suggest that both short and long tails on ATP511 proteins influence mitochondrial function, although potentially through different mechanisms. Short CAT-tails may directly act on ATP synthase function and thus affect the respiratory chain complex, while long CAT-tails form protein aggregates, causing mitochondrial proteostasis stress and thus indirectly affecting mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). This differential impact of CAT-tail length suggests a nuanced regulation of mitochondrial function mediated by ATP511 modifications.</p>

<title>msiCAT-tailing Influences Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore (MPTP) Dynamics</title>
<p>Beyond its traditionally recognized role in ATP production, the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub> ATP synthase has garnered increasing attention as a potential structural component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Given the possibility that CAT-tailed proteins like ATP511 might modulate MPTP function, this investigation sought to elucidate the mechanism by which msiCAT-tailing modulates MPTP dynamics (open-close state). Comparative analyses conducted in GBM and control cells revealed that MPTP in GSC827 cells predominantly exists in a closed conformation, indicated by strong Calcein signals. Notably, the treatment of anisomycin, a pharmacological CAT-tailing inhibitor, effectively induced MPTP opening in GSC827 cells, as indicated by decreased Calcein signals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). This effect was concomitant with the diminished aggregation of endogenous ATP5α (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E, F</xref>). Furthermore, corroborative evidence was obtained through genetic manipulation. Specifically, genetic inhibition of CAT-tailing via NEMF knockdown (sgNEMF) resulted in a similar decrease in Calcein signaling and a reduction in ATP5α accumulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, D, G, H</xref>), aligning with the results obtained using anisomycin. In contrast, treatment with cycloheximide, a general translation inhibitor, did not significantly alter Calcein or ATP511 aggregation signals (Fig. S5A-D), suggesting that non-specific translation inhibition does not impact the mitochondrial MPTP state. The crucial role of CAT-tail modifications on ATP5α in modulating MPTP status was further substantiated by the observation that overexpression of artificially synthesized AT repeat tails (AT3 and AT20) restored Calcein signals despite the inhibition of endogenous CAT-tailing (Fig. S5E).</p>

<p>The MPTP is recognized to participate in the transient efflux of protons, calcium ions (Ca²), and other signaling molecules from the mitochondrial matrix during brief opening episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). To quantitatively evaluate the MPTP open/closed state, the mitochondrial Ca² Retention Capacity (CRC) assay was employed, which measures the amount of Ca² required to elicit MPTP opening. Our results revealed that GSC827 cells exhibited a greater CRC than NHA cells. Pre-treatment with anisomycin or knockdown of NEMF (sgNEMF) significantly decreased the CRC in GBM cells, indicating MPTP opening upon the loss of CAT-tailed proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I, J</xref>). Consistent with Calcein staining results (Fig. S5A, B), cycloheximide treatment did not substantially alter CRC measurements (Fig. S6A, B). Conversely, enhancing CAT-tailing (e.g., via oeNEMF and siANKZF1) led to an increase in CRC (Fig. S6A, B), although this effect was less pronounced in GSCs, potentially due to their inherently active CAT-tailing and closed MPTP.</p>
<p>To further investigate the impact of specific AT repeat tails on MPTP opening, artificial AT repeat tails on ATP511 were introduced into GBM cells. It was found that the short AT tail (AT3) inhibited MPTP opening, while the long AT tail (AT20) displayed a weaker effect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K, L</xref>), potentially due to their different integration into ATP synthase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Complex co-immunoprecipitation assay did not detect direct interactions between ATP511 with AT3 or AT20 tails and MPTP components Cyclophilin D (Cyp-D) and adenine nucleotide translocator 2 (ANT2) (Fig. S6C). However, Cyp-D expression was reduced upon ectopic expression of ATP511-AT3 and ATP511-AT20, suggesting decreased MPTP formation (Fig. S6D). Intriguingly, BN-PAGE analysis revealed that both ATP511-AT3 and ATP511-AT20 altered ANT1/2-containing complexes, with expected bands disappearing (indicated by *) and aggregates forming (at the top), supporting the notion that ATP synthase is integrated into the MPTP supercomplex due to the spatial proximity of the ANT1/2 complex and ATP synthase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3M</xref>). In conclusion, msiCAT-tailed ATP511 proteins, particularly those with short AT3 tails, are integrated into ATP synthase and have a substantial influence on modulating MPTP status.</p>

<title>msiCAT-Tailing Boosts GBM Cell Migration and Resistance to Apoptosis</title>
<p>The elevated mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and constricted MPTP resulting from msiCAT-tailed ATP511 and other mitochondrial proteins may enhance cellular stress resilience.

MTT assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>) revealed that overexpressing short (AT3) and long (AT20) AT repeat tails, fused to ATP511, significantly improved GBM cell viability, but not that of NHA cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, B</xref>). However, short (GS3) and long (GS20) GS repeat tails did not affect GBM cell viability (Fig. S7A).

Notably, neither ATP5α alone nor GS repeat-tailed proteins showed comparable changes (Fig. S7D, E). Furthermore, overexpressing AT3- and AT20-tailed proteins effectively conferred phenotypes associated with increased GBM cell activity, such as enhanced survival and migration, even with inhibited endogenous CAT-tailing machinery activity (e.g., sgNEMF and oeANKZF1) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-G</xref>). It is worth noting that ANKZF1 knockdown in U87 and U251 cell lines can cause aberrant mitoGFP accumulation, possibly reducing cellular adaptability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), suggesting varying mitochondrial adaptability to proteostasis stress across cell lines.

To investigate the role of CAT-tailed ATP5α proteins in this resistance, we overexpressed proteins with mimetic tails in GBM cells.

In contrast, control short (GS3) and long (GS20) GS tails failed to confer such resistance (Fig. S8F, G). Consistent with these findings, overexpression of artificial CAT-tailed ATP5α proteins also increased the resistance of GBM cells to temozolomide (TMZ)-induced apoptosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>).

<p>Further investigation revealed the RQC pathway’s involvement in GBM cell anti-apoptosis, with initial findings pointing to alterations in mitochondrial functions. Prior studies demonstrated that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the RQC pathway led to a significant decrease in GBM mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>). In GSC cells, anisomycin treatment promoted mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening, an effect not seen in NHA cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-D</xref>). Consequently, GBM cell lines with genetically or pharmacologically inhibited RQC pathways were more susceptible to STS-induced apoptosis, evidenced by elevated executioner caspase 3/7 activity (Fig. S9A), enhanced PARP-1 cleavage (Fig. S9B, C), increased TUNEL staining (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H-K</xref>), and flow cytometry analysis (Fig. S9D-G). Notably, general translation inhibition using cycloheximide did not elicit the same apoptotic response (Fig. S9A, D, E). Finally, the RQC pathway was also implicated in temozolomide (TMZ)-induced cell death. Combining anisomycin with TMZ significantly reduced GBM cell survival (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L</xref>) and effectively inhibited GSC spheroid growth (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M, N</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The Ribosome-associated Quality Control (RQC) pathway plays a crucial role in managing aberrant proteins produced during translation. This study focused on understanding the consequences of RQC-mediated modification, specifically the addition of msiCAT tails, to mitochondrial proteins like ATP5α in glioblastoma (GBM) cells. The findings reveal that GBM cells harboring msiCAT-modified ATP5α exhibit a unique metabolic profile. Despite a reduction in ATP synthesis, these cells maintain their mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), a key factor for cellular function and survival. Furthermore, they demonstrate enhanced cell survival and motility, characteristics associated with increased tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Notably, the presence of msiCAT-modified ATP5α confers resistance to apoptosis triggered by staurosporine (STS), potentially by modulating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), a critical regulator of cell death pathways, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>. These identified traits contribute to an increased aggressiveness of tumors, suggesting that the RQC pathway plays a critical role in cancer cell survival and proliferation. Encouragingly, a recent study also demonstrated the RQC pathway’s involvement in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> Notch overexpression-induced brain tumor model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). The findings imply modulating the RQC pathway could serve as a promising complementary strategy to existing chemotherapy regimens. By targeting this specific pathway, therapeutic interventions might effectively disrupt the mechanisms that allow cancer cells to evade apoptosis and sustain their energy production under stress, potentially leading to improved treatment outcomes for patients with GBM and other cancers characterized by similar protein modifications.</p>

Conversely, in GBM cells, the CAT-tailed ATP5α protein can either form aggregates near the mitochondrial outer membrane or be imported into the mitochondria. Within the mitochondrial matrix, proteins with shorter CAT-tails readily integrate into ATP synthase, disrupting its functionality. This dysfunction is characterized by a reduced ATP synthesis rate and proton (H<sup>+</sup>) accumulation, leading to an elevated mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). These alterations in ATP synthase ultimately trigger malfunction of the MPTP, consequently affecting cell proliferation, migration, and resistance to drug-induced apoptosis (Right).</p></caption>

<p>The study of ATP synthase behavior in cancer holds particular importance. During carcinogenesis, ATP synthase frequently relocates to the plasma membrane, where it is termed ectopic ATP synthase (eATP synthase). These eATP synthases exhibit catalytic activity, facilitating ATP production in the extracellular space to foster a favorable tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Research indicates that eATP synthase assembles initially in mitochondria before being transported to the cell surface via microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). However, the specific type of ATP synthase delivered to the plasma membrane remains unclear. Future investigations into the localization of CAT-tailed eATP synthase may offer valuable insights into this process.</p>
<p>Multiple mitochondrial proteins in cancer cells can likely undergo CAT-tailing in a similar way. These msiCAT-tailed peptides may have varied impacts on mitochondria and cells due to differences in their base proteins. For instance, CAT-tailed COX4 protein might substantially and directly diminish mitochondrial respiratory efficiency. Examining the individual roles of these proteins is important, as the combined effect of their defects may be crucial in understanding observed mitochondrial changes in cancer. A minor caveat here is that the observed effect of the CAT-tails’ presence primarily stems from artificial CAT-tail sequences with a high threonine content, rather than the endogenous CAT-tail protein. It is possible that other sequence components could lead to different effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). A recent study found that ANKZF1 knockdown inhibited GBM progression by causing abnormal protein accumulation in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). This, combined with our data, suggests that balanced ANKZF1 expression and activity are vital for cancer proliferation. Both excess and deficiency may alter cellular adaptability. A minor flaw of that study was the use of a mitochondrial-localized non-stopped GFP protein to induce proteostasis stress and the lack of direct biochemical evidence of CAT-tailed proteins. Our research focuses on endogenous proteins for a detailed analysis of their impact on mitochondria. The rationale is that highly expressed, non-physiological ectopic proteins might cause general proteostasis failure, masking the specific functions of endogenous proteins. Additionally, the studies used different cell lines. GSC, a patient-derived GBM cell line with greater stemness, might have distinct mitochondrial status and RQC pathway activity compared to U87 or U251 cell lines. Thus, the conclusions of the two studies are not contradictory but rather complementary, both demonstrating the significance of RQC in tumorigenesis. Our study delves into the mechanistic role of the RQC pathway in GBM, identifying new potential targets for future treatments.</p>
<p>An in-depth investigation into the quantification of nuclear genome-encoded mitochondrial proteins modified via the msiCAT-tailing mechanism using sophisticated mass spectrometry is a compelling area for future research. Recent work by Lv et al., published in <italic>Cell Reports</italic>, revealed that the cytoplasmic E3 ligase Pirh2 and the mitochondrial protease ClpXP work in conjunction with the established NEMF-ANKZF1 system to break down mitochondrial protein aggregates resulting from ribosome stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). The increased presence of ClpXP in various cancers could potentially be linked to an increase in msiCAT-tailing products in mitochondria, though further studies are needed to clarify ClpXP’s role in mitochondrial RQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). Moreover, ClpXP influences the levels of multiple mitochondrial proteins. Our own experiments showed that ATP5α proteins lacking msiCAT-tails were the most challenging to express ectopically. Proteins with shorter tails (AT3) expressed more readily, while those with longer tails (AT20) exhibited the highest expression levels but also tended to form SDS-insoluble aggregates. This regulatory effect could be mediated by ClpXP-dependent degradation or potentially through transcriptional control. PGC-1α, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator, is a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). By binding to and activating nuclear transcription factors, PGC-1α triggers the transcription of nuclear genome-encoded mitochondrial proteins and the mitochondrial transcription factor Tfam. Tfam, in turn, activates mitochondrial genome transcription and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Distinguishing between these regulatory possibilities will necessitate future research, including a meticulous examination of mRNA levels for msiCAT-tailed targets and analysis of PGC-1α and Tfam binding to transcriptional elements.</p>
<p>MPTP is a complex, supramolecular channel traversing the inner mitochondrial membrane, characterized by its non-selective ion permeability, calcium dependence, and multifaceted functionality. Despite extensive investigations into its functional attributes and regulatory mechanisms, the precise molecular architecture of the MPTP remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). Several theoretical models have been posited to elucidate the MPTP’s structural composition. Firstly, the VDAC/ANT/Cyp-D model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>) proposed an assembly of voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC), adenine nucleotide translocators (ANT), and cyclophilin D (Cyp-D) as the structural basis; however, subsequent genetic analyses have introduced substantial controversy regarding the integral role of these proteins within the MPTP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). Secondly, the ATP synthase model posits that MPTP formation involves dimers or reconstituted c-rings of ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). While this hypothesis presents an intriguing perspective, empirical confirmation of ATP synthase’s role as a definitive structural element of the pore remains inconclusive, with a body of conflicting research surrounding this proposition. Thirdly, the contemporary prevailing hypothesis suggests the MPTP is constituted by a large complex, termed the ATP synthasome, comprising ANT and ATP synthase, with Cyp-D serving a regulatory function over the complex’s dynamic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>).</p>
<p>The MPTP activity is modulated by mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), which reciprocally influences mitochondrial ion homeostasis and energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Our study elucidates a dual function of msiCAT-tailed ATP5α protein in cancer cells: stabilization of a high membrane potential, thereby mitigating MPTP induction, and direct inhibition of MPTP functionality through participation in its assembly. While MPTP’s critical role in cell death is established, the premise that MPTP inhibition enables cancer cell evasion of drug-induced programmed cell death has lacked substantial evidence. This study furnishes empirical support for this hypothesis, demonstrating that GBM cells, notably glioblastoma stem cells (GSC), exhibit markedly reduced MPTP activity relative to control cells. This reduced activity is directly correlated with the CAT-tailing modification of the ATP synthase subunit. These observations are concordant with prior research indicating that genetic mutations or post-translational modifications in specific ATP synthase subunits can modulate MPTP activity. The findings highlight a novel mechanism through which cancer cells may develop resistance to therapeutic interventions by manipulating mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>).</p>

<title>Mitochondria ATP measurement via fluorescence imaging of ATP-red</title>
<p>BioTracker™ ATP red dye (Millipore, cat. SCT045) is a fluorogenic indicator for ATP in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>). Cells cultured in monolayer conditions were incubated in medium with 5 μM ATP red for 15 min in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Mitochondria were also labeled by incubating cells with 100 nM MitoTracker-Green (Invitrogen, cat. M7514) for 15 min to normalize their mass. Before measurement, cells were washed twice with culture medium, and then fresh medium was added. Cells were imaged in a 37°C chamber with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at excitation/emission of 510/570 nm for ATP-red and at excitation/emission of 490/516 nm for MitoTracker-Green by using the Zeiss confocal microscope. The ATP-red signals could also be measured by a Synergy 2 Reader (BioTek).</p>

<title>Mice and immunostaining</title>
<p>Animal studies were approved by the University of California, San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, AN195636-01) and were performed following the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p>
<p>For orthotopic brain tumor models, 8-to-10-week-old C57BL/6 mice (male and female in equal numbers) were used for i.c. studies. Cell lines (GL261, SB28) were suspended in DMEM for inoculation. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and 30,000 tumor cells were injected orthotopically in 3 μL. Using a stereotactic frame, a burr hole was formed on the skull via a 0.7 mm drill bit 1.5mm laterally to the right and 1.5mm rostrally from the bregma, and a noncoring needle (26s gauge; Hamilton) was used to inject the cells at a depth of 3mm into the brain from the burr hole. The skin incision was sutured. Mice were then monitored daily. Mouse SB28 tumor tissue and wild-type mouse brain tissue were collected at the survival endpoint.</p>
<p>Frozen tissue sections were thawed at room temperature for 20 min and rinsed with PBS three times. Tissues were then fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After washing in PBS, tissues were permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100 + 0.1% Tween-20 for 15 min and then blocked by using 5% normal goat serum and M.O.M. blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories, cat. BMK-2202) for 1 hour at room temperature. Tissues were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight in a humidified chamber at 4°C. After washing in PBST, tissues were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hour. After washing again in PBST, tissues were stained with 300 nM DAPI for 5 min and mounted in Fluoromount-G Anti-Fade solution. Images were taken using a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope. The primary antibodies used in the study were mouse anti-ATP5a (1:500, Abcam, cat. Ab14748), rat anti-TOMM20 (1:500, Abcam, cat. Ab289670), rabbit anti-NEMF (1:500, Proteintech, cat. 11840-1-AP), mouse anti-ANKZF1 (1:500, Santa Cruz, cat. sc-398713), chicken anti-GFP (1:500, Abcam, cat. Ab13970). The secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 633-, 594-, 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1: 300, Invitrogen, cat. A21071, A11036, A32732).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Cai et al have investigated the role of msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial proteins that frequently exist in glioblastoma stem cells. Overexpression of msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha (ATP5) protein increases the mitochondrial membrane potential and blocks mitochondrial permeability transition pore formation/opening. These changes in mitochondrial properties provide resistance to staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis in GBM cells. Therefore, msiCAT-tailing can promote cell survival and migration, while genetic and pharmacological inhibition of msiCAT-tailing can prevent the overgrowth of GBM cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The CATailing concept has not been explored in cancer settings. Therefore, the present provides new insights for widening the therapeutic avenue.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the paper does have strengths in principle, the weaknesses of the paper are that these strengths are not directly demonstrated.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some aspects of image acquisition and data analysis need to be clarified and extended.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the paper does have strengths in principle, the weaknesses of the paper are that these strengths are not directly demonstrated. The conclusions of this paper are mostly well-supported by data, but some aspects of image acquisition and data analysis need to be clarified and extended.</p>

<p>We are grateful for your acknowledgment of our study’s innovative approach and its possible influence on cancer therapy. We sincerely appreciate your valuable feedback. In response, this updated manuscript presents substantial new findings that reinforce our central argument. Moreover, we have broadened our data analysis and interpretation, as well as refined our methodological descriptions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This work explores the connection between glioblastoma, mito-RQC, and msiCAT-tailing. They build upon previous work concluding that ATP5alpha is CAT-tailed and explore how CAT-tailing may affect cell physiology and sensitivity to chemotherapy. The authors conclude that when ATP5alpha is CAT-tailed, it either incorporates into the proton pump or aggregates and that these events dysregulate MPTP opening and mitochondrial membrane potential and that this regulates drug sensitivity. This work includes several intriguing and novel observations connecting cell physiology, RQC, and drug sensitivity. This is also the first time this reviewer has seen an investigation of how a CAT tail may specifically affect the function of a protein. However, some of the conclusions in this work are not well supported. This significantly weakens the work but can be addressed through further experiments or by weakening the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the recognition of our study's novelty. To address your concerns about our conclusions, we have revised the manuscript. This revision includes new data and corrections of identified issues. Our detailed responses to your specific points are outlined below.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) In Figure 1B, please replace the high-exposure blots of ATP5 and COX with representative results. The current results are difficult to interpret clearly. Additionally, it would be helpful if the author could explain the nature of the two different bands in NEMF and ANKZF1. Did the authors also examine other RQC factors and mitochondrial ETC proteins? I'm also curious to understand why CAT-tailing is specific to C-I30, ATP5, and COX-V, and why the authors did not show the significance of COX-V.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your inquiry regarding the data.  Additional attempts were made using new patient-derived samples; however, these results did not improve upon the existing ATP5⍺, (NDUS3)C-I30, and COX4 signals presented in the figure.  This is possibly due to the fact that CAT-tail modified mitochondrial proteins represent only a small fraction of the total proteins in these cells.  It is acknowledged that the small tails visible above the prominent main bands are not particularly distinct. To address this, the revised version includes updated images to better illustrate the differences. We believe the assertion that GBM/GSCs possess CAT-tailed proteins is substantiated by a combination of subsequent experimental findings. The figure (refer to new Fig. 1B) serves primarily as an introduction. It is important to note that the CAT-tailed ATP5⍺ plays a vital role in modulating mitochondrial potential and glioma phenotypes, a function which has been demonstrated through subsequent experiments.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that the CAT-tail modification is not exclusive to the ATP5⍺protein.  ATP5⍺ was selected as the primary focus of this study due to its prevalence in mitochondria and its specific involvement in cancer development, as noted by Chang YW et al.  Future research will explore the possibility of CAT tails on other mitochondrial ETC proteins. Currently, NDUS3 (C-I30), ATP5⍺, and COX4 serve as examples confirming the existence of these modifications. It remains challenging to detect endogenous CAT-tailing, and bulk proteomics is not yet feasible for this purpose. COX4 is considered significant.  We hypothesize that CAT-tailed COX4 may function similarly to the previously studied C-I30 (Wu Z, et al), potentially causing substantial mitochondrial proteostasis stress.</p>
<p>Concerning RQC proteins, our blotting analysis of GBM cell lines now includes additional RQC-related factors. The primary, more prominent bands (indicated by arrowheads) are, in our assessment, the intended bands for NEMF and ANKZF1.  Subsequent blotting analyses showed only single bands for both ANKZF1 and NEMF, respectively. The additional, larger molecular weight band of NEMF, which was initially considered for property analysis (phosphorylation, ubiquitination, etc.), was not examined further as it did not appear in subsequent experiments (refer to new Fig. S1C).</p>

<p>This is an excellent point, and we appreciate the question. We conducted staining for ATP5⍺ and key RQC proteins in both tumor and normal mouse tissues. Notably, ATP5⍺ in GBM exhibited a greater tendency to form clustered punctate patterns compared to normal brain tissue, and not all of it co-localized with the mitochondrial marker TOM20 (refer to new Fig. S3C-E). Crucially, we observed a significant increase in NEMF expression within mouse xenograft tumor tissues, alongside a decrease in ANKZF1 expression (refer to new Fig. S1A, B). These findings align with our observations in human samples.</p>

<p>(3) Please knock down ATP5 in the patient's cells and check whether both the upper band and lower band of ATP5 have disappeared or not.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This control was essential and has been executed now. To validate the antibody's specificity, siRNA knockdown was performed. The simultaneous elimination of both upper and lower bands upon siRNA treatment (refer to new Fig. S2A) confirms they represent genuine signals recognized by the antibody.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 1C and ID, add long exposure to spot aggregation and oligomer. Figure 1D, please add the blots where control and ATP5 are also shown in NHA and SF (similar to SVG and GSC827).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>New data are included in the revised manuscript to address the queries. Specifically, the new Fig 1D now displays the full queue as requested, featuring blots for Control, ATP5α, AT3, and AT20. Our analysis reveals that AT20 aggregates exhibit higher expression and accumulation rates in GSC and SF cells.</p>
<p>Fig. 1C has been updated to include experimental groups treated with cycloheximide and sgNEMF. Our results show that sgNEMF effectively inhibits CAT-tailing in GBM cell lines, whereas cycloheximide has no impact. After consulting with the Reporter's original creator and optimizing expression conditions, we observed no significant aggregates with β-globin-non-stop protein, potentially due to the length of endogenous CAT-tail formation (as noted by Inada, 2020, in <italic>Cell Reports</italic>). Our analysis focused on the ratio of CAT-tailed (red box blots) and non-CAT-tailed proteins (green box blots). Comparing these ratios revealed that both anisomycin treatment and sgNEMF effectively hinder the CAT-tailing process, while cycloheximide has no effect.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In Figure 1E, please double-check the results with the figure legend. ATP5A aggregated should be shown endogenously. The number of aggregates shown in the bar graph is not represented in micrographs. Please replace the images. For Figure 1E, to confirm the ATP5-specific aggregates, it would be better if the authors would show endogenous immunostaining of C-130 and Cox-IV.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Labels in Fig. 1E were corrected to reflect that the bar graph in Fig. 1F indicates the number of cells with aggregates, not the quantity of aggregates per cell. The presence of endogenous ATP5⍺ is accurately shown. To address the specificity of ATP5⍺, immunostaining for endogenous NUDS3 was conducted. This revealed NUDS3 aggregation in GBM cells (SF and GSC) lacking TOM20, as demonstrated in the new Fig. S3A, B. These findings suggest NUDS3 also undergoes CAT-tailing modification, similar to ATP5⍺.</p>

<p>(6) Figure 3A. Please add representative images in the anisomycin sections. It is difficult to address the difference.</p>

<p>We appreciate your feedback. Upon re-examining the Calcein fluorescence intensity data in Fig. 3A, we believe the images accurately represent the statistical variations presented in Fig. 3B. To address your concerns more effectively, please specify which signals in Fig. 3A you find potentially misleading. We are prepared to revise or substitute those images accordingly.</p>

<p>(7) Figure 3D. If NEMF is overexpressed, is the CAT-tailing of ATP 5 reversed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. Your prediction aligns with our findings. We've added data to the revised Fig. S6A, B, which demonstrates that both NEMF overexpression and ANKZF1 knockdown lead to elevated levels of CRC. This increase, however, was not statistically significant in GSC cells. A plausible explanation for this discrepancy is that the MPTP of GSC cells is already closed, thus any additional increase in CAT-tailing activity does not result in further amplification.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Figure 3G. Why on the BN page are AT20 aggregates not the same as shown in Figure 2E?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your inquiry regarding the ATP5⍺ blots, specifically those in the original Fig. 3G (left) and 2E (right). Careful observation of the ATP5⍺ band placement in these figures reveals a high degree of similarity. Notably, there are aggregates present at the top, and the diffuse signals extend downwards. Given that this is a gradient polyacrylamide native PAGE, the concentration diminishes towards the top. Consequently, the non-rigid nature of the Blue Native PAGE gel may lead to slight variations in the aggregate signals; however, the overall patterns are very much alike. To mitigate potential misinterpretations, we have rearranged the blot order in the new Fig. 3M.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Figure 4D. The amount of aggregation mediated by AT20 is more compared to AT3. Why are there no such drastic effects observed between AT3 and AT20 in the Tunnel assay?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The previous Figure 4D presents the quantification of cell migration from the experiment depicted in Figure 4C. But this is a good point. TUNEL staining results are directly influenced by mitochondrial membrane potential and the state of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTP), not by the degree of protein aggregation. Our previous experiments showed comparable effects of AT3 and AT20 on mitochondria (Fig. 2E, 3K), which aligns with the expected similar outcomes on TUNEL staining. As for its biological nature, this could be very complicated. We hope to explore it in future studies.</p>

<p>(10) Figure 5C: The role of NEMF and ANKZF1 can be further clarified by conducting Annexin-PI assays using FACS. The inclusion of these additional data points will provide more robust evidence for CAT-tailing's role in cancer cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response to your suggestion, we have incorporated additional data into the revised version.</p>
<p>Using the Annexin-PI kit, we labeled apoptotic cells and detected them using flow cytometry (FACS). Our findings indicate that anisomycin pretreatment, NEMF knockdown (sgNEMF), and ANZKF1 upregulation (oeANKZF1) significantly increase the rate of STS-induced apoptosis compared to the control group (refer to new Fig. S9D-G).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) Figure 5F: STS is a known apoptosis inhibitor. Why it is not showing PARP cleavage?</p>
<p>Also, cell death analysis would be more pronounced, if it could be shown at a later time point. What is the STS and Anisomycin at 24h or 48h time-point? Since PARP is cleaved, it would also be better if the authors could include caspase blots.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I guess what you meant to say here is &quot;Staurosporine is a protein kinase inhibitor that can induce apoptosis in multiple mammalian cell lines.&quot; Our study observed PARP cleavage even in GSCs, which are typically more resistant to staurosporine-induced apoptosis (C-PARP in Fig. S9B). The ratio of C-PARP to total PARP increased. We selected a 180-minute treatment duration because longer treatments with STS + anisomycin led to a late stage of apoptosis and non-specific protein degradation (e.g., at 24 or 48 hours), making PARP comparisons less meaningful. Following your suggestion, we also examined caspase 3/7 activity in GSC cells treated with DMSO, CHX, and anisomycin. We found that anisomycin treatment also activated caspases (Fig. S9A).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) In Figure 5, the addition of an explanation, how CAT-tailing can induce cell death, would add more information such as BAX-BCL2 ratio, and cytochrome-c release from the mitochondria.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. In this study, we state that specific CAT-tails inhibit GSC cell death/apoptosis rather than inducing it. Therefore, we do not expect that examining BAX-BCL2 and mitochondrial cytochrome c release would offer additional insights.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) To confirm the STS resistance, it would be better if the author could do the experiments in the STS-resistant cell line and then perform the Anisomycin experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. We should emphasize that our data primarily originates from GSC cells. These cells already exhibit STS-resistance when compared to the control cells (Fig. S8A-C).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(14) It would be more advantageous if the author could show ATP5 CATailed status under standard chemotherapy conditions in either cell lines or in vivo conditions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting question. It's worth exploring this question; however, GSC cells exhibit strong resistance to standard chemotherapy treatments like temozolomide (TMZ).</p>
<p>Additionally, we couldn't detect changes in CAT-tailed ATP5⍺ and thus did not include that data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(15) In vivo (cancer mouse model or cancer fly model) data will add more weight to the story.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your intriguing question. An effective approach would be to test the RQC pathway's function using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Notch overexpression-induced brain tumor model. However, Khaket et al. have conducted similar studies, stating, &quot;The RNAi of Clbn, VCP, and Listerin (Ltn), homologs of key components of the yeast RQC machinery, all attenuated NSC over-proliferation induced by Notch OE (Figs. 5A and S5A–D, G).&quot; This data supports our theory, and we have incorporated it into the Discussion. While the mouse model more closely resembles the clinical setting, it is not covered by our current IACUC proposal. We intend to verify this hypothesis in a future study.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Figure 1B, C: To demonstrate that Globin, ATP5alpha, and C-130 are CAT-tailed, it is necessary to show that the high mobility band disappears after NEMF deletion or mutagenesis of the NFACT domain of NEMF. This can be done in a cell line. The anisomycin experiment is not convincing because the intensity of the bands drops and because no control is done to show that the effects are not due to translation inhibition (e.g. cycloheximide, which inhibits translation but not CAT tailing). Establishing ATP5alpha as a bonafide RQC substrate and CAT-tailed protein is critical to the relevance of the rest of the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for suggesting this crucial control experiment.</p>
<p>To confirm the observed signal is indeed a bona fide CAT-tail, it's essential to demonstrate that NEMF is necessary for the CAT-tailing process. We have incorporated data from NEMF knockdown (<italic>sgNEMF</italic>) and cycloheximide treatment into the revised manuscript. Our findings show that both <italic>sgNEMF</italic> and anisomycin treatment effectively inhibit the formation of CAT-tailing signals on the reporter protein (Fig. 1C). Similarly, NEMF knockdown in a GSC cell line also effectively eliminated CAT-tails on overexpressed ATP5⍺ (Fig. S2B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In general, the text should be weakened to reflect that conclusions were largely gleaned from artificial CAT tails made of AT repeats rather than endogenously CAT-tailed ATP5alpha. CAT tails could have other sequences or be made of pure alanine, as has been suggested by some studies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your reminder. We have reviewed the recent studies by Khan et al. and Chang et al., and we found their analysis of CAT tail components to be highly insightful. We concur with your suggestion regarding the design of the CAT tail sequence. We aimed to design a tail that maintained stability and resisted rapid degradation, regardless of its length. In the revised version, we clarify that our conclusions are based on artificial CAT tails, specifically those composed of AT repeat sequences (p. 9). We acknowledge that the presence of other sequence components may lead to different outcomes (p. 19).</p>

<p>Throughout the work (e.g. 3B, C), anisomycin effects should be compared to those with cycloheximide to observe if the effects are specific to a CAT tail inhibitor rather than a translation inhibitor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that including cycloheximide control experiments is crucial. The revised version now incorporates new data, as depicted in Fig. S5A, B, illustrating alterations in the on/off state of MPTP following cycloheximide treatment. Furthermore, Fig. S6A, B present changes in Calcium Retention Capacity (CRC) under cycloheximide treatment. The consistency of results across these experiments, despite cycloheximide treatment, suggests that anisomycin's role is specifically as a CAT tail inhibitor, rather than a translation inhibitor.</p>

<p>Line 110, it is unclear what &quot;short-tailed ATP5&quot; is. Do you mean ATP5alpha-AT3? If so this needs to be introduced properly. Line 132: should say &quot;may indicate accumulation of CAT-tailed protein&quot; rather than &quot;imply&quot;.</p>

<p>In the revised Fig. 1D, molecular weight markers have been included to denote signal sizes. The aggregates in the previous Fig. 1C, also present in the control plasmid, are likely a result of signal overexposure.

<p>We appreciate your question and have thoroughly re-evaluated our conclusion. We offer several potential explanations for the data presented in Fig. 1D: (1) ATP5α-AT20 may demonstrate superior stability. (2) GSC (GBM) cells might lack adequate mechanisms to monitor protein accumulation. (3) GSC (GBM) cells could possess an increased adaptive capacity to the toxicity arising from protein accumulation. This discussion has been incorporated into the revised manuscript (lines 166-169).</p>

<p>Line 177: how do you know the endogenous ATP5alpha forms aggregates due to CAT-tailing? Need to measure in a NEMF hypomorph.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand your concern and have addressed it. Revised Fig. 3G, H demonstrates that a reduction in NEMF levels, achieved through sgNEMF in GSC cells, significantly diminishes ATP5α aggregation. This, in conjunction with the Anisomycin treatment data presented in revised Fig. 3E, F, confirms the substantial impact of the CAT-tailing process on this aggregation.</p>

<p>We sincerely appreciate your insightful comments. In response, the revised manuscript now incorporates control data for ATP5α featuring a poly-glycine-serine (GS) tail. This data is specifically presented in Figs. S2E-G, S4E, S7A, D, E, and S8F, G. Our experimental findings consistently demonstrate that the overexpression of ATP5α, when modified with GS tails, had no discernible impact on protein aggregation, mitochondrial membrane potential, GSC cell mobility, or any other indicators assessed in our study.</p>
