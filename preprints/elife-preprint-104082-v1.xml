<title>Abstract</title><p>Blood pressure variability (BPV) has emerged as a novel risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia, independent of alterations in average blood pressure (BP). However, the underlying consequences of large BP fluctuations on the neurovascular complex are unknown. We developed a novel mouse model of BPV in middle-aged mice based on intermittent Angiotensin II infusions. Using radio telemetry, we demonstrated that the 24-hr BP averages of these mice were similar to controls, indicating BPV without hypertension. Chronic (20-25 days) BPV led to a blunted bradycardic response and cognitive deficits. Two-photon imaging of parenchymal arterioles showed enhanced pressure-evoked constrictions (myogenic response) in BPV mice. Sensory stimulus-evoked dilations (neurovascular coupling) were greater at higher BP levels in control mice, but this pressure-dependence was lost in BPV mice. Our findings support the notion that large BP variations impair vascular function at the neurovascular complex and contribute to cognitive decline.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dementia, the 7<sup>th</sup> leading global cause of mortality, presents as the predominant neurodegenerative complication in the elderly population. Notably, hypertension emerges as a primary risk factor for dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Blood pressure (BP) regulation involves a complex interplay of central and peripheral mechanisms, finely attuned to acute and chronic stressors in maintaining physiological ranges. Perturbations in vascular function and structure (e.g., reactivity, vascular stiffness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>), alterations in baroreflex sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, and enhanced sympathetic activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> are recognized factors that disrupt BP balance. Blood pressure variability (BPV) (an index of BP <italic>fluctuation or variation</italic>), particularly in midlife, increases the risk for cognitive decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, end-organ damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and cardiovascular events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Increased BPV also serves as an early predictor of hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. BPV delineates fluctuations across various measurement periods—from very short-term (beat-to-beat) to long-term (months or years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>Given the evidence that elevated BPV can precede hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, a modifiable risk factor in the setting of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia; understanding the drivers and cellular targets of BPV is essential. Unlike hypertension, BP fluctuations often elude detection in screening practices conducted in clinical settings, which rely on singular or averaged BP measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The absence of a gold standard for BPV indexing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and limited insights into the magnitude and frequencies of impactful BP fluctuations in disease conditions further compound this issue. Additionally, the absence of suitable animal models has limited the understanding of how this overlooked variable may impact brain health. In this study, we sought to establish an innovative murine model of BPV and to interrogate the impact of large BP fluctuations on cardiovascular and neurovascular outcomes.</p>
<p>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is tightly regulated by diverse signaling processes, including the interaction of cellular elements comprising the neurovascular complex—endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, pericytes, astrocytes, neurons, and microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Mechanisms governing CBF operate under both steady-state conditions (e.g., cerebral autoregulation (CA), humoral processes, chemoregulation) and in response to local neuronal activity (e.g., neurovascular coupling (NVC))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Evidence suggests that sustained hypertension adversely affects the functional integrity of the neurovascular complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, compromises cerebral perfusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and contributes to cognitive decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. However, the impact of large BP fluctuations on steady-state or activity-evoked CBF changes remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>Chronic hypertension leads to adaptive processes (e.g., vascular remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>) and a rightward shift in the cerebral autoregulation (CA) curve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, heightening vulnerability to ischemia at low BP while shielding the brain from hyperperfusion at high pressure. In humans, hypertension and BPV have been associated with white matter hyperintensities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and microbleeds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, the impact of BPV (prior to hypertension onset) on cerebrovascular function and neurovascular outputs has received little attention.</p>
<p>Using an innovative murine model of BPV, in the absence of overt hypertension, combined with <italic>in vivo</italic> two-photon imaging, we show that chronic BP fluctuations lead to microvascular dysfunction (e.g., enhanced parenchymal arteriole myogenic responses) and a blunted NVC response. In addition, mice subjected to chronic BPV showed poor cognitive performance. These findings underscore the pivotal role of dysregulated BP events in brain health and function.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>All experiments were conducted in middle-aged (12-15 months old) male C57BL6 mice (Jackson Laboratories) following protocols approved by the animal care and use committee of Augusta University (AU). Before experimentation, animals were housed in a room maintained at 20-22°C with a 12hr:12hr light-dark cycle and given <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Craniotomy surgery for chronic window</title>
<p>Surgeries were conducted using the aseptic technique. Animals were injected with dexamethasone and meloxicam 2-4 hours before surgery to prevent edema and/or inflammation. General anesthesia was induced with isoflurane (2%) and following loss of reflex, hair was removed from the scalp and the mouse was transferred to a sterile field. A single injection of ketamine/dexdomitor (60 mg/kg/0.5mg/kg) was administered to maintain anesthesia in the sterile field. The scalp was scrubbed with betadine/alcohol (3 times each, alternating). A scalp incision was made (∼1 cm) and a small craniotomy opened over the visual cortex (1-2 mm). A small aluminum head holder (300 mg) was fixed to the skull using cyanoacrylate glue followed by dental cement. The bone flap was removed (∼3 mm diameter). A glass coverslip (3 mm) was glued to a 4 mm coverslip and placed into the craniotomy with the inner glass (3mm) touching the cortex. The edges of the coverslip were then sealed with cyanoacrylate glue followed by dental cement covering everything including the wound margins.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Telemetry and iPrecio pump implantation surgery</title>
<p>Following a 3-week recovery period after craniotomy surgery, mice were implanted with a programmable pump (iPrecio, SMP-310R) and a biotelemetry transmitter device (PA-C10, Data Science International). Mice underwent brief anesthesia in a small chamber using 5% isoflurane for induction, followed by maintenance of anesthesia via a nose mask with 1.5-2% isoflurane. The neck fur was carefully clipped on both the anterior and posterior sides. Subsequently, mice were placed in a sterile field in a ventrally recumbent position, and a 1.5 to 2 cm horizontal incision was made. The pump and biotelemetry transmitter device were then implanted subcutaneously. The pump catheter was trimmed to 0.5 cm for subcutaneous drug delivery, while the telemeter catheter was tunneled subcutaneously over the shoulder, with its tip positioned within the left carotid artery. Closure of incisions was performed using 5-0 sutures, after which the mice were gradually brought out of anesthesia. It is important to note that due to the complexity of the surgeries involved, mice used for behavioral studies were not implanted with a telemetry catheter or cranial window. However, these mice were individually housed to simulate the conditions of the telemetry cohort.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Blood pressure assessment and BPV induction</title>
<p>After recovery from surgery, mice were housed individually in standard mouse cages under the conditions described above and assigned to a control or experimental BPV group. During this recovery period (∼7 days), both groups were infused with saline to determine baseline cardiovascular parameters. Blood pressure signals encompassing mean arterial pressure (MAP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), and pulse pressure (PP) (determined from the difference between the SBP and DBP) were continuously sampled at 250 Hz for 10 seconds and collected every 30 seconds for 24 hours per day. Once a baseline MAP was established, the saline in the infusion pump (in the BPV group) was substituted with angiotensin II (Ang II, Sigma Aldrich, A9525) and administered intermittently at a calculated dose of 3.1 µg/hour (every 3-4 hours) for 25 days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Two-photon imaging</title>
<p>On the day of the two-photon imaging acquisition, a mouse was anesthetized with chlorprothixene (0.04 cc) and a low dose of isoflurane (≤0.8%); a protocol to mildly sedate mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. An intra-orbital injection of Texas red (5%, 40 µl) was administered to label blood vessels. The mouse was head-fixed and a picospritzer (positioned on the contralateral hemisphere intended for imaging) was used to deliver a puff of air for whisker stimulation (WS) at a rate of 10 Hz for 20 seconds repeated seven to eight times with ∼ 90-second delay between each WS during an imaging session. Imaging sessions were conducted 106 ± 3.6 µm below the brain’s surface while pump infusion was <italic>off</italic> (low BP period) and again during Ang II infusions (high BP period). Images were collected at a rate of 3.75 frames/second.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Behavioral studies</title>
<p>Behavioral tasks were performed by an experimenter at the AU small animal behavioral core (SABC), who was blinded to the experimental protocol. BPV mice were subjected to behavioral tests at two-time points. First during the saline infusion period (days 7-10), with observations considered as baseline, and second, 25-26 days post-Ang II infusions. About 30 minutes before training and testing, animals were brought to the testing room to acclimate. Animals remained in the laboratory for 15 minutes following study completion. To eliminate olfactory cues, animal droppings were removed, and the space and objects were cleaned (dilute 50% (vol/vol) ethanol solution) between sessions where appropriate.</p>
<sec id="s2f1">
<title>Novel object recognition (NOR) task</title>
<p>Animal behavior was assessed using the previously described NOR task procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Animals were acclimated and then familiarized with an opaque plastic chamber (78.7 cm x 39.4 cm x 31.7 cm) containing bedding for 10 minutes. The next day, a training session involved animals exploring two identical objects for 10 minutes before returning to their home cages. Object recognition was assessed one hour later by placing an animal in the NOR apparatus with a familiar object and a new or novel object for 10 minutes. The objects’ positions and roles (familiar or novel) were randomly assigned. Objects were positioned about 40 cm apart, 19.3 cm from the two short walls and 19.3 cm from the two long walls of the chamber. Exploration of an object was defined as direct interaction with nostrils or head position towards the object at a distance ≤ 2 cm. For data inclusion, a mouse had to explore an object for at least 4 seconds and spend a minimum of 10 seconds of total object exploration. Recognition index was calculated using the formula: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="619509v1_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. The discrimination index was calculated as: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="619509v1_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. The cohort’s recognition capacity was accessed prior to testing at one, four, and 24-hour delaysThe one-hour delay for testing was determined based on earlier NOR tests assessing the cohort’s recognition capacity at one, four, and 24-hour delays. The animals exhibited normal recognition capacity with a one-hour delay but failed at 4- and 24-hour delays. Hence, the one-hour delay was selected for subsequent tests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f2">
<title>Y-maze</title>
<p>Y-maze tasks were performed twenty-four hours after NOR tasks. The Y-maze consisted of three arms (35.4 cm long, 9.9 cm wide with a height of 13.8 cm). Spontaneous alternation behavior was assessed by randomly placing mice in one of the three arms and allowed to explore for 10 minutes. Arm entries were visually scored into a series where a triplet set of arm entries constituted an alternation. An alternation was defined as successive consecutive entries into three different arms, and maximum alternations as the total number of arm entries minus 2. Percent alternation was calculated as the proportion of true alternations out of maximum alternations (# of true alternations/# of maximum alternations) x 100).</p>

<sec id="s2g">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Two-day averaged values of 24-hour or 12-hour (active and inactive period) BP variables were compared to a baseline phase corresponding to saline infusion (∼ 5 days). BPV was calculated using the average real variability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="619509v1_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> where K is the order of measurements and n denotes the number of BP readings. Absolute BP values were extracted every 15 minutes and averaged for the hour. The coefficient of variation (CV) was also used to calculate BPV. CV was calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation of hourly BP averages to the 24-hour BP average <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="619509v1_inline4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Similar to BP variables, two-day averages of 24-hour and 12-hour ARV and CV were compared to the average value of the last 5 days during the baseline phase. The bradycardic gain was calculated using (Bradycardic Gain = (HR at high BP – HR at low BP)/(SBP at high BP – SBP at low BP)). Parenchymal arteriole diameter responses to changes in MAP (myogenic responses) and whisker stimulation (WS) were analyzed using MatLab and ImageJ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. A linear regression was determined from the relationship between the MAP and arteriole diameter changes to evaluate myogenic responses. For neurovascular coupling experiments, the baseline was defined as 30 frames before stimulus onset. The stimulus-response comprised 100 frames encompassing the 20-second stimulus and the first 6 seconds post-stimulus. Six to eight WS events were averaged for each run and responses were normalized to the baseline average.</p>

<title>Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>We observed unexplained random transient dilatory events during two-photon imaging sessions, <bold>Supplemental Figure 1 B, D.</bold> These events occurred in control and BPV mice during low and high BP periods. Because these random dilations have been observed in other mouse strains using comparable <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging settings, they may be attributed to the sedative. To isolate pressure-evoked parenchymal arteriole changes (myogenic studies <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), random dilatory events corresponding to baseline tone were removed from the analysis, <bold>Supplemental Figure 1</bold>.</p>
<p>GraphPad Prism 10 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) was used for all statistical analyses. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E.M. A minimum of three mice was used for each experimental data set, and the specific sample size (n) is defined in figure legends. Data was tested for normal distribution, and statistical tests were used accordingly. Differences between two means within groups were determined using paired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test. Differences between groups were determined using Student’s unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, one- or two-way ANOVA with corresponding multiple comparison <italic>post hoc</italic> test specified in figure legends.

<title>Pulsatile Ang II infusion-induced changes in blood pressure</title>
<p>We developed a novel murine model of high BPV using the experimental design shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. The protocol consisted of a baseline phase (∼5 days), corresponding to saline infusions in all mice, followed by a treatment phase (∼20-25 days), where mice were either left on saline (control group) or subjected to robust BP transients induced via Ang II infusions (BPV group). Subcutaneous pumps were programmed to infuse 2 µL 6-8 times per day, with infusion periods corresponding to 1 hour every 3-4 hours (depending on the number of pulses), <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, right panel. During the pump-<italic>off</italic> periods, BP corresponded to 97±2.0 mmHg and 91±1.9 mmHg for MAP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), 113±2.6 mmHg and 105±2.6 mmHg for SBP, 80±1.7 mmHg and 78±1.7 mmHg for DBP, and 34±1.3 mmHg and 27±1.8 mmHg for PP, for mice with pumps infusing saline vs. Ang II, respectively, <bold>Supplemental Figure 2A.</bold> During the pump-<italic>on</italic> period, saline infusion did not change BP. However, Ang II infusions evoked significant BP transients corresponding to Δ37±3.9 mmHg (P&lt;0.0001) for MAP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), Δ70±3.0 mmHg (P&lt;0.0001) for SBP, Δ29±4.1 mmHg (P&lt;0.0001) for DBP, and Δ28±3.0 mmHg (P&lt;0.0001) for PP, <bold>Supplemental Figure 2A</bold>. Despite robust BP transients, 20 days of treatment minimally affected the 24-hour averages (vs Baseline) in all cardiovascular variables, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref><bold> &amp; Supplemental Figure 2B</bold>.

While the SBP in BPV mice significantly increased Δ9±2.9 mmHg (P=0.0088), mice remained within the lower range of high BP (131±4.4 mmHg).

<p>Blood pressure presents a circadian rhythm. Thus, cardiovascular variables were assessed during the active (dark) and inactive (light) periods of the mouse 12:12 hr cycle. Similar to the unchanged 24-hour average for MAP, there were minimal changes in the averaged BP corresponding to the daily inactive and active periods for control and BPV mice, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-D</xref>. Compared to controls, the DBP of the BPV group tended to be lower but not significant, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>. Starting on day 7 of treatment, BPV (vs control) mice had significantly higher PP during the inactive period, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>.

<title>Pulsatile Ang II infusion induced high BPV</title>
<p>Having achieved minimal changes in the 24-hour averaged MAP, yet with prominent BP fluctuations, we quantified blood pressure variability (BPV) over time. Two indices of BPV were used: the average real variability (ARV), defined as the absolute difference between consecutive BP measurements, and the coefficient of variation (CV), defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to mean BP. A significant increase in BPV was observed over time in the BPV group compared to baseline, without any differences in normal 24-hour BP averages. During the active period, ARV was significantly increased by day 3 and persisted through the protocol with 16.4 ± 0.66 mmHg (P=0.04) for SBP and 8.12 ± 0.71 mmHg (P=0.04) for PP, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1A</xref>.

<p>To determine the impact of acute BP changes on the microcirculation, we simultaneously tracked parenchymal arteriole diameter changes before pump infusion onset (Low BP), and during Ang II infusions (High BP), <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>. For these experiments, the pump reservoir for the control group was switched from saline to Ang II. Imaging was conducted at similar cortical depths (∼ layer 1-2 border of the somatosensory cortex) corresponding to 106±9.6 µm and 102±4.3 µm for control and BPV mice, respectively, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>. Arteriole diameters measured at baseline (Low BP) were comparable between groups, corresponding to 20±1.3 µm and 19±1.0 µm for controls and BPV mice, respectively, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>. Upon mild sedation resting BP dropped by -23±3.6 mmHg and - 31±4.4 mmHg for the control and BPV group, respectively (not shown). However, BP values remained within the putative cerebral autoregulation plateau range throughout two-photon imaging sessions and were comparable between groups. During the pump infusion period (High BP), the BP increased from 72±3.6 to 103±4.7 mmHg for controls (P&lt;0.0001) and from 60±4.4 to 96±6.4 mmHg for BPV mice (P&lt;0.0001), <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>.</p>
<p>To quantify <italic>in vivo</italic> pressure-evoked diameter changes (myogenic constrictions), we compared the slopes extracted from the linear regression corresponding to the MAP vs parenchymal arteriole diameter measured throughout the acquisition session, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-G</xref>. As determined by a steeper negative slope, the reactivity of parenchymal arterioles to BP increases in BPV mice (vs control) was significantly larger (P=0.0118), <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>. However, because under sedation, BPV mice showed lower baseline BP, albeit not significant (P=0.18, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), we considered if differences in the pressure ranged (i.e. change in pressure between low and high BP intervals) might explain the steeper slopes found in BPV mice. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref> shows the relationship between the lowest BP measured during the acquisition period and the derived slope from the MAP-diameter linear regression analysis.

We determined the pressure-diameter relationship of the whole cohort of mice. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>, parenchymal arterioles from control and BPV mice showed significant increases in tone (P&lt;0.0001) with increasing pressures from ∼50 to 125 mmHg. When we compared the slopes of the segmented regression lines to apparent lower and higher limits of autoregulation and the plateau range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, our data supports a significant decrease in arteriole diameter (P&lt;0.0015) in control mice at pressures &lt;50 mmHg (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>). At a putative CA plateau range for these arterioles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> 51-100 mmHg both groups showed significant constrictions (P&lt;0.001 for controls and P&lt;0.0001 for BPV arterioles) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4L</xref>), with steeper slopes for the BPV group (P&lt;0.05).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>BPV has emerged as a risk factor for cognitive decline, but its impact on brain function remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce a novel murine model of BPV using pulsatile BP increases induced via Ang II infusions without hypertension. Using <italic>in vivo</italic> two-photon imaging, we provide evidence of altered vascular function in mice subjected to chronic BP fluctuations. In BPV mice, parenchymal arterioles of &lt;30 μm showed enhanced myogenic constrictions. In addition, chronic BPV impaired neurovascular outputs and cognitive function. Notably, the NVC response in control mice was pressure-dependent, with greater magnitudes when the arterial BP was increased. This pressure-dependent effect was lost in mice subjected to chronic BPV. These data support the notion that chronic BPV targets a broad range of physiological processes (e.g., bradycardic reflex, myogenic reactivity, neurovascular coupling) and is a critical risk factor for brain health.</p>
<p>Our model emphasizes the importance of BPV assessment regardless of averaged BP values. Retrospective studies in primary care patients reveal BPV occurrences in both hypertensive and non-hypertensive adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, placing BPV as a critical modifiable risk factor, often overlooked by standard in-office single BP measurements. The significantly higher 24-hour averaged PP in the BPV group (<bold>Supplemental Figure 2B</bold>) makes PP the most sensitive BP-related variable in our model. The BPV group (vs controls) showed sustained lower DBP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) and higher PP during the inactive period (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), suggestive of a compensatory mechanism, which maintained the 24-hour MAP within physiological values. However, other factors preventing the onset of hypertension cannot be ruled out. To this end, experiments from control vs experimental mice were not equally conducted in the same season raising the possibility for a seasonal effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The autonomic nervous system (ANS) tightly regulates BP via changes in heart rate, systemic vascular resistance, and stroke volume. Notably, the baroreflex maintains cerebral perfusion pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Acute increases in BP, causes arterial baroreceptors to inhibit sympathetic outflow and (via enhanced vagal activity) decrease HR and peripheral vascular resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, consequently decreasing arterial BP. However, to maintain CBF relatively constant, baroreflex-mediated inhibition of sympathetic outflow and arteriole dilation is countered by the intrinsic properties of the cerebral vasculature, which constricts in response to increases in arterial BP. Dysregulation of these dynamic processes can put the brain at risk for both hypoperfusion and hyperperfusion. Impaired baroreflex sensitivity correlates with aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and mild cognitive impairments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. In our model, chronic BPV significantly blunted the baroreflex response, suggestive of ANS dysregulation. Previous reports have shown that chronic Ang II infusion suppresses and resets baroreceptor sensitivity independently of the pressure effect, but the resetting partially reverses within 30 minutes post-Ang II infusions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. In contrast to commonly used approaches of sustained Ang II infusion (osmotic pump models), our protocol delivers Ang II intermittently at 3- or 4-hour intervals. Thus, we speculate that this interval prevents desensitization or Ang II receptor internalization, another well-established phenomenon arising from sustained infusions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. In addition, the same Ang II dose evoked comparable BP increases at the start and end of the treatment regimen. The lack of differences in the bradycardic gain during the active period may be attributed to activity-mediated HR increases. Thus, our results support diminished baroreflex responses, which aligns with previous reports showing an association between high BPV and autonomic dysregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. The cellular mechanisms and targets are, however, poorly understood.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, cerebral autoregulation protects against fluctuations in cerebral perfusion pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. It is expected that vessels upstream from cerebral capillaries (e.g., small pial arterioles and arterioles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, larger vessels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>) buffer arterial pressure changes, sparing the brain from large CBF variations. Here, we show <italic>in vivo</italic> myogenic responses of parenchymal arterioles deep into the brain. Notably, responses were enhanced in the BPV group. While <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies have confirmed prominent myogenic responses in parenchymal arterioles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, chronic BPV-evoked changes to the reactivity of parenchymal arterioles to pressure suggest dominance of vasoconstrictive mechanisms driving smooth muscle cells to a more depolarized state (e.g., increased expression of voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) or decreased K<sup>+</sup> currents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>) or vascular remodeling in upstream vessels reducing pressure-buffering mechanisms to the microcirculation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Cipolla et al., showed that compared to middle cerebral arteries, parenchymal arterioles were 30-fold more sensitive to the VDCC blocker nifedipine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Importantly, the expression of VDCCs increases in hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> and long-acting calcium channel blockers (i.e., amlodipine), are among effective treatments for BPV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. A limitation of our study was that under the same experimental conditions, mild sedation induced a lower baseline BP (pumps <italic>off</italic>) in BPV mice compared to controls. Because the peak BP during the infusion period was comparable between groups, the lower BP baseline broadens the range used to determine the slope of the myogenic response. To address this limitation, we compared the pressure-arteriole diameter change of the mice cohort. Here, we observed notable differences in the shape of the curve supporting enhanced myogenic constrictions at comparable pressure ranges. In addition, we observed a shift in the plateau phase with prominent dilations occurring at pressures &gt;100 mmHg where control mice arterioles still held tone. This data supports variations in the cerebral autoregulation curve of BVP mice, which may compromise perfusion. Future studies addressing the impact of BPV on capillary perfusion or red blood cell velocity may better explain the link between BPV and brain pathology, such as microbleeds.</p>
<p>Chronic BPV significantly blunted the NVC response to whisker stimulation. Notably, control mice showed a pressure-dependent effect in the magnitude of the NVC response, which was abrogated in BPV mice. One possible explanation is that the greater NVC response in control mice arises from higher arteriole tone and a more efficient dilatory response to vasoactive signals released during the stimulus. On the other hand, the observation that arterioles from BVP mice, when subjected to higher pressures, showed faster recovery in diameter post-stimulus is also suggestive of a dominant vasoconstrictive state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Another possibility is that the blunted NVC response is of neuronal origin, such as a decreased in activity or in the release of vasodilatory signals. It would be important to assess the impact of high BPV on the neurovascular complex under awake conditions, with the caveat that activity and arousal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, among other factors, can increase BP and thus interfere with the pressure-dependence effect of neurovascular outputs.</p>
<p>Along with a blunted NVC response, our study shows that chronic BPV leads to cognitive decline as measured by a decrease in the recognition index in the NOR test. While no differences were observed in Y-maze alternations, these could be attributed to the age of the mice (14 months-old) which may already exhibit cognitive deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. These were evident when assessing the time-delay between the A-A and A-B trials in the NOR test, which lead us to use a shorter time window between testing.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In conclusion, our study reveals that high BPV disrupts cellular communication at the neurovascular complex, contributing to cognitive decline. Notably, our model achieved large BP fluctuations while preventing the onset of hypertension, providing evidence for the causal role of high BPV on poor neurovascular outputs. These findings advocate for including BPV assessment as a critical screening and diagnostic tool alongside standard average BP measurements, addressing cardiovascular and neurovascular risks. The adaptable model developed in this study holds promise for investigating the impact of BPV on brain function.</p>

<p>This study examined the effect of blood pressure variability on brain microvascular function and cognitive performance. By implementing a model of blood pressure variability using an intermittent infusion of AngII for 25 days, the authors examined different cardiovascular variables, cerebral blood flow, and cognitive function during midlife (12-15-month-old mice). Key findings from this study demonstrate that blood pressure variability impairs baroreceptor reflex and impairs myogenic tone in brain arterioles, particularly at higher blood pressure. They also provide evidence that blood pressure variability blunts functional hyperemia and impairs cognitive function and activity. Simultaneous monitoring of cardiovascular parameters, in vivo imaging recordings, and the combination of physiological and behavioral studies reflect rigor in addressing the hypothesis. The experiments are well-designed, and the data generated are clear. I list below a number of suggestions to enhance this important work:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 1B: It is surprising that the BP circadian rhythm is not distinguishable in either group. Figure 2, however, shows differences in circadian rhythm at different timepoints during infusion. Could the authors explain the lack of circadian effect in the 24-h traces?</p>
<p>(2) While saline infusion does not result in elevation of BP when compared to Ang II, there is an evident &quot;and huge&quot; BP variability in the saline group, at least 40mmHg within 1 hour. This is a significant physiological effect to take into consideration, and therefore it warrants discussion.</p>
<p>(3) The decrease in DBP in the BPV group is very interesting. It is known that chronic Ang II increases cardiac hypertrophy, are there any changes to heart morphology, mass, and/or function during BPV? Can the the decrease in DBP in BPV be attributed to preload dysfunction? This observation should be discussed.</p>
<p>(4) Examining the baroreceptor reflex during the early and late phases of BPV is quite compelling. Figures 3D and 3E clearly delineate the differences between the two phases. For clarity, I would recommend plotting the data as is shown in panels D and E, rather than showing the mathematical ratio. Alternatively, plotting the correlation of ∆HR to ∆SBP and analyzing the slopes might be more digestible to the reader. The impairment in baroreceptor reflex in the BPV during high BP is clear, is there any indication whether this response might be due to loss of sympathetic or gain of parasympathetic response based on the model used?</p>
<p>(5) Figure 3B shows a drop in HR when the pump is ON irrespective of treatment (i.e., independent of BP changes). What is the underlying mechanism?</p>
<p>(6) The correlation of ∆diameter vs MAP during low and high BP is compelling, and the shift in the cerebral autoregulation curve is also a good observation. I would strongly recommend that the authors include a schematic showing the working hypothesis that depicts the shift of the curve during BPV.</p>
<p>(7) Functional hyperemia impairment in the BPV group is clear and well-described. Pairing this response with the kinetics of the recovery phase is an interesting observation. I suggest elaborating on why BPV group exerts lower responses and how this links to the rapid decline during recovery.</p>
<p>(8) The experimental design for the cognitive/behavioral assessment is clear and it is a reasonable experiment based on previous results. However, the discussion associated with these results falls short. I recommend that the authors describe the rationale to assess recognition memory, short-term spatial memory, and mice activity, and explain why these outcomes are relevant in the BPV context. Are there other studies that support these findings? The authors discussed that no changes in alternation might be due to the age of the mice, which could already exhibit cognitive deficits. In this line of thought, what is the primary contributor to behavioral impairment? I think that this sentence weakens the conclusion on BPV impairing cognitive function and might even imply that age per se might be the factor that modulates the various physiological outcomes observed here. I recommend clarifying this section in the discussion.</p>
<p>(9) Why were only male mice used?</p>
<p>(10) In the results for Figure 3: &quot;Ang II evoked significant increases in SBP in both control and BPV groups;...&quot;. Also, in the figure legend: &quot;B. Five-minute average HR when the pump is OFF or ON (infusing Ang II) for control and BPV groups....&quot; The authors should clarify this as the methods do not state a control group that receives Ang II.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Blood pressure variability has been identified as an important risk factor for dementia. However, there are no established animal models to study the molecular mechanisms of increased blood pressure variability. In this manuscript, the authors present a novel mouse model of elevated BPV produced by pulsatile infusions of high-dose angiotensin II (3.1ug/hour) in middle-aged male mice. Using elegant methodology, including direct blood pressure measurement by telemetry, programmable infusion pumps, in vivo two-photon microscopy, and neurobehavioral tests, the authors show that this BPV model resulted in a blunted bradycardic response and cognitive deficits, enhanced myogenic response in parenchymal arterioles, and a loss of the pressure-evoked increase in functional hyperemia to whisker stimulation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>As the presentation of the first model of increased blood pressure variability, this manuscript establishes a method for assessing molecular mechanisms. The state-of-the-art methodology and robust data analysis provide convincing evidence that increased blood pressure variability impacts brain health.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One major drawback is that there is no comparison with another pressor agent (such as phenylephrine); therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether the observed effects are a result of increased blood pressure variability or caused by direct actions of Ang II. Ang II is known to have direct actions on cerebrovascular reactivity, neuronal function, and learning and memory. Given that Ang II is increased in only 15% of human hypertensive patients (and an even lower percentage of non-hypertensive), the clinical relevance is diminished. Nonetheless, this is an important study establishing the first mouse model of increased BPV.</p>
