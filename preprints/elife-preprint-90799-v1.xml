<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Synaptic vesicles dock and fuse at the presynaptic active zone (AZ), the specialized site for transmitter release. AZ proteins play multiple roles such as recruitment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels as well as synaptic vesicle docking, priming and fusion. However, the precise role of each AZ protein type remains unknown. At phasic synapses having high release probability, Rab3-interacting molecule-binding protein2 (RIM-BP2) is known to affect Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel localization at AZs. In order to dissect the role of RIM-BP2 at tonic synapses having low release probability, we applied electrophysiological recording and super-resolution imaging to hippocampal mossy fiber terminals of RIM-BP2 KO mice. By using whole cell capacitance measurements, we found that reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were responsible for the decreased rates of transmitter release in RIM-BP2 KO terminals. Consistently, STED microscopy pictured lower densities of P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at AZs deficient in RIM-BP2. Our results suggest that the RIM-BP2 function differs between phasic and tonic synapses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>At chemical synapses, an action potential arriving at the presynaptic terminal opens voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels triggers neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles within ms. Synaptic vesicle fusion occurs at a specialized region of the presynaptic membrane called the active zone (AZ), where Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters and vesicle fusion sites are accommodated via AZ scaffold proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Südhof, 2012</xref>). For rapid transmission, accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, co-localization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and fusion sites, and molecular priming of synaptic vesicles for fusion are required, and the differences between these factors might provide a basis for synaptic diversity. However, it remains unknown how these factors are regulated by AZ-scaffold proteins.</p>
<p>Rab3-interacting molecule-binding proteins (RIM-BPs) represent one principal, conserved family of AZ proteins and bind to RIMs and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hibino et al., 2002</xref>). RIM-BP family includes RIM-BP1, RIM-BP2, and RIM-BP3 in mammals, but RIM-BP3 expression is low in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Mittelstaedt and Schoch, 2007</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), loss of RIM-BPs decreases Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel density and reduces release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, RIM-BP here is necessary for tight coupling of synaptic vesicles to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and replenishment of high release probability vesicles at <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Müller et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Petzoldt et al., 2020</xref>). In mammalian synapses, the observations from KO mice are diverse. In RIM-BP1,2 DKO mice, the coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles became loose, and action potential-evoked neurotransmitter release was reduced at the calyx of Held synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Acuna et al., 2015</xref>). At hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses, RIM-BP2 deletion alters Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel localization at the AZs without altering total Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Besides, RIM-BP1,2 DKO has no additional effect, indicating that RIM-BP2 dominates the function of RIM-BP isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Grauel et al., 2016</xref>). Tight coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and vesicles is crucial for rapid and efficient transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wadel et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synapses are characterized by low release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</xref>). At hippocampal mossy fiber synapses, gSTED imaging suggested that RIM-BP2 KO altered the Munc13-1 cluster number and distribution. In addition, RIM-BP2 deletion decreased the number of docked vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brockmann et al., 2019</xref>). However, because of technically difficulty, direct and quantitative measurements of exocytosis in RIM-BP2 KO terminals have not been performed so far.</p>
<p>To quantify the RIM-BP2 function in mossy fiber-CA3 synapses, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from WT and RIM-BP2 KO hippocampal mossy fiber boutons. We measured the size of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of vesicle fusion, and the sensitivity of release to an intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer. From electrophysiological recordings, we show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes are reduced in RIM-BP2 KO terminals, and that the reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents is the dominant factor for that of transmitter release. Using STED imaging, we find the densities of P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in terminals to be reduced in RIM-BP2 KO. We suggest that RIM-BP2 regulates the number of P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the AZ and is critical for rapid transmitter release at hippocampal mossy fiber terminals.</p>

<title>RIM-BP2 KO reduces synaptic vesicle release and calcium currents at hippocampal mossy fiber boutons</title>
<p>To investigate the roles of RIM-BP2 in synaptic transmission, we examined the kinetics of exocytosis and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in WT and RIM-BP2 KO synapses. We applied whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and capacitance measurements to hippocampal mossy fiber terminals in acute slices from WT and RIM-BP2 KO mice, in order to measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and exocytosis directly. The patch pipette contained Cs<sup>+</sup>-based internal solution and 0.5 mM EGTA to isolate Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Midorikawa and Sakaba, 2017</xref>). The external solution contained 1 μM TTX to block Na<sup>+</sup> currents. Membrane capacitance was measured by applying a sinusoidal wave (1000 Hz, ±30 mV in amplitudes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Lindau and Neher, 1988</xref>). When the terminal was depolarized from −80 mV to +10 mV for 10 ms, Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and membrane capacitance were recorded as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>. During the depolarizing pulse, capacitance was not measured due to large conductance changes, and the increase was used for measuring synaptic vesicle exocytosis. To determine the size of the RRP and the time course of exocytosis, we measured capacitance changes (ΔC<sub>m</sub>) in response to various durations of depolarization. Here, the length of the depolarizing pulse was varied between 5 ms and 100 ms, and ΔC<sub>m</sub> plotted against pulse duration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, bottom). ΔC<sub>m</sub> in response to a 10 ms pulse was reduced in RIM-BP2 KOs (p = 0.0499). ΔC<sub>m</sub> became larger as the duration of pulse was prolonged, but the increase started to be saturated at a 100 ms pulse in WT terminals, suggesting depletion of the RRP. ΔC<sub>m</sub> in response to a 100 ms pulse was 52 ± 9.1 fF (n = 8). The amplitude corresponds to the fusion of about 500-600 synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hallermann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Midorikawa and Sakaba, 2017</xref>). The time course of ΔC<sub>m</sub> could be fitted by a single exponential with a time constant of 58 ± 11 ms. In RIM-BP2 KO terminals, ΔC<sub>m</sub> in response to a 100 ms pulse was smaller (41 ± 5.9 fF, n = 8) than that of WT terminals, and the release time constant was slower (64 ± 14 ms) than in WT terminals. We should note that the time constant is not necessarily reliable because the ΔC<sub>m</sub> values do not reach a plateau value at 100 ms pulse in some terminals. The amplitudes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were smaller in RIM-BP2 KO terminals as compared to WT terminals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, top). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> current in response to a 100 ms pulse was reduced by ∼ 30% in RIM-BP2 KO terminals (27 ± 3.9 pA, n = 8) compared to WT terminals (41 ± 4.3 pA, n = 8) (p = 0.0379). Thus, the results show that RIM-BP2 deletion reduces both neurotransmitter release and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.</p>

<p>To investigate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in more detail, we examined the voltage dependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents. Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were recorded in the presence of 1 μM TTX, a Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker, and 10 mM TEA, a K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> shows voltage step protocols and representative current traces. Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were elicited by 5 ms depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of −80 mV to various potentials to obtain I-V relationships. In both genotypes, Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents started to be activated at around −20 mV, and maximal amplitude was observed at ∼ +10 mV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). There was no major difference in the voltage dependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents between WT and RIM-BP2 KO mice. Consistently, activation time constants of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were similar between WT and RIM-BP2 KO, when the terminal was depolarized to +10 mV (τ = 1.4 ± 0.2 ms in WT, n = 6; τ = 1.3 ± 0.2 ms in KO, n = 4). These results suggest a reduction in the number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels rather than changes in activation kinetics is responsible for the current decrease observed.</p>

<title>High extracellular calcium concentration rescues the decrease of synaptic vesicle release in RIM-BP2 KO</title>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx controls exocytosis by regulating vesicular release probability and/or the RRP size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Katz, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Thanawala and Regehr, 2013</xref>). Because Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were reduced in RIM-BP2 KO mice, we tested whether the reduction of release in RIM-BP2 KO mice could be explained by that of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx or impaired synaptic vesicle docking / priming (Brockmann et al., 2017). To increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, we raised the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>) from 2 mM to 4 mM. Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and membrane capacitances were recorded at 4 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>, and amplitudes then plotted against pulse duration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Although Ca<sup>2+</sup> current elicited by a 100 ms pulse in RIM-BP2 KO was still smaller (33 ± 2.7 pA, n = 3) than that in WT (47 ± 6.6 pA, n = 4) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, top), elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in both WT and RIM-BP2 KO mice. At 4 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>, ΔC<sub>m</sub> in response to a 100 ms pulse in RIM-BP2 KO was larger (51 ± 11 fF, n = 3) than at 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>, and indeed showed a similar value in WT at 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, bottom). At the same time, ΔC<sub>m</sub> in WT was not altered (53 ± 3.2 fF, n = 4) when higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>, suggesting that the RRP in WT was already depleted at 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>. Also, the time course of exocytosis at 4 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> was similar to that of WT at 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>, as the time courses were superimposable in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>. These results suggest that a decrease in neurotransmitter release in RIM-BP2 KO could be rescued by an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, easiest explained by a reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel number.</p>

<title>Decreased Calcium currents are mainly responsible for reduced release in RIM-BP2 KO</title>
<p>In order to further address whether the reduction of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx observed was responsible for the compromised release of RIM-BP2 KO mice, we adjusted Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes of WT to that of RIM-BP2 KO by lowering [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>. The amplitudes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and capacitance jumps were plotted against pulse duration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). At 1 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and ΔC<sub>m</sub> were smaller than those of RIM-BP2 KO at 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>. At 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents became comparable to those of RIM-BP2 KO at 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>. Here, the ΔC<sub>m</sub> evoked by a 100 ms pulse (43 ± 6.7 fF, n = 5) was comparable between WT and RIM-BP2 KO (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). The average time course of capacitance increase of WT at 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> was similar to that of RIM-BP2 KO at 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>. Therefore, by reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, WT data could reproduce the release time course of RIM-BP2 KO. In <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, ΔC<sub>m</sub> in response to a 100 ms pulse at various [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>s were plotted against the peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes. The relationship could be fitted by a Hill plot with n = 3 in WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Schneggenburger et al., 1999</xref>). Consistently, when capacitance jumps elicited by various pulse durations are plotted against total Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (Fig. S1), the RIM-BP2 KO data were superimposed on the WT data, indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity for release was not altered and that the reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents determine the reduced release in RIM-BP2 KO. In <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, relative amplitudes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and capacitance in response to a 100 ms pulse are plotted. The RIM-BP2 KO data were superimposed on the WT data. These results confirmed that synaptic vesicles have similar sensitivity to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in both genotypes.</p>

When the physical coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles is tight, EGTA (slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator) has less effect on release probability, but EGTA is effective when the coupling is loose. Previous experiments have suggested that RIM-BPs regulate the channel-vesicle coupling at the calyx of Held (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Acuna et al., 2015</xref>). If this observation also applies to the mossy fiber synapse, EGTA sensitivity of release should be higher in RIM-BP2 KO terminals. To investigate the coupling at mossy fiber boutons in RIM-BP2 KO, we changed the concentration of EGTA in the patch pipette. In the presence of 5 mM EGTA, we depolarized the terminal from −80 mV to +10 mV for 5 ms and recorded Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and membrane capacitance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and ΔC<sub>m</sub> were plotted against pulse duration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In both WT and RIM-BP2 KO mice, ΔC<sub>m</sub> were reduced under 5 mM EGTA compared with the control condition of 0.5 mM EGTA. We compared the effect of EGTA on average amplitudes of peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in response to a 20 ms pulse (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Interestingly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes were ∼ 1.5 times larger at 5 mM EGTA (53 ± 12 pA, n = 5) than at 0.5 mM EGTA (39 ± 3.7 pA, n = 8) in WT, though the data scattered under 5 mM EGTA condition and there was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.524). In RIM-BP2 KO, we did not observe such an increase. EGTA might inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation in WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">von Gersdorff and Matthews, 1996</xref>). In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, we compared the effect of EGTA on the ΔC<sub>m</sub> in response to a 20 ms pulse. In both genotypes, ΔC<sub>m</sub> values were inhibited by 5 mM EGTA, and the inhibition was larger in RIM-BP2 KO.</p>

<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes in RIM-B2 KO are smaller than in WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). It is possible that strong effect of high EGTA on release maybe due to reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in RIM-BP2 KO. Therefore, we changed [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> from 2 mM to 1 mM and adjusted Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes of WT to the RIM-BP2 KO level. The capacitance increase and the amplitudes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents became similar to those of RIM-BP2 KO (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). These results indicate that WT and RIM-BP2 KO terminals have similar sensitivity of neurotransmitter release to EGTA. Thus, it is unlikely that changes in the coupling distance are responsible for the reduced exocytosis of the mutants.</p>

<title>STED microscopy reveals that RIM-BP2 KO reduces the density of P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels</title>
<p>Our electrophysiological data suggest that RIM-BP2 may regulate the density of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, or possibly Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel properties. In order to directly study the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel density at the AZ, we performed STED microscopy analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in WT and RIM-BP2 KO hippocampal mossy fiber terminals. We here focused on P/Q-type and N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels because both Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel types are relevant for transmitter release at this synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Castillo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Pelkey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Li et al., 2007</xref>). We performed immunohistochemistry on thin brain cryosections from WT and RIM-BP2 KO mice. STED microscopy confirmed complete loss of RIM-BP2 proteins in KO terminals (Fig. S2). We then immunohistochemically labeled the α-subunit of either P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (Cav2.1) or N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (Cav2.2) and Munc13-1 (AZ/release site marker, Böhme et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Sakamoto et al., 2018</xref>) with VGLUT1 (presynaptic marker) and PSD-95 (postsynaptic marker) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and Fig. S3). In the stratum lucidum of the hippocampal CA3 region, mossy fibers form large synapses containing multiple and clustered AZs on CA3 pyramidal cells, and also small synapses containing a single AZ on interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Acsády et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Rollenhagen et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, we identified AZs using Munc13-1 STED images and quantified the signal intensity of Cav2.1 or Cav2.2 only at AZs clustered in large VGLUT1 positive terminals in the CA3 stratum lucidum, allowing us to confine the analysis to large mossy fiber terminals innervating onto CA3 pyramidal cells. The total signal intensity of Cav2.1 at the AZ was 22% lower in RIM-BP2 KO mice (n = 4 animals) than in WT mice (n = 4 animals) (p = 0.0286) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, left). These data are consistent with the reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in RIM-BP2 KO mice. In contrast to Cav2.1, the total signal intensity of Cav2.2 and Munc13-1 did not significantly differ between WT and RIM-BP2 KOs (p = 0.3143 and p = 0.0831) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, right). Furthermore, we found that the number of Cav2.1 clusters within the AZ identified by STED deconvolution analysis was not altered (2.5 ± 0.11 in WT, n = 4 animals; 2.3 ± 0.02 in KO, n = 4 animals) (p = 0.114). These data suggest that RIM-BP2 KO reduces the number of P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels per cluster. To optically estimate physical distances between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and release sites, we next analyzed the nearest neighboring distance between Cav2.1 and Munc13-1 clusters. These distances were unchanged (61 ± 1.4 nm in WT, n = 4 animals; 64 ± 1.3 nm in KO, n = 4 animals) (p = 0.200) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), consistent with the similar sensitivity of release to EGTA between WT and RIM-BP2 KO mice. From these results, we conclude that decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in RIM-BP2 KO hippocampal mossy fiber terminals is caused by reduction in the density of P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the AZ.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the AZ, and efficient vesicle docking and priming are essential factors for fast synaptic vesicle exocytosis. AZ proteins are critical for fast synchronous release and synaptic diversity. RIM-BPs have been implicated in recruitment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to the AZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kaeser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Liu et al., 2011</xref>) by interacting with RIMs and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hibino et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, RIM-BPs, like RIM1/2, recruit Munc-13 and accelerate synaptic vesicle priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brockmann et al., 2020</xref>). Concerning the relative importance of RIM-BPs on priming vs Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel recruitment, we still do know little.</p>
<p>At murine central synapses, RIM-BPs deficient synapses demonstrate overall a rather mild decrease in the amounts of transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Acuna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Grauel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Luo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Krinner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brockmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Butola et al., 2021</xref>). Most studies so far have been focused on synapses with high release probability (phasic synapses) such as the calyx of Held and CA3-CA1 synapses. This said, at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses, KO of RIM-BPs has a strong influence on synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brockmann et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses, release probability is relatively low (tonic synapses). It was unknown whether the reduction of transmitter release at RIM-BP2 KO mossy fiber synapses is due to impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel recruitment, compromised vesicle docking or priming. Using STED microscopy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brockmann et al. (2019)</xref> suggested that the physical recruitment of Munc13-1 might be an important function of RIM-BP2, though functional demonstration had been lacking.</p>
<p>By using direct presynaptic patch clamp recordings, we here observed a decrease of Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes (∼ 30%) in RIM-BP2 KO mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). As the rates of exocytosis steeply depend on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dodge and Rahamimoff, 1967</xref>), the reduced Ca2+ influx is likely sufficient to explain the slowed release time course at RIM-BP2 KO mossy fiber synapses. Moreover, STED microscopy supported decreased density of P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Cav2.1) in the mutant mossy fiber terminal. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brockmann et al. (2019)</xref> observed a reduction of Munc13-1 cluster number and docked vesicles in RIM-BP2 deficient synapses at hippocampal mossy fiber terminals. They identified the terminals by using ZnT3, enriched at mossy fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brockmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wenzel et al., 1997</xref>). Our STED imaging surprisingly did not detect differences in Munc13-1 cluster number at the AZ between WT and RIM-BP2 KO mice. Notably, we analyzed the number of Cav2.1, Cav2.2 and Munc13-1 clusters only within AZs showing direct co-localization with VGLUT1 and PSD-95, which mainly reflects the AZs facing CA3 pyramidal cells rather than the synapses onto interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Acsády et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Rollenhagen et al., 2007</xref>). Such a difference in areas analyze between previous and our study might explain the difference. Still, our results do not exclude roles of RIM-BP2 in synaptic vesicle priming. We however suggest that the reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx might be more critical here when compared to effects of impaired vesicle priming.</p>
<p>Recent studies have reported that RIM-BPs deletion altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel localization and loosened the coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles at phasic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Acuna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Grauel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Butola et al., 2021</xref>). We investigated the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-vesicle coupling at hippocampal mossy fiber terminals. The sensitivity of release to Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator EGTA was not changed between WT and RIM-BP2 KO mice. We also indicated RIM-BP2 KO does not alter the coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to release sites by using STED microscopy.</p>
<p>At phasic synapses, deletion of RIM-BP2 affects physical distance between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles. In contrast, at hippocampal mossy fiber terminals having low release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</xref>), RIM-BP2 KO decreased the number of P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, thereby reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and neurotransmitter release. Thus, we hypothesize the specific molecular-architectural and biochemical contributions by RIM-BPs might be of different relevance between phasic and tonic synapses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brockmann et al. (2020)</xref> proposed that RIM-BP2 controls Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel recruitment and vesicle priming by profound interaction with RIMs and Munc13s. These results have been obtained through studying hippocampal cultures dominated by phasic synapses. It seems possible that the interaction among three protein types is tight at phasic synapses, simply because of high density of these proteins at AZs. Alternatively, one might speculate about additional proteins, different interaction surfaces taken, transsynaptic columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Deletion of RIM-BP2 does not lead to loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels themselves and/or vesicle priming due to remaining RIMs, Munc13, and other proteins, which can regulate recruitment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicle priming without RIM-BP2. Instead, fine-tuning of release such as synchronization is compromised. We hypothesize that AZ scaffold might be differently built, leading to different consequences when eliminating one component. Hence deletion of RIM-BP2 leads to immediate loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and/or vesicle priming. This is in line with the proposal that at tonic synapses, synaptic vesicles are only loosely coupled with Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</xref>) and vesicles are de-primed under resting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>). Future research along this line may lead to an understanding of how fine molecular differences in the AZ scaffolds might orchestrate synaptic diversity.</p>

<p>For STED imaging, data were analyzed using custom-designed programs in Mathematica (Wolfram), values were processed by Igor Pro (WaveMetrics), and pictures were created with ImageJ (NIH). To determine the area of AZs, image masks were generated from STED images of Munc13-1 by unsharp masking and image binarization. Only AZs that show co-localization with VGLUT1 and PSD-95 immunofluorescence signals were included in the analysis. To confine the analysis to the large mossy fiber boutons, AZs in presynaptic terminals of small VGLUT1-positive area were excluded. Then, the background subtracted integral of signal intensity of Cav2.1 or Cav2.2 was quantified using the image masks of AZs. The background signal intensity was estimated from non-AZ area in the same STED images. For quantification of Cav2.1 clusters in the AZs, STED images of Cav2.1 were deconvolved using a gaussian kernel with a radius of 40 nm. Image masks of each Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel were generated from deconvolved STED images by unsharp masking and image binarization. Then, the total signal intensity, the size, and the number of Cav2.1 clusters at the AZs were quantified using the image masks of Cav2.1 clusters. Custom-designed programs in Mathematica (Wolfram) are available from Source code 1. Values are given as mean ± SEM, and n indicates the number of animals.

<p>This nice study by Miyano combines slice electrophysiology and superresolution microscopy to address the role of RBP2 in Ca2+ channel clustering and neurotransmitter release at hippocampal mossy fiber terminals. While a number of studies demonstrated a critical role for RBPs in clustering Ca2+ channels at other synapses and some provided evidence for a role of the protein in molecular coupling of Ca2+ channels and release sites, the present study targets another key synapse that is an important model for presynaptic studies and offers access to a microdomain controlled synaptic vesicle (SV) release mechanism with low initial release probability.</p>
<p>Summarizing a large body of high-quality work, the authors demonstrate reduced Ca2+ currents and a reduced release probability. They attribute the latter to the reduced Ca2+ influx and can restore release by increasing Ca2+ influx. Moreover, they propose an altered fusion competence of the SVs, which is not so strongly supported by the data in my view.</p>
<p>The effects are relatively small, but I think the careful analysis of the RBP role at the mossy fiber synapse is an important contribution.</p>

<p>The proper expression and organization of CaV channels at the presynaptic release sites are subject to coordinative and redundant control of many active zone-specific molecules including RIM-BPs. Previous studies have demonstrated that ablation of RIM-BPs in various mammalian synapses causes significant impairment of synaptic transmission, either by reducing CaV expression or decoupling CaV from synaptic vesicles. The mechanisms remain unknown.</p>
<p>In the manuscript, Sakaba and colleagues aimed to examine the specific role of RIM-BP2 at the hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal cell synapse, which is well-characterized by low initial release probability and strong facilitation during repetitive stimulation. By directly recording Ca2+ currents and capacitance jumps from the MF boutons, which is very challenging but feasible, they showed that depolarization-evoked Ca2+ influx was reduced significantly (~39%) by KO of RIM-BP2, but no impacts on Ca-induced exocytosis and RRP (measured by capacitance change). They used STED microscopy to image the spatial distribution of the CaV2.1 cluster but found no change in the cluster number with a slight decrease in cluster intensity (~20%). They concluded that RIM-BP2 functions in tonic synapses by reducing CaV expression and thus differentially from phasic synapses by decoupling CaV-SV.</p>
<p>In general, they provide solid data showing that RIM-BP2 KO reduces Ca influx at MF-CA3 synapse, but the phenotype is not new as Moser and colleagues have also used presynaptic recording and capacitance measurement and shown that RIM-BP2 KO reduces Ca2+ influx at hair cell active zone (Krinner et al., 2017), although at different synapse model expressing CaV1.3 instead of CaV2.1. Further, the concept that RIM-BP2 plays diverse functions in transmitter release at different central synapses has also been proposed with solid evidence (Brockmann et al., 2019).</p>
