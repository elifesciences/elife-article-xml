<title>Abstract</title><p>While often undetected and untreated, persistent seasonal asymptomatic malaria infections remain a global public health problem. Despite the presence of parasites in the peripheral blood, no symptoms develop. Disease severity is correlated with the levels of infected red blood cells (iRBCs) adhering within blood vessels. Changes in iRBC adhesion capacity has been linked to seasonal asymptomatic malaria infections, however how this is occurring is still unknown. Here we present evidence that RNA polymerase III (RNA Pol III) transcription in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is downregulated in field isolates obtained from asymptomatic individuals during the dry season. Through experiments with in vitro cultured parasites, we have uncovered an RNA Pol III-dependent mechanism that controls pathogen proliferation and expression of a major virulence factor in response to external stimuli. Our findings establish a connection between <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cytoadhesion and a non-coding RNA family transcribed by Pol III. Additionally, we have identified <italic>P. falciparum</italic> Maf1 as a pivotal regulator of Pol III transcription, both for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding adaptively to external signals. These results introduce a novel perspective that contributes to our understanding of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> virulence. Furthermore, it establishes a connection between this regulatory process and the occurrence of seasonal asymptomatic malaria infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is responsible for the deadliest form of human malaria that annually affects over 200 million people, with 619,000 fatal cases, majorly African children under the age of 5. The disease is transmitted to its human host during a blood meal by the parasites’ vector, <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. Disease symptoms are seen while the parasite multiplies asexually within the host RBCs. During this time, variant surface antigens (VSAs) are exported and displayed on the surface of the iRBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wahlgren <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). During the ∼48-hour asexual intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC), the parasite develops through different morphological stages: ring (circulating), trophozoite, and schizont (sequestered in capillaries). Expression of one type of VSA that is linked to immune evasion and pathogenesis, termed <italic>P. falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Leech <italic>et al</italic>, 1984</xref>), can bind to a wide range of receptors on endothelial cells such as CD36. PfEMP1 binding mediates adhesion to the vascular endothelium within the host, thereby preventing mature iRBCs from traveling to, and being cleared by, the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites replicate via schizogony inside the host RBCs generating the infectious form, termed merozoites. Upon bursting of the iRBC, merozoites invade new RBCs, thus enabling the cycle to restart. The number of merozoites per schizont has been shown to reduce in unfavorable conditions as a way to diminish the total parasite load and therefore overall disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mancio-Silva <italic>et al</italic>, 2017b</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> chronic infection relies largely on mutually exclusive expression of PfEMP1 surface adhesins, that are encoded by the <italic>var</italic> virulence gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Scherf <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Guizetti &amp; Scherf, 2013</xref>). The expression of <italic>var</italic> genes, while under tight epigenetic regulation by the parasite, is additionally controlled by a family of ncRNA, termed RUF6. <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 encodes 15 RUF6 genes dispersed over several chromosomes located adjacent to central <italic>var</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gardner <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). RUF6 ncRNA have been observed to associate with the active <italic>var</italic> gene in <italic>trans</italic> and transcriptional repression disrupts the monoallelic expression of <italic>var</italic> genes by down-regulating the entire <italic>var</italic> gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barcons-Simon <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Guizetti <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Genetically modified parasites that express the entire RUF6 gene family show a general upregulation of <italic>var</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fan <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>P.</italic> falciparum virulence is linked to cytoadhesion and sequestration as a result of reduced clearance of iRBCs in the spleen and increased microcapillary obstruction and local inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Miller <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). Substantial sequestration of iRBCs in critical target organs has been associated with severe malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Miller <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guillochon <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). In long-term asymptomatic infections, found during prolonged low transmission dry seasons in malaria-endemic regions, decreased cytoadhesion and longer circulation time of iRBCs in the blood has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andrade <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). It is not fully understood how asymptomatic infections develop and are maintained nor is a molecular understanding of host and parasite factors, that underlies disease severity during the dry and wet seasons (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhang &amp; Deitsch, 2022</xref>)). Disease severity appears to be influenced by a variety of factors derived from the human host, parasite, and environment. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites are auxotrophic for various nutrients including glucose, certain types of amino acids, and lipids, which must be obtained from the host. Physiological conditions in the host, like diabetes, pregnancy, diet, and immunity can change the metabolic environment the parasites are exposed to. Numerous studies conclude that host immunity is a contributing factor to the maintenance of asymptomatic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kimenyi <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). While it is proposed that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> virulence regulation contributes to decreased endothelial binding, the mechanism and factors involved remains to be determined.</p>
<p>Almost all eukaryotes use conserved nutrient sensing pathways, including mTOR, GCN2, GCN5, Rgt2/Snf3, and Snf1/AMPK signaling cascades (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kumar <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>)). Most notably, the target of rapamycin complex (TORC) pathway involves the signaling of external factors to control many cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wullschleger <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Specifically, TORC participates in the regulation of RNA Pol III activity via the phosphorylation of its inhibitor, Maf1. When nutrients are available and mTOR kinase is active, Maf1 is hyperphosphorylated resulting in an inactive cytoplasmic state. Stress-induced Maf1 dephosphorylation results in nuclear localization and inhibition of RNA Pol III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pluta <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rollins <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Vannini <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). This pathway responds to a range of positive and negative external stimuli, most notably the presence of amino acids, that drive or inhibit cellular growth. The majority of the TORC pathway components are lost in the apicomplexan lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McLean &amp; Jacobs-Lorena, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Serfontein <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">van Dam <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). While <italic>P. falciparum</italic> encodes none of the core TORC1 components, it does contain a homologue to Maf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McLean &amp; Jacobs-Lorena, 2017</xref>). The biology of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> Pf-Maf1 is still poorly characterized.</p>
<p>Here, we present data showing inhibition of RNA Pol III transcription in field isolates from asymptomatic individuals during the dry season. We present evidence for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> Maf1 as a negative regulator of RNA Pol III-transcribed genes including tRNA and RUF6 ncRNA, and demonstrate that this mechanism is responsive to external stimuli using <italic>in vitro</italic> culture. Inhibition of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cytoadherence, via the regulation of RNA Pol III activity, represents a new paradigm contributing to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> virulence and links this process to seasonal asymptomatic malaria infections.</p>

<title>RUF6 ncRNA is downregulated in asymptomatic individuals during the dry season</title>
<p>We and others have previously established the role of the 15-member RUF6 ncRNA gene family in <italic>P. falciparum var</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barcons-Simon <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Diffendall <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fan <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Guizetti <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). RUF6 ncRNA protein complex associates with the active <italic>var</italic> gene expression site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Diffendall <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Guizetti <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>), and knockdown of the ncRNA RUF6 gene family dramatically reduced <italic>var</italic> gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barcons-Simon <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Bioinformatic analysis identified highly conserved RNA Pol III binding elements (conserved A- and B-box sequence) within RUF6 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Guizetti <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>), hinting at a role for RNA Pol III in virulence gene regulation. Thus, we determined the effects of RNA Pol III inhibition on gene transcription in synchronized wild type parasites. We observed downregulation of tRNA and RUF6 transcription after 20 hours of treatment with a commercially available RNA Pol III inhibitor (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>). As expected, no changes were observed in the transcription of an RNA Pol II-regulated gene, <italic>uce</italic> (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, PF3D7_0812600) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>). As predicted from the RUF6 sequence, our data provide direct experimental evidence for RNA Pol III-dependent transcription of RUF6 genes.</p>
<p>We next wanted to determine if RNA Pol III-transcribed genes, specifically RUF6 ncRNA, varied between parasites causing different clinical states of malaria infection, since previous studies did not include RNA Pol III-transcribed genes for their data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andrade <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). We first re-analyzed raw RNA-seq data, from a previous study that compared parasites infecting individuals during the dry versus wet season in a malaria endemic region of Mali (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andrade <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>), to include these genes. We were able to retrieve transcriptional data for two RNA Pol III-transcribed tRNAs (tRNA Leucine Pf3D7_API05400 and tRNA Asparagine Pf3D7_API05500), both of which show significantly lower levels in parasites infecting asymptomatic individuals during the dry season (n = 12) when compared to parasites infecting symptomatic individuals during the wet season (n = 12).</p>
<p>We further investigated whether RNA Pol III modulates gene transcription in field isolates of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> from different individuals infected during the wet and dry season in malaria endemic regions (The Gambia). In this pilot study, we analyzed <italic>P. falciparum</italic> steady state levels of RNA in venous blood samples taken from individuals with asymptomatic parasitemia during the dry season (n = 17), as well as mildly symptomatic malaria infections during the wet season (n = 14) in The Gambia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Collins <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fogang <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). RT-qPCR of total RNA showed that levels of tRNAs (Asparagine and Valine) were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) in parasites from asymptomatic infections during the dry season compared to parasites causing symptomatic infections during the wet season (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Likewise, RUF6 ncRNA was significantly downregulated (p &lt; 0.005) in parasites from asymptomatic infections during the dry season when compared to symptomatic infections during the wet season (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Expression was normalized to a housekeeping gene encoding fructose bisphosphate aldolase (Pf3D7_1444800).</p>

<p>The same previous study, mentioned above, also showed that <italic>var</italic> gene transcription varied in parasites infecting individuals during the dry versus wet seasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andrade <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). We observed a significantly lower level of <italic>var</italic> gene transcription (p &lt; 0.005) in parasites taken from asymptomatic individuals during the dry season compared to those taken from symptomatic individuals during the wet season (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The observed lower transcript levels of <italic>var</italic> genes may be a direct result of reduced RUF6 ncRNA levels. Taken together, our results reveal that levels of RNA Pol III-transcribed genes, particularly the regulatory RUF6 ncRNA, varies significantly between two different clinical states and seasons.</p>

<title>The environmental factor, magnesium, plays a regulatory role in genes transcribed by RNA Polymerase III</title>
<p>In studies of malaria infections, variations in metabolite levels were observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases across wet and dry seasons. However, the data did not pinpoint any particular factor that could be reliably linked to a specific condition of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andrade <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Other clinical studies investigated the correlation between macro- and micro-mineral concentrations and disease severity. In one study, it was discovered that levels of serum MgCl<sub>2</sub> were lower in cases of more severe malaria infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Innocent <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). We chose to analyze plasma samples from individuals participating in the same study as referenced in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, focusing on magnesium concentrations. Our findings show a significant reduction in MgCl<sub>2</sub> levels in symptomatic individuals during the wet season compared to asymptomatic individuals in the dry season, as depicted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>.</p>

<p>Our subsequent aim was to delve into the potential molecular mechanisms connecting external factors, like magnesium, with the changes in RUF6 ncRNA levels as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>. For this, we employed in vitro cultured <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual blood stage parasites. We supplemented culture medium with MgCl2, noted for its varying levels in individuals with malaria (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, we mimicked nutrient deprivation with isoleucine-deprived culture medium (as was described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Babbitt <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McLean &amp; Jacobs-Lorena, 2017</xref>)), fever conditions with incubation at 40°C, and food starvation with low glucose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jensen <italic>et al</italic>, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fang <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). We evaluated the steady state levels of RNA Pol I-(rRNA A1), RNA Pol II- (UCE and the active <italic>var</italic>), and RNA Pol III- (tRNA Valine and RUF6 ncRNA) transcribed genes in clonal parasites at late ring stage. We observed that high temperature and low glucose conditions affected gene transcription of RNA Pol I, II and Pol III (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>). Deprivation of isoleucine and MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation seemingly affected only RNA Pol III-transcribed genes with the exception of the RNA Pol II-transcribed active <italic>var</italic> gene, Pf3D7_1240900, likely as a result of decreased RUF6 ncRNA as was reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barcons-Simon <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>To explore the underlying molecular pathway that leads to the downregulation of RNA Pol III activity in malaria parasites, we continued using MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation. We selected a concentration of 3mM total MgCl<sub>2</sub>, based on reports indicating it does not inhibit the growth of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual blood stage and is within a physiological range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jahnen-Dechent &amp; Ketteler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hess <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). We verified that altering physiological concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> above the control level impacts both Pol III-transcribed RUF6 and tRNA, while not affecting Pol II-transcribed UCE, as demonstrated in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>. RNA-seq was done on control and MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplemented cultured parasites during two time points of the asexual blood stage parasites (ring and trophozoite) to further confirm that RNA Pol III is the main target (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>). RNA-seq data was compared to the microarray time course data in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bozdech <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lemieux <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>), which provided a statistical estimation of cell cycle progression at 12 and 24 hpi in both control and MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplemented parasites (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>).</p>
<p>These data indicate that any differences in transcription were due to MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation and not differences in cell cycle progression. During ring stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), 77% of the down-regulated genes contain typical RNA Pol III promoter sequences, A- and B-box consensus (from <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). A total of 27 ncRNA genes were downregulated (logFC &lt; 1.95, FDR &lt; 0.05) including all 15 RUF6 ncRNA, 6 tRNAs, 1 spliceosomal RNA, and 4 snoRNA. Additionally, 12 protein coding genes were up-regulated with no conserved pathway nor molecular or biological process. During trophozoite stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), 74% of the down-regulated genes have typical RNA Pol III promoter sequences. This demonstrates that MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation predominantly inhibits RNA Pol III-transcribed genes, including the entire RUF6 gene family.</p>

<title>Nuclear PfMaf1 protein is essential to regulate RNA Pol III</title>
<p>In almost all eukaryotes, the target of rapamycin complex (TORC) pathway has been shown to participate in the regulation of RNA Pol III activity via the phosphorylation of its only known inhibitor, Maf1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wullschleger <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>)).

Because Maf1 is conserved in the apicomplexan lineage, a predicted essential blood stage protein in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, we set out to explore if <italic>P. falciparum</italic> Maf1 (PfMaf1) functions similarly to model eukaryotes. We generated a PfMaf1 parasite line tagged with a 3HA tag and a ligand-controlled destabilization domain (ddFKBP), PfMaf1-FKBP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> top). PfMaf1-FKBP transfected parasite clonal populations were validated for proper integration and confirmation that the system was working, shown by western blot for addition and removal of the ligand, Shield-1, over the course of 3 cycles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> bottom). We observed that upon removal of Shield-1, PfMaf1 levels were shown to decrease by approximately 57% in total extracts after one cycle and almost complete degradation was achieved after 2 cycles.</p>

<p>Plasmodial Maf1 seemingly affects asexual blood stage proliferation making classical gene KO experiments unattainable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McLean &amp; Jacobs-Lorena, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), pointing to a regulatory role of the putative RNA Pol III inhibitor under normal <italic>in vitro</italic> culture growth conditions. Once PfMaf1 is depleted (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> bottom, 3 cycles -Shield), transcription of tRNA Valine and RUF6 ncRNA increased dramatically by 3-fold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), possibly perturbing cellular homeostasis. RNA Pol II-transcribed genes were unaffected. Parasite growth was assessed over the course of 5 days for two PfMaf1-FKBP clones cultured in the presence or absence of PfMaf1 (+/- Shield-1, removed one cycle before day 0, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). A significant difference in growth was achieved, most evidently in parasites cultured without Shield for 3 cycles, consistent with transposon mutagenesis scoring PfMaf1 essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Dead parasites were not detected by Giemsa staining even up to 8 cycles without Shield-1.

<p>Additionally, we demonstrate that nuclear PfMaf1 interacts with the RNA Pol III protein complex by performing co-immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative mass spectrometry (Co-IP MS) of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of PfMaf1-HA-ddFKBP.

Analysis of the quantitative mass spectrometry data revealed unique interactome of cytoplasmic PfMaf1 and nuclear PfMaf1 in their respective samples compared to their controls (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A, B</xref>). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that PfMaf1-associated proteins uniquely found in the nuclear fraction, and neither of the two controls nor cytoplasmic fraction, are significantly represented by the biological function category of “RNA Polymerase III transcription” (p = 0.00175) with two subunits of RNA Pol III (Pf3D7_1206600 and Pf3D7_1329000).

</fig>
<p>Next, we used the PfMaf1-FKBP transfected parasite lines, to show that the downregulation of RNA Pol III-transcribed genes, triggered by external stimuli, is dependent on PfMaf1. We used the PfMaf1 KD parasites (2<sup>nd</sup> cycle, see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) in control conditions and MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation to the growth medium in ring stage parasites for RT-qPCR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). We confirmed the previously observed down-regulation of RNA Pol III-transcribed tRNA Valine and RUF6 upon MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation in two independent PfMaf1-FKBP parasite clones. Notably, when PfMaf1 degradation was induced, the addition of MgCl<sub>2</sub> did not affect Pol III transcription. These results demonstrate that PfMaf1 mediates the observed decrease in RNA Pol III-transcribed genes with MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation.</p>
<p>Previous attempts to develop a knockout (KO) line did not yield success, as highlighted by McLean &amp; Jacobs-Lorena in 2017. However, our creation of an inducible system for degrading PfMaf1 protein has unveiled a twofold function of PfMaf1: i) it helps maintain Pol III transcription at levels essential for optimal parasite proliferation, and ii) it serves as a key element in an environmental sensing pathway that directly controls Pol III activity.</p>
<p>Finally, we set out to link <italic>P. falciparum</italic> virulence gene expression with decreased RUF6 transcription, by investigating the effect of MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation on cytoadherence of 3D7 iRBCs. We found that in static binding assays to the endothelial receptor CD36, bound to plastic dishes, adhesion of iRBCs was reduced by 50% with MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). This was also confirmed at the protein level using antibodies directed against the conserved intracellular ATS domain of PfEMP1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study reveals a regulatory mechanism in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> involving RNA Polymerase III, which plays a pivotal role in the parasite’s virulence. This discovery illuminates a previously unidentified adaptive molecular process in the parasite’s cytoadhesion and proliferation. We propose a connection with asymptomatic infections prevalent during the dry season in African regions, a period characterized by reduced mosquito transmission. In our analysis, we compared RNA from parasites in symptomatic individuals during the wet season to those in asymptomatic individuals in the dry season. In this comparison, we noted a reduction in the levels of tRNAs and RUF6 ncRNA, with the latter being recognized for its involvement in regulating <italic>var</italic> gene expression, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A-C</xref>. To date, RNA Polymerase III (Pol III) has not been acknowledged as a factor influencing the virulence of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in mild or asymptomatic malaria infections. Additionally, our research revealed a link between elevated serum MgCl2 levels and asymptomatic malaria infections, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>. The normal concentration range for MgCl2 in human serum is between 0.7–1.0 mmol/L (1.7– 2.4 mg/dL), while mild hypermagnesemia is characterized by levels ranging from 2.2-3.5 mmol/L (5.35–8.5 mg/dL). In our pilot study, the average concentration was observed to be around 0.7 mmol/L during the wet season and increased to 1.2 mmol/L in the dry season.</p>
<p>To investigate the potential mechanistic link between the changes in MgCl<sub>2</sub> levels and Pol III activity, we established an in vitro culture assay for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> that enabled us to delve into the molecular mechanism underpinning the environment-dependent inhibition of Pol III. We experimented with various concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> to assess its effect on Pol III activity. The standard culture medium we used contains 0.5 mmol/L of MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Our observations indicated a progressive inhibition of Pol III activity in the range of 1-3 mmol/L. To further explore the molecular mechanisms involved, we opted to use a concentration of 3 mmol/L in our continued studies. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed inhibition of Pol III transcription of tRNA and the RUF6 ncRNA gene family. Subsequent RNA seq data validated that transcriptional inhibition, induced by MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation, is primarily limited to canonical RNA Pol III-transcribed genes, which include A and B box containing sequences, and notably the RUF6 gene, crucial for the activation of var genes. Our findings established that the inhibition of <italic>var</italic> gene expression, mediated by Pol III, led to a decrease in the cytoadherence of infected red blood cells (iRBCs) when supplemented with MgCl<sub>2</sub>, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>. We noted a reduction of over 50% in binding to the endothelial receptor CD36 in a static binding assay. It is expected that the inhibition of iRBC cytoadherence would be even more pronounced under the physiological shear stress typically found in human capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Crabb <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Having established the role of Pol III in the expression of virulence genes, we subsequently showed a link between environmental factors and Maf1, which is the only known eukaryotic repressor of Pol III. We created an inducible system designed to specifically reduce PfMaf1 protein levels, enabling us to explore its influence on Pol III activity. Proteomic analysis through mass spectrometry of PfMaf1’s interactome showed its association with various nuclear RNA Pol III subunits, reinforcing its function as a repressor of Pol III in <italic>P. falciparum.</italic> PfMaf1 showed nuclear presence under standard growth conditions. Nuclear shuttling usually increases under specific conditions (stress, nutrient starvation) by changing the phosphorylation state of the Maf1 protein in eukaryotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Michels <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Our study supports a model in which a critical baseline amount of PfMaf1 in the nucleus is essential to modulate the expression of tRNAs by RNA Pol III during the multinucleated blood stage of the parasite. This regulation is essential for the parasite to balance its energy resources efficiently while producing large numbers of new infective forms, known as merozoites. Under optimal growth conditions, a single parasite undergoes several rounds of genome replication, forming approximately 30 nuclei within a shared cytoplasm. When PfMaf1 is completely removed, the transcription levels of tRNA Valine and RUF6 ncRNA increase more than threefold, while the transcription level of a Pol II-mediated housekeeping gene UCE remains unchanged. This significant elevation of tRNA transcription beyond physiological levels could potentially lead to an energy deficit within the cell, resulting in the observed reduction in the parasite’s multiplication rate, as demonstrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C and E</xref>. In clinical isolates, parasite densities have been associated with malaria pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nyarko &amp; Claessens, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Thomson-Luque <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) and low parasite densities are also a feature of asymptomatic malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Murray <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Nutrient availability in the host has been demonstrated to have a profound effect on the replication of parasites using <italic>P. berghei</italic> as a rodent malaria model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mancio-Silva <italic>et al</italic>, 2017a</xref>). Reports from cultured blood stage <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites showed that amino acid deficiency can alter parasite growth and survival to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McLean &amp; Jacobs-Lorena, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Marreiros <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Furthermore, a recent report suggested that nutrients involved in S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) metabolism can also affect <italic>var</italic> gene switching in cultured parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Schneider <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Individuals infected with malaria, compared to healthy individuals, were found to have decreased levels (up to 54%) of plasma free amino acids, which could be the result of a nutrient-reduced diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Leopold <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). In fact, dietary intake, including energy, protein, iron, zinc, calcium and folate, was found to decrease significantly in individuals during the dry season in areas of Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">M’Kaibi <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Blood serum magnesium levels can fluctuate in humans and were found to decrease with increasing disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Innocent <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). In our study, plasma magnesium levels were significantly decreased in symptomatic individuals during the wet season compared to asymptomatic individuals during the dry season (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). It is noteworthy that intracellular magnesium was found to increase in yeast as a result of calorie restriction, defined as a decrease in dietary glucose intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abraham <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>), indicating that our MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation could be mimicking low glucose conditions and thus, low nutrient availability. Although interactions between human malaria and malnutrition have been studied for many years, the evidence linking an effect between the two remains inconclusive at the mechanistic level. Our study sets the stage for exploring whether there are additional external stimuli, beyond magnesium chloride, that could activate the regulatory pathway of RNA Polymerase III. Given the lack of a conventional TOR pathway in malaria parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Serfontein <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">van Dam <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>), the exact signaling pathway that activates PfMaf1 remains unknown. Our mass spectrometry analysis of PfMaf1’s cytoplasmic binding partners has identified interactions with enzymes, such as phosphatases and kinases, which could potentially influence Maf1 activity. This discovery opens up new avenues for future research into the environmental sensing mechanisms that function upstream of PfMaf1.</p>
<p>A traditional view posits that the decreased cytoadherence seen in dry-season parasites may be affected by host immunity, which impairs the parasites’ adhesion capabilities. Although experimental evidence supporting this theory is missing, our research introduces a novel perspective to this critical topic by highlighting the role of metabolic changes in modulating virulence gene expression.</p>
<p>In summary, our research demonstrates that RNA Polymerase III activity, regulated by environmental factors, plays a crucial role in the proliferation of parasites and in reducing the cytoadhesive capacity of <italic>P. falciparum.</italic> This discovery unveils a previously unknown molecular process, significantly enhancing our understanding of subclinical parasite persistence. The insights gained from this study could pave the way for novel strategies aimed at preventing severe malaria by promoting reduced pathogen virulence.</p>

<title>Generation of PfMaf1 strains</title>
<p>All cloning was performed using KAPA HiFi DNA Polymerase (Roche 07958846001), In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Clontech 639649), and XL10-Gold Ultracompetent <italic>E. coli</italic> (Agilent Technologies 200315). Transgenic pSLI parasites were generated as previously described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Birnbaum <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>) with the following modifications: GFP was replaced with a 3HA tag and a ddFKBP domain was added after the protein of interest, PfMaf1. For localization and knock down studies, the last 500-1000 bp of target gene, PfMaf1 Pf3D7_0416500, was cloned into pSLI-3HA-ddFKBP. Each sequence started with an in-frame stop codon but the stop codon at the end of the gene was removed. 50 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected into ring stage 3D7 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites using the protocol described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hasenkamp <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Transfected parasites were selected with constant drug selection pressure of 2.56 nM WR99210 (Jacobus Pharmaceuticals) to obtain a cell line containing the episomal plasmid. A second drug selection using 400 μg/ml of G418 was done to select for integrants. Once parasites emerged, gDNA of each integration cell line was collected using a commercial kit (DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit) and checked by PCR to show that integration occurred at the correct locus. Both genome and vector specific primers for the 5’ and 3’ region were used so that the PCR product would cover the plasmid/genome junction. Vector primers used were the same as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Birnbaum <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Once proper size gel bands from PCR were seen, parasites were cloned by limiting dilution, and the targeted genomic locus was sequenced to confirm tag and FKBP integration.</p>

At 24hpi, each culture (1.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> parasites) was centrifuged and RBCs were lysed with six volumes of 0.15% saponin in DPBS for 5 min at 4°C. Parasites were centrifuged at 4,000 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C, and the pellet was washed twice with DPBS at 4°C. Parasites were then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and quenched with 125 mM glycine for 5 min on ice. Cross-linked parasites were washed twice with DPBS and then resuspended in 900uL of cytoplasmic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.65% IGEPAL CA-630, 10mM NaCl) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Thermo Fisher 78440) at 4°C and incubated with rotation for 30 min at 4°C.

Cytoplasmic fractions were mixed with 2:3 ratio of cytoplasmic dilution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mmM EDTA) and nuclear supernatants were mixed with 1:3 ratio of nuclear dilution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mmM EDTA). Cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction supernatants were incubated with 1ug of α-HA antibody (Abcam 9110) and 25uL Protein G Magnetic Dynabeads (Invitrogen), pre-incubated for a minimum of 2 hours and washed twice with dilution buffer, overnight with rotation at 4°C. The next day, the beads were collected on a magnet and the supernatant was removed. While on the magnetic stand, beads were washed twice with 500 μL wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.05% NP40), once with 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> (Sigma 09830) buffer, and then transferred to new tube. Finally, the beads were resuspended in 100 µl of 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> (Sigma 09830) and digested by adding 0.2 μg of trypsin-LysC (Promega) for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were then loaded into custom-made C18 StageTips packed by stacking one AttractSPE® disk (#SPE-Disks-Bio-C18-100.47.20 Affinisep) in a 200 µL micropipette tip for desalting. Peptides were eluted using a ratio of 40:60 CH3CN:H2O + 0.1% formic acid and vacuum concentrated to dryness with a SpeedVac apparatus. Peptides were reconstituted in 10 of injection buffer in 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) before liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Online LC was performed with an RSLCnano system (Ultimate 3000, Thermo Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were trapped on a 2 cm nanoviper Precolumn (i.d. 75 μm, C18 Acclaim PepMap<sup>TM</sup> 100, Thermo Scientific) at a flow rate of 3.0 µL/min in buffer A (2/98 MeCN/H2O in 0.1% formic acid) for 4 min to desalt and concentrate the samples.

Median and scale normalization was applied on the total signal to correct the XICs for each biological replicate (n = 5 in each condition). To estimate the significance of the change in protein abundance, a linear model (adjusted on peptides and biological replicates) was performed, and p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini– Hochberg FDR procedure. Proteins with at least 2 distinct peptides in 3 replicates of a same state, a 2-fold enrichment and an adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 were considered significantly enriched in sample comparisons. Proteins unique to a condition were also considered if they matched the peptides criteria.</p>

Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed Student’s t-test (* p&lt;0.05). (B) Transcript levels as quantified by RT-qPCR on 3D7 parasites harvested during late ring stage for control parasites, parasites in the absence of isoleucine (w/o Ile), at 40 degrees Celsius, at low-glucose levels (0.5mg/mL), and presence of additional MgCl<sub>2</sub> ([3mM] total). Primers were used for Pol II-transcribed ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UCE Pf3D7_0812600), Pol I-transcribed rRNA A1, Pol III-transcribed RUF6 ncRNA, Pol III-transcribed tRNA Valine (Pf3D7_0312600), and Pol II-transcribed active <italic>var</italic> gene (Pf3D7_1240900). Results are normalized to an RNA Pol II-transcribed reference gene FBA (Pf3D7_1444800) and presented as fold change/control. Error bars are displayed from 3 biological replicates. Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed Student’s t-test (* p&lt;0.05).</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study links the activity of polymerase III to the regulation of virulence gene expression in the deadliest malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. It identifies Maf1 as a Pol III inhibitor that enables the parasite to respond to external stimuli such as magnesium chloride plasma levels by downregulating Pol III-transcribed ruf6 genes and subsequently regulated var genes. While the evidence presented is generally <bold>convincing</bold>, some of the results are <bold>incomplete</bold>, and the mechanistic link between external signals and Maf1 activation remains unknown.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Asymptomatic malaria infections are frequent during the dry season and have been associated with lower cytoadherence of P. falciparum parasites and lower expression of variant surface antigens. The mechanisms underlying parasite adaptation during the low transmission season remain poorly understood. The authors previously established that members of the non-coding RNA RUF6 gene family, transcribed by RNA pol III, are required for expression of the main variant surface antigens in P. falciparum, PfEMP1, which drive parasite cytoadherence and pathogenicity. In this study, the authors investigated the contribution of RNA pol III transcription in the regulation of PfEMP1 expression in different clinical states, either symptomatic malaria cases during the wet season or asymptomatic infections during the dry season.</p>
<p>By reanalyzing RNAseq data from a previous study in Mali, complemented with RT-qPCR on new samples collected in The Gambia, the authors first report the down-regulation of RNA pol III genes (tRNAs, RUF6) in P. falciparum isolates collected from asymptomatic individuals during the dry season, as compared to isolates from symptomatic (wet season) individuals. They also confirm the down-regulation of var (DBLalpha) gene expression in asymptomatic infection as compared to symptomatic malaria. Plasma analysis in the two groups in the Gambian study reveals higher Magnesium levels in the dry season as compared to wet season samples, pointing at a possible role of external factors. The authors tested the effect of MgCl2 supplementation on cultured parasites, as well as three other stimuli (temperature, low glucose, Ile deprivation), and showed that Ile deprivation and MgCl2 both induce down-regulation of RNA pol III transcription but not pol I or pol II (except the active var gene). Using RNAseq, they show that MgCl2 supplementation predominantly inhibits RNA pol III-transcribed genes, including the entire RUF6 family. Conditional depletion of Maf1 leads to the up-regulation of RNA pol III gene transcription, confirming that Maf1 is a RNA pol III inhibitor in P. falciparum, as described in other organisms. Quantitative mass spectrometry shows that Maf1 interacts with RNA pol III complex in the nucleus, and with distinct proteins including two phosphatases in the cytoplasm. Using the Maf1 cKD parasites, the authors document that the down-regulation of RNA pol III by MgCl2 is dependent on Maf1. Finally, they show that MgCl2 results in decreased cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes, associated with reduced PfEMP1 expression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>-The work is very well performed and presented.</p>
<p>
-The study uncovers a novel regulatory mechanism relying on RNA pol III-dependent regulation of variant surface antigens in response to external signals, which could contribute to parasite adaptation during the low transmission season.</p>
<p>
-Potential regulators of Maf1 were identified by mass spectrometry, including phosphatases, paving the way for future mechanistic studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>-The signaling pathway upstream of Maf1 remains unknown. In eukaryotes, Maf1 is a negative regulator of RNA pol III and is regulated by external signals via the TORC pathway. Since TORC components are absent in the apicomplexan lineage, one central question that remains open is how Maf1 is regulated in P. falciparum. Magnesium is probably not the sole stimulus involved, as suggested by the observation that Ile deprivation also down-regulates RNA pol III activity.</p>
<p>
-The study does not address why MgCl2 levels vary depending on the clinical state. It is unclear whether plasma magnesium is increased during asymptomatic malaria or decreased during symptomatic infection, as the study does not include control groups with non-infected individuals. Along the same line, MgCl2 supplementation in parasite cultures was done at 3mM, which is higher than the highest concentrations observed in clinical samples.</p>
<p>
-Although the study provides biochemical evidence of Maf1 accumulation in the parasite nuclear fraction upon magnesium addition, this is not fully supported by the immunofluorescence experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study by Diffendall et al. set out to establish a link between the activity of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) and its inhibitor Maf1 and the virulence of Plasmodium falciparum in vivo. Having previously found that knockdown of the ncRNA ruf6 gene family reduces var gene expression in vitro, they now present experimental evidence for the regulation of ruf6 and subsequently, var gene expression by Pol III using a commercially available inhibitor. They confirm their findings with samples from a previously published Gambian cohort study using asymptomatic dry season and mildly symptomatic wet season samples, showing that higher levels of Pol III-dependent transcripts and var transcripts as well as lower MgCl2 plasma concentrations are present in wet season samples. From this, they hypothesize that the external stimuli heat, reduced glucose and essential amino acid supply, and increased MgCl2 levels are sensed by the parasite through the only known Pol III inhibitor Maf1 and result in lower Pol III activity and fewer ruf6 transcripts, which in turn reduces var gene expression, leading to reduced cytoadherence and virulence of P. falciparum. In their in vitro experiments they focus on investigating higher MgCl2 levels and their impact on Pol III and Maf1 activity as well as var gene expression and parasites adherence to purified CD36, thereby successfully confirming their hypothesis for MgCl2. Nicely, MgCl2-induced down-regulation of Pol III activity was shown to be dependent on Maf1 using a knock-down cell line. Additionally, they show that the Maf1-KD cell line displays a slower growth rate with fewer merozoites per schizonts and Maf1 interacts with RNA pol III subunits and some kinases/phosphatases.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the authors were largely successful in their aims. They provide largely convincing data, and the correlation between Pol III transcription and its inhibition by Maf1 with the expression of ruf6 and var genes is highly interesting. The data provide important insights for researchers investigating the function of Pol III and its inhibitor, non-coding RNAs, and their role in gene regulation, but may also indicate that the parasite senses and responds to its environment, opening up new research directions, particularly in field research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, most analyses are rather preliminary as only very few (3-5) candidate genes are analyzed by qPCR instead of carrying out comprehensive analyses with a large qPCR panel or RNA-seq experiments with GO term analyses. Data presentation lacks clarity, the number of biological replicates is rather low and the statistical analyses need to be largely revised. Although the in vivo data from wet (mildly symptomatic) and dry (asymptomatic) season parasites with different expression levels of Pol III-regulated genes, var genes, and MgCl2 are interesting, the link between the in vitro data and the in vivo virulence of P. falciparum, which is made in many sections of the manuscript, should be toned down. Especially since (i) the only endothelial receptor studied is CD36, which is associated with parasite binding during mild malaria, and (ii) several studies provide contradictory data on MgCl2 levels during malaria and in different disease states, which is not further discussed, but the authors mainly focused on this external stimulus in their experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work describes a new pathway by which malaria parasites, P. falciparum, may regulate their growth and virulence (i.e. their expression of virulence-linked cytoadhesins). This is a topic of considerable interest in the field - does this important parasite sense factor(s) in its host bloodstream and regulate itself accordingly? Several fragments of evidence have come out on this topic in the past decade, showing, for example, reduced parasite growth under calorie restriction (in mice); parasite dormancy in response to amino acid starvation (in culture and in mice), and also reduced virulence in dry-season, low-parasitaemia infections in humans. The molecular mechanisms that may underlie this interesting biology remain only poorly understood.</p>
<p>Here, the authors show that dry-season P. falciparum parasites have reduced expression of Pol3-transcribed tRNAs and ncRNAs that positively regulate virulence gene expression. They link the level of Pol3 activity to PfMaf1, a remnant of the largely-absent nutrient-sensing TOR pathway in this parasite. They propose that in the dry season, human hosts may be calorie-restricted, leading to Maf1 moving to the nucleus and suppressing Pol3, thus downregulated growth and virulence of parasites. The evidence is intriguing and the idea is conceptually elegant.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of dry/wet-season field samples from The Gambia is a strength, showing potential real-world relevance. The generation of an inducible knockdown of Maf1 in lab-cultured parasites is also a strength, allowing this pathway to be studied somewhat in isolation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The signals upstream of Maf1 remain rather a black box. 4 are tested - heat shock and low-glucose, which seem to suppress ALL transcription; low-Isoleucine and high magnesium, which suppress Pol3. Therefore the authors use Mg supplementation throughout as a 'starvation type' stimulus. They do not discuss why they didn't use amino acid limitation, which could be more easily rationalised physiologically. It may be for experimental simplicity (no need for dropout media) but this should be discussed, and ideally, sample experiments with low-IsoLeu should be done too, to see if the responses (e.g. cytoadhesion) are all the same.</p>
<p>(2) The proteomics, conducted to seek partners of Maf1, is probably the weakest part. From Figure S3: the proteins highlighted in the text are clearly highly selected (as ones that might be relevant, e.g. phosphatases), but many others are more enriched. It would be good to see the whole list, and which GO terms actually came top in enrichment.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 3 shows the Maf1-low line has very poor growth after only 5 days but it is stated that no dead parasites are seen even after 8 cycles and the merozoites number is down only ~18 to 15... is this too small to account for such poor growth (~5-fold reduced in a single cycle, day 3-5)? It would additionally be interesting to see a cell-cycle length assessment and invasion assay, to see if Maf1-low parasites have further defects in growth.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that there is still much to uncover relating to the PfMaf1 signaling pathway. While we still do not know each component, we have been able to link external factors (of course not limited to only magnesium) to the increased nuclear occupancy of PfMaf1. Other protein interactors that potentially regulate PfMaf1, while not confirmed, have been identified in plasma sample as candidates for future experiments to validate their potential involvement of RNA Pol III inhibition.</p>

It is unclear whether plasma magnesium is increased during asymptomatic malaria or decreased during symptomatic infection, as the study does not include control groups with non-infected individuals.

</disp-quote>
<p>This reviewer raised a valid point. The plasma magnesium levels for the wet symptomatic samples (averaging [0.79mM]) were within the normal range of a healthy individual (between [0.75-0.95mM]) while the dry asymptomatic levels were above the normal range (averaging [1.13mM]). Ideally, we would have liked to have control uninfected plasma samples from individuals from The Gambia. Unfortunately, field studies and human volunteer studies do not always have all the ideal controls that in vitro studies have. We recognize that [3mM] is higher than the normal range for magnesium levels, which is why we included a revised Supplementary Figure 3A. This figure shows that magnesium concentrations as low as [1mM] (similar to the levels found in dry asymptomatic samples) reduced the expression of RNA Pol III-transcribed genes.</p>

<p>We agree that the resolution of IFA images does not allow to support the WB data. We believe that the importance of the IFA Supplementary Figure is to show that PfMaf1 clusters together in foci, which has not been previously reported.</p>

<p>We agree that, ideally, we would have liked to do full RNA-seq on The Gambia samples. However, that was out of the scope of this project. The RNA samples were limited which is why we did not use more primers. We believe that an appropriate number of replicates was done for the experiments. The wet symptomatic samples from this study were from mildly symptomatic individuals, as stated in the manuscript. Therefore, CD36 was a relevant receptor to use for our studies.</p>
<p>We agree that the published studies about magnesium levels in infected individuals are not always consistent. What these studies do not consider is the time of year, whether the infection occurred during the dry or wet season. These studies were also done in different regions of the world using different technologies. For this reason, we only highlight the observed difference observed in our field study data from The Gambia.</p>

While understanding the exact mechanism or involvement of magnesium as a stress condition was not the scope of this manuscript, we believe that our data will be valuable into demonstrating that external stimuli act on P. falciparum virulence gene expression via RNA Pol III inhibition. Since we also had plasma level data for magnesium, and not isoleucine, we believed it made for a better external factor to use for our in vitro studies.</p>

<p>(2) The proteomics, conducted to seek partners of Maf1, is probably the weakest part. From Figure S3: the proteins highlighted in the text are clearly highly selected (as ones that might be relevant, e.g. phosphatases), but many others are more enriched. It would be good to see the whole list, and which GO terms actually came top in enrichment.</p>

<p>We apologize if the reviewer did not see the attached supplementary Co-IP MS data. The file includes all proteins found in each sample as well as GO term analysis. For the purpose of this work, we highlight proteins potentially involved in the canonical role of Maf1 that have been shown in model organisms to reversibly inhibit RNA Pol III (phosphatases, RNA Pol III subunits).</p>

<p>(3) Figure 3 shows the Maf1-low line has very poor growth after only 5 days but it is stated that no dead parasites are seen even after 8 cycles and the merozoites number is down only ~18 to 15... is this too small to account for such poor growth (~5-fold reduced in a single cycle, day 3-5)? It would additionally be interesting to see a cell-cycle length assessment and invasion assay, to see if Maf1-low parasites have further defects in growth.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer that the observed reduced merozoite numbers may not the only cause of the reduced growth rate. Other factors in the  PfMaf1 knock-down line may contribute to the observed poor growth.</p>
