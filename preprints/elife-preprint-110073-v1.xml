<abstract><p>The spatial organization of chromatin into active (A) and inactive (B) nuclear compartments is fundamental to genome regulation, yet their cell-cycle dynamics remain largely unexplored. Most research on chromatin dynamics during the cell cycle has primarily focused on events surrounding mitosis, providing only limited insight into chromatin behavior during S-phase. To address this gap, we developed a simple, drug-free approach that combines the Fucci cell-cycle indicator with <italic>in situ</italic> Hi-C to comprehensively analyze A/B compartment dynamics throughout interphase in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Unexpectedly, and contrary to prevailing views, we found that A/B compartment strength increased abruptly upon S-phase entry, stabilized during S-phase, and subsequently declined in late S/G2. This abrupt strengthening, which we termed ‘compartment maturation,’ required passage through the G1/S transition but was independent of active DNA synthesis. This maturation involved substantial architectural remodeling, particularly within the A compartment, which consolidated into a more organized structure as individual A domains rearranged to form long-range interactions. Moreover, compartment maturation was not limited to mESCs but was also observed across different developmental contexts in mice. Based on these observations, we propose a revised, stepwise model of nuclear compartmentalization during cell-cycle progression, consisting of four distinct stages: chromosome unfolding (G1), chromatin maturation (G1/S), stabilization (S phase), and refolding (G2). These findings reveal the unexpected plasticity of A/B compartments and underscore the G1/S transition as a critical period for their reorganization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome within the nucleus plays a fundamental role in regulating essential cellular processes, including gene expression, DNA replication, and repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. High-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> have revolutionized our ability to probe this organization, revealing the existence of megabase (Mb)-scale chromosomal compartments in interphase cells. These appear as a characteristic plaid pattern on Hi-C contact maps, reflecting the segregation of chromatin into self-interacting active (A) and inactive (B) nuclear compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. This pattern is identified computationally through principal component analysis (PCA) of the Hi-C contact matrix, where the first principal component (PC1) serves as a quantitative eigenvector; genomic bins are assigned to A (positive PC1 values) or B (negative PC1 values) compartments based on their correlated interaction profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Broadly speaking, A and B compartments correspond to euchromatin and heterochromatin, typically located in the nuclear interior and at the nuclear periphery, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Despite their fundamental significance in genome function, the principles governing compartment formation remain largely elusive. Over the past decade, researchers have increasingly focused on the cell cycle regulation to unravel the principles of chromatin organization, given that compartments are largely lost during mitosis and re-established during interphase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. This process begins as chromosomes compact into their distinct, rod-like shapes during prophase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Following mitosis, as cells traverse the M/G1 transition, chromosomes expand from this highly condensed state and gradually unfold to re-establish interphase chromatin architecture. Time-course Hi-C studies of this critical window<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> supported a &quot;compartment expansion&quot; model, positing that compartment boundaries are established soon after mitotic exit, followed by a gradual strengthening of chromatin interactions and their simultaneous expansion outward from the diagonal on Hi-C contact maps, reflecting the progressive increase in long-range interactions during G1. This progression culminates in the model proposed in the pioneering study by Nagano <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, where compartmentalization progressively strengthens after mitotic exit, peaking in G2 just before its rapid collapse in the subsequent mitosis.</p>
<p>Despite these insights, significant gaps remain in our knowledge. Although compartments were among the first structures identified in Hi-C maps, they have often not been the primary focus of studies and are frequently treated as binary, static entities. Even when they have been investigated, the emphasis has typically been placed on Hi-C PC1-defined compartment boundaries rather than on the internal dynamics of the compartments themselves. Furthermore, variability in compartment calculation methods across studies complicates direct comparisons and hampers a comprehensive understanding. Importantly, while previous studies have illuminated events around mitosis, they have left the S-phase notably underexplored. This is a critical gap given the strong correlation between A/B compartments and DNA replication timing, whereby A regions replicate in early S-phase and B regions in late S-phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The fragmented nature of the existing cell-cycle Hi-C datasets is further complicated by the reliance on synchronization drugs in most studies, which can introduce population heterogeneity and confound biological interpretation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we address these challenges by thoroughly investigating the temporal dynamics of interphase A/B compartments, with a special emphasis on the G1-to-S transition, a crucial yet understudied period for the coordinated establishment of 3D genome structure and DNA replication.</p>

<title>Drug-free cell cycle-phasing system in mESCs</title>
<p>To investigate how A/B nuclear compartments change throughout the cell cycle, we established a drug-free synchronization approach in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to avoid the heterogeneity associated with the use of chemical inhibitors. For high-resolution cell-cycle discrimination, we used the Fucci (SA) mESC line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, which expresses Cdt1-mCherry in G1 (degraded at the G1/S transition) and Geminin-mVenus in S/G2/M (accumulating from S-phase entry onwards) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The reciprocal fluorescence patterns of Cdt1 and Geminin enabled distinct and dynamic visualization of cell cycle phases, thereby allowing accurate sorting of highly pure cell populations for Hi-C without relying on chemical synchronization.</p>

</fig>
<p>To confirm the suitability of the Fucci markers for this purpose, we performed imaging and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis following EdU staining, which labels S-phase cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). As expected, EdU incorporation correlated with Geminin signal accumulation and Cdt1 signal depletion (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B,C</xref>).</p>
<p>To monitor cell-cycle progression of individual cells, we conducted time-lapse imaging over a 50-hour period, capturing images every 10 minutes using Differential Interference Contrast (DIC), mCherry (Cdt1), and mVenus (Geminin) fluorescence (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). We manually tracked individual cells and included only those that completed a full cell cycle from one mitosis to the next for quantitative analysis (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>). Our analysis revealed minimal variation in overall cell-cycle length among cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref>). We also quantified the duration of the G1 phase for each cell, which we defined as the time from mitosis until mCherry fluorescence reached its peak. The remaining time was defined as the duration of the S/G2/M phase. The G1 phase lasted approximately 1.5 hours (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2D</xref>), consistent with the known characteristically short G1 phase of mESCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, with relatively small cell-to-cell variability (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B,D</xref>).</p>
<p>The above results confirmed that Fucci markers could reliably delineate cell-cycle phases, allowing us to sort homogeneous populations by FACS for subsequent Hi-C analysis. To achieve this, asynchronously growing cells were first fixed, permeabilized, and stained for DNA before being subjected to FACS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). S-phase cells (subdivided into early, mid, and late S, each representing approximately 3-hour time windows, assuming a 10-hour S-phase) and G2-phase cells were sorted based on DNA content (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). For G1 cells, we employed a sequential gating strategy using both Fucci markers and DNA content (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The population was first gated to include only Geminin-negative cells, followed by a second gate selecting only cells with a 2C DNA content. From this refined G1 population, we further sorted early, mid, and late G1 fractions based on ascending mCherry fluorescence intensity, with each fraction comprising approximately 30% of the population to achieve sub-hour temporal resolution. Finally, the sorted cells (0.5–1 million cells per fraction) were subjected to in situ Hi-C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Stepwise changes in higher-order chromatin organization during interphase</title>
<p>Hi-C biological replicates were highly concordant (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A,B</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, we observed a continuum of cis-interactions throughout interphase, as shown by contact decay profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Cis-compartment structure and boundaries (Hi-C PC1) were already distinguishable from early G1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>), albeit with a low PC1 contribution rate at this stage (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D</xref>). Furthermore, Hi-C interaction maps (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>) revealed that long-range chromatin interactions formed gradually from early G1 to late G1, expanding away from the diagonal on the map, as previously described in M-to-G1 time-course Hi-C studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, however, this expansion from the diagonal culminated in late G1, when interactions spanning the farthest genomic distances (i.e., the regions most distant from the diagonal) were most pronounced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>). This trend was also evident in the contact decay profiles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) and contact probability plots (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>), which showed the greatest enrichment for contacts &gt; 50 Mb in late G1. As cells entered S-phase, the Hi-C plaid pattern showed a distinct increase in sharpness, which subsequently became progressively blurred during late S-phase and further in G2. Notably, G2 cells displayed a thickened signal along the Hi-C map diagonal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>), a chromatin organization reminiscent of mitotic chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. This finding suggests that the onset of mitotic chromosome condensation may occur earlier than previously thought, during G2 phase (as discussed further below).</p>
<p>While a previous study has linked DNA replication to stronger compartmentalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, we found that the change in compartment strength was strikingly abrupt during the late G1 to early-S transition, as revealed by saddle plots, which quantify Hi-C contact enrichment between genomic bins ranked by their PC1 values (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H,I</xref>). This shift, which we refer to as ‘compartment maturation’, was accompanied by a notable depletion of A-B interactions and an enrichment of A-A interactions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). Compartment strength then stabilized during S phase, which constitutes the longest phase of the mESC cell cycle (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>, &gt; 60% cells in S-phase by FACS). Subsequently, a decrease in compartment strength began in late S, followed by an even more significant decrease in G2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H,I</xref>). This mirrored the observation from the Hi-C maps mentioned earlier (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>).</p>
<p>The observed decrease in compartment strength during G2 contrasted with a previous report by Nagano <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, which showed maximal compartmentalization in G2. However, it should be noted that a unique compartment identification method was employed in that single-cell Hi-C study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, distinct from the standard <italic>de novo</italic> compartment calling approach used in most Hi-C studies (see <bold>Supplementary Note</bold> for details). Therefore, we attribute this discrepancy not to differences in biological samples or chromatin conformation capture technologies, but rather to technical or interpretative differences arising from the distinct A/B compartment identification methods used. To further support this conclusion, we reanalyzed the cell cycle-phased pooled single-cell Hi-C data from Nagano <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> using the conventional compartment-calling method and observed a trend consistent with our findings (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>), with compartment strength being maximal in early/mid S and decreasing in late S/G2. Thus, our analysis reconciles the apparent discrepancy with Nagano <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and supports a revised model in which compartment strength peaks in early S-phase and subsequently weakens toward G2, rather than continuously strengthening throughout interphase.</p>
<p>Notably, the pooled single-cell Hi-C data from Nagano <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> showed a clear diagonal thickening in late S/G2 cells (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C</xref>), in agreement with our observations above (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the structural transition toward mitotic chromosomes may already be initiated in late G2, a view further supported by a live-cell imaging study of interphase-to-mitosis chromosome dynamics showing prophase-like chromosome axis prealignment during G2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Compartment maturation requires S-phase entry but is independent of active DNA synthesis</title>
<p>Intrigued by the abrupt and pronounced compartmentalization shift, or compartment maturation, observed during the short transition from late G1 to early S, we investigated its relationship to DNA replication. Specifically, we asked whether the G1-to-S transition was the direct cause of compartment maturation, or whether the shift in compartmentalization reflects an intrinsic chromatin program that proceeds independently of cell-cycle stage. To test this, we designed two distinct cell-cycle perturbation experiments to induce prolonged arrest at two critical points, either just before or at the start of S-phase, and assessed their effects on compartment architecture.</p>
<p>Our first experimental perturbation aimed to determine whether prolonged G1-arrest, preventing S-phase entry altogether, would influence compartment maturation. Preventing S-phase entry in mESCs is particularly challenging; however, we found that the mTOR inhibitor INK-128 induces a reversible G1-like arrest in mESCs at a concentration of 1 µM (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). Cells were treated with INK-128 for 24, 72, and 120 hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). FACS analysis confirmed that cells remained arrested at a 2C DNA content at all timepoints. Concurrently, they exhibited a Geminin-negative state, while maintaining high levels of Cdt1, features characteristic of late G1 cells (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A</xref>). To minimize technical artifacts arising from copy-number differences, cells with a 2C DNA content were sorted at all three timepoints prior to performing Hi-C (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A</xref>).</p>

<p>Hi-C contact maps from INK-128-treated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) resembled a late G1-like chromatin organization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Saddle plot profiles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) similarly showed compartment strength comparable to that of late G1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). Although INK-128-treated cells displayed a slightly higher degree of compartment segregation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and increased long-range interaction formation relative to typical late G1 cells (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7B</xref>), the characteristic upward shift in compartment segregation and the enrichment of A-A interactions, indicative of compartment maturation, were notably absent.</p>
<p>The second experiment examined the effect of prolonged G1/S arrest on chromatin compartments. mESCs were first arrested at metaphase using Nocodazole and then released into medium containing a high concentration of Thymidine. Cells were subsequently collected at 3-hour intervals post-release (3, 6, 9, and 12 hours) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). FACS profiles (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7C</xref>) confirmed the accumulation of cells with a 2C DNA content following release from Nocodazole arrest. Approximately 6 hours after release, cells began to enter S-phase, as indicated by their transition from a Cdt1-positive/Geminin-negative (Cdt1+Geminin–) to a Cdt1-negative/Geminin-positive (Cdt1–Geminin+) state (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7C</xref>). This S-phase fraction progressively increased, leading to an almost complete conversion of 2C DNA content cells to the Cdt1–Geminin+ state after 12 hours of Thymidine treatment, with virtually no remaining G1 (Cdt1+Geminin–) cells. These results confirm that the cell population was successfully synchronized at the G1/S boundary, representing a pre-replicative state where replication had not yet initiated, although cell-cycle markers indicated entry into S-phase.</p>
<p>As in the previous time-course experiment, cells collected at all timepoints were FACS-sorted based on their 2C DNA content prior to performing Hi-C (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7C</xref>). Hi-C analysis of these samples revealed the emergence of a distinct plaid pattern as early as 3 hours post-release from Nocodazole (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), with compartment strength (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>) comparable to that of late G1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G,H</xref>). Strikingly, despite sharing the same 2C DNA content, compartment strength continued to increase over time, as evidenced by the progressive sharpening of the Hi-C plaid pattern (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) and by saddle plot analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). By 9 and 12 hours of Thymidine treatment, A/B compartment strength had reached levels similar to those of normal early- to mid-S cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G,H</xref>). Furthermore, contact probability plots comparing late G1 and Thymidine-treated cells (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7D</xref>) revealed an ‘S-like’ trajectory, characterized by a decrease in long-range interactions relative to late G1.</p>
<p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the Thymidine- and INK-128-treated Hi-C matrices, alongside those from normal cell-cycle phases, further clarified these findings (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Specifically, INK-128-treated samples clustered closely with late G1, whereas Thymidine-treated cells aligned closely with the S-phase trajectory, particularly along the PC1 axis, which accounted for 78% of the total variation. Additionally, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) followed by k-means clustering (k=2) of saddle plot data (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7E</xref>) revealed a clear separation between INK-128 and Thymidine samples.</p>
<p>Thymidine-treated cells—with the exception of the ‘THY_3H’ sample, which largely represented G1 cells—clustered with S-phase samples (thus S-like), whereas INK-128-treated cells grouped with G1 (thus G1-like).</p>
<p>Collectively, our results demonstrate that maturation of nuclear A/B compartments is a direct consequence of S-phase entry, and that this structural reorganization occurs independently of active DNA synthesis.</p>

<title>Formation of a consolidated A compartment in S-phase</title>
<p>To characterize compartment maturation in greater detail, we performed subcompartment analysis using the Calder2 tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. This computational framework integrates information from multiple principal components of the Hi-C contact matrix to classify genome structures into eight distinct types based on their multi-dimensional interaction signatures. The resulting subcompartments, ranked from 0.125 (strongest B) to 1 (strongest A), provide a finer resolution view of the organization within global A/B compartments. Given the high concordance of our cell-cycle-phased Hi-C biological replicates, we merged them for all downstream analyses.</p>
<p>Visual inspection of subcompartment profiles for individual chromosomes at 40-kb resolution (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>) revealed that, from early S-phase onward, minor variations among A subcompartment domains were largely lost and replaced by more homogeneous, predominantly strong A (dark red) domains. Quantification of genomic bins assigned to each subcompartment type (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) revealed a striking and progressive accumulation of strong A subcompartment genomic bins (rank 1) from early G1, peaking in mid S-phase and decreasing thereafter in late S and G2. Concurrently, weak A and B bins were reduced from early G1 to mid S, suggesting a transition of subcompartments towards stronger A states. Consistent with this, comparison of the average sizes of different subcompartment domains between late G1 and early S (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) revealed that only A subcompartment domains increased significantly in size, with the most statistically significant change observed in strong A subcompartment domains (ranks 0.875 and 1).</p>

<p>We also observed a &quot;smoother&quot; appearance in A-compartment profiles (Hi-C PC1 &gt; 0) in S-phase cells, characterized by fewer signal spikes (example shown in <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9A</xref>). To quantify this trend, we calculated the mean-square gradient (MSG), defined as the average of the squared difference between adjacent signal values (see Methods). A larger MSG value reflects a more irregular (spiky) compartment signal, whereas a lower value indicates a smoother signal (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9B</xref>). By measuring the MSG ratio between strong A versus B compartments, we found that in early G1, the A-compartment signal was more than twice as irregular as the B-compartment signal. However, upon S-phase entry and throughout cell-cycle progression, this ratio steadily declined, and by late S and G2, the two signals had converged to a similar degree of smoothness (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9C</xref>). When comparing the average MSG of the strongest A and B compartment regions (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9D</xref>), we observed no consistent trend for the B compartment. In contrast, the A compartment signal progressively became smoother, reaching maximal smoothness (lowest MSG value) in mid-S, followed by an increase in late S and G2.</p>
<p>These results reveal a previously unrecognized feature of chromatin organization during S-phase progression, whereby the A compartment becomes highly dynamic and reorganizes into a more uniform, consolidated strong A compartment. We refer to this process as “A-compartment consolidation.”</p>

<title>A-compartment consolidation is a robust feature across developmental contexts</title>
<p>mESCs possess a unique nuclear architecture characterized by more open and decondensed chromatin, presenting fewer and more dispersed heterochromatin foci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and a generally less compartmentalized 3D genome compared with their differentiated counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. This distinctive organization prompted us to ask whether the S-phase-associated A-compartment consolidation observed in mESCs is a unique feature of pluripotent cells or represents a more broadly conserved phenomenon across other cell types.</p>
<p>To address this question, we utilized the single-cell HiRES (Hi-C and RNA-seq employed simultaneously) dataset from Liu <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, which provides comprehensive single-cell Hi-C and RNA-seq data across a wide range of cell types, developmental stages, and cell-cycle phases. Although the accompanying metadata include extensive annotations for individual cells, identifying specific cell types at defined developmental stages and cell-cycle phases with sufficient read coverage for robust population-level analysis proved challenging. We therefore focused our analysis on four distinct cell types spanning three developmental stages—neural ectoderm (E7.5), neural tube (E8.5), mixed late mesenchyme (E10.5), and extra-embryonic (ExE) endoderm (E7.5) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>)—that provided sufficient Hi-C read coverage for both G1 and mid-S phase populations (see Table S1). This selection captured a developmental continuum extending beyond the stage equivalent to mESCs, which corresponds approximately to E4.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. We then performed pseudo-bulk Hi-C analysis by aggregating Hi-C reads from individual cells, grouped by cell-cycle phase (G1 and mid-S) within each selected cell type and developmental stage.</p>

<p>In all four cell types, we observed the characteristic increase in compartment strength (maturation) previously seen in mESCs when comparing late G1 and mid-S cells. Furthermore, we detected the hallmark increase in A-A interactions during the G1-to-mid-S transition, even in cell types where B-B interactions were more prominent than A-A interactions in G1, such as mixed late mesenchyme (E10.5) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>Calder subcompartment analysis of all four cell types at 200-kb resolution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) mirrored the trend observed in mESCs, showing an enrichment of strong A (rank 1) subcompartment bins and a corresponding reduction in weak subcompartment bins in mid-S cells. Together, these findings strongly indicate that compartment maturation and the accompanying A-compartment consolidation represent a robust and universally observed feature across different developmental contexts.</p>

<title>A-compartment consolidation during S-phase involves enhanced long-range contacts and structural reorganization</title>
<p>To further characterize A-compartment consolidation, we performed a distance-based compartment strength analysis using the Pentad tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Specifically, we quantified interactions within A (A-A), within B (B-B), and between A and B (A-B) compartments across four genomic distance ranges: short-range (1–10 Mb), mid-range (10–25 Mb), mid/long-range (25–50 Mb) and long-range (&gt; 50 Mb) throughout interphase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). As expected, positive interaction frequencies were observed for A-A and B-B pairs, and negative frequencies for A-B pairs, at all stages. More notably, our analysis revealed a marked enrichment of long-range A-A interactions emerging in early S-phase, which was substantially reduced in G2. Concurrently, we observed a depletion of short- and mid-range A-B interactions in early S-phase that persisted through mid-S, followed by a slight increase in late-S and a more pronounced increase in G2. In contrast, interactions showed minimal change across all distances throughout interphase.</p>

<p>By measuring intra-compartment (intra-A and intra-B; i.e., short-range A-A and B-B) and inter-compartment (inter-A and inter-B; i.e., long-range A-A and B-B) interaction strengths (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), we found that all interaction types followed a general &quot;rise-and-fall&quot; trend, similar to that observed in non-distance-based saddle plots (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H,I</xref>), with the most pronounced and statistically significant changes occurring from late G1 to early S. Most notably, inter-A interaction strength exhibited the largest and most statistically significant increase during this transition (<italic>P</italic> = 1.74 x 10⁻¹LJ, Δ median = 0.64) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B,C</xref>), corroborating our observation of enriched long-range A-A interactions during S-phase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). These observations point to large-scale rearrangements within A-compartment regions as a potential driver of the global shift in A/B compartment segregation at the G1/S transition.</p>
<p>To further investigate this, we visually inspected Hi-C contact maps of A-compartment domains from late G1 and early S-phase. This revealed a striking pattern of spatial reorganization in large A domains, characterized by a sharp reduction in interactions between A-compartment boundaries and their internal regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, purple dotted circles). Most notably, these large A domains became selectively inaccessible to neighboring smaller A domains, with only boundary-associated interactions persisting (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, black rectangles). The recurrence of this pattern across multiple domains (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>) suggested a non-random spatial reorganization specific to S phase. We hypothesize that this reorganization process reflects the formation of &quot;peninsula-like&quot; structures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>), in which internal A regions extend outward while remaining tethered at their bases (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p>

<title>3D modeling reveals the structural basis of cell cycle-dependent A/B compartment dynamics</title>
<p>To obtain a structural perspective on the proposed &quot;peninsula-like&quot; formations, we performed quantitative 3D modeling of chromosomes across all sampled interphase stages using LorDG, a deterministic genome modeler within the GenomeFlow pipeline that generates reproducible polymer-like 3D structures from Hi-C data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.

<p>To quantitatively assess the formation of &quot;peninsula-like&quot; structures, we measured global A-domain extension, defined as the size-normalized shortest boundary-to-center distance. Analysis of small (1–5 Mb) and large (&gt; 5 Mb) domains revealed that only large A domains showed a significant increase in global extension from late G1 to early S-phase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B, left panels</xref>). Importantly, this extension occurred without changes in the inter-boundary distance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B, right panels</xref>), supporting a model in which internal chromatin regions extend outward from anchored boundaries from late G1 to early S—a global spatial reorganization specific to domains larger than 5 Mb.</p>
<p>We next asked whether B compartment domains underwent similar global structural changes. In stark contrast to A domains, they exhibited a significant decrease in both center-to-boundary and boundary-to-boundary distances across all domain sizes (1–5 Mb and &gt; 5 Mb), reflecting global chromatin compaction during the late G1 to early S transition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p>
<p>Having established that both A and B domains undergo major global reorganization from late G1 to early S, we next examined whether these structural changes in A and B domains were accompanied by alterations in local chromatin compaction (i.e., changes in the physical packing of the polymer-like fiber). To assess this, we calculated the average bin-to-bin distance within size-stratified domains as a proxy for local compaction levels. A decrease or increase in this metric would reflect tighter or looser local packing, respectively, whereas stable values would indicate unchanged local packing at this scale.</p>
<p>In A-compartment domains, significant changes in local compaction levels were detected only between early and mid-G1 (decompaction) and between late S and G2 (compaction), with compaction levels converging to a uniform state across domains in G2 (as indicated by the minimal dynamic range), reaching values comparable to those of B domains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>, <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Fig. S12A,B</xref>). However, A-domain local compaction remained essentially unchanged from late G1 through S phase, despite substantial global structural reorganization of these domains. Thus, the emergence of “peninsula-like” structures in large A domains reflects global positional rearrangements rather than changes in local chromatin compaction.</p>
<p>As expected, B domains were generally more compact than A domains across all cell-cycle stages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>, <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Fig. S12A</xref>). However, their most significant local compaction shift occurred specifically between late G1 and early S, becoming more uniformly compact at the onset of S-phase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref><bold>, right panels; </bold><xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Fig. S12C</xref>). This finding implies a previously unrecognized active contribution of B-compartment domain reorganization in S-phase-dependent compartment maturation.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results refine our understanding of A/B compartment structural dynamics throughout interphase. The simulations not only recapitulated known features, such as chromosome decompaction from early to late G1, but also uncovered previously underappreciated aspects of compartment maturation during S-phase. Specifically, they revealed global changes in the spatial trajectory of A-domain chromatin without local chromatin compaction changes, providing a mechanistic explanation for the gain of long-range interactions and the emergence of consolidated A-compartment domains observed in S-phase (described in the previous section). Moreover, our analyses revealed that B-domains are also actively engaged in compartment maturation, showing more uniform compaction locally and globally in early S, an aspect previously overlooked by conventional Hi-C analyses. Finally, our analyses showed that the G2 phase is characterized by uniformly compact local chromatin across the genome.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we established a simple cell sorting and chromatin profiling strategy that precisely resolves cell-cycle phases across the entire interphase. Using this system, we could capture cell populations with exceptionally high temporal resolution, achieving sub-hour resolution within the G1 phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). By applying comprehensive, A/B compartment-centric analyses to these carefully staged populations, we obtained a nuanced view of how nuclear organization is dynamically remodeled throughout interphase. This approach allowed us to propose a revised model of cell cycle-dependent chromatin dynamics that challenges the prevailing view (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Our model delineates a stepwise cell cycle phase-dependent reorganization of nuclear compartmentalization, comprising four distinct stages. The first stage, chromosome unfolding, occurs from early to late G1 phase as chromatin expands from its highly compacted mitotic state. This is followed by compartment maturation, a sudden enhancement of A/B compartment separation at the onset of S-phase. The third stage, compartment stabilization, persists throughout S-phase, and finally, chromosome refolding is seen during G2 as the cell prepares for mitosis. Our primary focus was on the previously overlooked maturation stage, which we characterized in detail. We found that this reorganization is a direct consequence of S-phase entry but occurs independently of ongoing DNA synthesis. A defining feature of this stage is the formation of a consolidated A compartment, involving extensive spatial reorganization of individual A domains and the establishment of extensive long-range A-A interactions.</p>

<caption><title>Model of stepwise 3D genome reorganization during the cell cycle</title>
<p>The model proposes four sequential stages: (1) Chromosome unfolding (G1): Gradual formation of long-range interactions from the compact mitotic state. (2) Compartment maturation (G1/S Transition): An abrupt enhancement of compartmentalization upon S-phase entry, independent of DNA synthesis. This stage is characterized by A-compartment consolidation, accompanied by increased long-range A-A interactions and uniform compaction of the B compartment. (3) Compartment stabilization (S-phase): The matured compartment state is maintained throughout the S phase. (4) Chromosome refolding (G2): Global compaction begins in preparation for mitosis.</p></caption>

<p>Our findings provide several key conceptual insights. While the M-to-G1 and G2-to-M phase transitions are well known for their dramatic chromatin reorganization, we contend that the G1-to-S transition is equally critical yet remains significantly underexplored. This period may represent a rich time window for discovering and characterizing novel 3D genome regulators. Importantly, our results identify S-phase entry as a major driving force of large-scale 3D genome reorganization, prompting a reconsideration of how replication and chromatin architecture are functionally linked.</p>
<p>The prevailing view holds that replication timing is a readout of a pre-established nuclear framework defined by stable compartments and domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. However, our data indicate that this hierarchy warrants re-evaluation. We propose a model of dynamic interplay, in which chromatin modifications associated with G1-to-S transition actively reshape the very architectural landscape from which the replication program itself is derived. Our results also reveal an unexpected plasticity of A/B compartment organization, even within a single cell type, an aspect often overlooked due to the predominant focus on Hi-C PC1 of asynchronously growing cell populations when assessing A/B compartments. This finding underscores that, while the field increasingly pursues ever-higher data resolution at sub-TAD and loop levels, there remains much to learn about chromatin structure at a global scale. High-resolution approaches, though valuable, should not overshadow the importance of coarse-grained perspectives, as demonstrated by our findings. Finally, it is important to note that our analysis, although based on highly resolved and precisely staged cell populations, remains an ensemble measurement. Future studies combining ultra-high temporal resolution with single-cell analysis will be essential to resolve the precise kinetics and cell-to-cell heterogeneity of these cell cycle-dependent chromatin reorganization events.</p>
<p>Biologically, this dynamic S-phase chromatin behavior raises the question of its functional significance, prompting us to speculate on the roles this reorganization may serve. One plausible role is to facilitate DNA replication: A-compartment regions are gene-rich, euchromatic, and replicate early in S-phase. Their active reorganization during early S could enhance the accessibility or spatial coordination of replication origins and associated factors. It is tempting to speculate that this reorganization supports the formation of coupled replication factories, where sister replisomes function as a single coordinated unit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, which would promote efficient initiation and smooth progression of replication forks. Such structural flexibility may help optimize replication efficiency and ensure faithful execution of the replication timing program.</p>
<p>A second possibility is that this remodeling improves coordination between replication and transcription. Given that A-compartment regions are also transcriptionally active, their reorganization during replication may help alleviate topological conflicts between transcriptional and replication machineries, allowing both processes to proceed efficiently. Moreover, the rearrangement of A domains could expand the effective interface with nuclear bodies such as splicing speckles, thereby promoting compartmental segregation and optimizing functional compartmentalization during the critical process of DNA replication. These interpretations align with recent work demonstrating that the relative positioning of genomic regions with respect to nuclear locales influences genome organization, replication timing regulation, and gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Uncovering the biological significance of these chromatin dynamics first requires identifying the molecular factors responsible for compartment maturation in S-phase. Components of the replication machinery (particularly those not directly involved in DNA synthesis) represent an intriguing class of potential regulators. Their potential to influence higher-order chromatin organization is supported by recent findings, including evidence that certain replisome components in <italic>Drosophila</italic> undergo phase separation and that replisome loading can restrict chromatin motion independently of DNA synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Beyond the core replisome, other S-phase-associated factors and molecular processes—such as transcriptional machinery, chromatin modifiers, architectural proteins, and nuclear organizers—are also plausible candidates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Elucidating the precise roles and interplay of these components will be an important next step in understanding the mechanistic basis of compartment maturation.</p>
<p>While our work primarily focused on the critical G1-to-S transition, events occurring during S-to-G2 transition warrant equal attention. We speculate that mitotic chromosome reformation may begin in G2—potentially earlier than currently appreciated—to facilitate more efficient chromosome segregation. Such early initiation would likely minimize disruption to ongoing nuclear processes. Accordingly, the S/G2 boundary represents another promising window for investigating cell-cycle dependent chromatin reorganization. In summary, our findings support a dynamic, cell-cycle-aware model of A/B compartmentalization, in which chromatin architecture is precisely tuned to accommodate and coordinate essential nuclear functions at the appropriate time.</p>

<p>The R26p-Fucci2 mESC line was obtained from the RIKEN BDR animal facility, LARGE (derived from the R26p-Fucci2 mouse line, Acc. No. CDB0203T). To perform accurate flow cytometry (FACS) color compensation for this dual-reporter line, we also derived control mESC lines from single-reporter mice.

Individual blastocysts were plated onto a feeder layer of mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in ES cell derivation medium. The medium was composed of KnockOut<sup>TM</sup> DMEM (ThermoFisher, 10829018) supplemented with 20% knockout serum replacement (KSR, Gibco,10828-028), 1x MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids (Nacalai, 06344-56), 1x EmbryoMax® Nucleosides (Millipore, ES-008-D), 0.5 mg/mL penicillin-streptomycin (Nacalai, 09367-34), 100 µM beta-mercaptoethanol (Gibco, 21985-023), 1 µM PD0325901 (Wako, 162-25291), 3 µM CHIR99021 (Wako, 034-23103), and 1000 U/mL leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, Nacalai, NU0012-2). After 5–7 days of incubation at 37°C with 5% COLJ, the inner cell mass outgrowth was dissociated and replated. Emerging mESC colonies were selectively picked, expanded, and passaged to establish stable cell lines. The mouse ESC lines R26-mCherry-hCdt1 (Fucci-red), R26-mVenus-hGeminin (Fucci-green), R26p-Fucci2, and CBMS1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> (non-fluorescent) were maintained in 2i/LIF medium.

<title>Live-cell imaging of Fucci mESCs</title>
<p>Fucci mESCs were plated at a density of 0.1 million cells/mL in a 12-well plate and allowed to adhere for several hours prior to imaging. Live-cell imaging was performed for 50 hours using the Celldiscoverer 7 automated microscope (Zeiss), acquiring images every 10 minutes. Imaging was conducted with a 20x objective (NA 0.5) using the system’s automated focus maintenance. Fluorescence of the Fucci reporters was captured using the following settings: mCherry was excited with a 590 nm LED and emission was collected with a 635/50 nm bandpass filter; mVenus was excited with a 520 nm LED and emission was collected with a 540/25 nm bandpass filter. Simultaneous transmitted light images were acquired using both Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) and Phase Contrast modalities. For the analysis of the live-cell imaging data, manual tracking of nuclei was performed using the TrackMate plugin (v6.0.30) in Fiji using DIC and phase contrast images (tracker radius was set to 5 pixels). Only cells that completed a full cell cycle, defined as starting two frames after cell division and ending at the last frame before the subsequent cell division, were analyzed. The mean fluorescence intensities (mVenus and mCherry) for each tracked nucleus were exported using the TrackMate Extras plugin. Subsequent data processing and analysis were performed in R (v4.3.2). Briefly, the data from two biological replicates were merged, and cell cycle trajectories were aligned to the start of G1 phase. Fluorescence signals were baseline-corrected by subtracting the minimum intensity for each channel per cell. This pipeline was used to quantify cell cycle length, G1 length (timing of when cells reach maximum mCherry intensity), and to plot the normalized Fucci fluorescence dynamics.</p>

<title>Cell cycle synchronization and collection for Hi-C</title>
<p>For Hi-C experiments, Fucci mESCs were collected under three primary conditions. First, to obtain cells at various cell cycle stages (EG1, MG1, LG1, ES, MS, LS, and G2), an asynchronous population was harvested directly (50-100 million cells per experiment). Second, for the G1/S time-course experiment, cells were synchronized at the G2/M border using a 10-hour treatment with 50 ng/mL Nocodazole (Sigma, M1404). One dish of these synchronized cells was harvested as the G2/M time point. In parallel, other synchronized dishes were washed twice with PBS and released into a medium containing 2.5 mM thymidine (Sigma, T1895); these were then harvested every 3 hours from 3 to 12 hours post-release (collecting 2-4 million cells per time point). Finally, for a G1 arrest time-course, asynchronous mESCs from separate dishes were treated with 1 µM INK-128 (MedChemExpress, HY-13328) and harvested at 24, 72, and 120-hour time points (collecting 2–4 million cells per time point). All collected samples from these procedures were processed for Hi-C and subsequent FACS analysis as described in the following section.</p>

<title>Sample preparation for Hi-C</title>
<p>All harvested cells were processed for Hi-C using an established protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> with minor modifications. Briefly, harvested cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature, using 1 mL of fixative per 1 million cells. The reaction was quenched with 0.125 M glycine. After permeabilization with 0.1% saponin, cells were stained with Hoechst33342 (10 µg/mL) for 30 minutes in the dark to label DNA for cell cycle analysis. Cells were then FACS-sorted using a Sony MA900 cell sorter in purity mode. Laser configurations were as previously described in the ’Flow Cytometry’ section, and the gating strategies for isolating specific cell cycle populations are detailed in the Results section and corresponding figures. Sorted cell pellets were immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80°C until Hi-C and library preparation. Then, Hi-C libraries were prepared from 0.5–1 million fixed cells (frozen pellets) according to an established protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In brief, nuclei were isolated, chromatin was digested with DpnII (NEB, R0543), and restriction fragment overhangs were filled with biotinylated nucleotides prior to blunt-end ligation. After reverse crosslinking and DNA purification, 0.5–1 µg of DNA was sheared to 150–400 bp fragments using a Covaris S220 sonicator, with size selection performed using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Biotin-labeled fragments were captured on Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280), and the resulting libraries were prepared for sequencing using the NGS LTP Library Preparation Kit (KK8232). Final libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq X platform to generate 150 bp paired-end reads (approximately 100 million reads per sample; range 70–130 million).</p>

Compartments were called from balanced .mcool files using a modified approach that calculates principal components through correlation and covariance matrices before PCA. The first principal component (PC1) was extracted as the compartment track, where positive values correspond to active (A) compartments and negative values to inactive (B) compartments. PC1 sign was oriented using a gene density track for mm9.

The MSG is defined as MSG = LJ(∂f/∂x)²LJ, where f(x) is the compartment signal as a function of genomic position x. This metric quantifies the average rate of change of the compartment signal, where higher values indicate more variable, less smooth signals, while lower values reflect more uniform, smoother compartment signals. The genomic gradient of PC1 was computed for all chromosomes in each cell cycle stage using the ‘numpy.gradient’ function in Python. To focus on core compartment domains while avoiding boundary regions, we selected genomic bins where the compartment signal exceeded one standard deviation above the chromosome mean for A compartments, or fell below one standard deviation for B compartments. The MSG was calculated separately for these strong A (MSG_A,1σ) and B (MSG_B,1σ) regions.

<title>Supplementary note: A comparison of methodologies for A/B compartment analysis</title>
<p>Our study characterizes compartment dynamics using <italic>de novo</italic> identification of A/B compartments from population Hi-C data. This approach differs fundamentally from the single-cell compartment &quot;strength&quot; metric pioneered by Nagano <italic>et al.</italic> (2017)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and the choice of methodology is directly linked to the specific biological question being addressed.</p>
<p>The method developed by Nagano <italic>et al.</italic> was designed to quantify cell-to-cell variation by first defining a stable reference map of A and B domains derived from pooled single-cell data. The compartment strength for each individual cell is then calculated based on how closely its intra-chromosomal contact pattern conforms to this pre-defined reference. This provides a robust measure of structural heterogeneity but inherently assesses fidelity to the population-average architecture, rather than the strength of compartmentalization per se.</p>
<p>In contrast, our <italic>de novo</italic> approach re-identifies compartment identities independently for each cell-cycle-staged population, allowing us to capture the temporal progression of compartment organization, including large-scale rearrangements and the emergence of new organizational states that would otherwise be masked by comparison to a static reference. Thus, while the method of Nagano <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> provides an excellent measure of compartment pattern conservation across cells, our approach is specifically tailored to reveal how these patterns evolve over time during cell-cycle progression.</p>

<p>This manuscript provides <bold>valuable</bold> insight into how genome organization changes as cells progress through the cell cycle after mitotic exit. The conclusions are supported by <bold>solid</bold>, rigorous data, and the use of sorted unsynchronized cells rather than cells treated with drugs is a particular strength. Two sharp genome remodeling events are identified at G1-S and to a lesser extent, at S-G2 transitions. A discussion on the limitations of Hi-C and a broader interpretation of results in the context of other mechanistic models would strengthen the overall rigor.</p>

<p>This work convincingly shows that, rather than gradually &quot;evolving&quot; throughout interphase, global chromatin architecture undergoes unexpectedly sharp remodeling at G1-S (and to a lesser extent, S-G2) transitions. By applying &quot;standard&quot; Hi-C analyses on carefully sorted cells, the authors provide an excellent temporal view of how global chromatin architecture is changed throughout the cell cycle. They show a surprisingly abrupt increase in compartmentation strength (particularly interactions between the &quot;active&quot; A compartments) at G1-S transition, which is slightly weakened at S-G2 transition. Follow-up experiments show convincingly that the compartment &quot;maturation&quot; does not require the DNA synthesis accompanying S phase per se, but the authors have not identified the responsible factors (work for future publications). The possible biological ramifications of these architectural changes (setting up potential replication &quot;factories&quot;, and/or facilitating transcription-replication conflict resolution, both more pertinent for the active A compartments, which are most affected) have been well discussed in the article, but still remain speculative at this stage.</p>
<p>My major criticism of this article is aimed more at the state of the field in general, rather than this specific article, but it should be discussed to give a more balanced view: what actually is a chromatin compartment? Chromosomal tracing and live tracking experiments have shown that the majority of &quot;structures&quot; identified from Hi-C experiments are statistical phenomena, with even &quot;strong&quot; interactions only being infrequent and transient. A-B compartments are &quot;built up&quot; from multiple very low-frequency &quot;interactions&quot;, so ascribing causal effects for genome functions is even tougher. As a result, I have very little confidence in the results of the authors' polymer simulations and their inferred &quot;peninsula&quot; A compartment structures without any other supporting experimental data.</p>
<p>Specific minor points:</p>
<p>(1) A better explanation for how Figure 1E was generated is required, because this figure could be very misleading. Figure 1F and all other cis-decay plots (and the Hi-C maps themselves) show that the strongest interactions are always at smaller genomic separations, so why should there be more &quot;heat&quot; at the megabase ranges in Figure 1E?</p>
<p>(2) An ultra-high-resolution Hi-C study (Harris et al., Nat Commun, 2023) identified very small A and B compartments, including distinctions between gene promoters and gene bodies, raising further questions as to what the nature of a compartment really is beyond a statistical phenomenon. It is unreasonable to expect the authors to generate maps as deep as this prior study, but how much do their conclusions change according to the resolution of their compartment calling? The authors should include a balanced discussion on the &quot;meaning&quot; of A/B compartments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Choubani et al presents a technically strong analysis of A/B compartment dynamics across interphase using cell-cycle-resolved Hi-C. By combining the elegant Fucci-based staging system with in situ Hi-C, the authors achieve unusually fine temporal resolution across G1, S, and G2, particularly within the short G1 phase of mESCs. The central finding that A/B compartment strength increases abruptly at the G1/S transition, stabilizes during S phase, and subsequently weakens toward G2 challenges the prevailing view that compartmentalization strengthens monotonically throughout interphase. The authors further propose that this &quot;compartment maturation&quot; is triggered by S-phase entry but occurs independently of active DNA synthesis, and that it involves a consolidation and large-scale reorganization of A-compartment domains.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this is a thoughtfully executed study that will be of broad interest to the 3D genome community. The data are of high quality, and the analyses are extensive, albeit not completely novel. In particular, previous work (Nagano et al 2017 and Zhang et al 2019) has shown that compartments are re-established after mitosis and strengthened during early interphase, and single-cell Hi-C studies have reported changes in compartment association across S phase. In particular, Nagano et al show that DNA replication correlates with a build-up of compartments, similar to what is presented here, with the authors' conclusion that compartment strength peaks in early S. The idea that it weakens toward G2, rather than continuing to strengthen, appears to be novel and differs from the prevailing framing in the literature.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>That said, several aspects of the conceptual framing and interpretation would also benefit from further clarification, and the mechanistic interpretation of the reported compartment dynamics requires more careful positioning relative to established models of genome organization. Specific concerns are outlined below:</p>
<p>(1) One of the major conclusions of the study is that compartment maturation does not require ongoing DNA replication. However, the interpretation would benefit from more precise wording. Thymidine arrest still permits licensing, replisome assembly, and other S-phase-associated chromatin changes upstream of bulk DNA synthesis. Therefore, their data, as presented, demonstrate independence from DNA synthesis per se, but not necessarily from the broader replication program. Please clarify this distinction in the text and interpretations throughout the manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) A major conceptual issue that is not addressed at all is the well-established anti-correlation between cohesin-mediated loop extrusion and A/B compartmentalization. Numerous studies have shown that loss of cohesin or reduced loop extrusion leads to stronger compartment signals, whereas increased cohesin residence or enhanced extrusion weakens compartmentalization. Given this framework, an obvious alternative explanation for the authors' observations is that the abrupt increase in compartment strength at G1/S, and its decline toward G2, could reflect cell-cycle-dependent modulation of cohesin activity rather than a compartment-intrinsic &quot;maturation&quot; program.</p>
<p>The manuscript does not explicitly consider this possibility, nor does it examine loop extrusion-related features (such as loop strength, insulation, or stripe patterns) across the same cell-cycle stages. Without discussing or analyzing this widely accepted model, it is difficult to distinguish whether the reported compartment dynamics represent a novel architectural mechanism or an indirect consequence of known changes in extrusion behavior during the cell cycle. I strongly encourage the authors to analyze their data to determine if they observe anti-correlated loop changes at the same time they observe compartment changes. Ideally, the authors would remove loop extrusion during interphase using well-established cohesin degrons available in mESCs and determine if the relative differences in compartment dynamics persist.</p>
<p>(3) The proposed &quot;peninsula-like&quot; A-domain structures are inferred from ensemble Hi-C data and polymer modeling, rather than directly observed physical conformations. That is, single-cell imaging data clearly have shown that Hi-C (especially ensemble Hi-C) cannot uniquely specify physical conformations and that different underlying structures can produce similar contact patterns. The &quot;peninsula&quot; language, as written, risks being interpreted as a literal structural model rather than a conceptual visualization. Instead of risking this as just another nuanced Hi-C feature in the field, the authors could strengthen the manuscript by either (i) explicitly framing the peninsula model as a heuristic description of contact redistribution rather than a definitive physical architecture, or (ii) discussing alternative structural scenarios that could give rise to similar Hi-C patterns. Clarifying this distinction would improve the rigor and help readers better understand what aspects of A-compartment consolidation are directly supported by the data versus model-based extrapolations. For example, it would be useful to clarify whether the observed increase in long-range A-A contacts reflects spatial extension of internal A regions, changes in loop extrusion dynamics, increased compartment mixing within the A state, or population-averaged heterogeneity across alleles.</p>
<p>(4) The extension of the analysis to additional cell types using HiRES single-cell data is a valuable addition and supports the idea that compartment maturation is not unique to mESCs. However, the limitations of these data, in particular, the limited phase resolution, in addition to the pseudo-bulk aggregation and variable coverage, should be emphasized more clearly in the main text. Framing these results as evidence for conservation in principle, rather than definitive proof of identical dynamics across tissues, would be a more appropriate framing.</p>
