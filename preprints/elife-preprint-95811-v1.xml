<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The liver is the largest solid organ in the body and is primarily composed of HCs, ECs, KCs, and HSCs, which spatially interact and cooperate with each other to maintain liver homeostasis. However, the complexity and molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between these different cell types remain to be revealed. Here, we generated mice with conditional deletion of <italic>Bmp9/10</italic> in different liver cell types and demonstrated that HSCs were the major source of BMP9 and BMP10 in the liver. Using transgenic ALK1 (receptor for BMP9/10) reporter mice, we found that ALK1 is expressed on KCs and ECs other than HCs and HSCs. KCs from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> (conditional deletion of <italic>Bmp9/10</italic> from HSCs) mice lost their signature gene expression, such as ID1/3, CLEC4F, VSIG4 and CLEC2, and were replaced by monocyte-derived macrophages. ECs from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice also lost their identity and were transdifferentiated into continuous ECs, ultimately leading to collagen IV deposition and liver fibrosis. Hepatic ECs express several angiocrine factors, such as BMP2, BMP6, Wnt2 and Rspo3, to regulate liver iron metabolism and metabolic zonation. We found that these angiocrine factors were significantly decreased in ECs from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice, which further resulted in liver iron overload and disruption of HC zonation. In summary, we demonstrated that HSCs play a central role in mediating liver cell‒cell crosstalk via the production of BMP9/10 to maintain liver health.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Almost all organs in vertebrates consist of different cell types that undertake their individual functions to maintain organ homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), such as vascular endothelial cells supplying oxygen and nutrients to the organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) and immune cells, especially tissue-resident macrophages, constantly clearing cell debris and monitoring tissue microenvironments to prevent pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Usually, these different cell types originate from distinct progenitors and differentiate into specialized cell types via the expression of lineage-specific transcription factors during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Meanwhile, crosstalk between these individual cells within one organ occurs and promotes them to continue to specialize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), which is needed for the maintenance of the organotypic phenotypes of these cells. However, the cell‒cell communication within organs is largely unknown.</p>
<p>The liver is composed of four major cell types: hepatocytes (HCs), Kupffer cells (KCs), endothelial cells (ECs), and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). The liver exemplifies the importance of cellular interactions in maintaining organ integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). For example, secretion of Wnt signaling and BMP2/6 by ECs functions on hepatocytes to control hepatic zonation and iron metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), respectively. Loss of these signals results in liver dysfunction. Recent advances in RNA-sequencing technology and algorithms have enabled a better understanding of the cellular composition and potential cellular interactions of the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). However, the speculative cues still need experimental validation, and more importantly, it is still unknown what consequences happen if specific cell‒cell interactions are interrupted.</p>
<p>HSCs reside in the space of Disse and directly interact with HCs, ECs, and KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). HSCs are well known for their pathological role in liver fibrosis, as HSC activation is a critical step in the development of chronic liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). However, in addition to the storage of retinoids, the physiological role of HSCs in the normal liver remains unclear. ALK1, encoded by the activin A receptor-like type 1 (<italic>Acvrl1</italic>) gene, is the receptor of BMP9 and BMP10. Its mutations result in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), which causes vascular malformations in multiple organs, including the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). It has been reported that liver sinusoidal EC-specific <italic>Alk1</italic>-deficient mice exhibit severe liver vascular malformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), which mimic the liver symptoms observed in HHT patients. We and others demonstrated that ALK1 is needed for KC survival and identity, and the ability of KCs from <italic>Alk1</italic>-deficient mice to capture bacteria from the bloodstream was significantly impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). BMP9 is mainly expressed in the liver. Using antibody staining, BMP9 was reported to be expressed in human hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Recently, based on PCR and scRNA-Seq analysis, BMP9 and BMP10 have been shown to be mainly expressed by murine HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). However, no study has systematically examined which liver cell types secrete BMP9 and BMP10 and regulate ECs and KCs via these two paracrine factors. Here, we generated mice with conditional knockout of both <italic>Bmp9 and Bmp10</italic> in different liver cell types and found that HSCs are the functional source of BMP9 and BMP10. Interestingly, conditional deletion of <italic>Bmp9/10</italic> from HSCs (<italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup>) mice not only resulted in loss of KC and EC identity but also affected HC phenotypes in an indirect way, which ultimately resulted in liver dysfunction, suggesting that HSCs play a central role in orchestrating the interactions between different liver cell types under physiological conditions.</p>

<title>HSCs are the functional source of BMP9 and BMP10 in the liver</title>
<p>To generate mice lacking <italic>Bmp9</italic> and <italic>Bmp10</italic> in different liver cell types, <italic>Bmp9<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Bmp10<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were prepared and mated with <italic>Alb<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, <italic>Clec4f<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, <italic>Tie2<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, or <italic>Lrat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice, which have been extensively used in the literature to produce HCs, KCs, ECs, and HSC conditional knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), respectively. Because BMP9 and BMP10 play a redundant role in regulating KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), conditional double knockout mice (<italic>Bmp9<sup>fl/fl</sup>Bmp10<sup>fl/fl</sup>Alb<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, <italic>Bmp9<sup>fl/fl</sup>Bmp10<sup>fl/fl</sup>Tie2<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, <italic>Bmp9<sup>fl/fl</sup>Bmp10<sup>fl/fl</sup>Clec4f<sup>Cre</sup></italic>and <italic>Bmp9<sup>fl/fl</sup>Bmp10<sup>fl/fl</sup>Lrat<sup>Cre</sup></italic>) were generated. To systematically investigate which liver cell types produce BMP9 and BMP10, we acquired liver tissues from these mice. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that <italic>Bmp9</italic> and <italic>Bmp10</italic> mRNA expression was significantly reduced in the liver tissues from <italic>Bmp9<sup>fl/fl</sup>Bmp10<sup>fl/fl</sup>Lrat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (<italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup>) mice compared to other Cre deleter mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). Using Cre-mediated reporter mice, we demonstrated that <italic>Lrat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice can specifically target HSCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). BMP10 is mostly expressed in the heart, followed by the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). However, <italic>Bmp10</italic> expression in the heart was not affected in <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). ALK1 is the receptor of BMP9/10. To investigate which liver cell types express ALK1 and respond to BMP9/10, we prepared transgenic ALK1 reporter mice, which can faithfully reflect the expression of ALK1. We found that ALK1 was expressed on ECs and KCs but not HCs and HSCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>), suggesting that BMP9/10 can directly function on ECs and KCs via ALK1. Accordingly, we found that surface markers of liver F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice, including CLEC4F, Tim4 and VSIG4, were almost not expressed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). In contrast, these markers were not affected in the liver F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages from <italic>Bmp9<sup>fl/fl</sup>Bmp10<sup>fl/fl</sup>Alb<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, <italic>Bmp9<sup>fl/fl</sup>Bmp10<sup>fl/fl</sup>Tie2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Bmp9<sup>fl/fl</sup>Bmp10<sup>fl/fl</sup>Clec4f<sup>Cre</sup></italic>mice (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). LYVE1 and CLEC2, the surface markers of CD31<sup>+</sup> hepatic ECs, were also reduced in the livers of <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-</sup> <sup>KO</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref>). In addition, we also determined the phenotypes of KCs and ECs from <italic>Bmp10<sup>fl/fl</sup>Lrat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice to exclude the possibility that the altered phenotypes observed in <italic>Bmp9<sup>fl/fl</sup>Bmp10<sup>fl/fl</sup>Lrat<sup>Cre</sup></italic>mice were due to Cre-mediated cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) and found that these cells were not affected (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that HSCs are the functional source of BMP9 and BMP10 in the liver to regulate KCs and ECs.</p>

<title>The differentiation of liver macrophages from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice is blocked in a status of monocyte-derived macrophages</title>
<p>To acquire more information about transcriptome changes in liver macrophages in the <italic>Bmp9/10</italic>-deficient liver microenvironment, we performed bulk RNA-seq analysis on sorted liver macrophages from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice compared with their controls. We found that 2424 genes were differentially expressed (FC&gt;2, p-adj&lt;0.05), among which 1313 genes were upregulated and 1111 genes were downregulated in liver macrophages from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice compared to their control mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). From these differentially expressed genes, we found that genes associated with the identity of KCs, such as <italic>Fabp7</italic>, <italic>Cd5l</italic>, <italic>Cdh5</italic> and <italic>Clec4f</italic>, were significantly downregulated in liver macrophages from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). <italic>Id1</italic> and <italic>Id3</italic>, target genes of ALK1 signaling and important regulators of KC differentiation, were also significantly reduced in liver macrophages from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). We also observed downregulation of embryonic KC marker <italic>Timd4</italic> (encoding Tim4) expression and upregulation of monocytic <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> and <italic>Ccr2</italic> expression in liver macrophages from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>), suggesting that embryonic KCs were lost and replaced by monocyte-derived macrophages/KCs, as a reduced number of liver macrophages was observed in <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>).</p>

<p>Upon KC loss, blood monocytes are recruited into the liver, immediately differentiate into F4/80<sup>+</sup> monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMs) and then gradually acquire the expression of CLEC2, CLEC4F and VSIG4 to become monocyte-derived KCs (MoKCs) with time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). CLEC2, encoded by <italic>the Clec1b</italic> gene, was thought to be one of the earliest markers gained by monocyte-derived KCs and can be used to discriminate MoKCs from MoMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). In addition, TREML4 expression is immediately upregulated upon blood monocyte entry into the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Interestingly, we found that nearly all liver macrophages from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice did not express CLEC2 and TREML4, but liver macrophages from <italic>Alk1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Vav1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup>Vav1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice did (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>), suggesting that the differentiation of liver macrophages from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice is completely blocked in a status of monocyte-derived macrophages, and the differentiation defect in liver macrophages from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice is more pronounced than that from <italic>Alk1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Vav1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>and <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup>Vav1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice. To understand this discrepancy, we performed bulk RNA-seq analysis on sorted liver macrophages from <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup>Vav1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>mice, as Smad4 functions as a common Smad needed for transcriptional regulation in response to ALK signaling. In addition to ALK1, BMP9 and BMP10 also bind ALK2 with low affinity to transduce signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Analysis of the DE genes between <italic>Smad4</italic>-sufficient and <italic>Smad4</italic>-deficient KCs identified 1340 DE genes, including many KC signature genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). Comparison of the difference between the DE genes in liver macrophages from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> and <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup>Vav1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice revealed that 1659 of 2424 DE genes in liver macrophages from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice did not overlap with DE genes in MoKCs from <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup>Vav1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2h</xref>), which is consistent with the phenomenon described above, indicating that in addition to Smad4, alterations in other molecular mechanisms may affect the phenotypes of liver macrophages in <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice.</p>
<p>Transcription factors play an important role in the differentiation of tissue-resident macrophages. We compared the nonoverlapping transcription factors between the DE genes in liver macrophages from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> and <italic>Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup>Vav1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice and found 29 transcription factors only downregulated in liver macrophages from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2i</xref> and <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Among these transcription factors, we focused on <italic>Rxra</italic> because it has been reported to regulate the development of many embryonic tissue-resident macrophages, including KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), but it is unclear whether RXRa regulates the differentiation of blood monocytes to MoKCs. To test this hypothesis, we prepared <italic>Rxra<sup>fl/fl</sup>Csf1r<sup>Cre</sup> Clec4f <sup>DTR</sup></italic> mice, in which DT injection can delete KCs and monocytes recruited into the liver to differentiate into liver macrophages, which can be targeted by the <italic>Csf1r<sup>Cre</sup></italic> strain to eliminate the <italic>Rxra</italic> gene (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3a</xref>). We found that RXRα deficiency significantly inhibited the differentiation of blood monocytes to MoKCs, as the proportion of CLEC2<sup>+</sup> and VSIG4<sup>+</sup> macrophages was significantly reduced in <italic>Rxra</italic>-deficient macrophages compared with their controls (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3b</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), suggesting that the differentiation defect of liver macrophages from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice may be partially caused by <italic>Rxra</italic> downregulation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that HSCs convey BMP9/10 signals to KCs and ECs to maintain their identity. Loss of BMP9/10 in the liver microenvironment resulted in liver macrophage differentiation defects and a shift in hepatic EC differentiation toward continuous ECs and large arterial cells. Under this condition, physiological crosstalk between ECs and HCs was disrupted, which ultimately altered the whole liver microenvironment and resulted in liver dysfunction.</p>
<p>Recently, we and others have demonstrated that ALK1 is essential for KC differentiation, self-renewal, identity, and endocytic ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Here, we undertook systematic genetic manipulation to scrutinize the functional source of BMP9/10 in the liver. We found that instead of ECs, KCs and HCs, HSCs are the predominant source of BMP9/10 critical for KC homeostasis. BMP9 is mainly expressed in the liver, whereas BMP10 is mostly expressed in the heart and weakly expressed in the liver. We found that BMP10 expression in the heart was not affected in <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice, suggesting that the BMP10 signal needed for KCs and ECs was provided by the local liver rather than circulating BMP10 secreted by the heart. Indeed, ALK1 is weakly expressed in KCs and ECs, as the fluorescence signal emitted by KCs and LSECs from <italic>Alk1<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> reporter mice was weak when detected by flow cytometry, suggesting that the concentration of circulating BMP10 may not be enough to activate ALK1 signaling on hepatic ECs and KCs to maintain their phenotypes.</p>
<p>Recently, Schmid et al. used <italic>Stab 2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice to delete <italic>Alk1</italic> in liver sinusoidal ECs to model liver HHT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). They found that upon deletion of <italic>Alk1</italic>, liver sinusoidal ECs lost their identity and were transdifferentiated into large arterial cells. In addition, angiocrine Wnt signaling, such as Wnt2, Wnt9b, and Rspondin3, was impaired in <italic>Alk1</italic>-deficient liver sinusoidal ECs, leading to the disruption of liver metabolic zonation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). These phenomena were also observed in the <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mouse model. However, liver fibrosis observed in HHT patients did not occur in the livers of <italic>Alk1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Stab 2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Indeed, our transcriptomic data showed that <italic>Stab 2</italic> expression was significantly reduced in hepatic ECs of <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> <sup>mice</sup>, which was consistent with the data from <italic>Bmp9</italic> KO 129/Ola mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), suggesting that ALK1 signaling regulated STAB2 expression. Thus, it is possible that heterozygosity for the <italic>Alk1</italic> deletion in ECs may result in reduced expression of STAB2, and the expression of Cre recombinase driven by the <italic>Stab 2</italic> promoter accordingly decreases, so that the <italic>Alk1</italic>-floxed allele in ECs cannot be efficiently deleted by Cre-mediated cyclization, which may explain why liver fibrosis did not occur in <italic>Alk1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Stab 2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice. In view of liver fibrosis, <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice may be a better mouse model to mimic the liver pathology observed in HHT patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). In addition, the liver macrophage niche is composed of HCs, ECs and HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Thus, the altered phenotypes of HCs and ECs from <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice may be another reason for the differentiation defect of liver macrophages observed in <italic>Bmp9/10</italic><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice.</p>
<p><italic>Gata4</italic>-deficient mice spontaneously develop liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of healthy and cirrhotic human liver samples revealed that <italic>Gata4</italic> expression was also reduced in ECs from cirrhotic human liver samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), suggesting that reduced expression of <italic>Gata4</italic> may contribute to murine and human liver fibrosis. Given that BMP9/10 regulated the expression of <italic>Gata4</italic> in murine ECs, it is possible that the reduced expression of GATA4 may be due to low expression of BMP9/10 in liver cirrhosis. However, the expression of <italic>Bmp9/10</italic> was not detected by single-cell RNA-seq of either healthy or cirrhotic human livers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) due to the low abundance of <italic>Bmp9/10</italic> mRNA in HSCs. Thus, the correlation between <italic>Bmp9/10</italic> expression and liver fibrosis needs further investigation.</p>
<p>Collectively, we demonstrated that BMP9/10 sourced from HSCs function on KCs and ECs to maintain their identity, which further directs HCs to wire metabolic function to meet the organ’s needs. Upon disruption of this crosstalk, liver dysfunction ensued. This work illustrates the complexity underlying the crosstalk between different liver cell types.</p>

Frozen liver sections were then blocked for 2 hours with 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3 M glycine, and 10% donkey or goat serum before being stained overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in PBS with 0.2% Tween, secondary antibodies, and Hoechst for 2h at room temperature. Sections were mounted with Fluoromount G (YEASEN) and images were acquired on a Nikon A1R plus N-STORM confocal microscope with a 10x/0.45 PLANAPO, 20X/0.75 PLANAPO or 40X/0.75 PLANFLUOR objective lens. Laser excitation wavelengths of 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 647 nm channels were used for sample fluorescence detection. The following antibodies were used, anti-F4/80 (BM8, Biolegend), anti-CD64 (x54-5/7.1, Biolegend), anti-E-Cadherin (147307, Biolegend), anti-CD34 (RAM34, Invitrogen), anti-Glutamine Synthetase (ab49873, Abcam), anti-Desmin (ab15200, Abcam), anti-type I collagen (ab21286, Abcam), and anti-Clec4F (AF2784, R&amp;D systems). Fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Abcam and Invitrogen, as donkey anti rabbit AF594 (711-585-152, Jackson), donkey anti-rat AF488 (ab150153, Abcam), donkey anti-rat AF594 (A21209, Invitrogen) and donkey anti goat FITC (A11055, Invitrogen).</p>
<p>Hematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E), Picrosirius red (PSR), Nile red and Prussian blue were performed according to standard protocols.</p>

<title>Image processing and analysis</title>
<p>Quantitative analyses of all images were measured using the Fiji package for ImageJ software (NIH) and the Imaris (Oxford Instruments). For coverage measurements of KCs and HSCs, surface modules in Imaris were used to create CD64 and F4/80 biomarkers. A threshold was determined by the algorithm for background subtraction and manually set to match the cell signals. The number of cells per unit area was accessed by parameters in Imaris. IHC and Picrosirius red staining can be assessed by color deconvolution and the thresholding tool in ImageJ.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The aim of the present work is to evaluate the role of BMP9 and BMP10 in liver by depleting Bmp9 and Bmp10 from the main liver cell types (endothelial cells (EC), hepatic stellate cells (HSC), Kupffer cells (KC) and hepatocytes (H)) using cell-specific cre recombinases. They show that HSCs are the main source of BMP9 and BMP10 in the liver. Using transgenic ALK1 reporter mice, they show that ALK1, the high affinity type 1 receptor for BMP9 and BMP10, is expressed on KC and EC. They have also performed bulk RNAseq analyses on whole liver, and cell-sorted EC and KC, and showed that loss of Bmp9 and Bmp10 decreased KC signature and that KC are replaced by monocyte-derived macrophages. EC derived from these Bmp9fl/flBmp10fl/flLratCre mice also lost their identity and transdifferentiated into continuous ECs. Liver iron metabolism and metabolic zonation were also affected in these mice. In conclusion, this work supports that BMP9 and BMP10 produced by HSC play a central role in mediating liver cell-cell crosstalk and liver homeostasis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work further supports the role of BMP9 and BMP10 in liver homeostasis. Using a specific HSC-Cre recombinase, the authors show for the first time that it is the BMP9 and BMP10 produced by HSC that play a central role in mediating liver cell-cell crosstalk to maintain a healthy liver. Although the overall message of the key role of BMP9 in liver homeostasis has been described by several groups, the role of hepatic BMP10 has not been studied before. Thus, one of the novelties of this work is to have used liver cell specific Cre recombinase to delete hepatic Bmp9 and Bmp10. The second novelty is the demonstration of the role of BMP9 and BMP10 in KC Differentiation/homeostasis which has already been slightly addressed by this group by knocking out ALK1, the high affinity receptor of BMP9 and BMP10 (Zhao et al. JCI, 2022).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This work remains rather descriptive and the molecular mechanisms are barely touched upon and could have been more explored.</p>
<p>
Some references should be added; In particular, a work that has already demonstrated, using a different approach (in situ hybridization RNAscope), that in the liver BMP9 and BMP10 are expressed by HSC (Tillet et al., J Biol Chem 2018). Another publication (Bouvard et al., Cardiovasc Res, 2021) has previously showed that deletion of Bmp9 and Bmp10 leads to liver fibrosis and could have thus been cited. There is also a reference that is not correctly cited. Ref 26 (Herrera et al., 2014) does not say that &quot;BMP10 is mostly expressed in the heart, followed by the liver&quot; or that &quot;BMP9 and BMP10 also bind to ALK2&quot; as cited in the manuscript.</p>
<p>
The gating strategies for cell sorting which is used for bulk RNAseq and FACS analyses should be better described in order to better follow the manuscript. This point is particularly important for KC gating as the authors show that Tim4 is very strongly decreased in Bmp9fl/flBmp10fl/flLratCre (Fig 2c), yet, it seems that this marker is used for gating macrophages (Suppl fig4). Same question with F4/80 which is strongly decreased in Bmp9fl/flBmp10fl/flLratCre (Fig 2d) and also used for gating. It is important to show the gating strategy for both Control and Bmp9fl/flBmp10fl/flLratCre mice.</p>
<p>
The authors should explain how they selected the genes shown on each heatmaps and add references that can justify the choice of the genes.</p>
<p>
Quantifications of Immunostaining and FACS data should be added as well as statistical analyses.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors characterized the contribution of BMP9/BMp10 expression/secretion from all different hepatic cell types and analysed their impact on the other cell types. They are able to show that HSC derived BMP9/BMP10 controls Kupffer cell and EC differentiation and functions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is the first study to my knowledge to comprehensively analyze the contribution of BMP9/BMP10 expression in such systematic fashion in vivo. This study therefore is a significant contribution to the field and further supports previous studies that have already implied BMP9 and BMP10 in Kupffer cell and EC functions but did not unravel the intercellular cross talk in such detailed fashion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Several findings such as the impact of BMP9/10 on Kupffer cells and EC were already known. So these findings are not innovative, however I still believe that the elucidation of the cellular crosstalk makes this publication highly interesting to a broad scientific community.</p>
<p>Overall the authors achieved their aims and the results are well supporting the conclusions and discussion.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The aim of the present work is to evaluate the role of BMP9 and BMP10 in liver by depleting Bmp9 and Bmp10 from the main liver cell types (endothelial cells (EC), hepatic stellate cells (HSC), Kupffer cells (KC) and hepatocytes (H)) using cell-specific cre recombinases. They show that HSCs are the main source of BMP9 and BMP10 in the liver. Using transgenic ALK1 reporter mice, they show that ALK1, the high affinity type 1 receptor for BMP9 and BMP10, is expressed on KC and EC. They have also performed bulk RNAseq analyses on whole liver, and cell-sorted EC and KC, and showed that loss of Bmp9 and Bmp10 decreased KC signature and that KC are replaced by monocyte-derived macrophages. EC derived from these Bmp9fl/flBmp10fl/flLratCre mice also lost their identity and transdifferentiated into continuous ECs. Liver iron metabolism and metabolic zonation were also affected in these mice. In conclusion, this work supports that BMP9 and BMP10 produced by HSC play a central role in mediating liver cell-cell crosstalk and liver homeostasis.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work further supports the role of BMP9 and BMP10 in liver homeostasis. Using a specific HSC-Cre recombinase, the authors show for the first time that it is the BMP9 and BMP10 produced by HSC that play a central role in mediating liver cell-cell crosstalk to maintain a healthy liver. Although the overall message of the key role of BMP9 in liver homeostasis has been described by several groups, the role of hepatic BMP10 has not been studied before. Thus, one of the novelties of this work is to have used liver cell specific Cre recombinase to delete hepatic Bmp9 and Bmp10. The second novelty is the demonstration of the role of BMP9 and BMP10 in KC Differentiation/homeostasis which has already been slightly addressed by this group by knocking out ALK1, the high affinity receptor of BMP9 and BMP10 (Zhao et al. JCI, 2022).</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This work remains rather descriptive and the molecular mechanisms are barely touched upon and could have been more explored. Some references should be added; In particular, a work that has already demonstrated, using a different approach (in situ hybridization RNAscope), that in the liver BMP9 and BMP10 are expressed by HSC (Tillet et al., J Biol Chem 2018). Another publication (Bouvard et al., Cardiovasc Res, 2021) has previously showed that deletion of Bmp9 and Bmp10 leads to liver fibrosis and could have thus been cited. There is also a reference that is not correctly cited. Ref 26 (Herrera et al., 2014) does not say that &quot;BMP10 is mostly expressed in the heart, followed by the liver&quot; or that &quot;BMP9 and BMP10 also bind to ALK2&quot; as cited in the manuscript.</p>

<p>We agree with the comment of reviewer 1 that the molecular mechanisms were barely investigated in our work. Indeed, it has been reported that BMP9/10 induce the expression of ID1/3 in KCs and GATA4 and Maf in liver ECs in vitro culture system. These master regulators play an important role in the differentiation of the two cell types. Thus, we think that the reduced expression of these master regulators can explain the phenotype in KCs and ECs observed in Bmp9fl/flBmp10fl/flLratCre mice. In addition, according to the reviewer’s suggestion, these references will be added or corrected in our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>The gating strategies for cell sorting which is used for bulk RNAseq and FACS analyses should be better described in order to better follow the manuscript. This point is particularly important for KC gating as the authors show that Tim4 is very strongly decreased in Bmp9fl/flBmp10fl/flLratCre (Fig 2c), yet, it seems that this marker is used for gating macrophages (Suppl fig4). Same question with F4/80 which is strongly decreased in Bmp9fl/flBmp10fl/flLratCre (Fig 2d) and also used for gating. It is important to show the gating strategy for both Control and Bmp9fl/flBmp10fl/flLratCre mice.</p>
<p>The authors should explain how they selected the genes shown on each heatmaps and add references that can justify the choice of the genes.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestion. In our study, we used CD45+ Ly6C- F4/80+ CD64+ cells to define liver macrophages. We will delete Tim4 FACS plot from Suppl fig4 to avoid the misunderstanding. Although F4/80 positive cells were reduced in the livers of Bmp9fl/flBmp10fl/flLratCre mice, double staining by anti-F4/80 and anti-CD64 fluorescence antibodies can still clearly distinguish liver macrophages based on above gating strategy. Gating strategy for both control and Bmp9fl/flBmp10fl/flLratCre mice will be presented in our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors characterized the contribution of BMP9/BMP10 expression/secretion from all different hepatic cell types and analysed their impact on the other cell types. They are able to show that HSC derived BMP9/BMP10 controls Kupffer cell and EC differentiation and functions.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is the first study to my knowledge to comprehensively analyze the contribution of BMP9/BMP10 expression in such systematic fashion in vivo. This study therefore is a significant contribution to the field and further supports previous studies that have already implied BMP9 and BMP10 in Kupffer cell and EC functions but did not unravel the intercellular cross talk in such detailed fashion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the positive comment of reviewer 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Several findings such as the impact of BMP9/10 on Kupffer cells and EC were already known. So these findings are not innovative, however I still believe that the elucidation of the cellular crosstalk makes this publication highly interesting to a broad scientific community.</p>
<p>Overall the authors achieved their aims and the results are well supporting the conclusions and discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the positive comment of reviewer 2. We agree with the comment of reviewer 2 that although some findings in our paper are somehow expected, the detailed investigation of the crosstalk between different liver cell types is still needed and beneficial to this field.</p>
