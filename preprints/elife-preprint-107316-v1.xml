<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Autophagosomes form from seed membranes that expand through bulk-lipid transport via the bridge-like lipid transporter ATG2. The origins of the seed membranes and their relationship to the lipid transport machinery are poorly understood. Using proximity labeling and a variety of fluorescence microscopy techniques, we show that ATG2A localizes to extra-Golgi ARFGAP1 puncta during autophagosome biogenesis. ARFGAP1 itself is dispensable during macroautophagy, but among other proteins associating to these membranes, we find that RAB1 is essential. ATG2A co-immunoprecipitates strongly with RAB1A, and siRNA-mediated depletion of RAB1 blocks autophagy downstream of LC3B lipidation, similar to ATG2A depletion. Further, when either autophagosome formation or the early secretory pathway is perturbed, ARFGAP1 and RAB1A accumulate at ectopic locations with autophagic machinery. Our results suggest that ATG2A engages a RAB1A complex on select early secretory membranes at an early stage in autophagosome biogenesis.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>This study elucidates the role of early secretory membranes in autophagosome biogenesis. The authors demonstrate that RAB1/ARFGAP1 positive membranes are essential to autophagy and are recruited to the phagophore assembly site at an early step of autophagosome biogenesis. These membranes interact with the bridge-like lipid transport protein ATG2A and are positive for LC3B and WIPI2, suggesting that RAB1 membranes are a direct source for autophagosome growth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Macroautophagy is a cellular degradative pathway in which a seed vesicle grows to encapsulate a target cargo, closes to form the complete autophagosome, and subsequently fuses with the lysosome. This transient organelle forms <italic>de novo</italic> in approximately ten minutes and requires the delivery of millions of lipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. ATG2 proteins function as bridge-like bulk lipid transport proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and are essential during the membrane expansion step of autophagosome biogenesis. We propose that ATG2 bridges the ER and the developing phagophore, thereby allowing lipids to cross the cytosol through a long hydrophobic groove<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. At the phagophore, lipids are equilibrated into both leaflets of the bilayer via the ATG9 scramblases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. As such, ATG9 is essential to macroautophagy and is a key component of the seed membranes that ultimately expand during ATG2-mediated lipid transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In addition to ATG9 vesicles, several other membrane sources have been proposed to be involved in autophagosome biogenesis. In particular, both genetics and biochemistry implicate an essential role for the early secretory pathway. In yeast, some COP-II vesicle and ER exit site (ERES) proteins contribute to starvation-mediated autophagy at a stage that is downstream of formation of the pre-autophagosome structure (PAS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Furthermore, yeast ERES naturally colocalize with the autophagic cargo Ape1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, and that colocalization increases when various autophagy factors are depleted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. These studies imply that autophagosome initiation events may not be dependent upon the secretory pathway, but subsequent membrane growth or autophagosome maturation requires active ERES structures. Cross linking studies further establish a close proximity between autophagy and ERES proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Finally, the direct integration of yeast COPII-derived membranes into developing phagophores is suggested by the detection of the COP-II cargo Axl2-GFP, a transmembrane protein, at both phagophores and mature autophagosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In human cell lines, genetic or pharmacological disruption of the COPII-related small GTPase SAR1A reduces the frequency of autophagic events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Following biochemical fractionation of cellular membranes, the ER-to-Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC) is especially competent for supporting in vitro lipidation by LC3B, the primary marker of autophagic structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and clusters of COPII positive membranes can be seen accumulating adjacent to phagophores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Like in yeast, these studies can be interpreted as a key role for ERES or ERGIC membranes in forming or expanding autophagosome membranes. As starvation-mediated macroautophagy drives substantial remodeling of both the ERES and ERGIC membranes (Liang Ge review;), including the formation of subdomains with unique protein-dependent organelle-organelle contact sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, it is possible that the ERES/ERGIC contribution to autophagy represents a distinct subcompartment of these membrane structures.</p>
<p>Presumably, any contribution of an early secretory membrane must ultimately coordinate with recruitment of ATG9 vesicles, in order to ensure that the lipid transport machinery is competent to expand the phagophore membrane. Several studies have postulated an early fusion intermediate in phagophore formation, such as the description of the HyPas compartment where vesicles bearing distinct autophagy proteins (ATG16L1 and FIP200) were observed to coalesce early in autophagosome biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, when the lipid transporter ATG2 is genetically depleted from cells, all of the essential autophagy machinery including ATG9 concentrates into large compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Correlative light and electron microscopy of these structures indicate they are large assemblies of ATG9 vesicles surrounded by more complex membranes which harbor FIP200 and WIPI2, among other proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. These complex membranes often adopt a cup-like shape, leading us to name them “proto-phagophores”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The origins of the proto-phagophores have been unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that ATG2A is enriched during autophagosome biogenesis at RAB1/ARFGAP1 positive membranes. Although both proteins can be found within the ERGIC compartment, proximity data and colocalization analyses in secretory pathway disrupted cells suggest that RAB1 and ARFGAP1 membranes involved in ATG2 recruitment are distinct from generic ERGIC membranes. Genetic depletion experiments indicate that RAB1 and ATG2 function at a similar step in autophagosome formation and further these proteins can be isolated together in a complex. Finally, both ARFGAP1 and RAB1 co-localize with proto-phagophores, implying these membranes can recruit much of the key early autophagy machinery and may be dynamically remodeled into cup-like morphologies.</p>

<title>ATG2A is proximal to early secretory membranes</title>
<p>To determine the local proteome adjacent to ATG2A, we used a proximity labeling approach. We fused the biotinylation enzyme APEX2 and a green fluorescent marker to the amino-terminus of ATG2A (APEX2-EGFP-ATG2A) and expressed this construct in ATG2A/B double knockout cells (ATG2 DKO cells). In this way, the APEX2 enzyme will biotinylate cellular proteins in close proximity to the expressed ATG2A fusion protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. To ensure that the APEX2-EGFP-ATG2A construct is active and correctly localized, we measured the restoration of macroautophagy in these cells by following LC3B flux and p62 clearance (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1 A-C</xref>). While both LC3B-II and p62 dramatically accumulate in the ATG2 DKO cells, this accumulation is almost entirely reversed upon re-expression of APEX2-EGFP-ATG2A.</p>
<p>We also validated that biotinylation in these cells depends upon the presence of APEX-EGFP-ATG2A and a full reaction. In cells expressing APEX2-EGFP-ATG2A, biotin is only observed when both the biotin substrate (biotin phenol) and the reaction promoter (hydrogen peroxide) are included (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1 D</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Likewise, streptavidin-mediated immunoprecipitation revealed a strong enrichment of biotinylated material only when the full reaction conditions were employed (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1F</xref>). Furthermore, the anti-biotin and GFP signals colocalized establishing that biotinylation is favored at sites proximal to ATG2A (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Mass spectrometry of proteins isolated by streptavidin-mediated immunoprecipitation was performed using a three state quantitative SILAC experiment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> with light, medium, and heavy isotopes as follows: no hydrogen peroxide as a negative control, a full reaction in complete media, and a full reaction in starvation media and 100 nM bafilomycin. When comparing both the heavy and medium isotope states to the light state, mass spectrometry analysis revealed an abundance of autophagy related proteins in both full media and under starvation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1G</xref>, respectively). The majority of these proteins were cargo adaptors such as NBR1, p62 (SQSTM1), and TAX1BP1, suggesting that the target cargo is immediately adjacent to the biogenesis machinery during autophagosome maturation. We also observed a clear enrichment of ERES or COPII proteins including SEC16A, SEC23A, SEC23IP, and SEC24B/C. Additional ERES proteins such as TFG and SEC31A were also enriched in some, but not all, of the three replicates. In addition, ARFGAP1, a COPI effector that is primarily localized to the Golgi but also found in earlier secretory membranes, was one of the two most enriched proteins in both full media and starvation. Both ARFGAP1 and the COPII proteins suggest ATG2 is localizing to the early secretory pathway.</p>

<title>ATG2A is recruited to ARFGAP1 membranes during autophagosome biogenesis</title>
<p>As an orthogonal method to assess the proximity of ATG2A to early secretory components, we performed FLASH-PAINT, a super resolution technique with high multiplexing capabilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. FLASH-PAINT offers sub-organelle resolution while simultaneously allowing us to screen &gt;10 proteins. ATG2 DKO cells stably expressing GFP-ATG2A were starved and then immunostained for autophagic proteins (GFP-ATG2A, p62, and LC3B), ERES proteins (Tango1, SEC24C, SEC31A, SEC16A, TFG), and markers of COPI-positive membranes (ARFGAP1 and COPI). All proteins were concurrently labeled with primary antibodies that were in turn identified by their association with secondary antibodies with unique DNA barcodes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1H</xref>). A fluorophore conjugated imager DNA strand and adaptor strands were added to target the imager to the correct secondary antibody. Eraser strands were added in between rounds of imaging to outcompete the adaptor and allow for sequential labeling. In this way, the sub-cellular localization of all ten proteins could be established within the same image.</p>
<p>In these images, the Golgi can easily be identified as a perinuclear ribbon staining strongly for both ARFGAP1 and COP1 (magenta and purple respectively, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1I</xref>). In addition, there are bright puncta throughout the cell (pink arrow heads) stained with TFG and SEC31A, indicating that they are ERES. ARFGAP1 and COPI frequently also accumulated at ERES (made more obvious in the top-right inset, where TFG and SEC31 are removed), consistent with previous reports that COPI vesicles facilitate ER to Golgi transport in human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. GFP-ATG2A is mostly cytosolic, however small accumulations of ATG2 could be found at ERES and were generally observed to be proximal to ARFGAP1/COP1 (inset; brackets). Note that clusters of LC3B and p62 are also present. Occasionally, non-ERES accumulations of p62 could be observed in close proximity to LC3B and ATG2A (lower insets), and here again ATG2 is proximal to ARFGAP1.</p>
<p>Critically, we can directly measure the nominal proximity of each protein relative to the others under investigation by quantifying the median distance between all ten tested proteins within 200 nm of each individual protein (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1J</xref>). All early secretory pathway proteins closely associate with each other, including the COPI proteins ARFGAP1 and β-COP. As the majority of ATG2A was cytosolic, its average distances from other proteins were greater, however, within this cohort of candidate proteins, we found that ATG2A is most closely associated with P62 and ARFGAP1 (15nm and 16nm respectively; top row of <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1J</xref>), exactly consistent with the APEX screen.</p>
<p>The APEX and FLASH-PAINT datasets provided a clear but static result that ATG2A is recruited to ARFGAP1 positive structures. To determine whether this recruitment was coincident with phagophore formation, we stably expressed GFP-ATG2A and TagBFP-LC3B in ATG2 DKO cells in order to identify phagophores. ATG2A primarily localizes to phagophores and lipid droplets, whereas LC3B primarily localizes to phagophores, autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Where these two proteins colocalize strongly suggests a growing phagophore in the process of membrane expansion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1B</xref>). To assess co-localization with phagophores, we expressed candidate early secretory proteins labeled with red fluorophores (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). ARFGAP1-TagRFP colocalized with ∼90% of actively forming phagophores, whereas only ∼30% of phagophores were coincident with the ERES markers mRuby-SEC23A or RFP-p125a/SEC23IP. Further, while the ARFGAP1 signal was largely concentrated in the Golgi, phagophores most frequently colocalized with extra-Golgi ARFGAP1 puncta.</p>
<p>Finally, we compare our results to the subcellular localization of ARFGAP1 established by global organelle profiling available at the database at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://organelles.sf.czbiohub.org">https://organelles.sf.czbiohub.org</ext-link><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. ARFGAP1 is enriched on autophagic membranes positive for LC3B as well as endolysosomal and early secretory membranes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Strikingly, ARFGAP1 was most highly enriched on membranes isolated via RAB1A immunoprecipitation. The autophagic proteins ATG2A, ATG2B, WDR45, and ATG9A, all of which are involved in membrane expansion of the autophagosome, were also highly enriched on RAB1A membranes. These collective results establish that both endogenous ARFGAP1 (organelle isolation, APEX, FLASH PAINT) and overexpressed ARFGAP1 (live imaging) naturally associate with ATG2A, including during phagophore biogenesis.</p>

<title>Autophagic flux depends upon RAB1 but not ARFGAP1</title>
<p>To look for a potential functional role for ARFGAP1 in autophagy, we measured autophagic flux using the HaloTag dropout assay in which liberation of a free HaloTag (HT) is indicative of lysosome-mediated proteolysis of the full-length (FL) protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. We stably expressed HaloTag7-mGFP-LC3B in WT HEK293 cells and then used siRNA to knockdown various regulators or potential regulators of macroautophagy initiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Despite efficient knockdown, siRNA against ARFGAP1 had very little effect on flux; the ratio of free HaloTag to full-length HaloTag7-mGFP-LC3B following ARFGAP1 knockdown was similar to both nontransfected (NT) and nontargeting siRNA controls. In contrast, knockdown of the autophagy initiation factor FIP200 dramatically suppressed dropout of the HaloTag. We also looked for an interaction between ARFGAP1 and ATG2A, but even when both proteins were overexpressed, we could not detect significant interaction via co-immunoprecipitation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Thus, it is likely that ARFGAP1 localizes to a key membrane involved in autophagosome biogenesis but is not itself a player in initiating autophagosome formation.</p>

</fig>
<p>As shown in (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), both the ATG2/ATG9 lipid transport apparatus as well as ARFGAP1 are associated to RAB1A-positive membranes. RAB1 proteins mediate ER to Golgi trafficking in the early secretory pathway. The yeast RAB1 homologue, Ypt1, is essential to autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, while in mammals, genetic depletion of either RAB1A or RAB1B modestly reduces autophagic flux<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Thus, we tested the functional and physical interaction of RAB1 proteins with ATG2. Consistent with previous results, siRNA knockdown of either RAB1A or RAB1B in our system partially inhibited flux in the Halo dropout assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Strikingly, knockdown of both homologues simultaneously was nearly as effective as knocking down FIP200, establishing that RAB1 proteins play an essential role in supporting starvation induced autophagic flux.</p>
<p>In addition to following the Halo-tagged LC3B, we also immunoblotted for endogenous LC3B in each of our siRNA experiments. We found that knockdown of either RAB1 isoform, and especially knockdown of both together leads to a clear accumulation of the membrane conjugated form of LC3B, LC3B-II (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). As LC3B overexpression can alter endogenous LC3B patterns, we confirmed this increase in a cell line expressing only HaloTag7-mGFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Knockdown of RAB1A and RAB1B drove a threefold increase of LC3B-II (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Increasing LC3B-II levels without autophagic flux is indicative of a block to macroautophagy at a late stage, downstream of initiation, and is therefore easily distinguished from the block induced by depleting FIP200 (where LC3B-II levels go down). Intriguingly, LC3B-II levels also increase when ATG2 proteins are genetically depleted (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A,B</xref>), suggesting ATG2A and RAB1A might function together. Indeed, overexpressed GFP-RAB1A could strongly immunoprecipitate flag-tagged ATG2A in our cells, indicating these proteins are in a shared complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>).</p>
<p>We also tested several other proximity hits from the biotinylation analysis for interaction with flag-tagged ATG2A, including GFP-tagged copies of ERES resident proteins SEC23A, SEC31A, SEC16A, Sar1 and all four homologs of Sec24 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2 A-D</xref>). We found that ATG2A co-immunoprecipitated weakly with many of them, the strongest of which was SEC24D. Note that this SEC24D interaction was barely above the background of pull-down with GFP alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Thus, consistent with proximity and imaging analyses, ATG2 proteins are in the general proximity of the ERES machinery, but protein-protein interactions appear to be limited to RAB1.</p>

<title>Disruption of the early secretory pathway results in the recruitment of autophagic proteins to RAB1A-positive tubular membranes</title>
<p>These results suggest that ATG2 engages an early secretory membrane, distinct from the ERES, in a RAB1-dependent manner. We next tested whether disruption of the early secretory system would impact the localization of ATG2A. To this end, we overexpressed SAR1BH79G, the catalytic dead mutant of the small GTPase SAR1B that recruits the COPII coat. SAR1BH79G binds the membrane and recruits the COPII coat, but is unable to release, thereby trapping COPII onto the membrane. Overexpression of this construct has been shown to reduce autophagy in starved cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Consistent with those results, overexpression of SAR1BH79G-mOrange2 diminished autophagic flux of both a bulk cargo (HaloTag7-mGFP reduced ∼20%) and of LC3B (HaloTag7-mGFP-LC3B reduced by ∼30%) by the HaloTag degradation assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs 3A/B</xref>). Further, LC3B puncta number were lowest in cells expressing high amounts of SAR1BH79G (Figs. S3A/B), consistent with a block to autophagosome formation rather than autophagosome clearance.</p>

</fig>
<p>Unexpectedly, in a small subset of transfected cells (1.5±0.8%), overexpression of SAR1BH79G under starvation conditions shifted the localization of GFP-ATG2A from a largely punctate distribution to long, tubular objects that were SAR1BH79G negative (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). GFP-ATG2A decorated these tubules with varying intensities approximating a beads-on-a-string pattern (e.g. arrows in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Fluorescently tagged forms of LC3B, ARFGAP1 and RAB1A also decorated these tubules. However, these three proteins displayed the brightest intensities where ATG2A was dimmer (e.g. arrowheads in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). These three proteins, but not ATG2A, also decorated larger structures that appeared to be contiguous with the tubule, including bulbous regions at the tubule termini.</p>
<p>To determine the ultrastructure of these regions, we subjected GFP-ATG2A-expressing cells to correlative light and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (CLEM-FIB-SEM). The GFP-ATG2A fluorescence signal corresponded to thin, tubular membranes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3C</xref>), which is consistent with the finding that ATG2A preferentially binds highly curved membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. The tubule is surrounded by ER elements, many of which appear to be in very close contact (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>, S3C). GFP-ATG2A signal was more intense in regions with closely adjacent ER, consistent with a possible contact site localization. The tubule continued into larger structures at either end, which were GFP-ATG2-negative, and morphologically similar with the bulbous structures harboring ARFGAP1, RAB1A and LC3B in fluorescence images.</p>
<p>Thus, although unusual, these rare tubules afforded an opportunity to demonstrate that ATG2, ARFGAP1 and RAB1A target the same membrane, easily resolvable even at confocal resolution. ATG2 collects where ER is closely adjacent, and LC3B accumulates with RAB1A, implying a topological organization with LC3B and RAB1A decorating the same structure, suggesting that RAB1A membranes may be a component or progenitor of the phagophore membrane.</p>

<title>ARFGAP1 and RAB1A accumulate around pre-autophagic structures in ATG2 DKO cells</title>
<p>We previously published that very small, ATG9- and LC3B-positive vesicles accumulate in large clusters with the cargo-adaptor p62 in ATG2 DKO cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. This cluster is surrounded by a shell of more complicated membranes which we termed “protophagophores” because they colocalize with other autophagy proteins such as WIPI2 and because many of them appear to adopt a cup-like shape in TEM images. Beyond this protophagophore shell, the entire structure is surrounded by ER (illustrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Our work and others have shown that essentially all proteins involved in autophagosome biogenesis accumulate with these clusters, including FIP200, ATG14, ATG9A, ATG16L, and p62<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, suggesting they are repositories of autophagosome biogenesis material awaiting the arrival of ATG2 proteins.

<p>We therefore performed IF against various markers of the early secretory pathway in ATG2 DKO cells to look for colocalization with this compartment (represented by staining for p62 (mouse antibody) or for LC3B (rabbit antibody); <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4B-D</xref>). We found that ER exit site markers such as SEC16A, SEC24C, SEC31A, and TFG were not enriched around the compartment, neither was the Golgi protein GM130 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4C-D</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4A</xref>). ßCOP was modestly enriched, but at levels that by eye, did not suggest encapsulation of the compartment the way autophagy proteins collect. In addition, overexpressed mEmerald-ERGIC53 did not localize to the ATG2 DKO compartment (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>). In contrast, ARFGAP1 targeted essentially all of the ATG2 DKO compartments, forming a robust spherical shell at the periphery of the p62 signal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-D</xref>).

<p>We were unable to find a strong RAB1A signal by immunofluorescence, however, when overexpressed, GFP-RAB1A also formed a sphere around the ATG2 DKO compartment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we describe an interaction of ARFGAP1/RAB1-positive membranes with the autophagic biogenesis machinery including the lipid transporter ATG2. These membranes likely derive from a privileged region of the ERGIC consistent with the literature tying these intermediate secretory membranes to autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. In particular, the presence of both ARFGAP1 and RAB1 plus the general proximity to ERES proteins across a variety of assays is consistent with an early secretory origin for these membranes. Intriguingly, ARFGAP1 and RAB1 coalesce around the periphery of the ATG2 DKO compartment exactly where we previously described complex cup-shaped membranes, so called proto-phagophores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, accumulate. We do not detect any other ERES or ERGIC markers at these sites, implying proto-phagophores derive from only a subdomain of the ERGIC which we suspect is remodeled specifically for the purpose of supporting autophagy.</p>
<p>What do the ERGIC-derived membranes contribute to autophagosome formation? We speculate on three possibilities: 1) Local proteins are needed to drive other early autophagy steps. Most notably, in addition to interacting with ATG2A as shown here, RAB1 proteins also interact with other early acting autophagy proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> including especially the PI3Kinase, VPS34<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Thus, a privileged region of the ERGIC may simply best coordinate the machinery driving local protein and lipid remodeling needed to initiate phagophore formation. 2) ERGIC-derived membranes may have a unique membrane composition and structure necessary for autophagosome biogenesis. The RAB1-positive membranes that accumulate around the core of ATG9 vesicles in the DKO compartment are enriched for cup-like morphologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. We do not yet know the structural basis for these morphologies, but it may be that membranes with a natural degree of plasticity, as has been shown for the complex network of structures emanating from COPI/COPII rich early secretory membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, are better adapted to the subsequent remodeling needed to shape and grow around cytoplasm isolates during starvation-mediated macroautophagy. 3) Small ATG9 vesicles may not contribute sufficient volume to grow a phagophore, even considering the very small luminal volume of a mature autophagosome.</p>
<p>Geometric estimates of the surface-to-volume ratio in yeast autophagosomes, gleaned from cryo-electron microscopy tomograms, suggest that as much as 20% of the membrane might derive from fusion rather than lipid transport in order to deliver volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Autophagosome biogenesis also depends upon the incorporation of ATG9 scramblases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, which are thought to be delivered from a trans-Golgi compartment to the site of autophagosome biogenesis. As both the ERGIC and ATG9 seed membranes collect to high local concentrations in ATG2 DKO cells, future work may be able to tease out how their separation and eventual coalescence are regulated.</p>

All conditions were expanded to 3×15cm plates prior to proximity labeling. Heavy labeled cells were starved in EBSS and treated with 100 nM Bafilomycin A1 (Enzo, BML-CM110-0100) for 2 hrs prior to labeling. All conditions were incubated with 500 μM Biotin Phenol (Biotinyl Tyramide; Sigma-Aldrich, SML2135) for 30 min at 37°C. The heavy and medium isotope conditions were treated with 1 mM H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich, H1009-100ML) for 1 min at room temperature. All conditions were then aspirated and scraped in quencher solution containing 10 mM sodium azide (Sigma-Aldrich, S2002-100G), 10 mM sodium ascorbate (Sigma-Aldrich, A4034-100G) and 5 mM Trolox (Sigma-Aldrich, 238813-5G) in DPBS. The cells were then spun down at 77xg for 5 min at 4°C and were resuspended in quencher solution. This process was repeated for a total of three washes.

After three washes in 1xPBS for five minutes each, cells were blocked and permeabilized with 3% BSA and 0.25% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h. Next, cells were incubated with the anti-ARFGAP1 antibody, anti-SEC31A antibody, and the GFP-Nanobody in 3% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C overnight.

After four washes (30 s, 60 s, 2× 5 min), the sample was post-fixed with 3% PFA and 0.1% GA for 10 min. Finally, samples were washed three times with 1× PBS for 5 min each before adding the imaging solution.</p>
<p>The imaging solution consisted of 1x PBS and 500 mM NaCl and was supplemented with 1× Trolox, (100× Trolox: 100 mg Trolox, 430 μL 100 % Methanol, 345 μL 1M NaOH in 3.2 mL H<sub>2</sub>O), 1× PCA (40× PCA: 154 mg PCA, 10 mL water and NaOH were mixed and pH was adjusted 9.0), and 1× PCD (100× PCD: 9.3 mg PCD, 13.3 mL of buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 % Glycerol)).

<p>Fluorescence imaging was carried out on an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti2 microscope (Nikon Instruments) with the Perfect Focus System, attached to a Andor Dragonfly unit. The Dragonfly was used in the BTIRF mode, applying an objective-type TIRF configuration with an oil-immersion objective (Nikon Instruments, Apo SR TIRF 60×, NA 1.49, Oil). As excitation laser, a 561 nm (1W nominal) was used. The beam was coupled into a multimode fiber going through the Andor Borealis unit reshaping the beam from a gaussian profile to a homogenous flat top. As dichroic mirror a CR-DFLY-DMQD-01 was used. Fluorescence light was spectrally filtered with an emission filter (TR-DFLY-F600-050) and imaged on a scientific complementary metal oxide semiconductor (sCMOS) camera (Sona 4BV6X, Andor Technologies) without further magnification, resulting in an effective pixel size of 108 nm.

Images were acquired on an inverted Zeiss LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope with AiryScan, using Zen acquisition software (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1D</xref>) or a Nikon CSU-W1 SoRa 60x oil objective, using the Nikon Elements software (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C-F</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3C</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). All images were processed using ImageJ software. Images are displayed either as maximum intensity projections or single confocal slices as stated in the figure legends.</p>
<p>To assess the enrichment factor of early secretory proteins around the ATG2 DKO compartment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), the phagophore channel which was denoted by either LC3B or P62 was masked and duplicated. Following outlier removal, one masked image was dilated and the other eroded. Following an XOR function, the resulting signal formed a ring around the ATG2 DKO compartment and the early secretory protein channel(s) were measured using this ROI. Separately, the early secretory protein channel was masked using a manual threshold and measured. The enrichment factor was calculated as (Mean<sub>compartment</sub>-Min<sub>cell</sub>)/(Mean<sub>cell</sub>-Min<sub>cell</sub>). Three biological replicates were combined and statistically assessed using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett multiple comparison test. All data were plotted with mean ± SD, and all significance values were considering adjusted P value based on grouped analyses in Prism 9 (GraphPad). Asterisks indicate significance: *, P &lt; 0.05; **, P &lt; 0.01; ***, P &lt; 0.001; ****, P &lt; 0.0001.</p>

<p>Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine coated MatTek dishes (MatTek, P35GC-1.5-14-C). The following day the cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L3000015) according to the manufacturer’s protocol for 18-24 hrs. The cells were starved in HBSS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 14025092) for 2-4 h and imaged in the same solution at 37°C. All images were analyzed using ImageJ and are displayed as maximum intensity projections.</p>
<p>For phagophore quantification (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>), each channel was masked using a manual threshold and outliers were removed. The ATG2A and LC3B channels were merged using the AND function and quantified as the total number of phagophores. The phagophore channel was then merged using the AND function with the transfected gene and quantified as the number of positive phagophores. Three biological replicates were combined and the ratio of positive over total was plotted and statistically assessed using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett multiple comparison test. All data were plotted with mean ± SD, and all significance values were considering adjusted P value based on grouped analyses in Prism 9 (GraphPad). Asterisks indicate significance: *, P &lt; 0.05; **, P &lt; 0.01; ***, P &lt; 0.001; ****, P &lt; 0.0001.</p>

<caption><title>ATG2A and ARFGAP1 colocalize during starvation.</title><p><bold>(A-C)</bold> Immunoblot showing the restoration of LC3B flux (B) and P62 clearance (C) in ATG2 DKO cells stably expressing APEX2-GFP-ATG2A. The restoration of a wild type phenotype indicates that the fusion protein is both localizing and functioning properly. The band intensity of LC3B (B) and P62 (C) were normalized against the intensity of GAPDH for each lane. To normalize each replicate, each individual value was divided by the average of the replicate. Statistical significance was assessed by two way ANOVA. Data from five biological replicates were collected for each condition, save for the WT + Baf and WT + Baf + EBSS, which each had four replicates. <bold>(D-F)</bold> Single slice confocal immunofluorescence images (D) and immunoblots (E-F) demonstrating that the addition of biotin phenol and hydrogen peroxide to ATG2 DKO cells stably expressing APEX2-GFP-ATG2A results in the biotinylation of proteins proximal to ATG2A. The omittance of either biotin phenol or hydrogen peroxide resulted in the loss of the anti-biotin signal, save for endogenously biotinylated proteins. The immunoblot in (F) demonstrates that the biotinylated proteins can be enriched on streptavidin beads. <bold>(G)</bold> Proximity labeling of HEK293 ATG2 DKO cells stably expressing APEX2-GFP-ATG2A was performed as described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>. <bold>(H-J)</bold> FLASH-PAINT analysis confirming the proximity of ATG2A to ARFGAP1. ATG2 DKO cells stably expressing GFP-ATG2A were labeled with all of the antibodies listed in (J), which in turn were preincubated with secondary antibodies with unique DNA sequences as depicted in (H). Each target (T1, T2… Tn) was visualized sequentially by adding an adaptor DNA strand that matched the target sequence (A1, A2… An) and an additional sequence to recruit the imager DNA strand (H). To remove the imager strand from each sequential target, a unique eraser strand was added that recognized the entirety of the adaptor sequence (e.g. A1) and part of the imager sequence, resulting in the total sequestration of the adaptor DNA strand. The subsequent adaptor sequence was then added to visualize the next target protein. Seven of the ten visualized proteins are depicted in (I), which highlights the proximity of ATG2A and ARFGAP1 at autophagic and early secretory membranes. The heatmap presented in (J) shows the median distance within 200 nm between all visualized proteins. (I); pink arrow heads = ERES. white arrow heads = exogenous beads used as a fiduciary marks in imaging. (I; insets), brackets indicate immediate proximity of ATG2 (green) and ARFGAP (maroon) as frequently observed in ERES.</p></caption>

<caption><title>SAR1BH79G overexpression hinders autophagy and leads to the formation of ATG2A positive membrane tubules.</title><p><bold>(A-B)</bold> Live cell imaging shows that SAR1BH79G overexpression negatively correlates with LC3B puncta number. ATG2 DKO cells stably expressing GFP-ATG2A and BFP-LC3B were transfected with SAR1BH79G-mOrange2 and starved for 2 hours. The number of transfected cells with GFP-ATG2A tubules (white arrow in A) was counted against the total number of transfected cells, resulting in a formation rate of 1.5±0.8%. ROIs were drawn over each transfected cell, and the resulting SAR1BH79G intensity was plotted against the number LC3B puncta in (B). A linear trendline was added in black with a 95% confidence interval. <bold>(C)</bold> CLEM-FIBSEM of cells prepared as in (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). GFP-ATG2A fluorescence corresponds to a thin tubular membrane. A single slice SEM slice is depicted in (i). Note that the segmented tubule comes in and out of the plane of this slice, so the tubule that is highlighted in turquoise is not complete. The yellow arrows are pointing at adjacent ER structures which are segmented and displayed in (ii) in yellow. At many points, these ER structures come into very close apposition with the tubule which is denoted in red. The ER structures are removed in (iii) for better visualization of the tubule. The GFP-ATG2A fluorescence signal is depicted in (iv).</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>D. Fuller et al. set out to study the molecular partners that cooperate with ATG2A, a lipid transfer protein essential for phagophore elongation, during the process of autophagy. Through a series of experiments combining microscopy and biochemistry, the authors identify ARFGAP1 and Rab1A as components of early autophagic membranes, which accumulate at the periphery of aberrant pre-autophagosomal structures induced by loss of ATG2. While ARFGAP1 has no apparent function in autophagy, the authors show that RAB1A is implicated in autophagy, although the mechanisms are not explored in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work presented by Fuller et al. provides new insights into the composition of early autophagic membranes. The authors provide a series of MS experiments identifying proteins in close proximity to ATG2A, which is a valuable dataset for the field. Furthermore, they show for the first time the interaction between ATG2A and RAB1A, both in fed and starved conditions, which extends the characterisation of the pre-autophagosomal structures observed in ATG2 DKO cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors claim that this study elucidates the role of early secretory membranes in phagophore formation. However, this work is largely observational, which presents compelling evidence on the association between RAB1A GTPase and ATG2A without providing mechanistic insights into the functional relevance of this interaction. It remains unclear whether Rab1A depletion phenocopies ATG2A depletion in terms of autophagy progression or accumulation of pre-autophagosomal structures.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this research is conducted exclusively in HEK293 cells. Including at least one additional cell line would significantly strengthen the main findings (i.e., effects on LC3-II accumulation observed for RAB1A/B knockdown, given the previously published data on this topic).</p>
<p>A notable weakness of this manuscript, in this reviewer's opinion, lies in the discussion of the data in the context of existing literature. The discussion is rather short, mostly focused on the phenotype observed in ATG2 DKO cells. While this phenotype is certainly intriguing, it feels the discussion overlooks some important aspects, as outlined in the comments to the authors.</p>

<p>The mechanisms governing autophagic membrane expansion remain incompletely understood. ATG2 is known to function as a lipid transfer protein critical for this process; however, how ATG2 is coordinated with the broader autophagic machinery and endomembrane systems has remained elusive. In this study, the authors employ an elegant proximity labeling approach and identify two ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)-localized proteins-Rab1 and ARFGAP1-as novel regulators of ATG2 during autophagic membrane expansion.</p>
<p>Their findings support a model in which autophagosome formation occurs within a specialized subdomain of the ER that is enriched in both ER exit sites (ERES) and ERGIC, providing valuable mechanistic insight. The overall study is well-executed and offers an important contribution to our understanding of autophagy.</p>
<p>Specific Comments</p>
<p>(1) Integration with Prior Literature</p>
<p>
The data convincingly implicate the ERES-ERGIC interface in autophagosome biogenesis. It would strengthen the manuscript to discuss previous studies reporting ERES and ERGIC remodeling and formation of ERERS-ERGIC contact sites (PMID: 34561617; PMID: 28754694) in the context of the current findings.</p>
<p>(2) Experimental Conditions</p>
<p>
In Figures 2A-C and Figure 4, it is unclear how the cells were treated. Were they starved in EBSS? This information should be included in the corresponding figure legends.</p>
<p>(3) LC3 Lipidation vs. Cleavage</p>
<p>
In Figure 2A, ARFGAP1 knockdown appears to reduce LC3 lipidation without affecting Halo-LC3 cleavage. Clarifying this observation would help readers better understand the functional specificity of ARFGAP1 in the pathway.</p>
<p>(4) Use of HT-mGFP in Figure 2C</p>
<p>
It should be clarified whether the assay in Figure 2C was performed in the presence of HT-mGFP. Explaining the rationale would aid the interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>(5) COPII Inhibition Strategy</p>
<p>
The authors used the dominant-active SAR1(H79G) mutant to inhibit COPII function. While this is effective in in vitro budding assays, the GDP-locked mutant SAR1(T39N) has been shown to be more effective in blocking COPII-mediated trafficking in cells. Including SAR1(T39N) in the analysis would provide stronger support for the conclusions.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Fuller et al describes a crosstalk between ARTG2A with components of the early secretory pathway, namely RAB1A and ARFGAP1. They show that ATG2A is recruited to membranes positive for RAB1A, which they also show to interact with ATG2A. In agreement with earlier findings by other groups, silencing RAB1A negatively affects autophagy. While ARFGAP1 was also found on ATG2A-positive membranes, silencing ARFGAP1 had no impact on autophagy. Notably, these ARFGAP1-positive membranes are not Golgi membranes.</p>
<p>The findings are interesting, and in general, the data are of good quality; however, I have outstanding questions. An answer to any of these questions might strengthen the manuscript:</p>
<p>(1) Are the membranes to which ATG2A is recruited a form of ERGIC?</p>
<p>(2) Figure 3A/B: Is it possible to show a better example? The difference is barely detectable by eye. Since immunoblotting is not really a quantitative method, I think that such a weak effect is prone to be wrong. Is there another tool/assay to validate this result?</p>
<p>(3) Is the curvature-sensitive region of ARFGAP1 required for its co-localization with ATG2A?</p>
<p>(4) What does Rab1A do? What is its effector? Or does the GTPase itself remodel the membrane?</p>
<p>(5) What about Arf1? It appears that the role of ARFGAP1 is unrelated to Arf1 and COPI? Thus, one would predict that Arf1 does not localize to these structures and does not affect ATG2A function.</p>
<p>(6) Does ARFGAP1 promote fission of the membrane from its donor compartment?</p>
<p>(7) What are ARFGAP1 and Rab1A recruited to? What is the lipid composition or protein that recruits these two players to regulate autophagy?</p>
