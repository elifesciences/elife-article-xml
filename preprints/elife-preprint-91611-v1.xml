<title>Abstract</title><p>The DNA damage response is critical for maintaining genome integrity and is commonly disrupted in the development of cancer. PPM1D (protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1D) is a master negative regulator of the response; gain-of-function mutations and amplifications of <italic>PPM1D</italic> are found across several human cancers making it a relevant pharmacologic target. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 screening to identify synthetic-lethal dependencies of <italic>PPM1D,</italic> uncovering superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) as a potential target for PPM1D-mutant cells. We revealed a dysregulated redox landscape characterized by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and a compromised response to oxidative stress in <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells. Moreover, we observed marked genomic instability in mutant cells, which is exacerbated upon inhibition of SOD1. Altogether, our results demonstrate the protective role of SOD1 against oxidative stress and DNA damage in <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant leukemia cells and highlight a new potential therapeutic strategy against <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cancers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cellular DNA is frequently damaged by both endogenous and exogenous factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hoeijmakers, 2009</xref>). Unresolved DNA damage can lead to genomic instability, which is a hallmark of aging and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Cells have evolved intricate mechanisms to detect and repair DNA lesions. The DNA damage response (DDR) is a complex network of signaling pathways that coordinate various cellular processes initiated by p53, such as DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>), cell cycle checkpoint activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Harper et al., 1993</xref>), and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yonish-Rouach et al., 1991</xref>). However, upon resolution of DNA damage, the cell must terminate the DDR to avoid prolonged cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. One critical mechanism for DDR termination is the expression of Protein Phosphatase Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup>–Dependent 1D (PPM1D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fiscella et al., 1997</xref>), which is induced by p53 and plays a key role in attenuating the response. PPM1D is a member of the PP2C family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases and has been shown to dephosphorylate a wide range of DDR signaling molecules including p53, p38 MAPK, CHK1, CHK2, and H2AX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bulavin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cha et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Oliva-Trastoy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Takekawa et al., 2000</xref>). These dephosphorylation events generally lead to reduced activity of the targets, ultimately resulting in deactivation of the DDR.</p>
<p>Dysregulation of PPM1D has been associated with the development of diverse cancers, including breast, ovarian, esophagus, brain, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Khadka et al., 2022</xref>; Li et al., 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ruark et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>PPM1D</italic> is located on chromosome 17q and therefore frequently amplified in breast and ovarian cancers exhibiting 17q23 amplifications (Li et al., 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ruark et al., 2013</xref>). These amplifications result in overexpression of the wildtype PPM1D protein and consequent suppression of p53 and other PPM1D targets in the DDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bulavin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lambros et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, PPM1D can also become dysregulated through mutations in its terminal exon. These mutations produce a truncated protein that is stabilized, evading proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tokheim et al., 2021</xref>). The resulting mutant protein maintains its phosphatase activity and is found at high levels even in the absence of DNA damage. Excessive PPM1D activity leads to constitutive dephosphorylation and downregulation of PPM1D targets including multiple members of the DDR (Hsu et al., 2018). These gain-of-function <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutations are observed in diverse solid cancers including osteosarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">He et al., 2021</xref>), colorectal carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Peng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yin et al., 2013</xref>), diffuse midline gliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) and others. Moreover, <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutations and overexpression are associated with advanced tumor stage, worse prognosis, and increased lymph node metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Peng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>More recently, <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutations have been shown to drive expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bolton et al., 2020</xref>; Hsu et al., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kahn et al., 2018</xref>) in association with clonal hematopoiesis (CH), a pre-malignant state associated with an increased risk of hematologic malignancies and elevated all-cause mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Genovese et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jaiswal et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutations are particularly enriched in patients with prior exposure to cytotoxic therapies, who have a high risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) (Hsu et al., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lindsley et al., 2017</xref>). Given the prevalence of <italic>PPM1D</italic> aberrations in cancer, PPM1D is an attractive therapeutic target. Ongoing efforts are focused on elucidating the structure of PPM1D to improve drug design and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Miller et al., 2022</xref>). While several inhibitors thus far have shown efficacy <italic>in vitro</italic>, few have been studied <italic>in vivo</italic> and none have progressed to clinical trials due to poor bioavailability. Therefore, identifying targetable, synthetic-lethal partners to exploit the genetic defects of <italic>PPM1D</italic>-altered cells can offer an alternative therapeutic approach.</p>
<p>In this study, we performed an unbiased, whole-genome CRISPR screen to investigate genes essential for cell survival in <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutated leukemia cell lines. We identified superoxide dismutase-1 (<italic>SOD1</italic>) as a novel synthetic-lethal dependency of PPM1D which was validated by genetic and pharmacologic approaches. We showed that the mutant cells display compromised responses to oxidative stress and DNA damage, leading to increased reactive oxygen species and genomic instability. These results provide valuable insights into the biological processes corrupted by mutant PPM1D and underscore the potential of SOD1 as a targetable vulnerability in this context.</p>

<title><italic>SOD1</italic> is a synthetic lethal vulnerability of <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant leukemia cells</title>
<p>CRISPR dropout screens have emerged as a powerful tool to assess the functional importance of individual genes within a particular pathway by measuring the impact of their depletion on cell viability or fitness. To identify genes essential for <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cell survival, we first created isogenic wild-type (WT) and <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant Cas9-expressing OCI-AML2 leukemia cell lines and selected two <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant clones for CRISPR screening (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>). We transduced the cells with a whole-genome lentiviral library containing 90,709 guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting 18,010 human genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tzelepis et al., 2016</xref>). At day ten post-transduction, the cells were harvested for the first timepoint and then subsequently passaged for an additional 18 days to allow for negatively selected gene-knockout cells to “drop out”. The remaining pool of cells were collected for deep sequencing analysis of gRNA abundance (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). We analyzed genes that were specifically depleted in the mutant but not WT cells using the MaGECK-VISPR pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Differentially depleted genes are those for which the knockout or depletion of the gene results in a significant impact on the viability or growth of <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells compared to WT control cells. Through this analysis, we identified 409 differentially depleted genes in one of the <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant clones and 92 differentially depleted genes in the other clone while adhering to the maximum false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 25%. Among these genes, we found 37 common candidates that were depleted in both <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant biological replicates that were not depleted in the WT control cells <bold>(<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 1B</xref></bold>, <bold>Figure 1–source data 1</bold>).</p>

<p>Gene ontology analysis of these top essential genes demonstrated an enrichment in pathways related to DNA repair, interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair, and cellular responses to stress (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). Pathway analyses with the KEGG and REAC databases revealed a significant enrichment of the Fanconi anemia (FA) repair pathway, with notable genes such as <italic>BRIP1</italic> (<italic>FANCJ</italic>), <italic>FANCI, FANCA, SLX4</italic> (<italic>FANCP), UBE2T</italic> (<italic>FANCT</italic>), and <italic>C19orf40 (FAAP24)</italic> <bold>(<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>). Interestingly, our dropout screen revealed that superoxide dismutase 1, or <italic>SOD1</italic>, was the top essential gene based on fitness score (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). SOD1 is a crucial enzyme involved in scavenging superoxide (O<sub>2–</sub>) radicals, which are harmful byproducts of mitochondrial cellular metabolism. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes oxidative stress, which can damage cellular structures including DNA, proteins, and lipids. SOD1 is an attractive therapeutic target due to the availability of SOD1 small molecule inhibitors that are being tested in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lowndes et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, we decided to further investigate the role of SOD1 in promoting <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cell survival.</p>
<p>To validate the essentiality of SOD1 in <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> competitive proliferation assays in two different acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, OCI-AML2 and OCI-AML3. We transduced isogenic WT and <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant Cas9-expressing cells with either empty vector (EV) or two different <italic>SOD1-</italic>gRNA-expressing lentiviral vectors containing a blue-fluorescent protein (BFP) reporter. While loss of <italic>SOD1</italic> had minimal effects on the fitness of WT cells, <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells with <italic>SOD1</italic> deletion had significant reduction in cellular growth in both OCI-AML2 and OCI-AML3 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). Collectively, these results show that loss of <italic>SOD1</italic> confers a significant disadvantage specific to <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant leukemia cells.</p>

<title><italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells are sensitive to SOD1 inhibition and have increased oxidative stress</title>
<p>We next wanted to test if pharmacologic inhibition of SOD1 could mimic the genetic deletion of <italic>SOD1</italic>. We used two different SOD1 inhibitors, Lung Cancer Screen-1 (LCS-1) and <italic>Bis</italic>-choline tetrathiomolybdate (ATN-224), which work by different mechanisms. LCS-1 is a small molecule that binds to SOD1 and disrupts its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Somwar et al., 2011</xref>), while ATN-224 is a copper chelator that reduces SOD1 activity by decreasing the availability of copper ions, which are an essential SOD1 cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Juarez et al., 2006</xref>). To study the sensitivity of <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells to SOD1 inhibition, we engineered three patient-derived AML cell lines, MOLM-13, OCI-AML2, and OCI-AML3 which harbor distinct genetic backgrounds and AML driver mutations. Upon treatment with either ATN-224 or LCS-1, we found that SOD1 inhibition induced a significantly greater proportion of apoptotic <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant than <italic>PPM1D</italic>-WT cells (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>). <italic>PPM1D</italic>-truncating mutations conferred significant sensitivity to SOD1 inhibition compared to their WT counterparts in all three AML cell lines <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 1B</xref></bold>). To determine if this cytotoxicity was dependent on oxidative stress, we treated the cells with SOD1 inhibitors in combination with an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Importantly, NAC supplementation was able to completely rescue the sensitivity of mutant cells to both LCS-1 and ATN-224 treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>), suggesting that ROS generation contributes to the sensitivity of mutant cells to SOD1 inhibition.</p>

<p>Activating mutations in oncogenes often lead to increased ROS generation by altering cellular metabolism, inducing replication stress, or dysregulating redox homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Maya-Mendoza et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Park et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells have increased oxidative stress, leading to reliance on SOD1 for protection. SOD1 catalyzes the breakdown of superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and water. Therefore, we first assessed mitochondrial superoxide levels using the fluorogenic dye, Mitosox Green. This mitochondrial-targeted dye is rapidly oxidized by superoxide, but not other types of ROS, to produce green fluorescence. We observed that in the absence of exogenous stressors, <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells had a moderate increase in superoxide radicals (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). Free radicals can be detrimental to cells due to their ability to oxidize proteins, lipids, and DNA. Therefore, we also measured levels of lipid peroxidation as an additional measure of oxidative stress. Consistent with the increase in superoxide radicals, we observed a concurrent increase in lipid peroxidation in the <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). Using 2’7’-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) staining to measure total ROS levels, we observed that <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells harbored more total ROS compared to WT cells and that upon inhibition of SOD1, there was an increase in ROS that was specific to the mutant cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether the observed elevated ROS was a characteristic of other <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cell lines, we measured ROS levels in two different germline models. Humans with germline mutations in <italic>PPM1D</italic> were first described by Jansen et al. in 2017 in patients with intellectual disability. This neurodevelopmental condition is named Jansen-de Vries syndrome (JdVS, OMIM #617450) and is characterized by frameshift or nonsense mutations in the last or second-to-last exons of the <italic>PPM1D</italic> gene. These mutations result in functionally active, truncated mutant proteins like those exhibited in human cancers and clonal hematopoiesis. Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were generated from these JdVS patients by Jansen et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jansen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wojcik et al., 2023</xref>). In addition to human <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant LCLs, we also generated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from a germline mouse model harboring a heterozygous truncating mutation in the terminal exon of <italic>Ppm1d (Hsu et al., 2018)</italic>. When we measured total ROS from both the JdVS LCLs and the <italic>Ppm1d</italic>-mutant MEFs compared to their WT counterparts, both mutant models exhibited greater levels of total ROS (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">E</xref></bold>). Additionally, <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant LCLs were also more sensitive to pharmacologic SOD1 inhibition compared to the WT LCL line, GM12878 (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 1F</xref></bold>). These results demonstrate that <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutations not only increase ROS in the context of cancer, where cellular metabolism is often altered, but can also alter redox homeostasis in non-transformed cells.</p>
<p>To determine if mutant PPM1D was associated with ROS generation, we treated isogenic OCI-AML2 WT and <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells with a PPM1D inhibitor, GSK2830371, for 24 hours. We found that pharmacologic inhibition of PPM1D mildly decreased ROS levels in both WT and <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutant cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref></bold>), suggesting a link between PPM1D and ROS production. Altogether, these data demonstrate that SOD1 inhibition leads to preferential cytotoxicity in the mutant cells due to increased oxidative stress induced by mutant PPM1D.</p>

<title><italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant leukemia cells have altered mitochondrial function</title>
<p>Mitochondria are the primary source of ROS within the cell, as the electron transport chain is a major site of ROS production during oxidative phosphorylation. We next asked whether the observed increase in ROS in <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells was due to differences in mitochondrial abundance. We used two independent methods to measure mitochondrial mass, including MitoTracker Green flow cytometry (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>) and western blot analysis of mitochondrial complex proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). However, we did not observe a difference in mitochondrial mass with either method.

<p>To assess mitochondrial function, we performed seahorse assays in WT and <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant OCI-AML2 cells. Our seahorse assays revealed that the mutant cells have decreased mitochondrial respiration, as indicated by decreased basal, maximal, and ATP-linked respiration (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). While <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant MOLM-13 and OCI-AML3 cells also had decreased basal respiration, there were variable differences in maximal and ATP-linked respiration compared to WT, suggesting possible cell line differences affecting mitochondrial respiration <bold>(<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">B</xref></bold>). In addition to analyzing respiratory capacity, we also examined mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) using the fluorescent dye Mitotracker CMXRos, which accumulates in the mitochondria in an MMP-dependent manner. We stained both WT and mutant cells with Mitotracker CMXRos and observed a decrease in MMP in the mutant cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). Tracking cell numbers between the WT and mutant cell lines over time established this decrease in MMP was not due to altered cellular growth rates (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3–figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>). Altogether, these findings, along with decreased respiratory capacity and increased mitochondrial ROS, indicate a mitochondrial defect in <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells.</p>

<title><italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells have a reduced oxidative stress response</title>
<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction and increased ROS production are closely intertwined. On one hand, mitochondrial dysfunction leads to increased ROS production as a result of impaired oxidative phosphorylation and increased electron leakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Turrens, 2003</xref>). On the other hand, sustained oxidative stress can directly damage mitochondrial components and mtDNA and compromise their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wallace, 2005</xref>). To better understand the molecular basis for the observed mitochondrial dysfunction and dependency on SOD1, we performed bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on Cas9-expressing WT and <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant OCI-AML2 cells transduced with <italic>SOD1</italic>-sgRNA to induce <italic>SOD1</italic> deletion or the empty vector (EV) control (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>). Both EV and SOD1-sgRNA vectors were tagged with a BFP reporter to identify transduced cells. The cells were collected ten-days post-transduction, the timepoint at which we observed 50% reduction of the <italic>SOD1</italic>-deletion cells during the <italic>in vitro</italic> proliferation assays, reasoning this would capture the effects of <italic>SOD1</italic>-deletion on cellular and metabolic processes while avoiding excessive cell death.</p>
<p>Analysis of the RNA-seq data revealed 3530 differentially expressed genes, with 2028 downregulated genes and 1502 upregulated genes in the mutant cells compared to WT cells at baseline (<bold>Figure 4–source data 1</bold>).

<p>Following <italic>SOD1</italic> deletion, the WT cells displayed notable upregulation of pathways associated with cell cycling, chromosome organization, cell division, and DNA repair. In contrast, the mutant cells showed significant downregulation of these same pathways (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>). Intriguingly, upon <italic>SOD1</italic> deletion, the mutant cells exhibited an upregulation in the response to oxidative stress (GO:0006979, <bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1D</xref></bold>). This finding suggests a reactive transcriptional response to the heightened ROS levels resulting from the loss of SOD1.</p>
<p>As PPM1D is a phosphatase that can directly modulate the activation state of proteins, we examined whether there were alterations in protein and phosphoprotein levels in <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis, mirroring the experimental design used for bulk RNA-seq (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>). By focusing on differential protein expression between wild-type (WT) and <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells, we aimed to capture the post-translational regulatory events that could contribute to the mitochondrial dysfunction observed in the mutants. The RPPA analysis of over 200 (phospho-)proteins covering major signaling pathways identified 128 differentially expressed proteins between <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant and control WT OCI-AML2 cells (a panel of 264 proteins), with 67 downregulated proteins and 61 upregulated proteins (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 2A</xref>, source data 2</bold>). Notably, over-representation analysis showed that among the differentially expressed proteins, there was a significant enrichment in the “Response to Oxidative Stress” pathway in the mutant cells (-log10(pValue) = 24.164) compared to WT, with a particular emphasis on the downregulated proteins of this pathway (-log10(pValue 15.457, <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>, <bold>Figure 4–source data 3</bold>). While the RNA-seq suggested a transcriptional upregulation of the response to oxidative stress in the mutant cells after <italic>SOD1</italic> deletion, the RPPA data revealed that the mutant cells continued to exhibit decreased expression in proteins associated with the oxidative stress response (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 2B</xref></bold>). Taken together, these findings suggest that <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells have an inherent impairment in their baseline response to oxidative stress.</p>
<p>To further explore the diminished oxidative stress response in the mutant cells, we assessed their total-and small-molecule-antioxidant capacity. Total antioxidant capacity refers to the overall ability of the cells to counteract free radicals and reduce oxidative damage. This includes enzymatic antioxidants such as catalase, SODs, and peroxidases. Small molecule antioxidant capacity measures the capacity of low molecular weight antioxidants, such as glutathione and vitamin E, to neutralize ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hawash et al., 2022</xref>). Our results showed that <italic>PPM1D-</italic>mutant cells have significantly reduced total and small-molecule antioxidant capacity compared to WT cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). We also measured the protein levels of key antioxidant enzymes by western blot. While we saw similar protein levels of SOD1 in both WT and mutant cells, we observed a mild reduction in the thioredoxin and catalase levels (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>). These results provide evidence to support the RNA-seq and RPPA findings that <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells have impaired antioxidant defense mechanisms, leading to an elevation in ROS levels and reliance on SOD1 for protection.</p>

<title><italic>PPM1D</italic> mutations increase genomic instability and impair non-homologous end-joining repair</title>
<p>In addition to a decreased response to oxidative stress, the RNA-seq GSEA analysis also revealed differential responses to DNA repair. Upon <italic>SOD1</italic> deletion, WT cells significantly upregulated the regulation of DNA repair (GO:0006281), double-stranded break repair (GO:0006302), homologous recombination (GO:0035825), and more. However, there was a striking downregulation of DNA repair pathways after deletion of <italic>SOD1</italic> in the mutant cells (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>). PPM1D plays a key role in suppressing the DNA damage response (DDR) by dephosphorylating, thereby inactivating, p53 and other key upstream and downstream effectors of the pathway. Truncating mutations and amplifications in <italic>PPM1D</italic> that lead to increased PPM1D activity may therefore inhibit DNA damage repair and increase genomic instability. Oxidative stress and ROS also pose endogenous challenges to genomic integrity. Therefore, we hypothesized that due to the increase in ROS within the mutant cells, loss of <italic>SOD1</italic> may lead to unsustainable accumulation of DNA damage and overwhelm the mutant cell’s DNA repair capacity.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we first sought to establish the baseline levels of DNA damage in <italic>PPM1D</italic>-altered cells. We performed alkaline comet assays in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and found a significant increase in single- and double-stranded DNA breaks in mutant cells compared to WT (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). we also performed metaphase spreads in mouse primary B-cells to investigate chromosomal aberrations, which are consequences of abnormal double-stranded break repair. WT and <italic>Ppm1d</italic>-mutant mouse primary resting CD43+ B-cells were purified from spleens and stimulated with LPS, IL-4, and CD180 to induce proliferation. The cells were then treated with either low- or high-dose cisplatin for 16-hours. Consistent with our comet assay findings, we observed that <italic>Ppm1d</italic>-mutant cells harbored approximately two-fold more chromosomal breaks per metaphase after exposure to cisplatin (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). When we classified the chromosomal aberrations into subtypes, we observed that the mutant cells had increased numbers of each type of aberration. These results demonstrate that mutations in <italic>PPM1D</italic> increase genomic instability.</p>

<p>To further assess the DNA repair efficiency of <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells, we utilized U2OS DNA repair reporter cell lines which express a green fluorescent protein (GFP) cassette when specific DNA repair pathways are active after stimulation when the I-SceI restriction enzyme is induced to stimulate a double-stranded break (DSB). To test for homologous recombination (HR), tandem defective GFP genes can undergo HR to generate GFP+ cells. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repairs a defective GFP in a distinct cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Weinstock et al., 2006</xref>). Because the U2OS parental line harbors an endogenous heterozygous <italic>PPM1D</italic> truncating mutation (R458X), we corrected the lines to generate the isogenic <italic>PPM1D</italic> WT control (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>With two isogenic clones for each reporter cell line, we transfected the <italic>PPM1D</italic>-WT and - mutant U2OS clones with I-SceI and measured GFP expression by flow cytometry after 48 hours. Our results showed similar levels of repair via HR in both WT and mutant clones (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). This finding is consistent with prior studies showing that PPM1D promotes HR by forming a stable complex with BRCA1-BARD1, thereby enhancing their recruitment to DSB sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burdova et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, we saw significantly decreased NHEJ repair in the <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant clones (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>). Prior studies have shown that PPM1D modulates lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) activity, which is important for facilitating the recruitment of 53BP1 to DNA damage sites through RNF168-dependent ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Peng et al., 2015</xref>). PPM1D mutations may therefore lead to impairment of NHEJ through dysregulation of 53BP1 recruitment. To confirm this, we performed immunofluorescence imaging of Rad51 and 53BP1 foci. The recruitment of Rad51 and 53BP1 to the sites of DNA damage are important for the activation of HR and NHEJ, respectively. We analyzed mouse embryonic fibroblasts at baseline and after irradiation (10 Gy) and observed similar numbers of Rad51 foci in <italic>Ppm1d</italic>-mutant and WT cells (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref></bold>). In contrast, <italic>Ppm1d</italic>-mutant MEFs had fewer 53BP1 foci, indicating decreased NHEJ repair capacity that was consistent with our U2OS reporter line findings (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>). Comet assays were performed in parallel with the immunofluorescence experiments to show that the mutant cells had increased DNA damage (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 1D</xref></bold>). Therefore, the decrease in foci was not due to resolution of DNA damage, but rather due to inefficient DNA repair.</p>
<p>Lastly, to investigate the impact of SOD1 inhibition on DNA damage, we treated cells with a SOD1 inhibitor and performed comet assays. Consistent with our earlier observations, <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells exhibited a higher burden of DNA breaks. Upon treatment with ATN-224, the mutant cells displayed a significant increase in DNA damage compared to their baseline levels, while the WT cells maintained relatively stable levels of DNA damage (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>). As ROS are known to contribute to oxidative DNA damage, we further assessed the levels of 8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-Oxo-dG), a well-established marker of oxidative DNA damage. Strikingly, the mutant cells demonstrated elevated levels of oxidative DNA damage both at baseline and following SOD1 inhibition with ATN-224, whereas the WT cells once again did not exhibit a substantial increase in oxidative DNA damage upon treatment with ATN-224 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref></bold>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that inhibiting SOD1 in <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells exacerbates DNA damage, ultimately contributing to death of the <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The search for synthetic-lethal strategies for cancer therapy has gained significant attention in recent years due to the potential to identify new therapeutic targets that exploit tumor-specific vulnerabilities. In this study, we utilized whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 screening to uncover synthetic-lethal vulnerabilities of <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant leukemia cells. Our screen revealed that the top essential gene in <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells was <italic>SOD1</italic>. We investigated the mechanisms underlying this dependency and characterized the redox landscape of <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells, which revealed significant oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent studies have suggested that PPM1D is indirectly associated with energy metabolism via dephosphorylation of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein. ATM promotes mitochondrial homeostasis, and therefore sustained inactivation of ATM could lead to potential mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bar et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Guleria and Chandna, 2016</xref>). However, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are closely related, and it is difficult to dissect the driving factor. We therefore performed RNA-sequencing and RPPA analysis to better understand the underlying processes contributing to the heightened oxidative stress observed in the mutant cells. Our analyses indicated a diminished response to oxidative stress in the mutant cells. These findings may suggest a self-amplifying cycle whereby dysregulation of ROS scavenging systems increases ROS levels, which in turn leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, which further exacerbates oxidative stress. Hence, the additional impairment of ROS detoxification mechanisms within the cell, such as the loss of SOD1, has detrimental consequences for the viability of mutant cells.</p>
<p>Multiple mechanisms may underlie the suppressed oxidative stress response observed in <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells. One possible explanation is through PPM1D-mediated inhibition of p53. p53 exhibits complex and context-dependent roles in cellular responses to oxidative stress, and its functions can vary depending on the severity of stress encountered by the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sablina et al., 2005</xref>). Under mild or moderate oxidative stress conditions, p53 may protect the cell from ROS by inducing the transcription of genes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dhar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Peuget et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sablina et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tan et al., 1999</xref>). However, under severe or prolonged oxidative stress, the pro-apoptotic functions of p53 may promote ROS production to eliminate cells that have accumulated excessive DNA damage or irreparable cellular alterations. The duality of these anti- and pro-oxidant functions of p53 highlight its intricate role in modulating responses to oxidative stress. How PPM1D affects the switch between these functions of p53 is not understood. Furthermore, the extent to which the dependency on SOD1 observed in <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells is mediated through p53 remains unclear and requires deeper exploration to better understand the context in which SOD1 inhibitors can be used in cancer therapy.</p>
<p>Oxidative stress and DNA damage are intimately linked processes that frequently co-occur. Our study also investigated the interplay between PPM1D, DNA damage, and oxidative stress. We demonstrated significant genomic instability of <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells at baseline and further characterized the effects of mutant PPM1D on specific DNA repair pathways. While previous studies have suggested a role for PPM1D in modulating HR and NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burdova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Peng et al., 2015</xref>), our study is the first to demonstrate impaired NHEJ in <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells. Additionally, our study corroborated previous research demonstrating the synthetic-lethal relationship of <italic>SOD1</italic> and other DNA damage genes such as <italic>RAD54B, BLM,</italic> and <italic>CHEK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sajesh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sajesh and McManus, 2015</xref>)</italic>. In the context of <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutations, we showed that SOD1 inhibition amplifies oxidative stress and DNA damage, ultimately culminating in mutant cell death. These findings align with previous studies demonstrating that the inhibition of SOD1 by LCS-1 leads to the degradation of key DNA repair proteins, PARP1 and BRCA1, resulting in ROS-dependent death of glioma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ling et al., 2022</xref>). Similar observations were made in colorectal cancer models, where LCS-1 treatment enhanced the effectiveness of PARP1 inhibition. These results highlight the potential of combinatorial therapies to achieve therapeutic synergism and underscores the intricate relationship between ROS and DNA damage.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our screen also uncovered sensitivity of <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells to dropout of genes in the Fanconi Anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway including <italic>BRIP1</italic> (<italic>FANCJ</italic>), <italic>FANCI, FANCA, SLX4</italic> (<italic>FANCP), UBE2T</italic> (<italic>FANCT</italic>), and <italic>C19orf40 (FAAP24).</italic> The FA pathway plays a crucial role in facilitating the repair of interstrand crosslinks by coordinating the recruitment of various DNA repair pathways, such nucleotide excision repair, translesion synthesis, and homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ceccaldi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kottemann and Smogorzewska, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the FA genes are also essential for safeguarding genomic integrity during replication stress by protecting replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schlacher et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies have highlighted the essentiality of the FA pathway in p53-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ardeljan et al., 2020</xref>). Another study also showed that several FA pathway genes are shared synthetic-lethal partners in cells with various loss of tumor suppressors including <italic>PBRM1, LKB1, TP53, TP53BP1</italic>, and <italic>CHD1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Feng et al., 2022</xref>). In the context of cancer, cells with defects in DNA repair mechanisms heavily rely on compensatory pathways for survival. A prominent example is the successful treatment of BRCA1/2-deficient breast cancers with PARP1 inhibitors (50, 51). Given the observed suppression of p53 and increased genomic instability, it is reasonable that the FA pathway is also a dependency in <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells. However, the lack of small molecule inhibitors specifically targeting the FA pathway hinders our ability to directly assess its therapeutic potential in targeting <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells in our study.</p>
<p>In summary, our investigation sheds light on the role of mutant PPM1D in modulating cellular responses to oxidative stress and DNA repair in leukemia cells, offering valuable insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms. This research not only enhances our understanding of PPM1D-mediated cellular responses, but also identifies potential therapeutic targets against <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant leukemia cells. However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of our study. We recognize that while <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutations are frequently observed in patients with t-MN, they are rare in <italic>de novo</italic> AML (Hsu et al., 2018). While there is ample evidence that <italic>PPM1D</italic> is an oncogenic driver in many types of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ali et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Khadka et al., 2022</xref>; Li et al., 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nguyen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), the clinical importance of targeting pre-malignant PPM1D-associated clonal expansion in the hematopoietic system is not clear. However, the prevalence of <italic>PPM1D</italic> somatic mutations in other tissues such as the esophagus, suggests the need for further investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yokoyama et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

<title>Reverse-Phase Protein Array</title>
<p>Reverse phase protein array assays for antibodies to proteins or phosphorylated proteins in different functional pathways were carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Coarfa et al., 2021</xref>; Lu H.-Y., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Specifically, protein lysates were prepared from cultured cells with modified Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (TPER) (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) and a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, Pleasanton, CA) (Lu et. al. 2021). The lysates were diluted into 0.5 mg/ml in SDS sample buffer and denatured on the same day. The Quanterix 2470 Arrayer (Quanterix, Billerica, MA) with a 40 pin (185 µm) configuration was used to spot samples and control lysates onto nitrocellulose-coated slides (Grace Bio-labs, Bend, OR) using an array format of 960 lysates/slide (2880 spots/slide). The slides were processed as described and probed with a set of 264 antibodies against total proteins and phosphoproteins using an automated slide stainer Autolink 48 (Dako, Santa Clara, CA). Each slide was incubated with one specific primary antibody and a negative control slide was incubated with antibody diluent without any primary antibody. Primary antibody binding was detected using a biotinylated secondary antibody followed by streptavidin-conjugated IRDye680 fluorophore (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Total protein content of each spotted lysate was assessed by fluorescent staining with Sypro Ruby Protein Blot Stain according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).</p>
<p>Fluorescence-labeled slides were scanned on a GenePix 4400 AL scanner, along with accompanying negative control slides, at an appropriate PMT to obtain optimal signal for this specific set of samples. The images were analyzed with GenePix Pro 7.0 (Molecular Devices, Silicon Valley, CA). Total fluorescence signal intensities of each spot were obtained after subtraction of the local background signal for each slide and were then normalized for variation in total protein, background and non-specific labeling using a group-based normalization method as described (Lu H.-Y., 2021). For each spot on the array, the-background-subtracted foreground signal intensity was subtracted by the corresponding signal intensity of the negative control slide (omission of primary antibody) and then normalized to the corresponding signal intensity of total protein for that spot. Each image, along with its normalized data, was evaluated for quality through manual inspection and control samples. Antibody slides that failed the quality inspection were either repeated at the end of the staining runs or removed before data reporting. A total of 261 antibodies remained in the list.

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Gain-of-function mutations and amplifications of PPM1D are found across several human cancers and are associated with advanced tumor stage, worse prognosis, and increased lymph node metastasis. In this study, Zhang and colleagues investigate the synthetic-lethal dependencies of PPM1D (protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1D) in leukemia cells using CRISPR/Cas9 screening. They identified that SOD1 (superoxide dismutase-1) as the top hit, whose loss reduces cellular growth in PPM1D-mutant cells, but not wild-type (WT) cells. Consistently, the authors demonstrate that PPM1D-mutant cells are more sensitive to SOD1 inhibitor treatment. By performing different in vitro studies, they show that PPM1D-mutant leukemia cells have an elevated level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased basal respiration, increased genomic instability, and impaired non-homologous end-joining repair. The data strongly support that PPMD1 mutant cells have high levels of total peroxides and elevated DNA breaks and that genetic depletion of SOD1 decreases cell growth in two AML cell lines. These data highlight the potential of SOD1 inhibition as a strategy to achieve therapeutic synergism for PPM1D-mutant leukemia; and demonstrate the redox landscape of PPM1D-mutant cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is not explained how superoxide radical (which is not damaging by itself) induces damage, the on-target effects of the SOD1 inhibitors at the concentrations are not clear, the increase in total hydroperoxides is not supported by loss of SOD1, the changes in mitochondrial function are small, and there is no assessment of how the mitochondrial SOD2 expression or function, which dismutates mitochondrial superoxide, is altered. Overall these studies do not distinguish between signal vs. damaging aspects of ROS in their models and do not rule out an alternate hypothesis that loss of SOD1 increases superoxide production by cytosolic NADPH activity which would significantly alter ROS-driven regulation of kinase/phosphatase signal modulation, affecting cell growth and proliferation as well as DNA repair. Additionally, with the exception of growth defects demonstrated with sgSOD1, the majority of data are acquired using two chemical inhibitors, LCS1 and ATN-224, without supporting evidence that these inhibitors are acting in an on-target manner.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors address an important problem by seeking targetable vulnerabilities in PPM1D mutant AML cells. It is clear that SOD1 deletion induces strong growth defects in the AML cell lines tested, that most of the approaches are appropriate for the outcomes being evaluated, and that the data are technically solid and well-presented. The major weakness lies in which redox pathways and ROS species are evaluated, how the resulting data are interpreted, and gaps in the follow-up experiments. Due to these omissions, as currently presented, the broader impact of these findings is unclear.</p>

<p>We thank the editors and reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive assessment of our manuscript. In the upcoming revision process, we plan to address key concerns highlighted by the reviewers. While the bulk of our data involved the use of chemical SOD1 inhibitors, we intend to assess their on-target efficacy by measuring SOD activity after treatment. Additionally, we plan to perform key experiments to measure oxidative stress and DNA damage in SOD1-deletion cell lines to compare against the effects of chemical SOD1 inhibition. We acknowledge the lack of consideration for SOD2 and plan to explore changes in mitochondrial SOD2 expression and function in <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant cells at baseline and after <italic>SOD1</italic>-deletion. We will refine the text to clarify the data interpretation and elaborate on the limitations of our study in the discussion. Altogether, we thank the reviewers for their suggestions to improve our study and we hope that these additional experiments will provide additional evidence that SOD1 is a dependency in <italic>PPM1D</italic>-mutant leukemia cells.</p>
