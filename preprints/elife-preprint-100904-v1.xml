<title>Abstract</title><p>Harnessing the regenerative potential of endogenous stem cells to restore lost neurons is a promising strategy for treating neurodegenerative disorders. Müller glia (MG), the primary glial cell type in the retina, exhibit remarkable regenerative abilities in lower vertebrate species, such as zebrafish and amphibians, where injury induces MG to proliferate and differentiate into various retinal neuron types. The regenerative potential of mammalian MG is constrained by their inherent inability to re-enter the cell cycle, likely due to high levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and low levels of cyclin D1 observed in adult mouse MG. In this study, we found that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated cyclin D1 overexpression and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> knockdown exerts a strong synergistic effect on MG proliferation. MG proliferation induced by this treatment was potent but self-limiting, as MG did not undergo uncontrolled proliferation or lead to retinal neoplasia. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed that cell cycle reactivation leads to immunosuppression and dedifferentiation of MG. Notably, scRNA-seq analysis identified a new cluster of rod-like MG cells expressing both rod and MG genes, which was further validated by RNA in situ hybridization. Cell cycle reactivation also led to de novo genesis of bipolar- and amacrine-like cells from MG. Overall, our findings suggest that AAV- mediated cyclin D1 overexpression and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> knockdown stimulate MG proliferation and promote MG reprogramming. This approach may be a promising strategy, especially when combined with other regeneration-promoting factors, to enhance MG-mediated retinal repair.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Müller glia (MG) is the last cell type generated by the retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) during development and exhibit a gene expression profile similar to that of late retinal progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jadhav et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Roesch et al., 2012</xref>). In teleost fish and amphibians, MG respond rapidly to retinal injury, undergoing robust proliferation and regenerating lost retinal neurons from MG-derived progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hamon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Todd and Reh, 2022</xref>). In contrast, the proliferative and neurogenic ability of MG in response to injury in mammals is severely limited, failing to mediate retinal self-repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Karl et al., 2008</xref>). Recent investigations have achieved great success in mammalian retinal regeneration by direct conversion of MG to retinal neurons through a single or combination of neurogenic transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jorstad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Levi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Todd et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Yumi et al., 2015</xref>). However, this may lead to a depletion of the MG population and cause further retinal degeneration, as MG are indispensable for retinal function and homeostasis. Other studies have shown that the quiescent state of MG can be overridden by upstream signaling pathways such as Wnt and Hippo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hamon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rueda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yao et al., 2016</xref>). Activation of Wnt signaling by forced expression of β-catenin in adult mouse MG promoted spontaneous cell cycle re-entry in uninjured retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yao et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, it was demonstrated that bypassing the Hippo pathway in mouse MG led to spontaneous re-entry into the cell cycle and reprogramming into a progenitor cell-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hamon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rueda et al., 2019</xref>). These findings suggest that the re-entry of MG into the cell cycle, which is the first step of MG-mediated retinal regeneration in zebrafish, could be unlocked in mammalian retinas.</p>
<p>The cell cycle of MG is mainly regulated by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Cyclins bind to CDKs to form cyclin-CDK complexes to promote cell cycle progression. During retinal development, the expression of D-type cyclins (cyclin D1, D2, and D3) is tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Barton and Levine, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dyer and Cepko, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Trimarchi et al., 2008</xref>). Among these, cyclin D1, encoded by the <italic>Ccnd1</italic> gene, is the predominant D-type cyclin in the developing retina and is highly expressed in the RPCs but absent in differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Barton and Levine, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Trimarchi et al., 2008</xref>). Mice lacking <italic>Ccnd1</italic> have small eyes and hypocellular retinas due to reduced RPC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fantl et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sicinski et al., 1995</xref>), which cannot be compensated by <italic>Ccnd2</italic> and <italic>Ccnd3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Das et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">2009</xref>). Negative regulators of the cell cycle are CDK inhibitors (CDKIs), which include the INK4 (p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, p15<sup>INK4b</sup>, p18<sup>INK4c</sup>, and p19<sup>INK4d</sup>) and CIP/KIP families (p21<sup>Cip1</sup>, p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, and p57<sup>Kip2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Reynisdóttir et al., 1995</xref>). The CDKIs inhibit cell cycle progression by binding to and inactivating the cyclin-CDK complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Besson et al., 2008</xref>), and they regulate the proliferation in distinct retinal progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dyer and Cepko, 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Levine et al., 2000</xref>). p27<sup>Kip1</sup> inhibits the cyclin D-CDK complex to enter of the S phase. Following acute retinal damage in mice, a very small number of MG re-enter the cell cycle, co-incident with the downregulation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> or upregulation of cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dyer and Cepko, 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hamon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rueda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yao et al., 2016</xref>). However, this process is transient, as cyclin D1 expression rapidly returns to the basal level (Dyer and Cepko, 2000; Hamon <italic>et al</italic>., 2019a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rueda <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we propose that targeting the two key regulators of the cell cycle, cyclin D1 and p27<sup>kip1</sup>, can effectively induce MG cell cycle re-entry. Our findings demonstrate that simultaneously reducing p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and increasing cyclin D1 in the MG using a single AAV vector has a strong synergistic effect on promoting MG proliferation in uninjured adult mouse retinas. MG proliferation induced by this treatment is robust and self-limiting, as MG undergo a single round of cell division rather than unlimited proliferations. Through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we observed that cell cycle reactivation leads to immunosuppression and dedifferentiation of the MG. Interestingly, scRNA-seq analysis also showed that a new cluster of rod-like MG cells that express both rod and MG genes was induced by the treatment.</p>
<p>RNA in situ analysis further confirmed that MG cells in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) express high levels of rod gene <italic>Rho</italic> and <italic>Gnat1</italic> while maintaining the expression of MG gene <italic>Glul</italic>. Additionally, a few EdU+ MG daughter cells in the inner nuclear layer (INL) express the bipolar cell marker Otx2 or the amacrine cell marker HuC/D, suggesting de novo neurogenesis from MG. These results indicate that cell cycle reactivation also promotes MG reprogramming. Importantly, MG cell cycle reactivation does not disrupt retinal structure or impair retinal function, as the treatment did not deplete the MG from the retina. In summary, our results showed that MG cell cycle reactivation by downregulating p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and upregulating cyclin D1 stimulates MG proliferation and promotes cell fate reprogramming, and it is possible to combine this approach with other factors that promote regeneration in order to enhance retinal repair mediated by MG.</p>

<title>Simultaneous p27<sup>Kip1</sup> downregulation and cyclin D1 overexpression drive robust MG proliferation in the uninjured mouse retina</title>
<p>To test the hypothesis that adult mouse MG are kept in a quiescent state by high levels of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and low levels of cyclin D1, we examined whether spontaneous MG proliferation can be activated by directly changing the levels of these two downstream cell cycle regulators. In this study, we used adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 7m8 vector and a promoter sequence cloned from the human <italic>glial fibrillary acidic protein</italic> (<italic>GFAP</italic>) gene to drive MG- specific gene expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). AAV7m8 vectors were injected intravitreally into the eyes of C57BL/6 mice on postnatal day 6 (P6), when MG finish proliferation and start differentiation, and intraperitoneal injections of 5-ethynyl-2’- deoxyurdine (EdU) were given for five consecutive days to label the MG that had entered the S phase of the cell cycle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In the control retinas infected with AAV7m8-GFAP-GFP- nontarget (NT) short hairpin RNA (shRNA) virus, all MG, which were identified by Sox9 expression aligning in the inner nuclear layer (INL), were negative of EdU labeling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). When the retina was infected by AAV7m8-GFAP-mCherry-p27<sup>Kip1</sup> shRNA, which expresses a highly efficient p27<sup>Kip1</sup> shRNA, a small number of MG cells re-entered the cell cycle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D, G</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 2); however, these proliferated MG accounted for less than 1% of the total MG population. Similarly, overexpressing cyclin D1 alone through AAV7m8-GFAP- cyclin D1 infection stimulated a subset of MG cells to proliferate, resulting in a three-fold increase in the number of EdU+ MG cells compared to p27<sup>Kip1</sup> knockdown (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E, G</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 3). Finally, the AAV7m8-GFAP-cyclin D1-p27<sup>Kip1</sup> shRNA vector, which simultaneously overexpressed cyclin D1 and suppressed p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, had the most significant impact on MG proliferation, with a five-fold increase in EdU+Sox9+ cells compared to cyclin D1 overexpression alone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F, G</xref>, whole retinal cross-section shown in Supplementary Fig. 4). These findings suggest that both low levels of p27Kip1 and high levels of cyclin D1 are required for postmitotic MG to re-enter the cell cycle. Henceforth, we refer to this AAV vector that enables robust MG proliferation through concurrent p27<sup>Kip1</sup> knockdown and cyclin D1 overexpression as the cell cycle activator (CCA).</p>

<p>A transgenic mouse line <italic>Glast-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>; Sun1:GFP</italic>, in which MG nuclei were labeled by nuclear membrane-bound GFP (Supplementary Fig. 5), was used to quantify the percentage of MG that re-entered the cell cycle. In the retinal area where virus infection rate was the highest, approximately 45% of Sun1:GFP+ MG were EdU positive (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>), and the total number of MG increased by about 50% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>), indicating that nearly half of the MG cells re-entered the cell cycle. Previous research has shown that the ability of retina regeneration by various stimuli declines with the age of the mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Löffler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ueki et al., 2015</xref>). We compared the efficiency of CCA in driving MG proliferation in young (P28) and aged (&gt;8 months) mouse retinas to that in P6 pups. Remarkably, MG proliferation induced by CCA remained robust in young adult and aged mice, with more than 200 EdU+Sox9+ cells per section (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). These findings suggest that CCA efficiently drives MG proliferation in both young and aged animals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>MG proliferation driven by CCA is self-limiting</title>
<p>Concerned that p27<sup>Kip1</sup> suppression and cyclin D1 overexpression may lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and retinal tumorigenesis, we analysed the proliferative capacity of MG driven by CCA. Firstly, we examined the duration of MG proliferation after CCA treatment by a time-course EdU incorporation assay. On various days after the CCA injection, EdU was administrated to label the cells that were undergoing proliferation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The result revealed that MG proliferation started as quickly as the third day after CCA injection, reached its peak around the fifth day, followed by a gradual decrease (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). By two weeks post CCA injection, only a few MG were observed to have re-entered the cell cycle. Two months post- CCA injection, MG proliferation had mostly ceased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). These findings suggest that MG proliferation was largely completed within 2 weeks post-CCA treatment, probably due to the dilution of AAV episomal genome copies in the dividing cells. In addition, an EdU/BrdU double-labeling assay was performed to examine whether MG undergoes one or multiple cell divisions after CCA treatment. A single injection of EdU was given at 7 days post CCA treatment, followed by BrdU injection 24 hours later (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Retinas were collected 2 days after BrdU injection to evaluate if any MG continuously entered the S phase of the cell cycle. While there were a number of EdU+ cells and BrdU+ cells, few cells were co-labeled with EdU and BrdU (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B,C</xref>), indicating that MG undergoes only one cell division subsequent to CCA treatment.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we examined the distribution of the proliferated MG in the retina over time. As the labelling efficiencies of MG by Tamoxifen-induced reporter expression and by EdU varied among experiments and individual animals, we used the percentages of EdU+GFP+ MG in each retinal layer to assess the distribution of the proliferated MG. During retina development, proliferating retinal progenitor cells migrate in an apical-basal manner, whereas post-mitotic cells migrate basally to reach their final laminar position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lee and Norden, 2013</xref>). The proliferating MG undergo similar interkinetic migration towards the apical surface of the retina, as majority of the EdU+GFP+ MG nuclei were observed in the ONL and OPL (∼53% and ∼22%, respectively) at one week after CCA treatment, which is around the peak time of MG proliferation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D,E</xref>). To further explore whether the ONL MG daughter cells eventually return to the INL over an extended period, we examined the distribution of EdU+ MG cells at three weeks and four months post-CCA treatment. We found that while the percentage of INL EdU+ MG increased slightly over time, there was still about half of EdU+ MG remained in the ONL and in the OPL (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D,E</xref>). Across the three time points examined, the absence of EdU+GFP+ MG in the IPL and GCL suggests that migration of MG daughter cells to the GCL does not occur, at least without injury (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D,E</xref>). These findings led us to investigate whether the long-term localization of MG daughter cells in the ONL and OPL is associated with any change in their cell fate.</p>

<title>Cell cycle re-activation drives downregulation of IFN pathway and MG dedifferentiation</title>
<p>To unbiasedly assess the cell fate of MG and their daughter cells, we performed single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) analysis on the mouse retinas that received CCA treatment. AAV7m8- GFAP-cyclin D1- p27<sup>Kip1</sup> shRNA and AAV7m8-GFAP-GFP-NT shRNA (9:1 mixed) were co- injected to stimulate MG proliferation in 4-week-old <italic>Glast-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>;tdTomato</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), and 10% AAV7m8-GFAP-GFP-LacZsh was added to serve as an indicator of infection success. The control group was injected with AAV7m8-GFAP-GFP-NT shRNA to account for any non- specific effect caused by virus injection and/or shRNA expression. Three weeks after virus injection, the retinas with successful viral transduction were collected, and tdTomato+ cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), followed by scRNA-seq (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). As previous studies demonstrated that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced retinal damage and histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) improve MG proliferation and reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hoang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jorstad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rueda et al., 2019</xref>) , a group of CCA- treated mice also received NMDA on day 7 and TSA on day 9 post-CCA injection (CCA+NMDA+TSA, referred to as CCANT) to enhance the reprogramming effect, if any, of CCA.</p>

<p>After quality control, 3,758 cells were profiled in the control group, 3,890 cells in the CCA group, and 3,278 cells in the CCANT group (Supplementary Figures 6 and 7). Clustering analysis separated the cells into six different clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), which are quiescent MG, reactivated MG, MG in G2/M phase, MG in S phase, rod-like MG, and rods, as annotated by the known retinal cell type markers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). In the control group, the vast majority of MG (&gt;90%) remained as quiescent MG which express high levels of MG genes such as <italic>Glul</italic> and <italic>Kcnj10</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-H</xref>). Cell cycle state analysis showed that a small percentage of cells are in the G2/M or S phase in the CCA group, suggesting that there was still a small number of proliferating MG at three weeks after CCA treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>, Supplementary Figure 7D,E). In the CCA group, the majority of MG (∼70%) formed a separate cluster, which we refer to as reactivated MG. In this cluster of cells, we observed downregulation of MG genes (such as <italic>Glul</italic> and <italic>Kcnj10</italic>) and upregulation of reactive gliosis gene <italic>Gfap</italic> and cell cycle inhibitor <italic>Btg2</italic> compared with the quiescent MG cluster (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). Interestingly, the top differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between reactivated MG and quiescent MG are the interferon (IFN) pathway genes, including <italic>Stat1</italic>, <italic>Stat2</italic>, <italic>Irgp1</italic>, <italic>Irgm1</italic> and <italic>Igtp</italic>, which were downregulated in the reactivated MG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F-H</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 8), while <italic>Stat3</italic> was not downregulated concurrently with <italic>Stat1</italic> and <italic>Stat2</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 8). Here, downregulation of the IFN pathway in the reactivated MG may be a direct response to cyclin D1 overexpression and/or p27<sup>Kip1</sup> knockdown. A small percentage of MG (∼8%) of reactivated MG was also present in the control virus-injected group, which may be due to retinal injury caused by virus injection and inflammatory response caused by the AAV virus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D, E</xref>). The cell clusters of the CCANT group largely overlapped with the CCA group, with CCANT having fewer proliferating cells and more reactivated MG.</p>

<title>CCA upregulates rod gene expression in a subset of MG</title>
<p>Interestingly, the rods and rod-like MG were two unexpected clusters that appeared in the scRNA-seq analysis. Upon close examination of the retina of <italic>Glast-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>; R26-tdTomato</italic> mice without Tamoxifen induction, we found that very few rods (14 Tdt+ rods in 128 whole retinal sections of eight mouse retina samples screened) were mislabelled by leaky Tdtomato expression in a Cre-independent manner (Supplementary Figure 9). The small rod clusters are likely the true rods mislabelled by Tdt, which is presented in all three groups with a similar proportion. The rod-like MG cluster resides between the reactivated MG cluster and the rod cluster, and it is significantly enriched in the CCA and CCANT groups. The rod-like MG expressed most rod genes, including <italic>Rho</italic>, <italic>Gnat1, Rcvrn, Crx, and Nrl</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G, H</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 10), although the expression levels of the rod-specific genes were lower than those of natural rods. However, not all the rod genes are evenly upregulated, as the upregulation of transcription factor <italic>Otx2</italic> that is crucial for rod cell fate specification and the genes related to neuron projection and photoreceptor cell cilium such as <italic>Syt1</italic> and <italic>Cacnb2</italic> were less significant (Supplementary Figure 10). In addition, the rod-like cells expressed a high level of MG genes, while natural rods did not (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G, H</xref>). When comparing the rod-like MG cluster with the reactivated MG cluster, gene ontology (GO) analysis showed significant gene enrichment in the pathways related to visual system development, neuron differentiation, visual perception, and neuron projection (Supplementary Fig. 10). And GO was significantly enriched in the genes associated with neuron projection and neuron differentiation in the rod cluster as compared to the rod-like cluster (Supplementary Fig. 10), suggesting that rod-like MG were not fully differentiated rods. When comparing the CCA- and CCANT-treated groups, NMDA and TSA increased the percentages of reactivated MG and rod-like MG, but they did not induce the fully differentiated rods or any other new cell clusters. In the following study, we focused solely on the CCA treatment.</p>

<title>Rod-like MG in the ONL expresses both rod and MG genes</title>
<p>To exclude the possibility that the rod-like MG are fused MG with rod cell debris during retina isolation for scRNA-seq analysis, we examined the expression of rod gene expression in the rod-like MG on the retinal sections of the CCA-treated <italic>Glast-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>;Sun1:GFP</italic> mice. As the immunoreactivity for rod proteins such as RHO and GNAT1 is present in rod outer segment (ROS), which are densely packed and distal from rod nuclei, we performed RNA in situ hybridization on retinal sections using the RNAscope assay, which allowed us to analyse target RNA abundance in rod nuclei with the preservation of the spatial information. We examined the mRNA levels of the <italic>Rho</italic> and <italic>Gnat1</italic> genes at three weeks post CCA treatment, which is the same harvest time point as in the scRNA-seq data. The signals of both probes are specific as they are only detected in the ONL layer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). In the control retinas, the mRNA of the two rod genes was abundantly present in the rods in the ONL (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,C</xref>), while there was minimal <italic>Gnat1</italic> and <italic>Rho</italic> mRNA in the MG in the INL (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,E</xref>). In the CCA-treated retina, the MG in the ONL showed clear signals of both <italic>Gnat1</italic> and <italic>Rho</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,D</xref>), while the INL MG maintained very low levels of <italic>Gnat1</italic> and <italic>Rho</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,F</xref>). We counted the number of <italic>Gnat1</italic> fluorescent dots, which served as a reliable indicator of <italic>Gnat1</italic> mRNA levels. The result showed a significant upregulation of <italic>Gnat1</italic> mRNA levels in the MG-derived cells in the ONL and that its level was comparable to the natural rods (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4G</xref>). The MG in the OPL had intermediate levels of <italic>Gnat1</italic> mRNA, while the MG in the INL is similar to the untreated MG controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). The <italic>Rho</italic> mRNA levels were quantified by measuring the pixel intensity due to the fusion of numerous <italic>Rho</italic> fluorescent dots, which showed a similar trend of <italic>Rho</italic> mRNA expression as that of <italic>Gnat1</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). The RNAscope result demonstrated that the MG- derived cells in the ONL express high level of rod genes, those in the OPL express intermediate level of rod genes, while all MG in the INL retained the no/low rod gene expression, suggesting that the expression level of rod genes in the MG daughter cells is associated their position within the retinal layers.</p>

<p>To find out whether the ONL MG could differentiate into mature rods if given an extended period of time, we examined the morphology of the EdU+ MG in the ONL. Despite the extensive search, we did not identify any EdU+ Tdt+ cells in the ONL with a ROS, which is an important functional structure for rod phototransduction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A,B</xref>). Mature mouse rods have a unique nuclear architecture, where heterochromatin localizes in a single large chromocenter surrounded by euchromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Solovei et al., 2009</xref>). After CC treatment, the majority of the ONL MG nuclei do not resemble the rod nuclei (Supplementary Figure 11A- D). In addition, we labeled the MG sparsely with a low dose of Tamoxifen before CCA treatment and found that most of the ONL MG daughter cells retained the apical processes (Supplementary Figure 11E). We examined the mRNA expression of rod and MG genes again at four months after CCA treatment. <italic>Rho</italic>, <italic>Gnat1</italic>, and <italic>Glul</italic> mRNA expression do not display significant change at four months post-CCA treatment (Supplementary Fig. 12). Therefore, we conclude that the ONL MG do not develop to mature rods despite the continuous expression of rod gene and that they retained MG properties.</p>

We also found rare HuC/D+EdU+Tdt+ cells in the lower INL where the HuC/D+ amacrine cells naturally reside (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F-J</xref>). Whether these cells express other BP or AC markers and whether they are functional interneurons that connect with the retinal circuitry needs further investigation.

<title>CCA does not cause retinal neoplasia or functional deficit</title>
<p>To assess the long-term effect of CCA treatment, a cohort of C57BL/6 mice were observed for a year following CCA injection (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Visual function assessments showed no significant differences in visual acuity and electroretinography (ERG) between CCA-treated eyes and uninjected control eyes one year after CCA treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-C</xref>). Upon examining all the harvested retinas from the CCA-treated group, no retinal neoplasia was observed. The retinal structure remained intact, with no malignancy or disruptions in the retinal layers or stratification (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D,G</xref>). These results indicate that CCA treatment did not have a detrimental impact on retinal structure or function in mice, nor did it induce retinal tumours.</p>
<p>We used the MG marker Sox9 to examine the MG population in the retina sections harvested at a year post CCA treatment. In the control retina, Sox9+ MG cells were aligned in the INL (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D-E</xref>). In the CCA-treated retinas, there was a significant expansion in the number of Sox9+ MG cells, distributed across the ONL, OPL, and INL (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F-G</xref>). The large population of Sox9+ MG remained to support the retinal homeostasis, which explains the relatively unaffected retinal structure and function observed on the CCA-treated eyes. We further made comparison of the numbers of Sox9+ cells after one year of CCA treatment and after 2 weeks of CCA treatment. The total numbers of Sox+ cells were similar between these two time points (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref>), indicating no significant MG loss after MG proliferation. To directly assess whether CCA treatment may lead to the cell death of the MG, especially the MG displaced in the ONL and OPL, we examined the CCA-treated retinas with TUNEL assay and did not observe many TUNEL+ cells (Supplement Figure 13). Since we could only examine cell death at single time points, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that there were small numbers of MG-derived cells ding without being detected. The fact that the numbers of MG in the ONL and OPL did not decrease in the retinas harvested at one-year post-CCA treatment suggests that these MG-derived cells persist without dying or losing the MG identity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7I</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>MG proliferation is a key step towards MG-mediated regeneration in the retina. Previously, it was shown that activation of the canonical Wnt pathway by AAV-mediated overexpression of β-catenin stimulates MG proliferation through the Lin28/let7 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yao et al., 2016</xref>), and cyclin D1 is a direct target gene of both Wnt signaling and Lin28/let7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Shtutman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Tetsu and McCormick, 1999</xref>). Suppression of the Hippo pathway by transgenic expression of <italic>YAP5SA</italic> induces MG proliferation, accompanied by an increase in cyclin D1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hamon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rueda et al., 2019</xref>). However, the Hippo and Wnt pathways have downstream genes besides cyclin D1 and serve different cellular functions. It is not clear whether cyclin D1 activation is necessary or sufficient to drive MG proliferation in these contexts. In this study, we demonstrated that cyclin D1 overexpression alone can promote MG proliferation and that the combination of cyclin D1 overexpression and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> KD is the most potent to drive MG proliferation in mouse retina without injury stimulus.</p>
<p>The strategy to stimulate the MG cell cycle for the purpose of retinal regeneration must be carefully weighed against the concern of potential tumorigenesis. p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and cyclin D1 are gatekeepers of cell cycle regulation, and any abnormalities in their expression may impact cell division, potentially leading to the development of tumours. Previous studies have provided evidence that mice lacking p27<sup>Kip1</sup> are approximately 30% larger and generally do not exhibit malignancies, except for pituitary tumours that develop spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fero et al., 1996</xref>). Cyclin D1 is frequently overexpressed in a significant fraction of human cancers, such as breast and respiratory tract tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Callender et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zukerberg et al., 1995</xref>). The concern regarding retinal tumour formation due to CCA treatment may be mitigated, as the in vivo gene transfer was performed using AAV vectors. The advantage of using AAV vector is that AAV episomal genome becomes diluted after cell division, reducing the risk of tumor formation due to continuous cyclin D1 overexpression and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> KD. Consistent with this, the rate of MG proliferation was observed to decrease gradually over time, and the majority of MG cells did not undergo multiple cell divisions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Additionally, the retinal structure was normal without neoplasia (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>,<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). These results suggest that CCA is a potent and viable treatment to stimulate MG proliferation and may be a promising approach to be used in combination with other neurogenic factors to promote MG-mediated retinal regeneration.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found that the IFN pathway genes are enriched in the top downregulated genes in the reactivated MG cluster. The IFN pathway, mediated by STAT1 and STAT2, is an important component of the innate immune system against viral infection and is also known as antitumor cytokine signaling which facilitates immunosurveillance in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Durbin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kaplan et al., 1998</xref>). This pathway has also been implicated in suppressing regeneration in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jorstad et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Todd et al., 2020</xref>). STAT activation was shown to reduce the ASCL1-induced retinal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jorstad et al., 2020</xref>), and decreased IFN signaling could be induced by microglia depletion, which improves MG neurogenic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Todd et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we showed that the IFN pathway genes were downregulated in the MG after CCA treatment. This would be a direct response to the upregulation of cyclin D1 and/or downregulation of p27<sup>kip1</sup> in the MG cell-autonomously, or it could indirectly result from the microglial responses elicited by the treatment. Investigating whether and how the downregulation of IFN signaling plays a role in CCA-induced retinal regeneration would be interesting questions to explore further.</p>
<p>The upregulation of rod genes in the MG residing in the ONL is an unexpected outcome of MG cell cycle activation by CCA, as this was not reported in the other studies focusing on MG proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hamon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rueda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yao et al., 2016</xref>). In those studies, a very small subset of proliferative MG differentiated into BP and/or AC-like, but no photoreceptor genesis was reported. In our study, a significant subset of MG expressed the mRNA of <italic>Rho</italic> and <italic>Gnat1</italic> by scRNA-seq and RNAscope. However, the rod-like MG is unlikely a result of MG-to-rod cell fate reprogramming, as we did not see many cells overexpressing neurogenic genes, such as <italic>Ascl1</italic> and <italic>Dll3</italic>, or rod precursor gene <italic>prdm1</italic> (Supplementary Figure 14A). scRNA-seq analysis at earlier time points after CCA treatment would be helpful to further exclude this possibility. How does CCA activate rod gene expression if it is not through cell fate reprogramming? One hypothesis is that cyclin D1 or p27<sup>kip1</sup> regulates rod gene expression in addition to their well-characterized functions in cell cycle regulation. It was shown that cyclin D1 possesses transcriptional functions by recruiting CREB-binding protein histone acetyltransferase in developing mouse retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bienvenu et al., 2010</xref>). Cyclin D has been shown to activate retinoblastoma protein (Rb) by mono-phosphorylation (Narasimha <italic>et al</italic>., 2014), and Rb in turn promotes rod maturation, which is independent of its function for RPC cell cycle exit (Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004). In the <italic>Rb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> retinal explants, many genes expressed in rods, such as Nrl and Nr2e3, were significantly downregulated (Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004). Additionally, p27<sup>xic1</sup>, the Xenopus homolog of mammalian p27<sup>kip1</sup>, has been shown to promote glial cell fate independent of its CDK binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ohnuma et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, besides cell cycle activation, cyclin D1 overexpression and/or p27<sup>kip1</sup> KD may promote rod gene expression directly or indirectly, which may explain the rod-like MG population observed following CCA treatment.</p>
<p>Although rod-like MG express rod genes, they are, by no means, mature rods. First of all, they lack ROS and nuclear architecture of the mature rods. In addition, their gene expression profile was different from that of natural rod. We compared gene expression profiles of rod- like cells with natural rods and found that rod-like cells still lacked the expression of some genes related to neuron projection and photoreceptor cell cilium such as <italic>Syt1</italic> and <italic>Cacnb2</italic> (Supplementary Figure 10), indicating that rod-like cells were not fully differentiated. In addition, the rod-like MG still expressed MG genes such as <italic>Glul</italic>. By comparing differentially expressed genes associated with cell differentiation, we found that Notch-related genes, including <italic>Notch1</italic> and its downstream gene <italic>Hes1</italic>, remain highly expressed in the reactivated and rod-like MG (Supplementary Figure 14B). Notch signaling pathway is involved in regulating both cell proliferation and cell fate specification during retinal development (Jadhav, Mason and Cepko, 2006; Yaron <italic>et al</italic>., 2006). Genetic removal of <italic>Notch1</italic>, or Notch downstream effectors such as <italic>Hes1</italic> and <italic>RBP</italic>-J leads to precocious cell cycle exit and increased photoreceptors production during early retinogenesis (Tomita et al., 1996; Jadhav, Mason and Cepko, 2006; Riesenberg et al., 2009; Zheng et al., 2009). In addition, Notch1 functions in postmitotic cell fates to repress the rod fate (Mizeracka, Demaso and Cepko, 2013). Therefore, we conjecture that the high activity of Notch signaling may be the reason why rod-like cells fail to become full differentiated rods. A recent preprint has shown that suppressing Notch signaling in the MG and deletion of nuclear factor I factors a, b, and x (Nfia/b/x) synergize to promote neurogenesis of MG into retinal bipolar and amacrine interneurons in adult mice after NMDA-induced retinal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Le et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>One unresolved question is how to further enhance rod regeneration by combining CCA with other factors. It remains to be tested whether inhibiting Notch signaling or overexpressing other neurogenic factors, in combination with CCA treatment, can result in the full differentiation of new rod photoreceptors. Additionally, while the CCA approach exhibited potent mitogenic activity in uninjured mouse retinas, its ability to promote MG proliferation after retinal injury is still unknown. Further investigation is needed to test the effects of CCA in mouse models of retinal degeneration. Finally, it is yet to be investigated how the CCA treatment affects the promoter accessibility of rod genes in the rod-like MG cells. Single-cell ATAC-seq or ChIP- seq analyses could provide insights into the epigenetic changes that underlie the rod-like phenotype acquired by the proliferated MG cells.</p>

<p><italic>In situ</italic> RNA hybridization was performed using the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Detection Reagents V2 kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) following the commercial protocols. In brief, retinas were dissected, 4% PFA fixed, dehydrated in sucrose solution and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium. Retinas were cryosectioned into 20μm and mounted on SuperFrost Plus glass slides (Epredia). After OCT removal by PBS and further dehydration by ethanol, retinal sections were stained with GFP antibody (AB_2307313; Aves Labs) at 4 °C overnight. After three times wash with PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20), retinal sections were hybridized with RNA probes (Advanced Cell Diagnostics Cat.No. 474801-C3 for Mm <italic>Rho</italic>, 524881-C2 for Mm <italic>Gnat1</italic>, 426231-C2 for Mm <italic>Glul</italic>) for 2 hours at 40 °C for two hours.

<title>Preprocessing, filtering and clustering of scRNA data</title>
<p>Sequencing results were preprocessed with 10x Genomics Cell Ranger 6.1.1. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) for demultiplexing, barcode assignment, and unique molecular identifier (UMI) quantification using a standard pipeline for 10X for each of the three samples. We used indexed mouse genome mm10 with added tdTomato and GFP transgenes as a reference. Reads mapping to introns covered more than 34% of all reads. Therefore, they were included in feature counts by using ‘include_introns’ option in cellranger count step of the pipeline. Cell Ranger aggregation was applied for merging runs from three samples.</p>
<p>Quality control, filtering, dimensional reduction, and clustering of the data were carried out using the Seurat package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). The cells with less than 2,000 expressed features, total UMI count higher than 100,000 and percentage of mitochondrial transcripts more than 15% were disregarded. Features of the Y chromosome, as well as <italic>Xist</italic> and <italic>Tsix</italic> genes of the X chromosome, were excluded to avoid confusing effects of gender.</p>
<p>Further filtering of cells was carried out by only including cells expressing tdTomato (Supplementary Figure 6). Potential cell duplicates were estimated using DoubletFinder method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">McGinnis et al., 2019</xref>) implemented in R (with parameter settings PC=10, pK=0.28, pN=0.3). The threshold for the expected doublet formation rate was set to 10% to reflect the assumption that cell duplicates can appear relatively commonly in the MG cells. Detected duplicates were excluded from the data (Supplementary Figure 6G,H).</p>
<p>For the remaining cells, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimension reduction based on eight principal components (PCs) was applied, and cells were clustered using the graphical clustering method in Seurat. Cell types were identified using known marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Clark et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hoang et al., 2020</xref>). After removing doublets, cell types in clusters 4-9 other than MG, Rod-like, and Rod included only a few cells, and 10-30% of the cells were from the control sample, suggesting that these cells are likely to be contaminated (Supplementary Figure 6I,J). After excluding cells in clusters 4-9, the new UMAP and clustering (Supplementary Figure 7A) revealed two subclusters of Rod-like cells (Clusters C3- C4, Supplementary Figure 7A). The cells in the subcluster C4 exhibited similar proportional contributions from all three groups and expressed lower level of rod-specific genes such as <italic>Rho</italic> (Supplementary Figure 7B,C). These cells were again defined as contaminated and excluded from the data. The final UMAP was constructed using seven PCs, and the same PCs were used for clustering of cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<title>The optomotor and electroretinography tests</title>
<p>Mouse visual acuity was measured using an Optometry System (Cerebral Mechanics Inc.) following the published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Douglas et al., 2005</xref>). Testing was done with a grating of 12 degrees/second drifting speed and 100% contrast. The injected right eyes (CCA treated) and uninjected left eyes (Ctrl) were tested independently for counterclockwise and clockwise grating rotations, respectively. A staircase procedure was used, in which the observer tested low to high visual acuity. Each animal was tested for about 10-15 minutes per session.</p>
<p>ERG was measured using an Espion E3 System (Diagonsys LLC Inc.) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hoang et al., 2023</xref>). Animals were dark-adapted overnight before the test. After inducing anesthesia with a ketamine: xylazaine injection intraperitoneally, the pupils of both eyes were dilated using Mydrin®-P Ophthalmic Solution. Once the pupils were fully dilated, the eyes were maintained moist using a topical gel. The measurement electrodes were then applied to the cornea of both eyes, while the ground electrodes were attached to the mouth and tail. All these steps were performed in the darkroom under dim red light. For scotopic ERG recordings, a multiple 530nm light with different intensities (increments from 0.01 cd.s/m<sup>2</sup> to 30 cd.s/m<sup>2</sup>) were elicited to stimulate scotopic responses in a specific time interval. For photopic ERG recordings, 5 mins exposure under 10 cd.s/m<sup>2</sup> light intensity was adopted to inhibit the rod function. The photopic response was measured by multiple flashes of 30 cd.s/m<sup>2</sup> intensity in the illuminated background (10 cd.s/m<sup>2</sup>). The average amplitude and implicit time of a- and b- wave were recorded and exported for further analysis. The b-wave amplitude of the step-wise scotopic responses and that of photopic response at 30 cd.s/m<sup>2</sup> were shown in figure.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Wu et al. introduce a novel approach to reactivate the Muller glia cell cycle in the mouse retina by simultaneously reducing p27Kip1 and increasing cyclin D1 using a single AAV vector. The approach effectively promotes Muller glia proliferation and reprograming without disrupting retinal structure or function. Interestingly, reactivation of the Muller glia cell cycle downregulates IFN pathway, which may contribute to the induced retinal regeneration. The results presented in this manuscript may offer a promising approach for developing Müller glia cell-mediated regenerative therapies for retinal diseases.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data are convincing and supported by appropriate, validated methodology. These results are both technically and scientifically exciting and are likely to appeal to retinal specialists and neuroscientists in general.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are some data gaps that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>(1) Please label the time points of AAV injection, EdU labeling, and harvest in Figure 1B.</p>
<p>(2) What fraction of Müller cells were transduced by AAV under the experimental conditions?</p>
<p>(3) It seems unusually rapid for MG proliferation to begin as early as the third day after CCA injection. Can the authors provide evidence for cyclin D1 overexpression and p27 Kip1 knockdown three days after CCA injection?</p>
<p>(4) The authors reported that MG proliferation largely ceased two weeks after CCA treatment. While this is an interesting finding, the explanation that it might be due to the dilution of AAV episomal genome copies in the dividing cells seems far-fetched.</p>

<p>This manuscript by Wu, Liao et al. reports that simultaneous knockdown of P27Kip1 with overexpression of Cyclin D can stimulate Muller glia to re-enter the cell cycle in the mouse retina. There is intense interest in reprogramming mammalian muller glia into a source for neurogenic progenitors, in the hopes that these cells could be a source for neuronal replacement in neurodegenerative diseases. Previous work in the field has shown ways in which mouse Muller glia can be neurogenically reprogrammed and these studies have shown cell cycle re-entry prior to neurogenesis. In other works, typically, the extent of glial proliferation is limited, and the authors of this study highlight the importance of stimulating large numbers of Muller glia to re-enter the cell cycle with the hopes they will differentiate into neurons. While the evidence for stimulating proliferation in this study is convincing, the evidence for neurogenesis in this study is not convincing or robust, suggesting that stimulating cell cycle-reentry may not be associated with increasing regeneration without another proneural stimulus.</p>
<p>Below are concerns and suggestions.</p>
<p>Intro:</p>
<p>(1) The authors cite past studies showing &quot;direct conversion&quot; of MG into neurons. However, these studies (PMID: 34686336; 36417510) show EdU+ MG-derived neurons suggesting cell cycle re-entry does occur in these strategies of proneural TF overexpression.</p>
<p>(2) Multiple citations are incorrectly listed, using the authors first name only (i.e. Yumi, et al; Levi, et al;). Studies are also incompletely referenced in the references.</p>
<p>Figure 1:</p>
<p>
(3) When are these experiments ending? On Figure 1B it says &quot;analysis&quot; on the end of the paradigm without an actual day associated with this. This is the case for many later figures too. The authors should update the paradigms to accurately reflect experimental end points.</p>
<p>(4) Are there better representative pictures between P27kd and CyclinD OE, the EdU+ counts say there is a 3 fold increase between Figure 1D&amp;E, however the pictures do not reflect this. In fact, most of the Edu+ cells in Figure 1E don't seem to be Sox9+ MG but rather horizontally oriented nuclei in the OPL that are likely microglia.</p>
<p>(5) Is the infection efficacy of these viruses different between different combinations (i.e. CyclinD OE vs. P27kd vs. control vs. CCA combo)? As the counts are shown in Figure 1G only Sox9+/Edu+ cells are shown not divided by virus efficacy. If these are absolute counts blind to where the virus is and how many cells the virus hits, if the virus efficacy varies in efficiency this could drive absolute differences that aren't actually biological.</p>
<p>(6) According to the Jax laboratories, mice aren't considered aged until they are over 18months old. While it is interesting that CCA treatment does not seem to lose efficacy over maturation I would rephrase the findings as the experiment does not test this virus in aged retinas.</p>
<p>(7) Supplemental Figure 2c-d. These viruses do not hit 100% of MG, however 100% of the P27Kip staining is gone in the P27sh1 treatment, even the P27+ cell in the GCL that is likely an astrocyte has no staining in the shRNA 1 picture. Why is this?</p>
<p>Figure 2</p>
<p>
(8) Would you expect cells to go through two rounds of cell cycle in such a short time? The treatment of giving Edu then BrdU 24 hours later would have to catch a cell going through two rounds of division in a very short amount of time. Again the end point should be added graphically to this figure.</p>
<p>Figure 3</p>
<p>
(9) I am confused by the mixing of ratios of viruses to indicate infection success. I know mixtures of viruses containing CCA or control GFP or a control LacZ was injected. Was the idea to probe for GFP or LacZ in the single cell data to see which cells were infected but not treated? This is not shown anywhere?</p>
<p>(10) The majority of glia sorted from TdTomato are probably not infected with virus. Can you subset cells that were infected only for analysis? Otherwise it makes it very hard to make population judgements like Figure 3E-H if a large portion are basically WT glia.</p>
<p>(11) Figure 3C you can see Rho is expressed everywhere which is common in studies like this because the ambient RNA is so high. This makes it very hard to talk about &quot;Rod-like&quot; MG as this is probably an artifact from the technique. Most all scRNA-seq studies from MG-reprogramming have shown clusters of &quot;rods&quot; with MG hybrid gene expression and these had in the past just been considered an artifact.</p>
<p>(12) It is mentioned the &quot;glial&quot; signature is downregulated in response to CCA treatment. Where is this shown convincingly? Figure H has a feature plot of Glul , which is not clear it is changed between treatments. Otherwise MG genes are shown as a function of cluster not treatment.</p>
<p>Figure 4</p>
<p>
(13) The authors should be commended for being very careful in their interpretations. They employ the proper controls (Er-Cre lineage tracing/EdU-pulse chasing/scRNA-seq omics) and were very careful to attempt to see MG-derived rods. This makes the conclusion from the FISH perplexing. The few puncta dots of Rho and GNAT in MG are not convincing to this reviewer, Rho and GNAT dots are dense everywhere throughout the ONL and if you drew any random circle in the ONL it would be full of dots. The rigor of these counts also comes into question because some dots are picked up in MG in the INL even in the control case. This is confusing because baseline healthy MG do not express RNA-transcripts of these Rod genes so what is this picking up? Taken together, the conclusion that there are Rod-like MG are based off scRNA-seq data (which is likely ambient contamination) and these FISH images. I don't think this data warrants the conclusion that MG upregulate Rod genes in response to CCA.</p>
<p>Figure 5</p>
<p>
(14) Similar point to above but this Glul probe seems odd, why is it throughout the ONL but completely dark through the IPL, this should also be in astrocytes can you see it in the GCL? These retinas look cropped at the INL where below is completely black. The whole retinal section should be shown. Antibodies exist to GS that work in mouse along with many other MG genes, IHC or western blots could be done to better serve this point.</p>
<p>Figure 6</p>
<p>
(15) Figure 6D is not a co-labeled OTX2+/ TdTomato+ cell, Otx2 will fill out the whole nucleus as can be seen with examples from other MG-reprogramming papers in the field (Hoang, et al. 2020; Todd, et al. 2020; Palazzo, et al. 2022). You can clearly see in the example in Figure 6D the nucleus extending way beyond Otx2 expression as it is probably overlapping in space. Other examples should be shown, however, considering less than 1% of cells were putatively Otx2+, the safer interpretation is that these cells are not differentiating into neurons. At least 99.5% are not.</p>
<p>(16) Same as above Figure 6I is not convincingly co-labeled HuC/D is an RNA-binding protein and unfortunately is not always the clearest stain but this looks like background haze in the INL overlapping. Other amacrine markers could be tested, but again due to the very low numbers, I think no neurogenesis is occurring.</p>
<p>(17) In the text the authors are accidently referring to Figure 6 as Figure 7.</p>
<p>Figure 7</p>
<p>
(18) I like this figure and the concept that you can have additional MG proliferating without destroying the retina or compromising vision. This is reminiscent of the chick MG reprogramming studies in which MG proliferate in large numbers and often do not differentiate into neurons yet still persist de-laminated for long time points.</p>
<p>General:</p>
<p>
(19) The title should be changed, as I don't believe there is any convincing evidence of regeneration of neurons. Understanding the barriers to MG cell-cycle re-entry are important and I believe the authors did a good job in that respect, however it is an oversell to report regeneration of neurons from this data.</p>
<p>(20) This paper uses multiple mouse lines and it is often confusing when the text and figures switch between models. I think it would be helpful to readers if the mouse strain was added to graphical paradigms in each figure when a different mouse line is employed.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Wu et al. introduce a novel approach to reactivate the Muller glia cell cycle in the mouse retina by simultaneously reducing p27Kip1 and increasing cyclin D1 using a single AAV vector. The approach effectively promotes Muller glia proliferation and reprograming without disrupting retinal structure or function. Interestingly, reactivation of the Muller glia cell cycle downregulates IFN pathway, which may contribute to the induced retinal regeneration. The results presented in this manuscript may offer a promising approach for developing Müller glia cell-mediated regenerative therapies for retinal diseases.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data are convincing and supported by appropriate, validated methodology. These results are both technically and scientifically exciting and are likely to appeal to retinal specialists and neuroscientists in general.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are some data gaps that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>(1) Please label the time points of AAV injection, EdU labeling, and harvest in Figure 1B.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the lack of clarity in our experimental design. We will label all experiment timelines in the figures where appropriate in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) What fraction of Müller cells were transduced by AAV under the experimental conditions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for not clearly conveying the transduction efficiency. The retinal region adjacent to the injection site, typically near the central retina, exhibits a transduction efficiency of nearly 100%. In contrast, the peripheral retina shows a lower transduction efficiency compared to the central region. We will include the quantification of AAV transduction efficiency in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>The quantification of Edu+ MG or other markers was conducted in the area with the highest efficiency.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It seems unusually rapid for MG proliferation to begin as early as the third day after CCA injection. Can the authors provide evidence for cyclin D1 overexpression and p27 Kip1 knockdown three days after CCA injection?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our pilot study, we tested the onset time of GFP expression from AAV-GFAP-GFP following intravitreal injection. We observed GFP expression in MG as early as two days post-infection. These findings will be included in the revised manuscript. Additionally, we plan to perform qPCR or Western blot analysis to confirm cyclin D1 overexpression and p27kip1 knockdown at the onset of Müller glia proliferation, which will also be included in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors reported that MG proliferation largely ceased two weeks after CCA treatment. While this is an interesting finding, the explanation that it might be due to the dilution of AAV episomal genome copies in the dividing cells seems far-fetched.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that the lack of durability in high Cyclin D1 and low p27kip1 levels in MG contributes to the cessation of their proliferation. A potential reason for the loss of high Cyclin D1 overexpression and p27kip1 knockdown during MG proliferation could be the dilution of the AAV episomal genome. However, testing this hypothesis is challenging. Instead, we plan to provide direct evidence in the revised manuscript by examining the levels of Cyclin D1 and p27kip1 in the retina treated with CCA before and after the peak of MG proliferation.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript by Wu, Liao et al. reports that simultaneous knockdown of P27Kip1 with overexpression of Cyclin D can stimulate Muller glia to re-enter the cell cycle in the mouse retina. There is intense interest in reprogramming mammalian muller glia into a source for neurogenic progenitors, in the hopes that these cells could be a source for neuronal replacement in neurodegenerative diseases. Previous work in the field has shown ways in which mouse Muller glia can be neurogenically reprogrammed and these studies have shown cell cycle re-entry prior to neurogenesis. In other works, typically, the extent of glial proliferation is limited, and the authors of this study highlight the importance of stimulating large numbers of Muller glia to re-enter the cell cycle with the hopes they will differentiate into neurons. While the evidence for stimulating proliferation in this study is convincing, the evidence for neurogenesis in this study is not convincing or robust, suggesting that stimulating cell cycle-reentry may not be associated with increasing regeneration without another proneural stimulus.</p>
<p>Below are concerns and suggestions.</p>
<p>Intro:</p>
<p>(1) The authors cite past studies showing &quot;direct conversion&quot; of MG into neurons. However, these studies (PMID: 34686336; 36417510) show EdU+ MG-derived neurons suggesting cell cycle re-entry does occur in these strategies of proneural TF overexpression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We will revise the statement to &quot;MG neurogenesis,&quot; which encompasses both direct conversion and Müller glia proliferation followed by neuronal differentiation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Multiple citations are incorrectly listed, using the authors first name only (i.e. Yumi, et al; Levi, et al;). Studies are also incompletely referenced in the references.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the mistake with the reference. We will fix these mistakes in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 1:</p>
<p>(3) When are these experiments ending? On Figure 1B it says &quot;analysis&quot; on the end of the paradigm without an actual day associated with this. This is the case for many later figures too. The authors should update the paradigms to accurately reflect experimental end points.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the lack of clarity in our experimental design. We will label all experiment timelines in the figures where appropriate in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Are there better representative pictures between P27kd and CyclinD OE, the EdU+ counts say there is a 3 fold increase between Figure 1D&amp;E, however the pictures do not reflect this. In fact, most of the Edu+ cells in Figure 1E don't seem to be Sox9+ MG but rather horizontally oriented nuclei in the OPL that are likely microglia.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks to the reviewer for pointing this out. We will replace the image of Cyclin D1 which a better representative image.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Is the infection efficacy of these viruses different between different combinations (i.e. CyclinD OE vs. P27kd vs. control vs. CCA combo)? As the counts are shown in Figure 1G only Sox9+/Edu+ cells are shown not divided by virus efficacy. If these are absolute counts blind to where the virus is and how many cells the virus hits, if the virus efficacy varies in efficiency this could drive absolute differences that aren't actually biological.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Because the AAV-GFAP-Cyclin D1 and AAV-GFAP-Cyclin D1-p27kip1 shRNA viruses do not carry a fluorescent reporter gene, we cannot easily measure viral efficacy in the same experiment. We believe that variations in viral efficacy cannot account for the significant differences in MG proliferation for two reasons: 1) We injected the same titer for all three viruses, and 2) Viral infection efficacy is very high, approaching 100% in the central retina. Nonetheless, to rule out the possibility that the differences in MG proliferation among the Cyclin D overexpression, p27kip1 knockdown, and CCA groups are due to variations in viral efficacy, we will include the p27kip1 knockdown and Cyclin D1 overexpression efficiencies for all four groups using qPCR and/or Western blot analysis in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) According to the Jax laboratories, mice aren't considered aged until they are over 18months old. While it is interesting that CCA treatment does not seem to lose efficacy over maturation I would rephrase the findings as the experiment does not test this virus in aged retinas.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you to the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. We will void using “aged mice” in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Supplemental Figure 2c-d. These viruses do not hit 100% of MG, however 100% of the P27Kip staining is gone in the P27sh1 treatment, even the P27+ cell in the GCL that is likely an astrocyte has no staining in the shRNA 1 picture. Why is this?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For Supplementary Figure 2c-d, we focused on the central area where knockdown efficiency was high, approaching 100%. We will replace this image with one that includes both high and low Müller glia transduction efficiency regions, clearly demonstrating the complete loss of p27kip1 staining in the area of high transduction efficiency.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 2</p>
<p>(8) Would you expect cells to go through two rounds of cell cycle in such a short time? The treatment of giving Edu then BrdU 24 hours later would have to catch a cell going through two rounds of division in a very short amount of time. Again the end point should be added graphically to this figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. While the typical cell cycle time for human cells is approximately 24 hours, we hypothesized that 24 hours would be the most likely timepoint to capture cells continuously progressing through the cell cycle. However, we acknowledge that we cannot exclude the possibility of some cells entering a second cell cycle at much later timepoints.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we will carefully qualify our conclusion to state that the majority of MG do not immediately undergo another cell division, rather than making a definitive statement. This more cautious phrasing will better reflect the limitations of the 24-hour timepoint and allow for the potential of a small subset of cells proceeding through additional rounds of division at later stages.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 3</p>
<p>(9) I am confused by the mixing of ratios of viruses to indicate infection success. I know mixtures of viruses containing CCA or control GFP or a control LacZ was injected. Was the idea to probe for GFP or LacZ in the single cell data to see which cells were infected but not treated? This is not shown anywhere?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The virus infection was not uniform across the entire retina. To mark the infection hotspots, we added 10% GFP virus to the mixture. Regions of the retina with low infection efficiency were removed by dissection and excluded from the scRNA-seq analysis. We apologize for not clearly explaining this methodological detail in the original text, and will update the Methods section accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) The majority of glia sorted from TdTomato are probably not infected with virus. Can you subset cells that were infected only for analysis? Otherwise it makes it very hard to make population judgements like Figure 3E-H if a large portion are basically WT glia.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This question is related to the last one. Since the regions with high virus infection efficiency were selectively dissected and isolated for analysis, the percentage of CCA-infected MG should constitute the majority in the scRNA-seq data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) Figure 3C you can see Rho is expressed everywhere which is common in studies like this because the ambient RNA is so high. This makes it very hard to talk about &quot;Rod-like&quot; MG as this is probably an artifact from the technique. Most all scRNA-seq studies from MG-reprogramming have shown clusters of &quot;rods&quot; with MG hybrid gene expression and these had in the past just been considered an artifact.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the low levels of Rho in other MG clusters (such as quiescent, reactivated, and proliferating MG) are likely due to RNA contamination. However, the level of Rho in the rod-like MG is significantly higher than in the other clusters, indicating that this is unlikely to be solely due to contamination.</p>
<p>As shown in Supplementary Figure 7A-C, a cluster of MG-rod hybrid cells (cluster C4) was present in all three experimental groups at similar ratios, and this hybrid cluster was excluded from further analysis. In contrast, the rod-like Müller glia (cluster C3) were predominantly found in the CCA and CCANT groups, suggesting a genuine response to CCA treatment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we will conduct Rho and Gnat1 RNA in situ hybridization on the dissociated retinal cells to further support the conclusion that rod-specific genes are upregulated in a subset of MG in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) It is mentioned the &quot;glial&quot; signature is downregulated in response to CCA treatment. Where is this shown convincingly? Figure H has a feature plot of Glul , which is not clear it is changed between treatments. Otherwise MG genes are shown as a function of cluster not treatment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will add box plots of several MG-specific genes to better illustrate the downregulation of the glial signature in the relevant cell cluster in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 4</p>
<p>(13) The authors should be commended for being very careful in their interpretations. They employ the proper controls (Er-Cre lineage tracing/EdU-pulse chasing/scRNA-seq omics) and were very careful to attempt to see MG-derived rods. This makes the conclusion from the FISH perplexing. The few puncta dots of Rho and GNAT in MG are not convincing to this reviewer, Rho and GNAT dots are dense everywhere throughout the ONL and if you drew any random circle in the ONL it would be full of dots. The rigor of these counts also comes into question because some dots are picked up in MG in the INL even in the control case. This is confusing because baseline healthy MG do not express RNA-transcripts of these Rod genes so what is this picking up? Taken together, the conclusion that there are Rod-like MG are based off scRNA-seq data (which is likely ambient contamination) and these FISH images. I don't think this data warrants the conclusion that MG upregulate Rod genes in response to CCA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We performed RNA in situ hybridization on retinal sections because we aimed to correlate cell localization with rod gene expression. We understand the reviewer’s concern that the punctate signals of Rho and GNAT1 in the ONL MG may actually originate from neighboring rods. In the revised manuscript, we will conduct RNAscope on dissociated retinal cells to avoid this issue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 5</p>
<p>(14) Similar point to above but this Glul probe seems odd, why is it throughout the ONL but completely dark through the IPL, this should also be in astrocytes can you see it in the GCL? These retinas look cropped at the INL where below is completely black. The whole retinal section should be shown. Antibodies exist to GS that work in mouse along with many other MG genes, IHC or western blots could be done to better serve this point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, the GCL was cropped out in Figure 5 A-B. We have other images with all retinal layers, which we will use in the revised manuscript. Additionally, we will perform the GS antibody staining to demonstrate partial MG dedifferentiation following CCA treatment.</p>
