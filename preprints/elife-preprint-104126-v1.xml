<title>Abstract</title><p>In the nervous system, reliable communication depends on the ability of neurons to adaptively remodel their synaptic structure and function in response to changes in neuronal activity. While neurons are the main drivers of synaptic plasticity, glial cells are increasingly recognized for their roles as active modulators. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction as a model system for a tripartite synapse, we show that peripheral glial cells collaborate with neurons at the NMJ to regulate activity-induced synaptic remodeling, in part through a protein called shriveled (Shv). Shv is an activator of integrin signaling previously shown to be released by neurons during intense stimulation at the fly NMJ to regulate activity-induced synaptic remodeling. We demonstrate that Shv is also present in peripheral glia, and glial Shv is both necessary and sufficient for synaptic remodeling. However, unlike neuronal Shv, glial Shv does not activate integrin signaling at the NMJ. Instead, it regulates synaptic plasticity in two ways: 1) maintaining the extracellular balance of neuronal Shv proteins to regulate integrin signaling, and 2) controlling ambient extracellular glutamate concentration to regulate postsynaptic glutamate receptor abundance. Loss of glial cells showed the same phenotype as loss of Shv in glia. Together, these results reveal that neurons and glial cells homeostatically regulate extracellular Shv protein levels to control activity-induced synaptic remodeling. Additionally, peripheral glia maintains postsynaptic glutamate receptor abundance and contribute to activity-induced synaptic remodeling by regulating ambient glutamate concentration at the fly NMJ.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The nervous system is highly plastic, with the capacity to undergo dynamic alterations in structure and strength in response to changing stimuli and environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lamprecht and LeDoux, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Citri and Malenka, 2008</xref>). This activity-induced synaptic remodeling process is highly conserved across species and plays crucial roles in circuit formation during development, as well as in stabilizing existing connections post-development. Synaptic remodeling represents a finely orchestrated process, with communications across both the pre- and post-synapses to allow the growth of new synapses, and the stabilization and strengthening of existing ones. While much of the research on synaptic plasticity has concentrated on interactions between presynaptic axon terminals and postsynaptic cells, most synapses are tripartite synapses, with glial cells as the third cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Araque and Navarrete, 2010</xref>). Beyond simply providing metabolic support, glial cells are increasingly recognized for their roles as active modulators of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sancho et al., 2021</xref>). However, how glial cells and neurons collaborate to coordinate activity-induced synaptic remodeling are not well understood.</p>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a genetically tractable system and a tripartite glutamatergic synapse that serves as an excellent model system to investigate mechanisms underlying activity-induced synaptic remodeling by glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Banerjee and Bhat, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Freeman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). The peripheral glial cells at the fly NMJ perform some of the key functions similar to mammalian glia, including controlling neuronal excitability and conduction velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kottmeier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Rey et al., 2023</xref>), recycling of neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Rival et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Danjo et al., 2011</xref>), and engulfing and clearing debris during damage to allow the growth of new boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fuentes-Medel et al., 2009</xref>). They also release proteins such as transforming growth factor (TGF-β) to support synaptic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fuentes-Medel et al., 2012</xref>), TNF-α (eiger) to influence neuronal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Keller et al., 2011</xref>), Wingless to regulate GluR clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kerr et al., 2014</xref>), and laminin to control animal locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Petley-Ragan et al., 2016</xref>). However, the role of peripheral glia in regulating activity-induced stabilization and remodeling of the existing synapses at the NMJ remains unknown.</p>
<p>Previous studies on activity-induced synaptic remodeling at the fly NMJ demonstrated that neuronal activity leads to the enlargement of existing boutons, accompanied by increases in postsynaptic GluR abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chang et al., 2024</xref>). Intense neuronal stimulation triggers the release of a protein called Shriveled (Shv) by presynaptic motoneurons, which activates βPS integrin bi-directionally to stimulate synaptic bouton enlargement and elevate GluR levels on the postsynaptic muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, <italic>shv</italic> mutants display defective post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), a form of functional synaptic plasticity similar to the early phase of long-term potentiation (LTP) seen in mammalian neurons. Here we demonstrate that the Shv protein is also expressed in glial cells and is released extracellularly by peripheral glial cells. Glial Shv not only regulates basal GluR clustering but is also required for activity-induced synaptic remodeling. We further demonstrate that while glial Shv is present extracellularly, it does not respond to neuronal activity nor does it activate integrin signaling, unlike Shv derived from neurons. Instead, glial Shv contributes to synaptic plasticity regulation by modulating the levels of Shv release from neurons and by controlling the levels of ambient glutamate concentration. Restoring ambient glutamate concentration could correct basal GluR abundance and defective synaptic plasticity caused by the loss of glial cells. These results further reveal that regulation of ambient extracellular glutamate concentration by glia is an important mechanism contributing to synaptic plasticity regulation.</p>

<title>Shv is expressed in peripheral glia</title>
<p>To determine the role of Shv in glia, we first monitored its presence in different cell types. To this end, we knocked-in eGFP to the 3’-end of the full-length Shv protein using CRISPR/Cas9-catalyzed homology directed repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gratz et al., 2014</xref>). Western blots confirmed that the Shv protein is tagged with eGFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>), and immunostaining revealed its presence in neurons and glial cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Glial cells were identified using antibody against reverse polarity (Repo), a transcription factor expressed exclusively in glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Xiong et al., 1994</xref>), and neuronal cells were marked either by Elav, a transcription factor expressed in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Robinow and White, 1991</xref>), or HRP, which stains the neuronal cell membrane. We found that Shv-eGFP is present in both Repo and Elav positive cells in the larval brain, consistent with our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, Shv-eGFP can be detected at the NMJ, with weak signals in postsynaptic muscles and synaptic boutons, and stronger signals in peripheral glia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Glial Shv is required for activity-induced synaptic remodeling</title>
<p>Loss of Shv in <italic>shv<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant was previously shown to be essential for activity-induced synaptic remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Given that Shv is observed in neurons, glia, and muscle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>), we determined the tissue-specific requirement for Shv by systematically knocking down <italic>shv</italic> using RNAi and tissue-specific drivers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). We found that <italic>shv</italic> knockdown in neurons using the pan-neuronal driver, <italic>elav-GAL4,</italic> generated the same phenotype as <italic>shv<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lee et al., 2017</xref>), namely smaller bouton size, reduced basal GluR intensity, and defective synaptic remodeling in response to neuronal stimulation. However, knockdown of <italic>shv</italic> in glia using the pan-glial specific driver, <italic>repo-GAL4</italic>, resulted in normal bouton size but significantly elevated GluR levels, as well as abolished activity-induced synaptic remodeling. This increase in GluR is unexpected and further suggests that neuronal and glial Shv acts through different pathways to regulate GluR abundance. Lastly, knockdown of <italic>shv</italic> in post-synaptic muscles using the muscle specific driver <italic>24B-GAL4</italic> did not affect synaptic development or activity-induced synaptic changes. Collectively, these results are consistent with an earlier finding that Shv is predominantly released by neurons to maintain activity-induced synaptic remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lee et al., 2017</xref>), as well as reveal an unexpected requirement for glial Shv in sustaining activity-induced synaptic changes and basal GluR abundance.</p>

</fig>
<p>Given that reducing Shv in glia altered basal GluR levels during development, we used the GeneSwitch system to determine the temporal requirement for Shv in glia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). In the presence of RU486, the <italic>repo-GeneSwitch</italic> driver can undergo a conformational change to activate gene expression in glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Osterwalder et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Roman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Artiushin et al., 2018</xref>). When the 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae were fed with RU486 to transiently drive <italic>shv-RNAi</italic> expression in glia, we observed defective synaptic remodeling and elevated GluR levels. These results suggest an acute requirement for the glial Shv protein in regulating synaptic plasticity and GluR abundance.</p>
<p>Next, we determined the spatial requirement for Shv in glial cells. The peripheral glia can be divided into three subtypes: wrapping glia (WG) is the innermost layer, wrapping and contacting the peripheral nerve bundle; the subperineurial glial (SPG) covers the WG, establishing the blood-brain barrier; the perineurial glia (PGs) is located on the outermost surface of the nerve that is also part of the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Awasaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Stork et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brink et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Freeman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fernandes et al., 2024</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Using GAL4 lines previously shown to drive expression in the specific glial subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Stork et al., 2012</xref>), we found that reducing Shv in either SPG or PG was sufficient to block activity-induced synaptic remodeling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>), phenocopying <italic>shv</italic> knockdown in all glial cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). NMJs with <italic>shv</italic> knockdown in wrapping glia (<italic>nrv-Gal4</italic>) exhibited normal activity-induced synaptic remodeling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). We also tested whether the astrocyte-like glia located in the central nervous system also contributes by knocking down Shv using <italic>alrm-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>). We observed normal activity-induced synaptic remodeling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Together, these results suggest that Shv in PG and SPG glia, both in contact with synaptic boutons, extending into the muscles, and are part of the blood-brain barrier, are crucial for Shv function in glia and for synaptic remodeling.</p>

<title>Glial expression of Shv is sufficient to rescue synaptic plasticity in <italic>shv</italic> mutants</title>
<p>While it has been demonstrated that Shv derived from neurons is sufficient to rescue <italic>shv<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant in activity-induced synaptic remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lee et al., 2017</xref>), it is not known whether glial Shv can compensate for the loss of neuronal Shv.

<p>In addition to structural rescue, we next tested whether glial Shv can rescue functional plasticity.

Selective expression of <italic>shv</italic> in glia was sufficient to restore mEPSP amplitude, in line with the rescue in GluR levels. Glial-specific expression of <italic>shv</italic> also rescued post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), an activity-dependent plasticity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that is functionally similar to the initial stages of long-term potentiation (LTP) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that glial Shv is sufficient to support functional and structural plasticity.</p>

<title>Glial Shv does not activate integrin signaling</title>
<p>Shv was previously shown to be released by neurons to trigger synaptic remodeling through integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lee et al., 2017</xref>); we thus asked whether glial Shv restores synaptic plasticity in <italic>shv<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants by activating integrin signaling similar to its neuronal counterpart. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> shows that glia can indeed release Shv, as glial expression of HA tagged Shv (driven by <italic>repo-GAL4</italic>) can be detected extracellularly when stained using non-permeabilizing conditions. Next, we determined the effects of glial Shv on integrin signaling by monitoring the levels of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (pFAK), as its levels strongly correlate with integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mitra et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tsai et al., 2008</xref>). To our surprise, glial expression of <italic>shv</italic> in <italic>shv<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant did not restore pFAK levels to normal (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>shv</italic> knockdown in glial cells exhibited higher pFAK staining compared to the control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>), a result that is opposite to what was observed with shv knockdown in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>shv</italic> overexpression in glia, although did not change basal pFAK levels, blocked the activity-induced pFAK increases normally seen in control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that glial Shv does not activate integrin and appears to play an inhibitory role in activity-induced integrin activation.</p>

<p>To elucidate whether glial Shv directly inhibits activity-induced integrin activation, we monitored the amount of Shv released by glia during neuronal activity by expressing Shv-HA in either glia or neurons of <italic>shv<sup>1</sup></italic>and measured its extracellular levels. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref> demonstrates that while stimulation significantly increased extracellular Shv released by neurons, the amount of extracellular Shv released by glial cells was reduced. These data indicate that glial Shv does not directly inhibit integrin signaling. Next, we tested the hypothesis that glial Shv instead influences integrin signaling by regulating Shv release from neurons. To this end, we monitored Shv released by neurons or glia using the endogenously tagged Shv-eGFP line and tissue-specific knockdown of <italic>shv</italic>. When Shv was selectively knocked down in glia, an increase in extracellular Shv-eGFP level was observed at the NMJ (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>), which likely originated from neurons. This finding is consistent with a role for glial Shv in suppressing neuronal Shv release and further explains the higher pFAK level observed in case of glial <italic>shv</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). A similar compensatory upregulation from glia was obtained when Shv was knocked down in neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). We also monitored the levels of Shv-eGFP in the larval brain, confirming that the <italic>shv-RNAi</italic> approach successfully reduced Shv levels in the selective cell types (Sup <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Taken together, these results reveal that the amount of Shv released by neurons is homeostatically regulated by Shv produced in glia. Furthermore, unlike neurons, glial Shv release is independent of neuronal activity and does not directly alter integrin signaling.</p>

<title><italic>Drosophila</italic> peripheral glia and Shv control ambient extracellular glutamate levels to regulate activity-induced synaptic remodeling</title>
<p>If Shv derived from glia does not activate integrin signaling, how does it restore synaptic plasticity in <italic>shv<sup>1</sup></italic>? One plausible explanation is that glial Shv is required for normal glial growth or survival. We therefore monitored glial morphology when Shv is knocked down in glia by co-expressing membrane targeted <italic>CD4-tdGFP</italic> using the <italic>repo-GAL4</italic> driver. Sup <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> shows that there is no observable change in gross glial morphology, with glial processes extending and associating with proximal synaptic boutons, indicating glial Shv is not required for glial maintenance. This finding further bolster support for the claim that glial Shv does not activate integrin, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of peripheral glial layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Xie and Auld, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>An alternate possibility is that Shv modulates glial function to rescue activity-induced synaptic remodeling. Glial cells have an established role in providing support and maintaining glutamate homeostasis in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Augustin et al., 2007</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval NMJ is a glutamatergic synapse with high ambient glutamate concentration in the hemolymph, with an average in the range of 1-2 mM glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Surprisingly, the larval NMJ does not contain the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 protein (Eaat1), which is essential for removing extracellular glutamate, suggesting that high extracellular glutamate is better tolerated and removed by diffusion through the hemolymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rival et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). The high ambient glutamate concentration is maintained by the cystine/glutamate antiporter (Cx-T), which imports cystine and exports glutamate into the extracellular milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Augustin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grosjean et al., 2008</xref>). The purpose of the high extracellular glutamate is not well understood, but it is thought to control GluR clustering and maintain a reserved pool of GluR intracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Given that we observed significantly upregulated GluR clustering when Shv was reduced in glia, we hypothesized that glial Shv may influence the levels of ambient extracellular glutamate. To detect glutamate level at the synapse, we took advantage of the GAL4/UAS and LexA/LexAop systems to express the glutamate sensor (iGluSnFR) in neurons while simultaneously knocking down or upregulating Shv in glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Marvin et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). Knockdown of Shv in glia significantly reduced iGluSnFR signal, whereas upregulating Shv increased it, suggesting that glial Shv critically controls ambient extracellular glutamate levels. As a control, we also expressed Shv in neurons using <italic>Elav-LexA</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). We found neuronal expression of Shv did not alter iGluSnFR signal at the synapse, confirming that the change in ambient glutamate level is selectively caused by Shv from glia.</p>

<p>Next, we set out to determine whether the reduced extracellular ambient glutamate is responsible for the defective synaptic remodeling observed when Shv is depleted in glia. To this end, we incubated the NMJ with HL-3 solution containing 2 mM glutamate for 1 hour before stimulating the NMJ with high KCl. Strikingly, this treatment condition not only corrected basal GluR levels, but also fully rescued the activity-induced synaptic remodeling defect seen in glial knockdown of <italic>shv</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). In contrast, incubating the NMJ with 2 mM glutamate did not correct basal GluR or activity-induced synaptic remodeling defect when Shv is knocked down in neurons (sup <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). These data are consistent with the iGluSnFR imaging results and further confirm that glial and neuronal Shv acts through distinct pathways to jointly regulate synaptic remodeling.</p>
<p>To further understand the function of glial cells in synaptic plasticity regulation, we ablated glia by using the inducible <italic>repo-GeneSwitch</italic> driver to express <italic>reaper (rpr)</italic> in early third instar larvae. This method allows us to examine the acute requirement for glia while avoiding lethality associated with chronic glial ablation. Following RU486 treatment for 24 hours, fragmentation of the glial cell membrane and a reduction in GFP intensity was observed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>), indicating degeneration of glial cells. This is consistent with an earlier report demonstrating that Rpr expression is sufficient to induce apoptosis and trigger cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">White et al., 1996</xref>). <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref> shows that glial ablation caused the same phenotype as <italic>shv</italic> knockdown in glial cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), with elevated basal GluR levels and blocked activity-induced synaptic remodeling. We hypothesized that if a primary role of glial cells in synaptic plasticity regulation is to maintain ambient extracellular glutamate levels, similar to glial Shv, then correcting extracellular glutamate concentration should be sufficient to restore synaptic plasticity, even in the absence of functional glia. Strikingly, incubating NMJs with 2 mM glutamate not only restored basal GluR levels but also rescued activity-induced synaptic remodeling caused by glial ablation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>). Together, these data confirm that the ability of peripheral glial cells to maintain high ambient extracellular glutamate concentrations at the NMJ is crucial for synaptic plasticity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we show that the peripheral glial cells at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ play an important role in regulating synaptic plasticity. We demonstrate that neurons and glia jointly orchestrate activity-induced synaptic remodeling at the NMJ, with Shv playing a pivotal role. While neurons release Shv in an activity-dependent manner to regulate synaptic remodeling through integrin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lee et al., 2017</xref>), release of Shv by peripheral glial cells does not rely on neuronal activity and does not activate integrin signaling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A-C</xref>). Instead, glial Shv influences activity-induced synaptic remodeling by keeping the levels of Shv released by neurons in check (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D-F</xref>) and controlling ambient extracellular glutamate levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data suggest that one mechanism underlying activity-induced synaptic remodeling by glia is through indirect control of Shv release from neurons, thereby maintaining minimal integrin signaling under ambient conditions. We propose that this low baseline integrin signaling enables neurons to respond with high sensitivity to enhanced integrin activation by Shv release from neurons following neuronal activity, leading to rapid synaptic remodeling. Conversely, knocking down Shv in glia removes this suppression, resulting in increased Shv release from neurons, higher basal integrin signaling, GluR levels, and pathway saturation, thereby inhibiting activity-induced synaptic remodeling. Supporting this, overexpression of Shv in neurons elevated basal pFAK and abolished synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). These findings also raise several intriguing questions for future research, including how neurons and glia distinguish different sources of Shv, and how they sense and communicate this information to regulate extracellular Shv levels from different cells.</p>
<p>Another main function of glial Shv is to regulate ambient extracellular glutamate concentration. We report that overexpression of <italic>shv</italic> elevated ambient glutamate levels at the synapse measured using a genetically encoded glutamate sensor, whereas knockdown of <italic>shv</italic> in glia reduced its level (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Furthermore, ablating glia recapitulated the phenotypes of <italic>shv</italic> knockdown in glia, and transiently restoring extracellular ambient glutamate concentration efficiently rescued synaptic plasticity. It has been shown that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval NMJ maintains a surprisingly high ambient extracellular glutamate concentration, with an average in the range of 1-2 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Augustin et al., 2007</xref>). How Shv regulates extracellular glutamate concentration remains to be explored, but a likely mechanism is by affecting the levels or functions of the cystine/glutamate (Cx-T), which imports cystine and exports glutamate into the extracellular matrix. While Shv has been shown to activate integrin, it encodes a homolog of the mammalian DNAJB11protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), which functions as a molecular chaperone vital for proper protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Shen et al., 2002</xref>). Shv thus could potentially be required for the proper folding and the function of the Cx-T, which is located on glial cell membrane at the fly NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Augustin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grosjean et al., 2008</xref>). Aligned with this, mutations in Cx-T also resulted in elevated basal GluR levels at the fly NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Augustin et al., 2007</xref>). Future studies examining the functional interactions between Cx-T and Shv will shed light on mechanisms for Shv-dependent regulation of ambient extracellular glutamate levels at the NMJ.</p>
<p>How does extracellular glutamate regulate GluR levels and synaptic plasticity? Changes in glutamate levels has been shown to directly impact neurotransmission, glutamate receptor activity, and influence GluR clustering by internalizing the desensitized GluR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Featherstone and Shippy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). We have also shown that basal GluR level is homeostatically regulated by extracellular glutamate concentration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). It is plausible that a high extracellular glutamate concentration enables the NMJ to maintain a reserved pool of GluRs that can be readily mobilized to the surface upon neuronal activity. Additionally, activation of GluR and downstream signaling pathways could trigger local protein translation machineries to prime the synapses to respond rapidly to changes in neuronal activity. Future studies examining intracellular mechanisms controlling activity-induced GluR increases will lead to better insights on synaptic plasticity regulation.</p>

<p>This study presents a <bold>valuable</bold> finding on a new role of glia in activity-dependent synaptic remodeling using the Drosophila NMJ as a model system. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is <bold>solid</bold>. However, the unaddressed cell-type specific mechanisms of Shv secretion and regulation on the extracellular glutamate levels and lack of details on the methods for statistical analysis have hindered further evaluation of the claims. The work will be of interest to neuroscientists working on glia-neuron interaction and synaptic remodeling.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Chang et al. investigated the cell type-specific role of the integrin activator Shv in activity-dependent synaptic remodeling. Using the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction as a model, they show that glial-secreted Shv modulates synaptic plasticity by maintaining the extracellular balance of neuronal Shv proteins and regulating ambient extracellular glutamate concentrations, which in turn affects postsynaptic glutamate receptor abundance. Furthermore, they report that genetic perturbation of glial morphogenesis phenocopies the defects observed with the loss of glial Shv. Altogether, their findings propose a role for glia in activity-induced synaptic remodeling through Shv secretion. While the conclusions are intriguing, several issues related to experimental design and data interpretation merit further discussion.</p>

<p>In this paper Chang et al follow up on their lab's previous findings about the secreted protein Shv and its role in activity-induced synaptic remodeling at the fly NMJ. Previously they reported that shv mutants have impaired synaptic plasticity. Normally a high stimulation paradigm should increase bouton size and GluR expression at synapses but this does not happen in shv mutants. The phenotypes relating to activity dependent plasticity were completely recapitulated when Shv was knocked down only in neurons and could be completely rescued by incubation in exogenously applied Shv protein. The authors also showed that Shv activation of integrin signaling on both the pre- and post- synapse was the molecular mechanism underlying its function. Here they extend their study to consider the role of Shv derived from glia in modulating synaptic features at baseline and remodeling conditions. This study is important to understand if and how glia contribute to these processes. Using cell-type specific knockdown of Shv only in glia causes abnormally high baseline GluR expression and prevents activity-dependent increases in bouton size or GluR expression post-stimulation. This does not appear to be a developmental defect as the authors show that knocking down Shv in glia after basic development has the same effects as life long knockdown, so Shv is acting in real time. Restoring Shv in ONLY glia in mutant animals is sufficient to completely rescue the plasticity phenotypes and baseline GluR expression, but glial-Shv does not appear to activate integrin signaling which was shown to be the mechanism for neuronally derived Shv to control plasticity. This led the authors to hypothesize that glial Shv works by controlling the levels of neuronal Shv and extracellular glutamate. They provide evidence that in the absence of glial Shv, synaptic levels of Shv go up overall, presumably indicating that neurons secrete more Shv. In this context which could then work via integrin signaling as described to control plasticity. They use a glutamate sensor and observe decreased signal (extracellular glutamate) from the sensor in glial Shv KD animals, however, this background has extremely high GluR levels at the synapse which may account for some or all of the decreases in sensor signal in this background. Additional controls to test if increased GluR density alone affects sensor readouts and/or independently modulating GluR levels in the glial KD background would help strengthen this data. In fact, glial-specific shv KD animals have baseline levels of GluR that are potentially high enough to have hit a ceiling of expression or detection that accounts for the inability for these levels to modulate any higher after strong stimulation and such a ceiling effect should be considered when interpreting the data and conclusions of this paper. Several outstanding questions remain-why can't glial derived Shv activate integrin pathways but exogenously applied recombinant Shv protein can? The effects of neuronal specific rescue of shv in a shv mutant are not provided vis-à-vis GluR levels and bouton size to compare to the glial only rescue. Inclusion of this data might provide more insight to outstanding questions of how and why the source of Shv seems to matter for some aspects of the phenotypes but not others despite the fact that exogenous Shv can rescue and in some experimental paradigms but not others.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Chang and colleagues provides compelling evidence that glia-derived Shriveled (Shv) modulates activity-dependent synaptic plasticity at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ). This mechanism differs from the previously reported function of neuronally released Shv, which activates integrin signaling. They further show that this requirement of Shv is acute and that glial Shv supports synaptic plasticity by modulating neuronal Shv release and the ambient glutamate levels. However, there are a number of conceptual and technical issues that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Major comments</p>
<p>(1) From the images provided for Fig 2B +RU486, the bouton size appears to be bigger in shv RNAi + stimulation, especially judging from the outline of GluR clusters.</p>
<p>
(2) The shv result needs to be replicated with a separate RNAi.</p>
<p>
(3) The phenotype of shv mutant resembles that of neuronal shv RNAi - no increased GluR baseline. Any insights why that is the case?</p>
<p>
(4) In Fig 3B, SPG shv RNAi has elevated GluR baseline, while PG shv RNAi has a lower baseline. In both cases, there is no activity induced GluR increase. What could explain the different phenotypes?</p>
<p>
(5) In Fig 4C, the rescue of PTP is only partial. Does that suggest neuronal shv is also needed to fully rescue the deficit of PTP in shv mutants?</p>
<p>
(6) The observation in Fig 5D is interesting. While there is a reduction in Shv release from glia after stimulation, it is unclear what the mechanism could be. Is there a change in glial shv transcription, translation or the releasing machinery? It will be helpful to look at the full shv pool vs the released ones.</p>
<p>
(7) In Fig 5E, what will happen after stimulation? Will the elevated glial Shv after neuronal shv RNAi be retained in the glia?</p>
<p>
(8) It would be interesting to see if the localization of shv differs based on if it is released by neuron or glia, which might be able to explain the difference in GluR baseline. For example, by using glia-Gal4&gt;UAS-shv-HA and neuronal-QF&gt;QUAS-shv-FLAG. It seems important to determine if they mix together after release? It is unclear if the two shv pools are processed differently.</p>
<p>
(9) Alternatively, do neurons and glia express and release different Shv isoforms, which would bind different receptors?</p>
<p>
(10) It is claimed that Sup Fig 2 shows no observable change in gross glial morphology, further bolstering support that glial Shv does not activate integrin. This seems quite an overinterpretation. There is only one image for each condition without quantification. It is hard to judge if glia, which is labeled by GFP (presumably by UAS-eGFP?), is altered or not.</p>
<p>
(11) The hypothesis that glutamate regulates GluR level as a homeostatic mechanism makes sense. What is the explanation of the increased bouton size in the control after glutamate application in Fig 6?</p>
<p>
(12) What could be a mechanism that prevents elevated glial released Shv to activate integrin signaling after neuronal shv RNAi, as seen in Fig 5E?</p>
<p>
(13) Any speculation on how the released Shv pool is sensed?</p>
