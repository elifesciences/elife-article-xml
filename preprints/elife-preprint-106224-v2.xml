<title>Abstract</title><p>Although the causal association between aging and osteoarthritis (OA) has been documented, our understanding of the underlying mechanism remains incomplete. To define the regulatory molecules governing chondrocyte aging, we performed transcriptomic analysis of young and old human chondrocytes from healthy donors. The data predicted that GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) may play a key role in mediating the difference between young and old chondrocytes. Results from immunostaining and western blot showed significantly higher GATA4 levels in old human or mouse chondrocytes when compared to young cells. Moreover, overexpressing <italic>GATA4</italic> in young chondrocytes remarkably reduced their cartilage-forming capacity <italic>in vitro</italic> and induced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Conversely, suppressing <italic>GATA4</italic> expression in old chondrocytes, through either siRNA or a small-molecule inhibitor NSC140905, increased the production of aggrecan and collagen type II, and also decreased levels of matrix-degrading enzymes. In OA mice induced by surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus, intraarticular injection of lentiviral vectors carrying mouse <italic>Gata4</italic> resulted in a higher OA severity, synovial inflammation, and pain level when compared to control vectors. Mechanistically, we found that overexpressing GATA4 significantly increased the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5. Our work demonstrates that the aging-associated increase of GATA4 in chondrocytes plays a vital role in OA progression, which may also serve as a target to reduce osteoarthritis in the older population.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aging is an inevitable phenomenon resulting in limited functionality, loss of structural integrity, and inability to effectively resist injury and disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Osteoarthritis (OA), the world’s most common form of degenerative disease, has been closely associated with the advancement of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Specifically, OA is estimated to affect 32.5 million Americans, with most cases occurring in adults over the age of 45.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> In fact, 1 in 3 people over the age of 65 are suffering from OA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> There are many contributors linked to the onset and progression of aging, such as organelle dysfunction and telomere shortening,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> but the molecular mechanism underlying age-related OA has not been fully understood. Prior studies have demonstrated the role of DNA damage on chondrocyte aging due to oxidative stresses, resulting in an aged phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> Aged cells can also undergo a state similar to permanent cell cycle arrest known as cellular senescence, which leads to a low-grade state of chronic inflammation and contributes to OA onset and progression in aged individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>OA is now considered a whole joint disease, but cartilage degradation still represents the central feature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> The physiological role of articular cartilage is to support and protect the bones of diarthrodial joints through absorbing mechanical loads and facilitating frictionless movements. The extracellular matrix (ECM) of the cartilage is composed primarily of collagen type II and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and the constant breakdown and rebuilding of ECM components in the cartilage is common in healthy adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Many growth factors contribute to the chondro-supportive environment in the knee joint. Particularly, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays a key role in maintaining chondrocytes and replenishing ECM loss. However, during OA, TGF-β can induce catabolic processes in chondrocytes, resulting in matrix stiffening, osteophytes, and chondrocyte hypertrophy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Furthermore, as we age, the regenerative response of chondrocytes begins to decline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> The whole joint nature of OA and the limited regenerative capacity of chondrocytes have contributed to the difficulty in developing disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs). To date, no DMOADs have reached FDA approval.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Currently, OA-associated changes in chondrocytes have been widely examined, which have significantly enhanced our understanding of this disease and promoted the development of potential treatments. However, OA is a combined consequence of different physiological stressors, including aging, injuries, obesity, etc. Therefore, aged chondrocytes in healthy humans without OA do not necessarily exhibit all the features of OA chondrocytes. In this study, to understand key regulators that contribute to an “aged” state in chondrocytes prior to OA onset, we first compared the transcriptome of young and old human chondrocytes isolated from healthy donors without joint diseases and employed unbiased analysis to define the key regulatory molecules that mediate chondrocyte aging. Assessment of the chondrocyte genome demonstrated the upregulation of several factors in aged chondrocytes, and transcription factor GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) specifically drew our attention since it is associated with DNA damage and cellular senescence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Mechanistically, upregulation of GATA4 was shown to increase nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> NF-κB is thought to amplify and potentially propagate cellular senescence during the aging process through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which could contribute to a low-grade state of chronic inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> Furthermore, the upregulation of GATA4 in OA chondrocytes was also reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> We thus hypothesized that the increased GATA4 level contributes to chondrocyte aging and accelerated OA progression upon injuries. We first tested the hypothesis by increasing or suppressing <italic>GATA4</italic> expression in healthy chondrocytes and examining their cartilage-forming capacity. When <italic>GATA4</italic> was overexpressed, we found that there were alterations to the TGF-β signaling pathway and activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. We also assessed the role of GATA4 <italic>in vivo</italic> by injecting lentiviral vectors carrying control or mouse <italic>Gata4</italic> genes into the knee joints of OA mice induced by surgically created destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM). Lastly, a mechanistic study was conducted to explore how GATA4 impacts chondrocyte phenotypes and functions.</p>

<title>Cell isolation and expansion</title>
<p>Healthy human knee cartilage tissues were harvested from arthritis-free donors through an established protocol with the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI). This study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Committee for Oversight of Research and Clinical Training Involving Decedents. Cartilage was diced into ∼ 1 mm<sup>3</sup> pieces with a scalpel and incubated with a dissociation medium that was composed of high glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States), 2% Antibiotics-Antimycotics (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, United States), and collagenase type II (1 mg/mL(w/v), Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ, United States). 10 mL medium was used for 1g of cartilage, and the treatment lasted for 16 hours in a shaker at 37°C. The mixture was then passed through a 70 µm strainer to collect single chondrocytes. Isolated chondrocytes were seeded in tissue culture flasks at 1×10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and maintained in growth medium (GM, DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies) and 1% Antibiotics-Antimycotics). After cells were fully attached to the culture substrate, the medium was changed every three days until cells reached 70-80% confluency. Cells were detached with Trypsin/EDTA (Gibco/ Thermo Fisher Scientific) and passaged.</p>

<title>Individual Chondrocyte Monolayer Culture</title>
<p>Chondrocytes isolated from healthy human cartilage were expanded to passage 1 (P1) and plated in tissue culture 6 well plates at P2, treated with GM, and cultured until cells reached 80% confluency. Media changes occurred every two days until cell collection. <xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref> lists the chondrocyte ages and genders used for different experiments.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Young and Old Chondrocyte Pools</title>
<p>Chondrocytes at passage 0 (P0) were pooled with three to four other young chondrocyte donors and grown in tissue culture flasks with GM at a cell seeding density of 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells per flask. Media was changed weekly. Once cells reached 80% confluency, cells were collected using Trypsin/EDTA. Some cells were frozen using Recovery Cell Culture Freezing Medium (Gibco/ Thermo Fisher Scientific), and other cells were used for subsequent passaging. The same methods were used for the old (&gt; 45 years) chondrocyte pool. <xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref> lists the chondrocyte ages and genders used in each pool. Due to the extensive amount of work conducted using these pools, two separate chondrocyte pools were made.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and bioinformatics analysis</title>
<p>The transcriptomic differences among three young and three old chondrocyte donors were assessed through RNA-Seq. Individual chondrocyte cultures (P0) were lysed with the QIAzol reagent (Qiagen, German Town, MD, United States), and RNA was isolated from the lysate using an RNA Easy Plus Universal Kit (Qiagen). Extracted RNA were quantitated Qubit™ RNA BR Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by the RNA quality check using Fragment Analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). For each sample, RNA libraries were prepared from 500ng RNA using the KAPA mRNA HyperPrep Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) according to manufacturer’s protocol, followed by quality check using Fragment Analyzer (Agilent Technologies) and fluorescent quantification on the Infinite F Nano + (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). The libraries were normalized and pooled, and then sequenced using NovaSeq6000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA,) to an average of 50M 100PE reads.</p>
<p>Quality control was first applied to raw RNA sequencing reads by tool FastQC. Low-quality reads and adapter sequences were filtered out by the Trimmomatic tool. Surviving reads were then aligned to human reference genome hg38 using STAR aligner, and gene counts were quantified. Differential expression analysis was performed based on gene counts by R package “DESeq2” and DEGs were selected by adjusted p-value &lt; = 0.05 and fold change &gt; = 1.5. These DEGs were then applied to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to detect enriched pathways. This software employs databases of prebuilt pathways with known genes summarized from previous studies, checks the overlap between the DEG list and known pathways and performs statistical tests to determine the enrichment. Significant pathways were defined by p-value &lt; = 0.05. Statistically stringently, FDR = 5% cutoff should be applied to control the false discovery rate. To encourage more gene candidates, this study went by p-value&lt; = 0.05 and fold-change&gt; = 1.5 cutoff. All the tools were run by default parameter settings.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) to examine the GATA4 levels in native cartilage tissues</title>
<p>Human cartilage tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Chemical, Fair Lawn, NJ) at 4°C overnight and then subjected to a graded ethanol dehydration series, starting from 20% ethanol and progressing to 100% ethanol. Subsequently, they were embedded in Paraplast X-tra (Leica Biosystems Inc. Richmond, IL). The Paraplast-embedded samples were sectioned at a thickness of 6 µm using a rotary Leica microtome (Leica Microsystems Inc., Deerfield, IL, Model RM 2255). Young and old mouse knee joints were gifts from Dr. Ana Mario Cuervo’s lab at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, which otherwise were wastes. After the specimens were fixed and decalcified in a formic acid-based bone decalcifier (StatLab, Mckinney, TX, USA) for a period of two weeks, they were then embedded and sectioned as described above.</p>
<p>For immunohistochemistry (IHC), the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections first underwent antigen retrieval based on different antibodies. Slides were then blocked with 10% goat or horse serum (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1h, incubated at 4<sup>◦C</sup> overnight with the primary antibody against GATA4, then incubated with a biotinylated anti-mouse/rabbit immunoglobulin G(IgG) secondary antibody for 1h, with signal detection via DAB substrate kit (Abcam). The Nikon Eclipse E800 upright microscope (Melivile, NY, United States) was used to image the stained sections. Antibody specifications can be found in <xref rid="tblS2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Western blot to examine the GATA4 levels in human chondrocytes</title>
<p>P1 young and old chondrocytes were used for individual chondrocyte analysis of GATA4. Cells were washed in pre-cooled PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) three times. Using the RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with the protease and phosphatase Inhibitor Single-Use Cocktail (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a cell scraper, monolayer culture samples were collected. A pestle was used to homogenize pellets in the RIPA cocktail for pellet culture samples. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the Pierce<sup>™</sup> BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were fractioned electrophoretically on the NuPAGE 4-12%, Bis-Tris Mini Protein Gel (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane using the iBlot Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, United States). The membrane was blocked with 3% non-fat milk (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), diluted with 1× Tris-buffered saline (TBS, Gibco/ Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) (TBST) at room temperature for 1.5 h, washed, and incubated with the primary antibody at 4°C overnight on a rotating shaker. The membrane was washed 7 times for 3 min with TBST buffer and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Malborough, MA, United States) for 1.5 h at room temperature. After being washed 5 times with TBST, the membrane was incubated in the chemiluminescence substrate SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were acquired using the ChemiDocTM Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad). Images were quantified using ImageJ.

<title>Overexpression of <italic>GATA4</italic> in young human chondrocytes</title>
<p>P2 young, pooled chondrocytes or young, individual chondrocytes were transduced with the lentiviral vector containing <italic>GATA4</italic> fused with dTomato gene or the control lentivirus carrying EGFP for 10 hours. After that, flasks were rinsed with PBS for 2 times and the medium was replaced by fresh GM. Both vectors were created and packed by VectorBuilder (&gt;10<sup>8</sup> TU/mL, VectorBuilder, Chicago, IL, United States). To detect the number of cells transduced, cultures were imaged with an EVOS M5000 microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) after 72 h of initial transduction. After transduction, western blot, RT-qPCR, and IHC were used to verify the stable expression of GATA4 in cells.</p>

<title>RNA isolation and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)</title>
<p>For pellet culture, samples were first rinsed with PBS twice and a pestle and electric pulverizer were used to crush pellets. Cells were homogenized in Qiazol (Qiagen).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The causal relationship between aging and OA has been documented, and understanding the molecular mechanisms is essential for the development of treatment methods. In this study, we discovered the critical roles of aging-associated increases in GATA4 levels. Specifically, overexpressing GATA4 in young chondrocytes impaired their capacity to form normal hyaline cartilage, while suppressing GATA4 in old chondrocytes restored their chondrogenic potential. We also demonstrated that GATA4 functions partially by promoting the activation of SMAD1/5. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> work further confirmed that high <italic>Gata4</italic> expression accelerated OA progression in mice. Lastly, we defined a small-molecule GATA4 inhibitor that can partially restore the capacity of old chondrocytes to create healthy cartilage, representing a potential DMOAD for further validation in the future.</p>
<p>Given the recognized challenges in harvesting healthy cartilage tissues from donors without arthritis, there are limited reports investigating chondrocyte aging per se. The current findings include proliferation and post-expansion chondrogenic capacity reduction with aging,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> increased MMP-13 production in response to catabolic stimuli,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and altered response to TGF-β.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> One of our recent studies again demonstrated that aged chondrocytes displayed a reduced proliferation potential compared to young cells. Additionally, cartilage tissues generated by old chondrocytes contained more senescent cells than those from young cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> However, to the best of our knowledge, there were no publications describing the transcriptomic comparisons between young and old chondrocytes, which would be informative in defining targets to stop or reverse chondrocyte aging.</p>
<p>Through transcriptomic analysis, we were able to assess the expression of different genes and genetic pathways that occur as chondrocytes age. Of note, Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α (HIF1α) was the most differentially expressed gene predicted to regulate chondrocyte aging. The connection between HIF1α and aging has been previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> Furthermore, additional studies have investigated HIF1α in association with OA and assessed its use as a therapeutic target.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> Therefore, we decided to focus on GATA4, which was less studied in chondrocytes but highly associated with cellular senescence, an aging hallmark. However, our selection did not dampen the importance of HIF1α and other molecules listed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> in chondrocyte aging. They can be further studied in the future using the same strategy employed in the current work.</p>
<p>The GATA family consists of several proteins (GATA1-6) with different variations of DNA-binding domains composed of zinc finger structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> Particularly, GATA4, 5, and 6 are involved in the development of the mesoderm and endoderm tissues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> in which GATA4 has been detected in the development of structures such as the heart,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> pancreas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> lung, and liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> In addition, GATA4 and GATA6 are the only members that are associated with aging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> Particularly, GATA4 is unique in that it regulates tissues in a context-dependent manner and adopts a multifaceted role in the body, contributing to other age-related diseases such as atherosclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and heart failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, GATA4 might be associated with metabolic regulation. A study conducted by Patankar et al. investigated how GATA4 regulates obesity. Specifically, they used intestine-specific <italic>Gata4</italic> knockout mice to study diet-induced obesity, showing that the knockout mice were resistant to the high-fat diet, and that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) release was increased. These findings indicated a decreased risk for the development for insulin resistance in knockout mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> This work was taken a step further in a subsequent publication, in which the same team investigated the dietary lipid-dependent and independent effects on the development of steatosis and fibrosis in <italic>Gata4</italic> knockout mice. The results from this work suggested that the knockdown of <italic>Gata4</italic> increases GLP-1 release, in turn suppressing the development of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis ultimately blocking hepatic <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> These studies are especially interesting with the rise of GLP-1 based therapy for the treatment of OA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> Thus, the coupling of GATA4-related metabolic dysfunction and OA should be further investigated.</p>
<p>In 2015, GATA4 was first introduced as a senescence regulator in a study conducted by Kang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> This work demonstrated the role of GATA4 in human fibroblasts and determined that the inhibition of autophagy caused GATA4 accumulation following DNA damage. They examined the presence of GATA4 in the human brain and found that there was an increase of GATA4 in the prefrontal cortex of aged human samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Further studies have shown that GATA4 regulates angiogenesis and inflammation in fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis, indicating that GATA4 is required for the inflammation induced by IL-1β. This study also demonstrated that GATA4 binds to promoter regions on Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-A and VEGFC to enhance transcription and regulate angiogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> In chondrocytes specifically, previous studies demonstrated that increased GATA4 levels are associated with chondrocyte senescence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> an important change often observed in OA chondrocytes. Moreover, suppressing GATA4 with siRNA was shown to effectively abolish ionizing radiation-induced senescent phenotype in chondrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> Of note, all these studies relevant to chondrocytes were conducted <italic>in vitro.</italic> Herein, we, for the first time, demonstrate the role of GATA4 in regulating chondrocyte aging.</p>
<p>A theory of chondrocyte aging proposed by van der Kramm suggests that alterations to the TGF-β pathway induce chondrocyte hypertrophy and result in articular cartilage that is prone to OA development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> While investigating the function of GATA4 in chondrocytes, we assessed how its levels contribute to TGF-β alterations in chondrocytes and found that GATA4 levels negatively correlated with the anabolic potential of chondrocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Our study indicated that there was an observed decrease in chondrogenesis and an increase in hypertrophy-related genes following <italic>GATA4</italic> overexpression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). To maintain healthy cartilage homeostasis, numerous pathways are involved. In particular, TGF-β is a crucial cytokine necessary for cartilage homeostasis during OA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> and aged chondrocytes respond differently to TGF-β compared to their young counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mechanistically, in the TGF-β pathway, TGF-β binds to the heterotetrameric receptor complex, which can be grouped into three receptor types (type I, type II, and type III). When TGF-β binds to its corresponding receptor, the activin-receptor-like kinases (ALKs) are activated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> Typically, the anabolic binding of TGF-β to ALK4/5 results in the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3, protecting chondrocytes from hypertrophy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> However, there can also be catabolic effects associated with the expression of SMAD1/5, typically expressed when TGF-β binds to ALK1/2/3/6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> The phosphorylation of SMAD1/5 results in the promotion of ECM degrading proteins such MMP-13.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> As mentioned previously, research has demonstrated that aged chondrocytes respond differently to TGF-β compared to young chondrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> Chondrocyte aging has been linked to the increase of pSMAD1/5 signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> These previous studies and literature review inspired us to explore the potential association between GATA4 levels and the activation of SMAD1/5.</p>
<p>Our results found that GATA4 resulted in the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5 even without TGF-β stimulation, which however did not alter the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3. Although there are no current publications specifying the complex relationship of GATA4 and SMAD1/5 in chondrocytes, a prior study reported that GATA4 was regulated by SMAD1/5. Specifically, SMAD1/5 and GATA4 can bind together to promote IL-6 expression in macrophages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> In this study, it was shown that GATA4 was necessary for bone morphogenic protein-6 (BMP-6) mediated IL-6 induction, in which there are multiple GATA binding domains on the IL-6 promoter. This work further showed that GATA4 interacts with SMAD 2,3 and 4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> Studies have suggested that BMP pathways and GATA4 work synergistically to regulate SMAD signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> This information indicates that the involvement of GATA4 in the TGF-β signaling pathway is complex, and further studies should be conducted to better assess this relationship.</p>
<p>Additionally, a common hallmark of chondrocyte aging is the alternation of ECM, including composition change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and stiffening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> ECM stiffness can directly affect chondrocyte phenotype and proliferation, and contribute to OA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> A recent study by Fu et al. associated matrix stiffening with the promotion of chondrocyte senescence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> Furthermore, matrix stiffening has been associated with modulating the TGF-β signaling pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> Future studies should investigate the potential of matrix stiffening and the effect of GATA4 on pericellular matrix proteins such as decorin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, biglycan, collagen VI and XV, as these proteins assist with the regulation of biochemical interactions and assist with the maintenance of the chondrocyte microenvironment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> Herein, the TGF-β signaling pathway can further alter the extracellular microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, which could promote cellular senescence and subsequently NF-κB pathway activation.</p>
<p>While the TGF-β pathway is closely associated with cartilage matrix remodeling, we also found increases in the levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines after GATA4 overexpression. We investigated the NF-κB pathway since it is also activated in aged tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> During the aging process, NF-κB is thought to amplify and potentially propagate cellular senescence through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> A study by Qiao et al. indicated that GATA4 regulates NF-κB in dental pulp cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Specifically, using siRNAs, they determined that the knockdown of GATA4 decreased p65 production induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> Other studies have investigated the role of GATA4 in the synovium and the progression of the disease state of rheumatoid arthritis and OA. Jia et al. showed that the knockdown of GATA4 attenuated synovial inflammation and joint damage in a collagenase-induced arthritis mouse model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> More recently, a study conducted by Chen et al. investigated the roles of GATA4 in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and determined that GATA4 induced cellular senescence in FLSs in OA progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Our study also discovered that the siRNA knockdown of GATA4 decreased the phosphorylation of p65 in aged chondrocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). However, we also noticed that MMP-13 expression levels decreased in both <italic>GATA4</italic> overexpression and knockdown experiments. It should be noted that MMP-13 is constitutively produced in human chondrocytes but is only activated under pathological conditions. Given that MMP-13 is regulated by different transcriptional factors and cytokines, as well as RNAs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> its associations with GATA4 require further investigation in the future. Collectively, these findings further indicate that GATA4 might regulate aging partially through TGF-β and NF-κB pathways.</p>
<p>Our current study has not fully explored why aging promotes GATA4 expression. The study from Kang et al. indicated that DNA damage contributed to GATA4 accumulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> It is known that DNA damage response (DDR) is regulated by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3–related (ATR) signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> The activation of these signaling pathways inhibits autophagy-related protein p62.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> In addition, Copp et al. reported increased DNA damage in old chondrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> These studies implied that DNA damage may be a reason for GATA4 upregulation. Our preliminary data and prior work from Kan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> support this possibility. Specifically, a DNA damage-inducing agent, doxorubicin, promoted the upregulation of GATA4 in chondrocytes (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). To further link DNA damage to GATA4 accumulation, a study by Chung et al. used Tributyltin (TBT), a well-known endocrine-disrupting chemical, to induce DNA damage in articular chondrocytes. After 24 hours of TBT treatment, there was a significant increase in <italic>GATA4</italic> expression and expression of senescence markers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> The study by Kang et al. demonstrated that the suppression of p62 following DNA damage leads to GATA4 accumulation due to the lack of autophagy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> DNA damage is known to increase with age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> Therefore, we believe that DNA damage due to aging is a key driver of the upregulation of GATA4 in old chondrocytes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have determined that GATA4 is increased in aged chondrocytes compared to young in both humans and mice, which may be induced by increased DNA damage observed in aged cells. We also demonstrated that GATA4 overexpression impaired the quality and quantity of cartilage created by chondrocytes and accelerated OA progression in mice. Conversely, suppressing GATA4 with siRNA or small-molecule inhibitors partially restores the capacity of old chondrocytes to form cartilage. Additionally, our study found that GATA4 can activate SMAD1/5 and change chondrocyte response to TGF-β. Overall, our study indicated that GATA4 could be a contributor to OA onset and progression in aged individuals, which can also serve as a potential target to prevent aging-associated OA.</p>
<p>There are some limitations of this study that can be further addressed in future studies. First, this study has allowed us to examine the potential mechanisms of GATA4 in chondrocyte aging. Although we found that GATA4 was generally increased with aging, some young donors also exhibited increased levels of GATA4, which may be associated with increased DNA damage, as discussed above, or other stressors. Therefore, GATA4 should be used together in conjunction with other aging biomarkers, such as epigenetic clock <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> to precisely define chondrocyte aging. Future work should examine biological versus chronological aging and epigenetic clock-based assessments to explain the variabilities in GATA4 expression among donors. Second, the TGF-β signaling pathway is complex, and there are multiple studies that have associated it with GATA4. However, the relationship between GATA4 overexpression and SAMD1/5 activation should be further investigated to elucidate specific signaling mechanisms. Third, during our <italic>in vivo</italic> work, the intraarticular injection of GATA4 lentivirus was not chondrocyte-specific. Therefore, the injection also allowed for other cell types to overexpress GATA4. Future work should be conducted using transgenic mouse lines for cartilage-specific inducible overexpression or depletion of <italic>Gata4</italic> to further investigate the role of GATA4 in chondrocytes. Furthermore, studies using GATA4 knockdown do not demonstrate a complete reversal of aging in chondrocytes, and additional <italic>in vivo</italic> assessment needs to be conducted to verify whether GATA4 could be a therapeutic target for chondrocyte aging. In particular, our <italic>in vitro</italic> study demonstrated the potential of using small-molecule GATA4 to enhance the quality of cartilage created by old chondrocytes. We can validate the findings <italic>in vivo</italic>, as well as develop other GATA4 inhibitors. Lastly, our work indicates that GATA4 has a role in chondrocyte aging, but that does not negate the other aging factors and pathways. Combining current findings and investigating the prevalence of GATA4 in association with other aging molecules will further contribute to our understanding of the role of GATA4 in aging and possible OA onset.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript assesses the differences between young and aged chondrocytes. Through transcriptomic analysis and further assessments in chondrocytes, GATA4 was found to be increased in aged chondrocyte donors compared to young. Subsequent mechanistic analysis with lentiviral vectors, siRNAs, and a small molecule were used to study the role of GATA4 in young and old chondrocytes. Lastly, an in vivo study was used to assess the effect of GATA4 expression on osteoarthritis progression in a DMM mouse model.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work linked the over expression of GATA4 to NF-kB signaling pathway activation, alterations to the TGF-b signaling pathway, and found that GATA4 increased the progression of OA compared to the DMM control group. Indicating that GATA4 contributes to the onset and progression of OA in aged individuals.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>Great work! All my concerns have been well addressed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study elucidated the impact of GATA4 on aging- and injury-induced cartilage degradation and osteoarthritis (OA) progression, based on the team's finding that GATA expression is positively correlated with aging in human chondrocytes. By integrating cell culture of human chondrocytes, gene manipulation tools (siRNA, lentivirus), biological/biochemical analyses and murine models of post-traumatic OA, the team found that increasing GATA4 levels reduced anabolism and increased catabolism of chondrocytes from young donors, likely through upregulation of the BMP pathway, and that this impact is not correlated with TGF-β stimulation. Conversely, silencing GATA4 by siRNA attenuated catabolism and elevated aggrecan/collagen II biosynthesis of chondrocytes from old donors. The physiological relevance of GATA4 was further validated by the accelerated OA progression observed in lentivirus-infected mice in the DMM model.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a highly significant and innovative study that provides new molecular insights into cartilage homeostasis and pathology in the context of aging and disease. The experiments were performed in a comprehensive and rigorous manner. The data were interpreted thoroughly in the context of the current literature.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The only aspect that would benefit from further clarification is a more detailed discussion of aging-associated ECM changes in the context of prior literature.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an exciting, comprehensive paper that demonstrates the role of GATA4 on OA-like changes in chondrocytes. The authors present elegant reverse translational experiments that justify this mechanism and demonstrate the sufficiency of GATA4 in a mouse model of osteoarthritis (DMM), where GATA4 drove cartilage degeneration and pain in a manner that was significantly worse than DMM alone. This could pave the way for new therapies for OA that account for both structural changes and pain.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) GATA4 was identified from human chondrocytes.</p>
<p>(2) IHC and sequencing confirmed GATA4 presence.</p>
<p>(3) Activation of SMADs is clearly shown in vitro with GATA4 overexpression.</p>
<p>(4) The role of GATA4 was functionally assessed in vivo using the mouse DMM model, where the authors uncovered that GATA4 worsens OA structure and hyperalgesia in male mice.</p>
<p>(5) It is interesting that GATA4 is largely known to be found in cardiac cells and to have a role in cardiac repair, metabolism, and inflammation, among other things listed by the authors in the discussion (in liver, lung, pancreas). What could this new knowledge of GATA4 mean for OA as a potentially systemically mediated disease, where cardiac disease and metabolic syndrome are often co-morbid?</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) It would be useful to explain why GATA4 was chosen over HIF1a, which was the most differentially expressed.</p>
<p>(2) In Figure 5, it would be useful to demonstrate the non-surgical or naive limbs to help contextualize OARSI scores and knee hyperalgesia changes.</p>
<p>(3) While there appear to be GATA4 small molecule inhibitors in various stages of development that could be used to assess the effects in age-related OA, those experiments are out of scope for the current study.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>I do not have further comments. Thank you for addressing the previously mentioned concerns.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript assesses the differences between young and aged chondrocytes. Through transcriptomic analysis and further assessments in chondrocytes, GATA4 was found to be increased in aged chondrocyte donors compared to young donors. Subsequent mechanistic analysis with lentiviral vectors, siRNAs, and a small molecule was used to study the role of GATA4 in young and old chondrocytes. Lastly, an in vivo study was used to assess the effect of GATA4 expression on osteoarthritis progression in a DMM mouse model.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work linked the overexpression of GATA4 to NF-kB signaling pathway activation, alterations to the TGF-b signaling pathway, and found that GATA4 increased the progression of OA compared to the DMM control group. This indicates that GATA4 contributes to the onset and progression of OA in aged individuals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The authors thank the reviewer for reviewing our manuscript and providing insightful comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) A couple of sentences should be added to the introduction, to emphasize the role GATA4 plays, such as the alterations to the TGF-b signaling pathway and the increased activation of the NF-kB pathway.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, we have expanded on these signaling pathways in the Introduction to highlight the known functions of GATA4. Importantly, there was no previous study reporting the roles of GATA4 in regulating TGF-β pathway.</p>
<p>“Many growth factors contribute to the chondro-supportive environment in the knee joint. Particularly, transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) plays a key role in maintaining chondrocytes and replenishing ECM loss. However, during OA, TGF-b can induce catabolic processes in chondrocytes, resulting in matrix stiffening, osteophytes, and chondrocyte hypertrophy.[10-12]” (Lines 80-84)</p>
<p>“Mechanistically, upregulation of GATA4 was shown to increase nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) pathway activation.[14,15]  NF-κB is thought to amplify and potentially propagate cellular senescence during the aging process through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which could contribute to a low-grade state of chronic inflammation.[16]” (Lines 99-102)</p>
<p>“When GATA4 was over expressed, we found that there were alterations to the TGF-b signaling pathway and activation of the NF-kB signaling pathway.” (Lines 106-108)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure 1F, the GATA4 histology image should be bigger.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now increased the size of the image in revised Figure 1F.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Further discussion should be conducted regarding the reasoning as to why GATA4 increases the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. The underlying mechanism of GATA4 activating SMAD1/5 has not been previously investigated. We have now elaborated on this in the discussion and have added more relevant publications.</p>
<p>“Our study indicated that there was an observed decrease in chondrogenesis and an increase in hypertrophy-related genes following GATA4 overexpression (Figure 2G).” (Lines 572-574)</p>
<p>“These previous studies and literature review inspired us to explore the potential association between GATA4 levels and the activation of SMAD1/5.” (Lines 587-588)</p>
<p>“In this study, it was shown that GATA4 was necessary for bone morphogenic protein-6 (BMP-6) mediated IL-6 induction, in which there are multiple GATA binding domains on the IL-6 promoter. This work further showed that GATA4 interacts with SMAD 2,3 and 4.[55] Studies have suggested that BMP pathways and GATA4 work synergistically to regulate SMAD signaling.56 This information indicates that the involvement of GATA4 in the TGF-b signaling pathway is complex and further studies should be conducted to better assess this relationship.” (Lines 594-599)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) More information should be included to clarify why GATA4 is thought to be linked to DNA damage and the pathway that is associated with that.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now included further information in the discussion to clarify the association between DNA damage and GATA4 upregulation.</p>
<p>“The study by Kang et al. demonstrated that the suppression of p62 following DNA damage leads to GATA4 accumulation due to the lack of autophagy.13 DNA damage is known to increase with age.71 Therefore, we believe that DNA damage due to aging is a key driver of the upregulation of GATA4 in old chondrocytes.” (Lines 642-646)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Please add further information regarding the limitations of the animal study conducted in this work and future plans to assess this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included more limitations of the animal study that was conducted in this work and have expanded on the future plans to use inducible GATA4 expression in transgenic mouse lines to study the role of GATA4 overexpression in OA onset and progression.</p>
<p>“Third, during our in vivo work, the intraarticular injection of GATA4 lentivirus was not chondrocyte-specific. Therefore, the injection also allowed for other cell types to overexpress GATA4. Future work should be conducted using transgenic mouse lines for cartilage-specific inducible overexpression or depletion of Gata4 to further investigate the role of GATA4 in chondrocytes.” (666-670)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In Figure 5, GATA4 should be changed to Gata4 in the graphed portions for consistency.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. We have made the necessary adjustments throughout the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) While it is convincing that GATA4 expression is elevated in elderly individuals, and that it has a detrimental impact on cartilage health, the authors might want to add further discussion on the variability among individual human donors, especially given the finding that the elevation of GATA4 was not observed in chondrocytes from donor O1 (Figure 1G).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The authors thank the reviewer for reviewing our manuscript and providing insightful comments.</p>
<p>As suggested, we have included more discussion on the variability among donors.</p>
<p>“Although we found that GATA4 was generally increased with aging, some young donors also exhibited increased levels of GATA4, which may be associated with increased DNA damage, as discussed above, or other stressors. Therefore, GATA4 should be used together in conjunction with other aging biomarkers, such as the epigenetic clock [72] to precisely define chondrocyte aging. Future work should examine biological versus chronological aging and epigenetic clock-based assessments to explain the variabilities in GATA4 expression among donors.” (Lines 658-663)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It might also be worth adding additional discussion on the interplay between senescent chondrocytes and the dysfunctional ECM during aging. As noted by the authors, aging is associated with decreased sGAG content and likely degenerative changes in the collagen II network, so the microniche of chondrocytes, and thus cell-matrix crosstalk through the pericellular matrix, is also altered or impaired.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. We have included more discussion on the interplay of chondrocyte senescence and dysfunctional ECM during aging, with a specific focus on the microniche of chondrocytes.</p>
<p>“Additionally, a common hallmark of chondrocyte aging is the alternation of ECM, including composition change [2] and stiffening.[57] ECM stiffness can directly affect chondrocyte phenotype and proliferation, and contribute to OA.[58] A recent study by Fu et al. associated matrix stiffening with the promotion of chondrocyte senescence.[59] Furthermore, matrix stiffening has been associated with modulating the TGF-b signaling pathway.[60-62] Future studies should investigate the potential of matrix stiffening and the effect of GATA4 on pericellular matrix proteins such as decorin[63,64], biglycan, collagen VI and XV, as these proteins assist with the regulation of biochemical interactions and assist with the maintenance of the chondrocyte microenvironment.[65] Herein, the TGF-b signaling pathway can further alter the extracellular microenvironment[62], which could promote cellular senescence and subsequently NF-kB pathway activation.” (Lines 600-610)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) If applicable, please also add Y3 and O3 to Figure S1 for visual comparison across individual donors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, we added Y3 and O3 to the revised Figure S1 for more visual comparisons across individual donors.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 3C, the molecular weight labels are off.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. We corrected this mistake.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Line 438 - Please clarify in text that the highest efficiency of siRNA chosen was siRNA2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, we added the reason for selecting siRNA2.</p>
<p>“Several GATA4 siRNAs were tested, and the one with the highest efficiency was selected based off RT-qPCR results, which indicated that siRNA2 treatment induced lowest expression of GATA4.  (Supplementary Figure S6).” (Lines 448-450)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Did the authors test the timeline of sustained knockdown of GATA4 by siRNA?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used a 7-day timepoint of chondrogenesis, and RT-qPCR results demonstrated that there was a downregulation of GATA4 expression at this timepoint (Figure 4). In the current in vitro study, we did not examine the efficacy of GATA4 siRNA for longer than 7 days.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3( Public review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) It would be useful to explain why GATA4 was chosen over HIF1a, which was the most differentially expressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The authors thank the reviewer for reviewing our manuscript and providing insightful comments.</p>
<p>When we first saw the results, we did consider studying the role of HIF1a in aging because it was the most differentially expressed. When we reviewed the relevant literature, we found that HIF1a was commonly upregulated in aged individuals which was thought to be linked to hypoxia and increased oxidated stress (PMID: 12470896, PMID: 12573436). Further investigation found studies that investigated HIF1a in chondrocytes and the use of in vivo work to investigate its role in osteoarthritis (PMID: 32214220). Indicating that HIF1a plays a protective role during OA by suppressing the activation of NF-kB pathway.  Moreover, there is work that has been conducted assessing the stabilization of HIF1a by regulating mitophagy and using HIF1a as a potential therapeutic target for OA (PMID: 32587244). Since there have been many studies investigating the correlation of HIF1a expression and OA, we felt that it would be more innovative to look at other molecules, such as GATA4. Moreoever, as we highlighted in the Introducion and Disucussion, through testing in cell types other than chondrocytes, GATA4 was shown to be associated with DNA damage and senescence, which are both aging hallmarks. Given the fact that roles of GATA4 in chodnrocytes had not been previous studies, we thus chose GATA4 in this study.</p>
<p>“Of note, Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1a (HIF1a) was the most differentially expressed gene predicted to regulate chondrocyte aging. The connection between HIF1a and aging has been previously reported.32 Furthermore, additional studies have investigated HIF1a in association with OA and assessed its use as a therapeutic target.[33,34] Therefore, we decided to focus on GATA4, which was less studied in chondrocytes but highly associated with cellular senescence, an aging hallmark. However, our selection did not dampen the importance of HIF1α and other molecules listed in Figure 1D in chondrocyte aging. They can be further studied in the future using the same strategy employed in the current work.” (Lines 526-533)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 5, it would be useful to demonstrate the non-surgical or naive limbs to help contextualize OARSI scores and knee hyperalgesia changes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. Based on prior experience, the OARSI score of mice in the sham group had an OARSI score ranging from 0-0.5. In the current study, we focused on the DMM control and DMM Gata4 virus groups so we did not include a sham control group. We recognized this was a limitation of this study.</p>
<p>“We measured the naive limbs for knee hyperalgesia before DMM surgery, and found the average threshold was 507g. We have highlighted the threshold measurement in the figure legend.507 g was the threshold baseline for non-surgery mice (dashed line).” (Lines 499-500)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) While there appear to be GATA4 small-molecule inhibitors in various stages of development that could be used to assess the effects in age-related OA, those experiments are out of scope for the current study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this comment that the results are still preliminary, which was the reason that we put it in the supplementary materials. However, we felt like the result is informative, which will support the potential of GATA4 as a therapeutic target and inspire the development of more specific inhibitors. Therefore, if the reviewer agrees, we want to keep the results in the current study.</p>
<p>In particular, our in vitro study demonstrated the potential of using small-molecule GATA4 to enhance the quality of cartilage created by old chondrocytes. We can validate the findings in vivo, as well as develop other GATA4 inhibitors. (Lines 673-675)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Is GATA4 upregulated in chondrocytes in publicly available databases?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this question. We have examined the public databases and have found that there is data showing the trend that GATA4 is upregulated in aged or OA chondrocytes in work conducted by Ungethuem et al (PMID: 20858714). In one study by Ramos et al. (PMID: 25054223), we noticed that GATA4 expression levels were the same in both young and old groups, which may be due to the relatively smaller sample size in the young group compared to old group (4 vs 26).</p>

<p>(5) In many cases, the figure captions describe the experiment vs. the outcome. It may be more compelling to state the main finding in the figure title, and you might consider changing it from what is stated at present. For example, Figure 2: instead of the impact of overexpression, you may say GATA4 overexpression impairs cartilage formation (as stated in the results).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion. We have made the following changes to the figure captions as suggested.</p>
<p>Figure 1: GATA4 is upregulated in aged chondrocytes (Line 373)</p>
<p>Figure 2: Overexpressing GATA4 impairs the hyaline cartilage formation capacity of young chondrocytes (Lines 408-409)</p>

<p>(6) It would be useful to provide a little more information about the human tissue donors, if that is available.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have provided more information about the tissue donors in the revised Supplementary Table S1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) While aging-like changes were observed in young chondrocytes with GATA4 overexpression, it would be interesting to directly evaluate if there is a change in biological versus chronological age in these tissues. Companies like Zymo can provide this biological v chronological age epigenetic clock-based assessments if that is of interest, to say the young chondrocytes are looking &quot;older&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this information. We agree that it will be important to assess epigenetic changes in GATA-overexpressing cells. We are contacting the company to learn more about their technology. Meanwhile, we added this to the future work section of the manuscript.</p>
<p>“Although we found that GATA4 was generally increased with aging, some young donors also exhibited increased levels of GATA4, which may be associated with increased DNA damage, as discussed above, or other stressors. Therefore, GATA4 should be used together in conjunction with other aging biomarkers, such as the epigenetic clock [72] to precisely define chondrocyte aging.

<p>(8) It is not clear the age at which the mice received DMM in the methods, but it is shown in Figure 5.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added the age at which the mice received the DMM surgery to the methods section.</p>
<p>“Intraarticular injections were administered to mice between 10-12 weeks of age under general anesthesia to safeguard the well-being of the animals and to minimize procedural discomfort.” (Line 300)</p>
<p>“One week after viral vector injection, DMM surgery was performed to induce the OA model on mice 11-13 weeks of age.” (Line 312-313)</p>

<p>(10) Also interesting, loss of GATA4 seems to prevent diet-induced obesity in mice and promote insulin sensitivity (potentially via GLP-1 secretion). I wonder if there may be a metabolic axis here too? PMID: 21177287. I may have missed parts of the discussion of the role of GATA4 in metabolism, but it might be an interesting addition to the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the current study, we have not investigated the role of GATA4 in obesity. As suggested, we have included a discussion of GATA4 in metabolism.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, GATA4 might be associated with metabolic regulation. A study conducted by Patankar et al. investigated how GATA4 regulates obesity. Specifically, they used intestine-specific Gata4 knockout mice to study diet-induced obesity, showing that the knockout mice were resistant to the high-fat diet, and that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) release was increased. These findings indicated a decreased risk for the development for insulin resistance in knockout mice.[44] This work was taken a step further in a subsequent publication, in which the same team investigated the dietary lipid-dependent and independent effects on the development of steatosis and fibrosis in Gata4 knockout mice. The results from this work suggested that the knockdown of Gata4 increases GLP-1 release, in turn suppressing the development of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, ultimately blocking hepatic de novo lipogenesis.[45] These studies are especially interesting with the rise of GLP-1 based therapy for the treatment of OA.46,47 Thus, the coupling of GATA4-related metabolic dysfunction and OA should be further investigated.” (Lines 542-553)</p>

<p>(11) Another potential citation: GATA4 regulates angiogenesis and persistence of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis PMID: 29717129 - around the inflammatory axis potential in OA? since GATA4 was reported in FLS from OA- PMC11183113.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. We have included this work/citation in the discussion section.\</p>
<p>“Further studies have shown that GATA4 regulates angiogenesis and inflammation in fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis, indicating that GATA4 is required for the inflammation induced by IL-1b. This study also demonstrated that GATA4 binds to promoter regions on Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-A and VEGFC to enhance transcription and regulate angiogenesis.[15]”  (Lines 558-562)</p>
