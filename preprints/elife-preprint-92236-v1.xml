<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Enhanced protein synthesis is a crucial molecular mechanism that allows cancer cells to survive, proliferate, metastasize, and develop resistance to anti-cancer treatments, and often arises as a consequence of increased signaling flux channeled to mRNA-bearing eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F). However, the post-translational regulation of eIF4A1, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase and subunit of the eIF4F complex, is still poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that IBTK, a substrate-binding adaptor of Culllin 3-RING ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL3), interacts with eIF4A1. The non-degradative ubiquitination of eIF4A1 by catalyzed CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex promotes cap-dependent translational initiation, nascent protein synthesis, oncogene expression, and tumor cell growth both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, our results show that mTORC1 and S6K1, two key regulators of protein synthesis, directly phosphorylate IBTK to augment eIF4A1 ubiquitination and sustained oncogenic translation. This link between the CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex and the mTOR signaling pathway, frequently dysregulated in cancer, represents a promising target for anticancer therapies.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Enhanced protein synthesis is a critical process that allows cancer cells to survive, multiply, metastasize, and resist anti-cancer treatments(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). This process typically results from increased signaling through the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), which binds to mRNAs. eIF4F complex is composed of four proteins: eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4B, and eIF4A. Of these, eIF4A is responsible for unwinding the secondary structure in the 5’-UTR region of the mRNA, allowing the ribosomal subunit to bind and begin translation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The eIF4A protein family consists of three paralogs, eIF4A1, eIF4A2, and eIF4A3. Although eIF4A1 and eIF4A2 have similar roles in translation initiation, eIF4A3 is not involved in translation control but an important component of the exon junction complex (EJC) and plays a critical role in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Increased eIF4F activity promotes the translation of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation and survival, and tumor immune evasion, which are hallmarks of cancer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Several eIF4A inhibitors, such as eFT226, silvestrol, hippuristanol, and pateamine A, have demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity in various studies conducted <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). In particular, eFT226 is currently being evaluated in multiple clinical trials(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>).</p>
<p>The mTORC1 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in promoting cell growth and anabolism while inhibiting catabolism. It integrates various signals from nutrients, cellular energy levels, growth factors, and environmental stimuli to regulate this process. Translation is a highly energy-intensive process and tightly regulated by the mTORC1 signaling. Ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6Ks) and 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) are two major downstream targets of mTORC1 signaling. They regulate various aspects of mRNA translation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. For example, S6Ks phosphorylate ribosomal protein S6, which promotes translation initiation and elongation. 4E-BPs, on the other hand, bind to eIF4E and inhibit its activity, preventing the translation of specific mRNAs. In addition, mTORC1 coordinates translation by phosphorylating other components of the translational machinery, such as eEF2K, eIF2B, and LARP1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>The Cullin3-RING E3 (CRL3) ubiquitin ligase complex subfamily is composed of a catalytic core made up of RBX1 and CUL3, and a substrate-binding adaptor that contains an interchangeable BTB domain. The CRL3 complex plays a role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell division, differentiation, and signaling. Through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, the CRL3 complex promotes the degradation of specific proteins by marking them with ubiquitin. However, the CRL3 complex can also facilitate non-degradative ubiquitination, which can modulate protein activity, localization, or interaction(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Initially characterized as an inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), the Inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (IBTK) contains two BTB domains and can assemble an active CRL3 complex(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). The downstream targets and biological processes of the CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex are still not well understood, but a limited number of studies suggest that IBTK plays a pro-survival role in cells. IBTK is preferentially translated in response to eIF2α phosphorylation during endoplasmic reticulum stress. Knockdown of IBTK expression reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis in cultured cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). A genome-wide RNAi screen identified IBTK as a synthetic lethal partner of the Ras oncogene in colorectal cancer cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). In Eμ-myc transgenic mice, Ibtk gene knockout delayed the onset of pre-B/B lymphoma and improved animal survival due to increased apoptosis of pre-cancerous B cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). The expression of IBTK was significantly increased in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) progression, but decreased in remission following chemotherapy. Knockdown of IBTK expression increased spontaneous and chemotherapy agent-induced apoptosis and impaired cell cycle progression in CLL cell lines(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). To date, only two substrates of CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> have been reported. CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> targets PDCD4, an eIF4A1 inhibitor, for proteasomal degradation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Another study showed that CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> activates β-Catenin-dependent transcription of MYC by promoting GSK-3β degradation in cancerous B cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). These findings suggest that CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> may play a crucial role in cancer development and progression, as well as in the regulation of cell survival and apoptosis.</p>
<p>Through a variety of biochemical and cell biology approaches, we have identified eIF4A1 as a non-degradative ubiquitinated substrate of the CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex. Our findings suggest that a mTORC1/S6K1-IBTK-eIF4A1 signaling axis mediates cap-dependent translation, facilitates oncoprotein expression, and promotes tumor cell growth.</p>

<title>Cell lines and lentiviral infection</title>
<p>SiHa, HeLa, 293T, H1299, and CT26 cells were acquired from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO2. We routinely perform DNA fingerprinting and PCR to verify the authenticity of the cell lines and to ensure they are free of mycoplasma infection. We conducted transient transfection using EZ Trans (Shanghai Life-iLab Biotech). For lentiviral transfection, we transfected pLKO shRNA knockdown or pCDH overexpression plasmids and virus packing constructs into 293T cells. The viral supernatant was collected after 48 h. SiHa or HeLa cells were then infected with the viral supernatant in the presence of polybrene (8 µg/ml) and selected in growth media containing puromycin (1.5 μg/ml). The gene-specific shRNA sequences can be found in <bold>Supplementary Table 6.</bold></p>

<title>Doxycycline inducible expression and protein complex purification</title>
<p>To generate stable cell lines with inducible IBTK gene expression, Flp-In T-REx 293 cells were co-transfected with pOG44 and pcDNA5-FLAG-BirA*-IBTK constructs. After two days of transfection, the cells were selected with hygromycin (100 μg/ml) for 2 weeks, and then the positive clones were pooled and amplified. To induce exogenous IBTK expression, doxycycline (10 ng/ml) was added to the stable cell lines. For purification in the AP-MS pipeline, the sample was lysed in 3 ml (for each plate) of NP-40 lysis buffer containing fresh protease inhibitor and kept on ice for 2 h. The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 12000 rpm at 4°C. Cleared lysates were filtered through 0.45 μM spin filters (Millipore) and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated M2 agarose (Sigma). The bound polypeptides were eluted with the FLAG peptide (Sigma). For BioID approach, the cell pellet was thawed in 3 ml of BC100 lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 100 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol) containing fresh protease inhibitor and kept on ice for 2 h. The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 12000 rpm at 4°C. Cleared lysates were filtered through 0.45 μM spin filters (Millipore) and immunoprecipitated with Strep-Tactin beads (IBA lifescience). The bound polypeptides were eluted with 50 nM biotin. Finally, the eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE for Coomassie Blue staining. Gel bands were cut out and subjected to mass-spectrometric sequencing.</p>

<title>Identification of eIF4A family proteins as IBTK interacting proteins</title>
<p>Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and proximity-dependent biotinylation identification (BioID) methods are powerful tools for interrogating protein-protein interactions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Using these techniques, we sought to comprehensively characterize the interaction partners of IBTK in cells. To accomplish this, we developed a tag workflow that enabled simultaneous AP-MS and BioID analysis with a single construct, pcDNA5/FRT vector containing FLAG-BirA*-IBTK. This construct was stably transfected into Flp-In T-REx 293 cells, resulting in inducible expression of IBTK (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 1A</bold>). We observed that levels of doxycycline (DOX)-induced FLAG-BirA*-IBTK protein were comparable to those of endogenous IBTK (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). Through our AP-MS and BioID analysis, we identified multiple potential IBTK interactors (<bold>Supplementary Table.1, 2</bold>). One notable finding was the presence of multiple eIFs in the purified IBTK complex, including the subunits of eIF2, eIF3, and eIF4 complex (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, C</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 1B</bold>). Of particular interest, eIF4A1 is a crucial subunit of the eIF4F complex and a promising therapeutic target for cancer. Previous large-scale interactome mapping datasets had suggested a potential interaction between IBTK and eIF4A1, though it had not been analyzed for its biological functions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Therefore, we performed additional analyses to explore the pathophysiological significance of the eIF4A1-IBTK interaction.</p>

<p>To validate the interaction between IBTK and eIF4A1, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays. Our results demonstrated that ectopically expressed IBTK and eIF4A1 interacted with each other (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>). Moreover, we observed that two eIF4A1 paralogs, eIF4A2 and eIF4A3, also interacted with IBTK (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E, F</xref></bold>). Using FLAG-IBTK as an immunoprecipitation agent, we were able to confirm that endogenous eIF4A1/2/3 and CRL3 subunits (RBX1 and CUL3) associated with IBTK, but not other eIF4 complex subunits (eIF4B, eIF4E, and eIF4G) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref></bold>). Additionally, we detected endogenous interactions between IBTK and eIF4A1/2/3 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H-K</xref></bold>).

<title>IBTK mediate non-degradative ubiquitination of eIF4A1</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that eIF4A1 protein stability can be regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and that deubiquitinase USP9X promotes eIF4A1 stability by facilitating its deubiquitination(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). However, the specific ubiquitin E3 ligases accountable for eIF4A1 proteolysis remain elusive. Given that IBTK is involved in the assembly of a CRL3 ubiquitin ligase complex, we hypothesized that IBTK may target eIF4As for degradation. Nevertheless, overexpressing exogenous IBTK did not influence the levels of endogenous eIF4A1/2/3 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout (KO) (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2A-C</bold>) or shRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of IBTK in multiple cell lines did not alter the levels of eIF4A1/2/3 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, C</xref></bold>). Additionally, the protein half-life of eIF4A1/2/3 was unaltered by IBTK depletion (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2D, E</bold>). Surprisingly, the protein level of PDCD4, a reported proteolytic substrate of the CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex, remained unchanged in IBTK-KO or - KD cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, C</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We observed that IBTK-WT co-expression effectively ubiquitinated eIF4A1 and eIF4A2, but not the ΔBTB mutant (which has a defect in CUL3 binding) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>). Consistently, endogenous eIF4A1/2 ubiquitination was reduced upon IBTK KO (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>), and we further demonstrated that the CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex catalyzed eIF4A1 ubiquitination <italic>in vitro</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref></bold>). Intriguingly, neither overexpression nor IBTK KO had any impact on eIF4A3 ubiquitination (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, E</xref></bold>), despite a strong interaction between these two proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J, K</xref></bold>). Notably, eIF4A1 and eIF4A2 share highly similar protein sequences (&gt;90% identity), but eIF4A1 is generally more abundant than eIF4A2 in most tissues. Furthermore, eIF4A2 KO did not affect cell viability or global protein synthesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), thus our study primarily focused on the functional consequences of IBTK regulation of eIF4A1.</p>
<p>After identifying that IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination is non-degradative, we explored the specificity of polyubiquitin chain linkage on eIF4A1 catalyzed by CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup>. To do this, we conducted ubiquitination assays using a panel of ubiquitin mutants with a single lysine-to-arginine (KR) mutation at seven lysine residues or only one lysine present with the other six lysine residues mutated to arginine (KO). Additionally, we included a ubiquitin mutant in which all lysine residues were replaced with arginine (K-ALL-R). Strikingly, co-expression of any Ub-KR or -KO mutants did not significantly impact IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination, whereas co-expression of the Ub K-ALL-R mutant, which is unable to form polyubiquitin chains, formed only a moderate reduction in IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref></bold>). The C-terminal glycine-glycine (GG) amino acid residues are essential for Ub conjugation to targeted proteins. Indeed, co-expression of the Ub-ΔGG mutant abolished IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref></bold>). We then aimed to identify the specific sites on eIF4A1 where ubiquitin was attached. Using MS to analyze the immunoprecipitated eIF4A1-Ub conjugates, we found that eIF4A1 was ubiquitinated at twelve lysine residues (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2F, Supplementary Table. 3</bold>). By mutating these lysine residues to arginine, we found that IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination was completely terminated (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2G</bold>), suggesting that at least some of these lysine residues may serve as ubiquitin attachment sites targeted by CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup>. Collectively, these data suggest that the CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex mainly catalyzes multi-mono-ubiquitination on eIF4A1, which does not lead to degradation.</p>

<title>IBTK promotes nascent protein synthesis and cap-dependent translation initiation</title>
<p>Given the significance of eIF4A1 in translational regulation, we conducted puromycin incorporation assays to assess the impact of IBTK depletion on global protein synthesis. Our results demonstrated a noticeable decrease in nascent protein synthesis in both IBTK-KO or -KD cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref></bold>). However, this effect was reversed by reintroducing IBTK into IBTK-KO cells (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 3A</bold>). Remarkably, the eIF4A1 inhibitor silvestrol also showed a considerable reduction in nascent protein synthesis, particularly in IBTK-KD or KO cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref></bold>).

We treated cells with sodium arsenite (AS), a conventional SG inducer that produces oxidative stress, and examined SG assembly using eIF4A1 staining as a surrogate. Our data indicated that IBTK-KO cells exhibited significantly higher levels of AS-induced SGs compared to parental cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, D</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 3B</bold>). Conversely, overexpression of IBTK-WT resulted in a marked reduction in AS-induced SG assembly, while the ΔBTB mutant had no such effect (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E, F</xref></bold>).

<p>We aimed to determine whether IBTK plays a regulatory role in the cap-dependent translation initiation. In mammalian cells, two mechanisms of translation initiation exist: 5’ cap-dependent translation initiation and internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated initiation. To evaluate the effect of IBTK on both mechanisms, we performed dual-luciferase assays. The upstream reporter (Renilla luciferase) of the bicistronic mRNA was translated via a cap-dependent mechanism, whereas the downstream reporter (Firefly luciferase) was under the control of internal initiation from the hepatitis C virus (HCV)-IRES or (EMCV)-IRES(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Our dual-luciferase assays showed that IBTK depletion caused a significant decrease of Renilla signals by approximately 60% in both systems (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref></bold>), indicating that IBTK has a direct effect on cap-dependent translation initiation. Moreover, we observed that IBTK deficiency reduced the interaction between eIF4A1 and eIF4 subunits (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref></bold>) and the interaction between capped mRNAs and the eIF4 complex in IBTK-KO cells (assessed by m<sup>7</sup>GTP-Sepharose pull-down assays, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref></bold>).

As IBTK-KO cells showed compromised eIF4F-initiated translation activity and downregulated STAT1 protein levels, we investigated the potential impact of IBTK on tumor immune escape and IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression. Our results demonstrated that the expression of STAT1, IRF1, and PD-L1 induced by IFN-γ was markedly reduced in both IBTK-KO H1299 cells (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 6A-C</bold>) and IBTK-KD CT26 cells (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 6D-F</bold>). To further investigate the effects of IBTK on tumor growth in the presence of a functional immune system, we used a CT26 xenograft tumor model and found that immunocompetent mice implanted with IBTK-KD CT26 cells exhibited reduced tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 6G-I</bold>). CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a crucial role in antitumor immunity by secreting granzyme B, which triggers apoptosis. Notably, depletion of IBTK increased the population of CD8<sup>+</sup> CTLs and the release of granzyme B in xenograft tumors (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 6J, K</bold>). Collectively, these data indicate that IBTK promotes IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression and tumor immune escape.</p>

<title>IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination is regulated by mTORC1/S6K1 signaling</title>
<p>We investigated whether upstream mTORC1/S6K1 signaling regulates IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination. Three quantitative phosphoproteomic studies revealed that treatment with mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin or Torin 1) led to markedly reduced phosphorylation levels of seven Ser/Thr sites on IBTK(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Notably, these sites are clustered in a short region (990-1068 aa) close to IBTK’s last BTB domain (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>). We established the interaction of IBTK with the mTORC1 complex and S6K1 in cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-E</xref></bold>). We then examined the effect of mTOR signaling on IBTK phosphorylation. To do so, we generated an IBTK deletion mutant (900-1150 aa) spanning the potential mTORC1-regulated phosphorylation sites. Phos-tag gels were utilized for detection of shifts in the electrophoretic mobility of phosphorylated proteins. The results demonstrated that the phosphorylated IBTK900-1150aa was markedly decreased while the non-phosphorylated form was simultaneously increased in amino acid (AA)-deprived or rapamycin-treated cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref></bold>). Moreover, phosphorylation levels of IBTK900-1150aa were markedly downregulated in cells deficient in Raptor, an essential subunit of mTORC1 but not mTORC2 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref></bold>), indicating that mTORC1 signaling mediates IBTK phosphorylation.</p>

<p>In order to investigate whether mTOR or S6K1 directly phosphorylates IBTK, we conducted <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays using recombinant IBTK900-1150aa segment as a substrate. The analysis of the phospho-peptides via MS revealed that mTOR phosphorylates residues S911/999/1004/1039/1045/1069/1089/1141, while S6K1 phosphorylates residues S971/990/993/1033/1045/1096 and T1101 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H, I</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 7A, B, Supplementary Table. 4, 5</bold>). Thus, four out of seven sites (excluding S992, T1008, and T1068) were confirmed as mTOR/S6K1 phosphorylation sites <italic>in vitro</italic>, thereby confirming that IBTK is an authentic mTORC1/S6K1 substrate. Additionally, simultaneous mutation of seven Ser/Thr sites to Ala nearly abolished the mobility shift of IBTK900-1150aa (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref></bold>), suggesting that most, if not all, mTOR-regulated sites are localized in this region. We generated a phosphorylation-specific antibody that targets the combination of phospho-S990/992/993 in IBTK. Using this antibody, we observed a marked decrease in the phosphorylation levels of three adjacent Ser residues in IBTK upon AA deprivation or rapamycin treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K</xref></bold>). Furthermore, we found that IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination was considerably decreased by AA deprivation or rapamycin treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L</xref></bold>). To investigate the role of mTORC1/S6K1-regulated phosphorylation in this process, we generated an IBTK mutant (IBTK-7S/TA) in which seven Ser/Thr residues were replaced with Ala to abolish phosphorylation regulated by mTORC1/S6K1. We noticed that the IBTK-7S/TA mutant showed diminished capacity to ubiquitinate eIF4A1 compared to IBTK-WT (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M</xref></bold>). Collectively, these data suggest that IBTK is a phosphorylation substrate for mTORC1/S6K1 and that the mTORC1/S6K1 signaling pathway positively regulates IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination.</p>

<title>Overexpression of IBTK correlates with poor survival in cervical cancer</title>
<p>The aforementioned results established that demonstrated that IBTK promotes oncogenic eIF4A1 activation in cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa and SiHa). In light of these findings, we sought to evaluate the pathological significance of IBTK expression in cervical cancer.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Oncogenic signaling appears to dominate translation control at nearly all stage of cancer propagation for very specific and distinct cellular phenotypes. In general, cancer cells upregulate eIF4F activity to promote cap-dependent translation and oncogene expression, leading to rapid cell growth. Specifically, the study reveals a novel signaling axis involving mTORC1/S6K1-IBTK-eIF4A1 that promotes cap-dependent translation and oncoprotein expression, contributing to tumor cell growth. Additionally, we demonstrate that mTORC1 and S6K1 phosphorylate IBTK at multiple sites to boost CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup>-mediated IBTK ubiquitination under nutrient-rich conditions. Overall, this study adds to our understanding of how cancer cells hijack protein synthesis machinery to promote their survival and proliferation, and provides potential avenues for developing new cancer treatments (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>The development of eIF4A inhibitors as therapeutic agents for cancer patients is an exciting area of research. However, the emergence of resistance to these inhibitors highlights the need for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance. The recent genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen has identified three negative NRF2 regulators (KEAP1, CUL3, CAND1) whose inactivation can confer resistance to the silvestrol analogue, providing insights into potential pathways that may contribute to drug resistance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Additionally, our study shows that IBTK overexpression can suppress AS-induced SG assembly and that knockdown of IBTK can sensitize cancer cells to eIF4A inhibitor-induced cell death, making IBTK a potential therapeutic target to overcome intrinsic resistance to eIF4A1 inhibitor. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of continued research in the development of eIF4A1 inhibitors and the identification of new therapeutic targets to combat drug resistance in cancer cells.</p>
<p>The tumor suppressor PDCD4 inhibits translation by binding directly to eIF4A. Pisano et al. reported that PDCD4 is the first CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> substrate and that CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> targets PDCD4 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Although this study highlighted the potential involvement of IBTK in translation regulation, we did not observe any changes in protein levels of PDCD4 in IBTK-KD or -KO cells. Instead, our study showed that eIF4A1 is a major downstream effector of CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup>, which has been previously observed to regulate several well-characterized eIF4A targets, such as MYC and MCL1, in Eμ-myc mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Our results also suggest that IBTK may play a role in tumor immune escape through modulating the eIF4F-STAT1–IRF1–PD-L1 axis. This is supported by a recent study indicating that eIF4A1 promotes PD-L1-mediated tumor immune escape by controlling the translation of STAT1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to eIF4A1/2, IBTK cannot ubiquitinate eIF4A3, despite a strong interaction between the two proteins. It is not currently clear whether IBTK can promote eIF4A3 ubiquitination in certain circumstances or simply modulate eIF4A3 activity through direct binding. eIF4A1 is an essential subunit of EJC. The role of IBTK in post-transcriptional gene regulation through modulation of EJC activity is an area that warrants further investigation, particularly given that eIF4A3 or IBTK knockdown had an impact on alternative splicing in HeLa cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Alongside its interaction with eIF4A1/2, IBTK may also play diverse roles in different stages of the translation process. The AP-MS/MS data and biochemical validation provided strong evidence for the interaction between IBTK and eIF2α (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref></bold>). A previous study showed that a functional uORF in the 5’-UTR sequence allows for preferential translation of IBTK in response to p-eIF2α and ER stress(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Our findings suggest that IBTK may interact with eIF2α and modulate its activity, either positively or negatively, through direct binding in response to p-eIF2α and ER stress. The identification of IBTK interacting with multiple subunits of eIF3 complex (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, G</xref></bold>), which play key roles in different stages of translation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), highlights the potential role of IBTK in modulating translation regulation through eIF3 complex. These findings provide a basis for further investigations into the precise role of IBTK in controlling the efficiency and fidelity of protein synthesis.</p>
<p>Several quantitative phosphoproteomic studies have used mTOR inhibitors coupled with MS to demonstrate that mTOR kinase modulates the phosphorylation of thousands of currently uncharacterized mTOR substrates, either directly or indirectly through its downstream kinases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). One such potential mTOR substrate is IBTK. We observed that seven mTOR-regulated Ser/Thr sites are clustered in a short region of IBTK and hyperphosphorylation of IBTK900-1150aa was abolished when mTORC1 activity was inhibited. In particular, using <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays combined with MS, we have identified S999/S1004 as sites phosphorylated by mTOR, and S990/993 as sites phosphorylated by S6K1. However, the kinases responsible for the other three phosphorylation sites remain unclear and require further investigation. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which mTORC1 regulates IBTK phosphorylation and activity may provide insight into the broader functions of mTORC1 signaling in protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors examined the role of IBTK, a substrate-binding adaptor of the CRL3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in modulating the activity of the eiF4F translation initiation complex. They find that IBTK mediates the non-degradative ubiquitination of eiF4A1, promotes cap-dependent translational initiation, nascent protein synthesis, oncogene expression, and tumor cell growth. Correspondingly, phosphorylation of  IBTK by mTORC1/ S6K1 increases eIF4A1 ubiquitination and sustains oncogenic translation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study utilizes multiple biochemical, proteomic, functional, and cell biology assays to substantiate their results.  Importantly, the work nominates IBTK as a unique substrate of mTORC1, and further validates eiF4A1 ( a crucial subunit of the ei44F complex) as a promising therapeutic target in cancer. Since IBTK interacts broadly with multiple members of the translational initial complex - it will be interesting to examine its role in eiF2alpha-mediated ER stress as well as eiF3-mediated translation. Additionally, since IBTK exerts pro-survival effects in multiple cell types, it will be of relevance to characterize the role of IBTK in mediating increased mTORC1 mediated translation in other tumor types, thus potentially impacting their treatment with eiF4F inhibitors.</p>
<p>Limitations/Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The findings are mostly well supported by data, but some areas need clarification and could potentially be enhanced with further experiments:</p>
<p>1. Since eiF4A1 appears to function downstream of IBTK1, can the effects of IBTK1 KO/KD in reducing puromycin incorporation (in Fig 3A),  cap-dependent luciferase reporter activity (Fig 3G), reduced oncogene expression ( Fig 4A) or 2D growth/ invasion assays (Fig 4) be overcome or bypassed by overexpressing eiF4A1? These could potentially be tested in future studies.</p>
<p>2. The decrease in nascent protein synthesis in puromycin incorporation assays in Figure 3A suggest that the effects of IBTK KO are comparable to and additive with silvesterol. It would be of interest to examine whether silvesterol decreases nascent protein synthesis or increases stress granules in the IBTK KO cells stably expressing IBTK as well.</p>
<p>3. The data presented in Figure 5 regarding the role of mTORC1 in IBTK-mediated eiF4A1 ubiquitination needs further clarification on several points:</p>
<p>- It is not clear if the experiments in Figure 5F with Phos-tag gels are using the FLAG-IBTK deletion mutant or the peptide containing the mTOR sites as it is mentioned on line 517, page 19 &quot;To do so, we generated an IBTK deletion mutant (900-1150 aa) spanning the potential mTORC1-regulated phosphorylation sites&quot; This needs further clarification.</p>
<p>-It may be of benefit to repeat the Phos tag experiments with full-length FLAG-IBTK and/or endogenous IBTK with molecular weight markers indicating the size of migrated bands.</p>
<p>-Additionally, torin or Lambda phosphatase treatment may be used to confirm the specificity of the band in separate experiments.</p>
<p>-Phos-tag gels with the IBTK CRISPR KO line would also help confirm that the non-phosphorylated band is indeed IBTK.</p>
<p>-It is unclear why the lower, phosphorylated bands seem to be increasing (rather than decreasing) with AA starvation/ Rapa in Fig 5H.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Sun et al. identifies a novel role for IBTK in promoting cancer protein translation, through regulation of the translational helicase eIF4A1. Using a multifaceted approach, the authors demonstrate that IBTK interacts with and ubiquitinates eIF4A1 in a non-degradative manner, enhancing its activation downstream of mTORC1/S6K1 signaling. This represents a significant advance in elucidating the complex layers of dysregulated translational control in cancer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A major strength of this work is the convincing biochemical evidence for a direct regulatory relationship between IBTK and eIF4A1. The authors utilize affinity purification and proximity labeling methods to comprehensively map the IBTK interactome, identifying eIF4A1 as a top hit. Importantly, they validate this interaction and the specificity for eIF4A1 over other eIF4 isoforms by co-immunoprecipitation in multiple cell lines. Building on this, they demonstrate that IBTK catalyzes non-degradative ubiquitination of eIF4A1 both in cells and in vitro through the E3 ligase activity of the CRL3-IBTK complex. Mapping IBTK phosphorylation sites and showing mTORC1/S6K1-dependent regulation provides mechanistic insight. The reduction in global translation and eIF4A1-dependent oncoproteins upon IBTK loss, along with clinical data linking IBTK to poor prognosis, support the functional importance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While these data compellingly establish IBTK as a binding partner and modifier of eIF4A1, a remaining weakness is the lack of direct measurements showing IBTK regulates eIF4A1 helicase activity and translation of target mRNAs. While the effects of IBTK knockout/overexpression on bulk protein synthesis are shown, the expression of multiple eIF4A1 target oncogenes remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Overall, this study significantly advances our understanding of how aberrant mTORC1/S6K1 signaling promotes cancer pathogenic translation via IBTK and eIF4A1. The proteomic, biochemical, and phosphorylation mapping approaches established here provide a blueprint for interrogating IBTK function. These data should galvanize future efforts to target the mTORC1/S6K1-IBTK-eIF4A1 axis as an avenue for cancer therapy, particularly in combination with eIF4A inhibitors.</p>
