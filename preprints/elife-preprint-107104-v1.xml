<title>Abstract</title><p>Oncogenic <italic>Ras</italic> is known to induce DNA replication stress, leading to cellular senescence or death. In contrast, we found that it can also trigger polyploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovarian nurse cells to die by inducing aberrant division stress. To explore intrinsic protective mechanisms against this specific form of cellular stress, here we conducted a genome-wide genetic screen and identified the E2 enzyme Uev1A as a key protector. Reducing its expression levels exacerbates the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras</italic>, while overexpressing it or its human homologs, UBE2V1 and UBE2V2, mitigates this effect. Although Uev1A is primarily known for its non-proteolytic functions, our studies demonstrate that it collaborates with the E3 APC/C complex to mediate the proteasomal degradation of Cyclin A, a key cyclin that drives cell division. Furthermore, Uev1A and UBE2V1/UBE2V2 also counteract oncogenic <italic>Ras</italic>-driven tumorigenesis in diploid cells, suppressing the overgrowth of germline tumors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human colorectal tumor xenografts in nude mice, respectively. Remarkably, elevated expression levels of UBE2V1/2 correlate with improved survival rates in human colorectal cancer patients harboring oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations, indicating that their upregulation could represent a promising therapeutic strategy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although the human body contains trillions of cells that could potentially be targeted by oncogenic mutations, cancers arise infrequently throughout a human lifetime, suggesting the presence of effective resistant mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lowe et al., 2004</xref>). One key mechanism involves the induction of DNA replication stress by these oncogenic mutations, leading to cellular senescence or death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hills and Diffley, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kotsantis et al., 2018</xref>). This mechanism is mediated through the activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway and the tumor suppressor protein p53, which are triggered by DNA double-strand breaks. Only the cells that escape senescence and death, such as those harboring <italic>p53</italic> mutations, can undergo transformation by oncogenic mutations, thereby initiating tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gaillard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Igarashi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Macheret and Halazonetis, 2015</xref>). Among the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancers are the <italic>RAS</italic> genes (<italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>NRAS</italic>, and <italic>HRAS</italic>), which mutations are present in 20-30% of all cancer cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gimple and Wang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sanchez-Vega et al., 2018</xref>). These mutations often occur at codons 12, 13, and 61, resulting in RAS small GTPases being locked in a constitutively active, GTP-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Moore et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, previous studies have shown that oncogenic <italic>HRAS<sup>G12V</sup></italic>can induce DNA replication stress via the DDR pathway, ultimately leading to cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Di Micco et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Serrano et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>Ras oncogene at 85D</italic> gene (<italic>Ras85D</italic>, hereafter referred to as <italic>Ras</italic>) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> exhibits high homology to human <italic>RAS</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Neuman-Silberberg et al., 1984</xref>). Our previous research demonstrated that oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> triggers cell death in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovarian nurse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>), a type of post-mitotic germ cells that undergo G/S endoreplication to become polyploid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hammond and Laird, 1985</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> promotes the division of mitotic germ cells, the precursors to nurse cells. Furthermore, monoallelic deletion of the <italic>cyclin A</italic> (<italic>cycA</italic>) or <italic>cyclin-dependent kinase 1</italic> (<italic>cdk1</italic>) gene (<italic>cycA<sup>+/-</sup></italic> or <italic>cdk1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) suppresses the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). While CycA, a key cyclin promoting cell division, is not expressed in normal nurse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lilly et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lilly and Spradling, 1996</xref>), its ectopic expression in nurse cells can trigger their death (as observed in this study). These findings suggest that the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> is primarily due to aberrant promotion of cell division, rather than DNA hyper-replication. <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovarian nurse cells thus offer a valuable model for studying this specific form of cellular stress.</p>

<p>(A) Schematic cartoon for <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovariole. During oogenesis, GSC undergoes asymmetric division to generate two daughter cells: one that self-renews and maintains GSC identity, and the other, called a cystoblast, that differentiates to support oogenesis. As differentiation progresses, each cystoblast performs four rounds of division with incomplete cytokinesis to produce 16 interconnected cystocytes, establishing a germline cyst. This germline cyst is then surrounded by epithelial follicle cells to form an egg chamber. Within each egg chamber, one of the 16 germ cells becomes the oocyte, while the remaining 15 differentiate into nurse cells. These nurse cells undergo G/S endocycling, becoming polyploid to aid in oocyte development.

<p>Ubiquitination not only mediates protein degradation through the proteasome or lysosome but also plays crucial regulatory roles in various biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dikic, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kwon and Ciechanover, 2017</xref>). These functions are largely determined by the topological structures of the polyubiquitin chains, where ubiquitin can be linked to another ubiquitin via any of its seven lysine (K) residues or its first methionine residue. Among these, K11- and K48-linked polyubiquitin primarily mediates the proteasomal degradation. In contrast, K63 linkage facilitates the lysosomal degradation of protein aggregates and damaged organelles through autophagy. Additionally, K63 linkage is involved in non-degradative processes such as DNA repair, kinase activation, and protein transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kwon and Ciechanover, 2017</xref>). Ubc13, a ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzyme (Ubc), is responsible for the K63 linkage, with its activity requiring a Ubc variant (Uev, E2) protein as a cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hofmann and Pickart, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">McKenna et al., 2001</xref>). These E2 enzymes have been shown to play regulatory roles in various biological processes, including cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ma et al., 2013</xref>), DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Broomfield et al., 1998</xref>), DDR, and innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andersen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>However, it still remains unknown whether they also possess proteasomal proteolytic functions and whether such functions hold significant biological roles.</p>
<p>In this study, to investigate the intrinsic protective mechanisms against the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we conducted a genome-wide genetic screen and identified Uev1A as a crucial protector. Mechanistically, Uev1A works in conjunction with the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) to degrade the essential cyclin Cyclin A (CycA) via the proteasome, highlighting the critical role of its proteolytic function. Additionally, Uev1A and its human homologs, UBE2V1 and UBE2V2, also counteract oncogenic <italic>Ras</italic>-driven tumorigenesis in diploid cells, inhibiting the overgrowth of <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline tumors and human colorectal tumor xenografts in nude mice, respectively. These findings suggest that upregulation of UBE2V1/2 could represent a promising therapeutic approach for human colorectal cancers with <italic>RAS</italic> mutations.</p>

<title>Genetic screen identifies Uev1A as a crucial protector against the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic></title>
<p>While oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> triggers cell death in nurse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>), it does not have the same effect in cystocytes, the precursor cells before differentiating into nurse cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, D, E</xref>). To confirm Ras<sup>G12V</sup> expression in cystocytes, we generated a <italic>UASz-flag-Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> transgenic fly strain, which phenocopied the effects observed with the previously used <italic>UASp-Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>. RAS small GTPases need to be anchored to the inner cell membrane for their proper function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Willingham et al., 1980</xref>). Using <italic>bam-GAL4-VP16</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen and McKearin, 2003</xref>), we overexpressed Ras<sup>G12V</sup> specifically in cystocytes (<italic>bam&gt;flag-Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>) at 29°C and observed membrane-localized Flag signals, validating the normal expression of Ras<sup>G12V</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Also, Flag signals were detected in some early-stage nurse cells, although these signals gradually diminished over time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). However, nurse cell death remained very low in this context (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D, E</xref>). This may be attributed to either insufficient levels of the oncoproteins or the presence of a protective mechanism.</p>
<p>To explore this potential protective mechanism, we conducted a genetic modifier screen by introducing individual genome-wide <italic>Deficiencies</italic> (361 lines) into <italic>bam&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> flies (<bold><italic>bam&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup>; Deficiency/+</italic></bold>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Of note, ovaries from <italic>bam&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup>; Df#7584/+</italic> flies exhibited the highest incidence of degrading egg chambers with dying nurse cells per ovary (<bold>see Source data 1</bold>). One gene deleted in this deficiency line is <italic>uev1a</italic>, and RNAi targeting <italic>uev1a</italic> reproduced the phenotype seen with <italic>Df#7584</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D, E</xref>). In this and all subsequent experiments, we quantified the nurse-cell-death phenotype using the percentage of degrading to total egg chambers per ovary (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), a method that is more precise than our approach in the genetic screen. To further verify the role of <italic>uev1a</italic>, we generated a <italic>UASz-uev1a</italic> transgenic fly strain. Overexpression of Uev1A successfully rescued the nurse-cell-death phenotype in <italic>bam&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup>; Df#7584/+</italic> fly ovaries (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D, E</xref>), confirming that Uev1A is a crucial protector against the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>.</p>

<title>Protective role of Uev1A against the nurse cell death induced by direct overexpression of Ras<sup>G12V</sup></title>
<p>In contrast to the scenario above (<italic>bam&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>), direct overexpression of Ras<sup>G12V</sup> in nurse cells using <italic>nos-GAL4-VP16</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rørth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Van Doren et al., 1998</xref>) (<italic>nos&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>) resulted in substantial cell death even at 25°C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F, I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). Such observation prompted us to investigate the role of Uev1A in this context. Notably, the incidence of dying nurse cells was markedly elevated in <italic>nos&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup>+uev1a-RNAi</italic> ovaries compared to the <italic>nos&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup>+GFP-RNAi</italic> control ovaries (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F, I</xref>). To further validate this, we generated two <italic>uev1a</italic> mutants using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique: <italic>uev1a<sup>Δ1</sup></italic> and <italic>uev1a<sup>Δ2</sup></italic>. Both mutations consist of small deletions that cause frame shifts within the second coding exon of the <italic>uev1a</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Of note, flies with the <italic>uev1a<sup>Δ1/Δ1</sup></italic>, <italic>uev1a<sup>Δ1/Δ2</sup></italic>, <italic>uev1a<sup>Δ1</sup>/Df#7584</italic>, <italic>uev1a<sup>Δ2/Δ2</sup></italic>, or <italic>uev1a<sup>Δ2</sup>/Df#7584</italic> genotype could not survive into adults, suggesting that both mutations are strong loss-of-function alleles. Consistent with the effects observed with <italic>uev1a-RNAi</italic>, either mutation markedly increased the incidence of dying nurse cells in <italic>nos&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> ovaries (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H, I</xref>).</p>
<p>We next investigated whether upregulating Uev1A could mitigate the nurse cell death induced by direct overexpression of <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>. Remarkably, compared to the <italic>nos&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup>+lacZ</italic> control ovaries, the incidence of dying nurse cells was significantly reduced in <italic>nos&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup>+Uev1A</italic> ovaries (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K, L</xref>). Uev1A has two human homologs, UBE2V1 and UBE2V2, which share 67% (85%) and 67% (86%) sequence identities (similarities) with Uev1A, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). We generated transgenic fly strains for both <italic>UASz-UBE2V1</italic> and <italic>UASz-UBE2V2</italic>. Notably, overexpression of either UBE2V1 or UBE2V2 significantly mitigated the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>, similar to the effects observed with Uev1A overexpression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K, L</xref>). Taken together, these results further confirm the protective role of Uev1A against the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>.</p>
<p>Then, we were intrigued by the potential of Uev1A to protect against the nurse cell death induced by other oncogenic mutations. Yorkie (Yki), a key oncoprotein in the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Huang et al., 2005</xref>), has a hyperactive form known as Yki<sup>3SA</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Oh and Irvine, 2009</xref>). Its overexpression using <italic>nos-GAL4-VP16</italic> (<italic>nos&gt;Yki<sup>3SA</sup></italic>) at 29°C, but not at 25°C, could induce nurse cell death (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref><bold><italic>—figure supplement 1</italic></bold>), albeit much less severe than that induced by <italic>nos&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> at 25°C (compared with <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F, I</xref>). Of note, the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Yki<sup>3SA</sup></italic>was significantly alleviated by Uev1A overexpression (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), implying a broad role of Uev1A in this process. However, due to the mild effect of Yki<sup>3SA</sup> on triggering nurse cell death, we focused on Ras<sup>G12V</sup> in our subsequent studies.</p>

<title>Oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> triggers nurse cells to die through activating the MAPK pathway</title>
<p>To investigate how Uev1A protects against the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>, we first sought to further explore the mechanisms driving this cell death. Since egg chambers contain both nurse cells and oocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), we considered the possibility that the death signal could originate from the oocytes. The <italic>Bicaudal D</italic> (<italic>BicD</italic>) gene is essential for oocyte determination, and egg chambers deficient in it fail to specify oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Suter and Steward, 1991</xref>).

<title>CycA and the DDR pathway orchestrate the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic></title>
<p>The Ras/MAPK pathway is well known to promote cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gimple and Wang, 2019</xref>). Our previous work demonstrated that reducing the gene dosage of <italic>CycA</italic> or <italic>Cdk1</italic> suppresses the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). In addition to CycA and Cdk1, Cyclin B (CycB) and String (Stg) are two other essential regulators that drive cell division (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Edgar and Lehner, 1996</xref>). To investigate whether these regulators could individually induce nurse cell death upon overexpression, we tested each and found that only CycA triggered this phenotype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Notably, co-overexpression of CycA with Uev1A significantly suppressed this effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>), suggesting a genetic interaction between the two.</p>
<p>Oncogenic <italic>RAS</italic> can also induce DNA replication stress in diploid cells through forced cell cycle progression, thereby activating the DDR pathway and p53 to trigger cellular senescence or death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Di Micco et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Serrano et al., 1997</xref>). To investigate whether DDR plays a similar role in <italic>Ras</italic>-induced death of polyploid nurse cells, we targeted two key DDR genes: <italic>telomere fusion</italic> (<italic>tefu</italic>, encoding <italic>Drosophila</italic> ATM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Oikemus et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Silva et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Song et al., 2004</xref>) and <italic>loki</italic> (<italic>lok</italic>, encoding <italic>Drosophila</italic> Chk2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Masrouha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Xu et al., 2001</xref>). Strikingly, knockdown of either gene markedly enhanced this cell death (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>), revealing a protective role for the DDR pathway. By contrast, knockdown of <italic>p53</italic> suppressed this cell death (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>), demonstrating opposing functions for DDR and p53 in this system.</p>
<p>Given that RNAi targeting <italic>tefu</italic> or <italic>lok</italic> phenocopied that of <italic>uev1a</italic>, we hypothesized that Uev1A may protect against the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> through the DDR pathway. Since DDR is triggered by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>- induced stress in this context, we speculated that Uev1A should be upregulated as a response. To test this, we initially attempted to generate an antibody against Uev1A using its full protein sequence as the antigen; however, this approach was unsuccessful. As an alternative, we created a <italic>uev1a-flag</italic> knock-in fly strain by inserting the coding sequence of a 3xFlag tag immediately before the stop codon (&quot;TAG&quot;) of the <italic>uev1a</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These knock-in flies were homozygous viable and fertile, indicating that the Flag insertion did not disrupt Uev1A’s normal function. Previous studies have shown that Uev1A can activate JNK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ma et al., 2013</xref>), which acts in the surrounding follicle cells to promote nurse cell removal during late oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Timmons et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, we detected Uev1A-Flag signals in such follicle cells (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>), confirming that these signals reflect endogenous Uev1a expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries. Surprisingly, Uev1A-Flag signals were low in both <italic>nos&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup>; uev1a-flag/+</italic> and <italic>uev1a-flag/+</italic> control germ cells, including nurse cells, with no significant differences between the two groups (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). This suggests that Uev1A expression remains at basal levels, rather than being upregulated by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>-induced stress in this context. Although the possibility that Uev1A may play a role in the DDR pathway at these basal levels cannot be ruled out, we were then prompted to explore its potential proteolytic function as an E2 enzyme.</p>

<title>Uev1A collaborates with the APC/C complex to mitigate the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic></title>
<p>We first investigated whether Uev1A is directly involved in degradation of the Ras<sup>G12V</sup> oncoproteins. To address the challenges of analyzing membrane-localized signals in <italic>nos&gt;flag-Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> nurse cells due to severe cell death, we performed this assay in <italic>bam&gt;flag-Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>ovaries at 29°C. Notably, similar membrane-localized Flag signals were detected in both <italic>bam&gt;flag-Ras<sup>G12V</sup>+Uev1A</italic> and <italic>bam&gt;flag-Ras<sup>G12V</sup>+GFP</italic> control germ cells, including nurse cells (<xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This result suggests that Uev1A does not directly degrade the Ras<sup>G12V</sup> oncoproteins.</p>
<p>APC/C complex primarily functions as an E3 ligase to facilitate the degradation of CycA during cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sudakin et al., 1995</xref>). A compelling alternative model to explain our findings is that Uev1A collaborates with the APC/C complex to degrade CycA. Cell division cycle 27 (Cdc27, <italic>Drosophila</italic> APC3) is an essential part of the substrate recognition TPR lobe within the APC/C complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yamano, 2019</xref>). In <italic>bam&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup>+cdc27-RNAi</italic> ovaries, we observed dying nurse cells, a phenotype that was exacerbated with mutations in either <italic>uev1a<sup>Δ1</sup></italic>or <italic>uev1a<sup>Δ2</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E, F</xref>). Furthermore, knocking down <italic>cdc27</italic> could increase the incidence of dying nurse cells in <italic>bam&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup>+uev1a-RNAi</italic> ovaries (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E, F</xref>). Additionally, we investigated Fizzy- related (Fzr), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of Cdh1, which plays a critical role as an activator of APC/C-dependent proteolysis and functions as a tumor suppressor in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Greil et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sigrist and Lehner, 1997</xref>). Remarkably, nearly all egg chambers in <italic>bam&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup>+uev1a-RNAi+fzr-RNAi</italic> ovaries exhibited degradation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E, F</xref>).</p>
<p>We also knocked down three additional APC/C complex genes in <italic>bam&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup>+uev1a-RNAi</italic> ovaries: <italic>shattered</italic> (<italic>shtd</italic>, encoding <italic>Drosophila</italic> APC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tanaka-Matakatsu et al., 2007</xref>), <italic>morula</italic> (<italic>mr</italic>, encoding <italic>Drosophila</italic> APC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kashevsky et al., 2002</xref>), and <italic>lemming A</italic> (<italic>lmgA</italic>, encoding <italic>Drosophila</italic> APC11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nagy et al., 2012</xref>). Among these factors, Shtd is a critical component of the scaffolding platform, while Mr and LmgA are essential components of the catalytic modules within the APC/C complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yamano, 2019</xref>). However, no significant enhancement in nurse cell death was observed (data not shown). This may be due to the relatively mild phenotype of nurse cell death in <italic>bam&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup>+uev1a-RNAi</italic> ovaries. To address this, we switched to knocking down these genes in <italic>nos&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> ovaries. Notably, knockdown of any of them could significantly exacerbated the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G, H</xref>), similar to the effect observed with Uev1A downregulation. Collectively, these findings provide genetic evidence that Uev1A collaborates with the APC/C complex to mitigate the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>.</p>
<p>Then, we investigated whether Uev1A and the APC/C complex protect nurse cells from death during normal oogenesis. Given that the G2/M-promoting CycA is absent in the G/S-endocycling nurse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lilly et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lilly and Spradling, 1996</xref>), we used the cystocyte-specific driver, <italic>bam-GAL4-VP16</italic>, to conduct the assays at 29°C. Similar to nurse cells, Uev1A expression was at basal levels in cystocytes, with some expression detected in inner sheath cells and epithelial follicle cells (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Remarkably, nearly all egg chambers in <italic>bam&gt;fzr-RNAi</italic> ovaries exhibited degradation (<xref rid="fig2s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), underscoring Fzr’s critical regulatory role in this context. Uev1A, lacking the conserved cysteine residue in its presumed active site for ubiquitin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sancho et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>), typically partners with Bendless (Ben), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of mammalian Ubc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Muralidhar and Thomas, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Oh et al., 1994</xref>), to perform the E2 enzyme function. Ovaries with the <italic>bam&gt;cdc27-RNAi</italic>, <italic>bam&gt;cdc27-RNAi+uev1a-RNAi</italic>, or <italic>bam&gt;cdc27- RNAi+ben-RNAi</italic> genotype showed minimal degradation of egg chambers (<xref rid="fig2s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, degraded egg chambers were prevalent in <italic>bam&gt;cdc27-RNAi+ben-RNAi; uev1a<sup>Δ1</sup>/+</italic> and <italic>bam&gt;cdc27-RNAi+ben-RNAi; uev1a<sup>Δ2</sup>/+</italic> ovaries, where Uev1A, Ben, and Cdc27 are all downregulated (<xref rid="fig2s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results suggest that Uev1A, Ben, and the APC/C complex also work together to protect nurse cells from death during normal oogenesis.</p>

<title>Uev1A and the APC/C complex work together to degrade CycA via the proteasome</title>
<p>The APC/C complex is known to collaborate with the E2 enzymes UBE2C (<italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog: Vihar) and UBE2S (<italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog: Ube2S) to facilitate the proteasomal degradation of CycA during cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Greil et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yamano, 2019</xref>). This degradation involves the assembly of branched ubiquitin chains, incorporating K11, K48, and K63 linkages through a two-step mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Meyer and Rape, 2014</xref>). However, the involvement of Uev1A in this process remains unexplored. To explore it, we performed biochemical assays in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> Schneider 2 (S2) cells, overexpressing tag-fused proteins using <italic>act-GAL4</italic> to enhance expression efficiency. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays revealed that Uev1A interacts with several components of the APC/C complex, including Mr, Cdc16 (<italic>Drosophila</italic> APC6), and Cdc23 (<italic>Drosophila</italic> APC8). In addition, Cdc27 was found to interact with CycA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Remarkably, RNAi targeting <italic>uev1a</italic>, <italic>ben</italic>, or <italic>cdc27</italic> significantly stabilized CycA proteins after the treatment with cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of protein synthesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-E</xref>). Since the K63 linkage primarily mediates lysosomal degradation via autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kwon and Ciechanover, 2017</xref>), we tested CycA stabilization with a chloroquine (CQ, a lysosome inhibitor) or MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor) treatment. Notably, MG132, but not CQ, treatment significantly stabilized CycA proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). These results suggest that Uev1A, Ben, and Cdc27 cooperate to promote CycA degradation through the proteasome rather than the lysosome.</p>

<p>To directly validate this, we performed ubiquitination assays for CycA in S2 cells. Cdc27 significantly enhanced CycA ubiquitination, while this effect was markedly reduced upon the knockdown of <italic>uev1a</italic>, <italic>ben</italic>, or both (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). This result indicates that both Uev1A and Ben are essential for APC/C-mediated proteasomal degradation of CycA. Furthermore, we explored the roles of the seven lysine (K) residues in ubiquitin for polyubiquitin chain formation. The 7KR (lysine to arginine) mutation completely abolished Cdc27-promoted polyubiquitination of CycA. Intriguingly, the 6KR+K48 mutation, in which all K residues except K48 were mutated to R residues, failed to restore polyubiquitination. In contrast, either 6KR+K11 or 6KR+K63 mutation significantly restored polyubiquitination (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). These findings suggest that the K11 and K63 linkages are primarily responsible for CycA polyubiquitination in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. Together with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hofmann and Pickart, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">McKenna et al., 2001</xref>), we propose that Uev1A and Ben mediate the K63 linkage in this process.</p>

<p>To investigate the potential tumor-suppressive effects of UBE2V1 and UBE2V2 on colorectal cancer cells, we overexpressed them in human SW480 cells (carrying the <italic>KRAS<sup>G12V</sup></italic> mutation) and HCT116 cells (carrying the <italic>KRAS<sup>G13D</sup></italic> mutation), respectively. Overexpression efficiency was confirmed by Western blot analysis (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Proliferation assays using 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) demonstrated that overexpression of either UBE2V1 or UBE2V2 significantly inhibited the proliferation of <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutant colorectal cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, D</xref>). This inhibitory effect was further corroborated by clonogenic and cell viability (CCK8) assays, which showed that UBE2V1 or UBE2V2 overexpression markedly impaired cell colony formation and survival (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E–G</xref>).</p>
<p>To validate the tumor-suppressive effects of UBE2V1 and UBE2V2 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated stable SW480 cell lines overexpressing either of them, with overexpression efficiency confirmed by Western blot analysis (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Subcutaneous tumorigenesis assays in <italic>Balb/c</italic> nude mice showed that UBE2V1 or UBE2V2 overexpression significantly suppressed tumor formation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H, I</xref>). Immunohistochemical staining further revealed a marked reduction in Cyclin A expression and Ki-67 positivity rates in tumors overexpressing either UBE2V1 or UBE2V2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J, K</xref>). Notably, the tumor-suppressive effect of UBE2V1 was more pronounced than that of UBE2V2, aligning with their ability to protect against the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K, L</xref>). These results provide strong evidence for the tumor-suppressive effects of UBE2V1 and UBE2V2 on <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutant colorectal cancer.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is well established that oncogenic <italic>Ras</italic> can induce DNA replication stress, leading to cellular senescence or death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hills and Diffley, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kotsantis et al., 2018</xref>). However, our previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>) and current findings demonstrated that oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> can also trigger cell death in polyploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovarian nurse cells through aberrantly promoting their division. In this study, we performed a genome-wide genetic screen and identified the E2 enzyme Uev1A as a crucial protector against this specific form of cellular stress. Mechanistically, Uev1A collaborates with the APC/C complex (E3) to facilitate the proteasomal degradation of CycA, which overexpression alone can also trigger nurse cell death. Furthermore, Uev1A and its human homologs, UBE2V1 and UBE2V2, counteract oncogenic <italic>Ras</italic>-driven tumorigenesis in diploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline and human colorectal tumor cells, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). These findings highlight the critical role of Uev1A in counteracting oncogenic <italic>Ras</italic> stimuli in both polyploid and diploid cells.</p>
<p>Our studies reveal that the DDR pathway protects against the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>), suggesting that this cellular stress both activates and is subsequently suppressed by the DDR. In contrast, p53 promotes nurse cell death under the same conditions (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Interestingly, previous research has also demonstrated distinct roles of p53 and Lok, a crucial DDR regulator, in regulating nurse cell death during mid-oogenesis. While Lok overexpression triggers nurse cell death, p53 overexpression does not. Furthermore, Lok-induced nurse cell death remains unaffected by <italic>p53</italic> mutation, indicating that its mechanism operates independently of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bakhrat et al., 2010</xref>). The underlying mechanisms driving these differences warrant further investigation.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that Uev1A promotes cell death through activating JNK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). If this mechanism also applied to the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>, we would expect a reduction in Uev1A levels to suppress this cell death. However, our observations revealed the opposite effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-I</xref>). Additionally, we did not detect the expression of <italic>puc-lacZ</italic>, a reporter for JNK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Glise et al., 1995</xref>), in <italic>nos&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> nurse cells (data not shown). These findings suggest that Uev1A’s protective role in this context is independent of JNK signaling.</p>
<p>Of note, the suppressive effects of Uev1A on <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup>; bam<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> germline tumors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> were less pronounced than that of UBE2V1/2 on oncogenic <italic>KRAS<sup>G12V</sup></italic>-driven human colorectal tumor xenografts in nude mice (<bold><italic>compare </italic></bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref> with <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H, I</xref>). Our previous research has shown that <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup>; bam<sup>-/-</sup></italic> germline tumor cells divide infrequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). This suggests that the relatively weak suppression observed in these tumors may be due to the fact that Uev1A’s mechanism of action is cell cycle-dependent: the more frequently tumor cells divide, the more effectively Uev1A can suppress tumor overgrowth. We did not observe significant negative effects of Uev1A overexpression on GSC maintenance in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, E</xref>). This is likely because GSCs also divide infrequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Morris and Spradling, 2011</xref>). Therefore, these findings underscore the importance of considering the potential negative effects of Uev1A/UBE2V1/2 overexpression in other contexts, particularly when cells divide rapidly.</p>
<p>RAS oncoproteins have long been considered &quot;undruggable&quot;, due to the lack of deep-binding, targetable pockets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Moore et al., 2020</xref>). To date, targeted therapies have been approved only for KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Canon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Skoulidis et al., 2021</xref>). Recently, small-molecule pan-KRAS degraders, developed using the proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) strategy, have shown promise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Popow et al., 2024</xref>), though their clinical effectiveness and safety remain to be fully validated. Alternatively, targeting key regulators in the RAS signaling pathway—such as SOS, SHP2, Farnesyltransferase, Raf, MEK, ERK, and PI3K—has emerged as an attractive therapeutic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Moore et al., 2020</xref>). Recent research has also explored the strategy of hyperactivating oncogenic <italic>RAS</italic> to trigger cell death as a potential means to suppress the overgrowth of human colon tumor xenografts in nude mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dias et al., 2024</xref>). Additionally, targeting the cellular dependencies driven by oncogenic <italic>RAS</italic> may trigger RAS-specific synthetic lethality, presenting a promising therapeutic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Moore et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings highlight the tumor-suppressive effects of UBE2V1 and UBE2V2 on human colorectal tumors driven by oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Notably, both of these two E2 enzymes are relatively small, with UBE2V1 consisting of 147 amino acid residues and UBE2V2 145 residues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). This raises the exciting possibility that their upregulation, through mRNA delivery or small-molecule agonists, could offer a promising therapeutic approach for human cancer.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study examines the role of E2 ubiquitin enzyme, Uev1a in tissue resistance to oncogenic RasV12 in Drosophila melanogaster polyploid germline cells and human cancer cell lines. The <bold>incomplete</bold> evidence suggests that Uev1a works with the E3 ligase APC/C to degrade Cyclin A, and the strength of evidence could be increased by addressing the expression of CycA in the ovaries and the uev1a loss of function in human cancer cells. This work would be of interest to researchers in germline biology and cancer.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study uncovers a protective role of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant Uev1A in mitigating cell death caused by over-expressed oncogenic Ras in polyploid Drosophila nurse cells and by RasK12 in diploid human tumor cell lines. The authors previously showed that overexpression of oncogenic Ras induces death in nurse cells, and now they perform a deficiency screen for modifiers. They identified Uev1A as a suppressor of this Ras-induced cell death. Using genetics and biochemistry, the authors found that Uev1A collaborates with the APC/C E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to promote proteasomal degradation of Cyclin A. This function of Uev1A appears to extend to diploid cells, where its human homologs UBE2V1 and UBE2V2 suppress oncogenic Ras-dependent phenotypes in human colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in xenografts in mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Most of the data is supported by a sufficient sample size and appropriate statistics.</p>
<p>
(2) Good mix of genetics and biochemistry.</p>
<p>
(3) Generation of new transgenes and Drosophila alleles that will be beneficial for the community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Phenotypes are based on artificial overexpression. It is not clear whether these results are relevant to normal physiology.</p>
<p>(2) The phenotype of &quot;degenerating ovaries&quot; is very broad, and the study is not focused on phenotypes at the cellular level. Furthermore, no information is provided in the Materials and Methods on how degenerating ovaries are scored, despite this being the most important assay in the study.</p>
<p>(3) In Figure 5, the authors want to conclude that uev1a is a tumor-suppressor, and so they over-express ubev1/2 in human cancer cell lines that have RasK12 and find reduced proliferation, colony formation, and xenograft size. However, genes that act as tumor suppressors have loss-of-function phenotypes that allow for increased cell division. The Drosophila uev1a mutant is viable and fertile, suggesting that it is not a tumor suppressor in flies. Additionally, they do not deplete human ubev1/2 from human cancer cell lines and assess whether this increases cell division, colony formation, and xenograph growth.</p>
<p>(4) A critical part of the model does not make sense. CycA is a key part of their model, but they do not show CycA protein expression in WT egg chambers or in their over-expression models (nos.RasV12 or bam&gt;RasV12). Based on Lilly and Spradling 1996, Cyclin A is not expressed in germ cells in region 2-3 of the germarium; whether CycA is expressed in nurse cells in later egg chambers is not shown but is critical to document comprehensively.</p>
<p>(5) The authors should provide more information about the knowledge base of uev1a and its homologs in the introduction.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors performed a genetic screen using deficiency lines and identified Uev1a as a factor that protects nurse cells from RasG12V-induced cell death. According to a previous study from the same lab, this cell death is caused by aberrant mitotic stress due to CycA upregulation (Zhang et al.). This paper further reveals that Uev1a forms a complex with APC/C to promote proteasome-mediated degradation of CycA.</p>
<p>In addition to polyploid nurse cells, the authors also examined the effect of RasG12V-overexpression in diploid germline cells, where RasG12V-overexpression triggers active proliferation, not cell death. Uev1a was found to suppress its overgrowth as well.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors show that the overexpression of the human homologs, UBE2V1 and UBE2V2, suppresses tumor growth in human colorectal cancer xenografts and cell lines. Notably, the expression of these genes correlates with the survival of colorectal cancer patients carrying the Ras mutation.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>This paper presents a significant finding that UBE2V1/2 may serve as a potential therapy for cancers harboring Ras mutations. The authors propose a fascinating mechanism in which Uev1a forms a complex with APC/C to inhibit aberrant cell cycle progression.</p>

<p>(1) Phenotypes are based on artificial overexpression. It is not clear whether these results are relevant to normal physiology.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Downregulation of Uev1A, Ben, and Cdc27 together significantly increased the incidence of dying nurse cells in normal ovaries (Figure 2-figure supplement 4), indicating that the mechanism we uncovered also protects nurse cells from death during normal oogenesis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The phenotype of &quot;degenerating ovaries&quot; is very broad, and the study is not focused on phenotypes at the cellular level.

</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for pointing out this issue. We quantified the phenotype of nurse cell death using “degrading/total egg chambers per ovary”, not “degenerating ovaries” (see all quantification data in our manuscript). Notably, this phenotype ranges from mild to severe. In normal nurse cells, nuclei exhibit a large, round morphology in DAPI staining (see the first panel in Figure 1D). During early death, nurse cell nuclei become disorganized and begin to condense and fragment (see the third panel in Figure 2-figure supplement 2E). In late-stage death, the nuclei are completely fragmented into small, condensed spherical structures (see the second panel in Figure 1D), making cellular-level phenotypic quantification impossible. Since all nurse cells within the same egg chamber are interconnected, their death process is synchronous. Thus, quantifying the phenotype at the egg-chamber level is more practical than at the cellular level. To improve clarity, we will provide a detailed description of the phenotype and integrate this explanation into the main text of the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>We apologize for our misleading description. In Figure 5, we aimed to demonstrate that UBE2V1/2, like Uev1A in <italic>Drosophila</italic> “<italic>nos&gt;Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>+<italic>bam-RNAi</italic>” germline tumors (Figure 4), suppress oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic>-driven overgrowth in diploid human cancer cells. Importantly, this function of Uev1A and UBE2V1/2 is dependent on <italic>Ras</italic>-driven tumors; there is no evidence that they act as broad tumor suppressors in the absence of oncogenic <italic>Ras</italic>. <italic>Drosophila uev1a</italic> mutants were lethal, not viable (see Lines 131-133), and germline-specific knockdown of <italic>uev1a</italic> (<italic>nos&gt;uev1a-RNAi</italic>) caused female sterility without inducing tumors. These findings suggest that Uev1A lacks tumor-suppressive activity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> female germline in the absence of <italic>Ras</italic>-driven tumors. We will revise the manuscript to prevent misinterpretation. Furthermore, we will investigate whether depletion of <italic>UBE2V1</italic>, <italic>UBE2V2</italic>, or both promotes oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic>-driven overgrowth in human cancer cells.</p>

<p>(4) A critical part of the model does not make sense. CycA is a key part of their model, but they do not show CycA protein expression in WT egg chambers or in their over-expression models (nos.RasV12 or bam&gt;RasV12).

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this critical comment. CycA is a key cyclin that partners with Cdk1 to promote cell division (Edgar and Lehner, 1996). Notably, nurse cells are post-mitotic endocycling cells (Hammond and Laird, 1985) and typically do not express CycA (Lilly and Spradling, 1996) (see the last sentence, page 2518, paragraph 3). However, their death induced by oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> is significantly suppressed by monoallelic deletion of either <italic>cycA</italic> or <italic>cdk1</italic> (Zhang et al., 2024). Conversely, ectopic CycA expression in nurse cells triggers their death (Figure 2C, 2D). These findings suggest that polyploid nurse cells exhibit high sensitivity to aberrant division-promoting stress, which may represent a distinct form of cellular stress unique to polyploid cells. To further test our model, we will compare CycA expression levels in normal nurse cells versus those undergoing oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>-induced cell death.</p>
