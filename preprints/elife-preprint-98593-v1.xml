<title>Abstract</title><p>Innate immune responses triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, while host factors including pro-inflammatory cytokines are critical for viral containment. By utilizing quantitative and qualitative models, we discovered that soluble factors secreted by human monocytes potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion in viral-infected cells. Through cytokine screening, we identified that interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a key mediator of inflammation, inhibits syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains. Mechanistically, IL-1β activates RhoA/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway, which drives the enrichment of actin bundles at the cell-cell junctions that prevents syncytia formation.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has spread globally, with at least 755 million people diagnosed and the death toll is over 6.8 million. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron, continue to evolve and increase transmissibility and the ability to escape host immune responses. These variants have brought huge challenges to the design and development of vaccines and therapeutic reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). In order to discover novel strategies to control the virus, it is important to understand host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cell-cell fusion (also known as syncytia formation) in multiple cell types including lung epithelial cells, neurons and glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Martínez-Mármol et al., 2023</xref>). Syncytia of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells with neighboring cells could potentially contribute to increased viral transmission and pathogenicity in the infected host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Rajah, Bernier, Buchrieser, &amp; Schwartz, 2022</xref>), which also makes the virus insensitive to extracellular neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Yu et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, syncytia formation among pneumocytes with long-term persistence of viral RNA has been observed in the lung autopsy of deceased COVID-19 donors, which may contribute to prolonged clearance of the virus and long COVID symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bussani et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, inhibiting syncytia formation is critical to ensure viral clearance and to control viral transmission.</p>
<p>It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 mediated syncytia formation is effectively inhibited by multiple interferon (IFN)-stimulating genes (ISGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Pfaender et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). However, low IFN levels with impaired ISG responses were observed during early SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may have compromised the antiviral responses of IFN in severe COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Blanco-Melo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hadjadj et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, identifying endogenous host factors that regulate syncytia formation is of great significance for harnessing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>Of note, a variety of cells are involved in the host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ren et al., 2021</xref>), lung epithelial cells are the primary target of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, which subsequently recruit and activate innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barnett et al., 2023</xref>). Tissue-resident macrophages and circulating monocytes contribute to local and systemic inflammation largely through releasing inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sefik et al., 2022</xref>). Among these cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, the combination of TNF-α and IFN-γ induces inflammatory cell death, resulting in clear tissue damage, while other cytokines’ function remains obscure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Karki et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, when corticosteroids were used to suppress the inflammatory response in patients infected by SARS-CoV (N. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lee et al., 2004</xref>) or MERS-CoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arabi et al., 2018</xref>), the clearance of viral RNA was obviously delayed, suggesting the importance of innate immune factors including cytokines in viral clearance.</p>
<p>Innate immune cells express toll-like receptors (TLRs), and TLR-mediated signaling induces robust production of inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Medzhitov, 2001</xref>). In the current work, we screened the role of soluble pro-inflammatory cytokines on the SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion. Notably, we identified that IL-1β, which is the key factor of inflammatory response, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced syncytia formation in various cells by activating RhoA/ROCK pathway to initiate actin bundle formation at cell-cell interface between SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and neighboring cells. Importantly, IL-1β significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission among lung epithelia in experimental mice <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, our data highlight an important role for pro-inflammatory cytokines against viral infection.</p>

<title>Host factors secreted by activated innate immune cells inhibit SARS-CoV-2 induced cell-cell fusion</title>
<p>We have previously established quantitative and qualitative models for SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion by bioluminescence assay, immunoblotting and fluorescence imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). In order to explore the potential effect of cytokines on SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion, human monocyte cell line THP-1 and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were used in this study. We applied several TLR ligands to stimulate such innate immune cells and collected the cell culture supernatants for subsequent experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Of note, cell culture supernatants of THP-1 cells stimulated by TLR ligands significantly reduced the bioluminescence signal, while neither untreated THP-1 cell culture supernatant nor the medium control had any effect on the bioluminescence signal reflecting cell-cell fusion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 spike engagement of ACE2 primed the cleavage of S2’ fragment in target cells, a key proteolytic event coupled with spike-mediated membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). In parallel with bioluminescence assay, a large amount of enriched S2’ cleavage was detected in HEK293T-Spike and HEK293T-ACE2 co-cultured group and co-culture incubated with untreated THP-1 cell culture supernatant, while S2’ cleavage was significantly reduced upon treatment with TLR ligands-stimulated THP-1 cell culture supernatants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Syncytia formation was also visualized using cells co-expressing spike and a ZsGreen fluorescent reporter. The number and area of syncytium were significantly reduced by the treatment with TLR ligands-stimulated THP-1 cell culture supernatants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Considering the presence of TLR ligands in cell culture supernatant, we tested their potential direct effects. As expected, TLR ligands alone did not reduce the bioluminescence signal and S2’ cleavage compared to the control groups <bold>(Fig. S1 A and B)</bold>, as well as no effect on syncytia formation <bold>(Fig. S1C)</bold>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Concurrently, we also tested the effect of PBMCs culture supernatants on SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion. Consistent with the results from THP-1 cells, TLR ligands stimulated PBMCs culture supernatants treatment also significantly reduced the bioluminescence signal, S2’ cleavage, and the number and area of syncytium compared with the medium group <bold>(Fig. S1 D-F)</bold>. These results suggested that activated innate immune cells released host factors to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion.</p>
<p>To validate the effect of innate immune cell culture supernatants on cell-cell fusion in authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection, we pre-treated ACE2-expressing cells with THP-1 cell culture supernatants before inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) or Wuhan-Hu-1 (wild type, WT) strains. Cell lysates were used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike and N protein 24 hours post infection (hpi) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). This experiment revealed that TLR ligands stimulated THP-1 cell culture supernatants reduced S2’ cleavage and N protein during Delta or WT SARS-CoV-2 infection in HEK293T-ACE2 cells, while untreated THP-1 cell culture supernatant had no effect <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref><bold> and Fig. S2A)</bold>. In addition, TLR ligands stimulated THP-1 cell culture supernatants significantly reduced the number and area of syncytium induced by Delta or WT SARS-CoV-2 infection <bold>(Fig. S2 B and C)</bold>. Furthermore, we infected the human colon epithelial carcinoma cell line Caco-2 with WT SARS-CoV-2, and found that S2’ cleavage and N protein were reduced after TLR ligands stimulated THP-1 cell culture supernatants pre-treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Accordingly, immunofluorescent staining also showed that TLR ligands stimulated THP-1 cell culture supernatants significantly reduced the number and area of syncytium during SARS-CoV-2 infection in Caco-2 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). These data suggested that host factors secreted by activated innate immune cells inhibit authentic SARS-CoV-2 induced cell-cell fusion.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>IL-1β inhibits SARS-CoV-2 induced cell-cell fusion</title>
<p>To explore which host factors inhibited SARS-CoV-2 induced cell-cell fusion, we first detected mRNA levels of different cytokines in THP-1 cells stimulated by TLR ligands. It was found that the expression levels of <italic>IL1A</italic>, <italic>IL1B</italic>, <italic>IL6</italic> and <italic>IL8</italic> were significantly increased upon TLR ligands stimulation, while <italic>IL4</italic>, <italic>IL12A</italic>, <italic>IFNA1</italic>, <italic>IFNB1</italic> and <italic>IFNG</italic> mRNA levels were relatively unchanged or undetected <bold>(Fig. S3A)</bold>. In addition, we also detected the mRNA levels of cytokine receptors in HEK293T modelling cells, confirming that <italic>IL1R1</italic>, <italic>IL4R</italic>, <italic>IL6ST</italic>, <italic>IL8RA</italic>, <italic>IFNAR1</italic>, <italic>IFNGR1</italic> were expressed in such cells, while <italic>IL2RA</italic> and <italic>IL12RB1</italic> were undetectable <bold>(Fig. S3B)</bold>.</p>
<p>We next selected recombinant IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 to test whether individual cytokine may play a role in affecting SARS-CoV-2 spike induced cell-cell fusion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Interestingly, IL-1α and IL-1β significantly reduced the bioluminescence signal compared to the control group, while IL-6 and IL-8 had little or no effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). In addition, fluorescence images of cells expressing Zsgreen reporter also confirmed that IL-1α and IL-1β significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike induced syncytia formation <bold>(Fig. S3C)</bold>. Furthermore, IL-1β and IL-1α both reduced the bioluminescence signal and S2’ cleavage <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref><bold> C and D, and Fig. S4A)</bold> in cell lysates in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the syncytia formation was inhibited with increasing concentrations of IL-1β or IL-1α <bold>(Fig. S4 B and C)</bold>. Intriguingly, when we added both IL-1α and IL-1β, there was no synergistic inhibition on cell-cell fusion compared to either cytokine alone <bold>(Fig. S4 D and E)</bold>, suggesting a potential saturation of IL-1 receptor binding to these homologues. Since both IL-1α and IL-1β activate the downstream pathway through the same receptor IL-1R1, it is suggested that IL-1α or IL-1β may inhibit cell-cell fusion through the same pathway. Considering the higher mRNA level of <italic>IL1B</italic> than <italic>IL1A,</italic> as well as the classical release pathway of IL-1β from innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Weber, Wasiliew, &amp; Kracht, 2010</xref>), we mainly used IL-1β for further experiments.</p>

<p>In order to validate the effect of IL-1β on cell-cell fusion during authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection, we pre-treated ACE2-expressing cells with IL-1β before inoculating with Delta or WT authentic SARS-CoV-2. Cell lysates were used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike and N protein 24 hpi (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). To this end, it was found that IL-1β reduced S2’ cleavage and N protein compared to the control group during such infection both in HEK293T-ACE2 <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref><bold> and Fig. S5A)</bold> and Caco-2 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Meanwhile, IL-1β inhibited authentic SARS-CoV-2 induced syncytia formation <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref><bold> and Fig. S5 B and C)</bold>. These results verified that IL-1β inhibits authentic SARS-CoV-2 induced cell-cell fusion in various target cells.</p>
<p>As expected, innate immune cells activated by TLR ligands secreted IL-1β into the cell culture supernatants <bold>(Fig. S6, A and B),</bold> and TLR2 was essential for THP-1 cells to release IL-1β in response to TLR2 ligands <bold>(Fig. S6C)</bold>. More importantly, the cell culture supernatants of TLR2-knockout THP-1 cells stimulated by TLR2 Ligands had no effect on the bioluminescence signal, while the cell culture supernatants from WT THP-1 cells stimulated by the same TLR2 Ligands significantly reduced the bioluminescence signal <bold>(Fig. S6D)</bold>. In addition, pre-treatment with TAK1 inhibitor (5Z-7) or IKKβ inhibitor (TPCA1) in WT THP-1 cells prevented IL-1β secretion after PGN stimulation <bold>(Fig. S6E)</bold>, as well as eliminated the inhibitory effect of PGN-stimulated WT THP-1 cell culture supernatant on SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion <bold>(Fig. S6F)</bold>. In parallel, pre-treatment with these inhibitors in PBMCs showed the same results <bold>(Fig. S6 G and H)</bold>. These data suggested that TLR-knockout or inhibitors targeting the respective TLR signaling prevented innate immune cells from releasing IL-1β into supernatants, which led to failed inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike induced cell-cell fusion. These findings thus further verify that IL-1β is an important host factor inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 induced cell-cell fusion.</p>
<p>To investigate the effector function of IL-1 on cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (donor cells) and neighboring cells expressing ACE2 (acceptor cells), we pre-treated HEK293T-S or HEK293T-ACE2 cells or both with IL-1β, then co-cultured after washing with PBS. Cells were then analyzed by the quantitative and qualitative models <bold>(Fig. S7A)</bold>. Notably, pre-treatment of either HEK293T-S or HEK293T-ACE2 cells with IL-1β alone reduced bioluminescence signal and S2’ cleavage; when IL-1β pre-treatment on both HEK293T-S and HEK293T-ACE2 cells was applied, bioluminescence signal and S2’ cleavage were further reduced <bold>(Fig. S7B)</bold>. Furthermore, we used Vero E6-overexpressing ACE2 cell line (Vero E6-ACE2) and human Calu-3 cells as acceptor cells. In this case, pre-treatment of either HEK293T-S or Vero E6-ACE2 cells with IL-1β alone reduced part of S2’ cleavage, while IL-1β pre-treatment of both HEK293T-S and Vero E6-ACE2 cells led to further reduction of S2’ cleavage <bold>(Fig. S7C)</bold>. And the same results were observed in the case of Calu-3 as acceptor cells <bold>(Fig. S7D)</bold>. Accordingly, fluorescence imaging showed that IL-1β significantly reduced the number and area of syncytia <bold>(Fig. S8A)</bold>. Notably, IL-1β reduced the bioluminescence signal and S2’ cleavage in different SARS-CoV-2 variants <bold>(Fig. S8 B-D)</bold>. These results suggest that IL-1β acts on both donor and acceptor cells to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike induced cell-cell fusion in various cell lines.</p>
<p>SARS-CoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Belouzard, Chu, &amp; Whittaker, 2009</xref>) and MERS-CoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Straus et al., 2020</xref>) spike protein also induce cell-cell fusion in target cells. Therefore, we further explored whether IL-1β could also inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spike-induced cell-cell fusion in ACE2-or Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4)-expressing cells by bioluminescence assay, immunoblotting and a modified <italic>stop-mCherry</italic> fluorescent model, wherein mCherry reporter is only expressed when Cre excises the Stop cassette inside the fused syncytia <bold>(Fig. S9A)</bold>. Similar to SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion, IL-1β also reduced bioluminescence signal <bold>(Fig. S9 B and C)</bold>, S2’ cleavage <bold>(Fig. S9 D and E)</bold> and the number and area of syncytium <bold>(Fig. S9F)</bold>. These data suggested that IL-1β possesses a broad spectrum to inhibit cell-cell fusion induced by different coronaviruses.</p>

MyD88 is the downstream adaptor of IL-1R1.

In addition, we found that IL-1β was unable to reduce bioluminescence signal and S2’ cleavage in the presence of IRAK1/4 inhibitor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).

<p>Intriguingly, when we tested TAK1, a downstream molecule of TRAF6 for the potential involvement in the signaling, it was found that IL-1β still reduced bioluminescence signal and S2’ cleavage in TAK1 knockout (sgMAP3K7) HEK293T cell line <bold>(Fig. S11A)</bold>. Moreover, we found that in the presence of TPCA1, an IKKβ inhibitor, IL-1β still inhibited bioluminescence signal and S2’ cleavage as well <bold>(Fig. S11B)</bold>. Although IL-1β upregulates the mRNA transcription levels of NF-κB pathway-related genes, such as <italic>RELB</italic>, <italic>NFKBIA</italic>, and <italic>NFKB1</italic> <bold>(Fig. S11C)</bold>, IL-1β still reduced the bioluminescence signal after these NF-κB pathway-related genes knockout <bold>(Fig. S11D)</bold>.

<p>Furthermore, we validated these findings in authentic SARS-CoV-2 infected Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells. Consist with the results from HEK293T cells, IL-1β failed to reduce S2’ cleavage and N protein in the presence of IRAK1/4 inhibitor, whereas it still reduced S2’ cleavage and N protein in the presence of the IKKβ inhibitor TPCA1 in Caco-2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>) and Calu-3 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>).</p>

<title>IL-1β inhibits SARS-CoV-2 induced cell-cell fusion through RhoA/ROCK mediated actin bundle formation at the cell-cell junction</title>
<p>It has been reported that IL-1β activates RhoA signaling via MyD88 and IRAK, which is a pathway independent from IKKβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen, Zuraw, Liu, Huang, &amp; Pan, 2002</xref>).

Therefore, we set out to detect the active level of RhoA through pull-down assay.

<p>To investigate whether IL-1β inhibits SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion through RhoA/ROCK pathway, we co-transfected GFP-AHPH in ACE2-expressing cells, then co-cultured with S-expressing cells at different time points. In the process of syncytia formation, cell-cell contact established between S-expressing cells and ACE2-expressing cells, and GFP-AHPH localized distally from cell-cell junction in the early stage of syncytia formation. With the enlargement of syncytium, GFP-AHPH is visualized at the periphery of syncytium <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref><bold>, top panel)</bold>. However, in IL-1β treated group, GFP-AHPH foci is enriched to the cell-cell junction in the early stage. Over time, GFP-AHPH was recruited more to the cell-cell junction between S-expressing cells and ACE2-expressing cells, preventing further cell-cell fusion <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref><bold>, bottom panel)</bold>. Cartoon schematics inserted in the imaging data illustrate such findings in a modeled manner.</p>
<p>ROCK-mediated actin rearrangement is through the downstream substrates, which induces cross-linking of actin bundles with myosin and generate contractile forces along these bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Watanabe, Kato, Fujita, Ishizaki, &amp; Narumiya, 1999</xref>). It has been reported that RhoA initiates actin arc formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dupraz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Stern et al., 2021</xref>), so we further explored the changes of actin cytoskeleton during SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion. Phalloidin staining showed that actin filaments (F-actin) at cell-cell junction between S-expressing cells and ACE2-expressing cells was gradually disappeared along with cell-cell fusion in the early stages of syncytia formation. With the formation and enlargement of syncytium, F-actin of syncytium is preferably distributed peripherally <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref><bold>, top panel)</bold>. However, IL-1β activated RhoA to initiate actin bundles formation at cell-cell junction, the formation of these actin bundles potentially generates barriers and prevents membrane fusion between S-expressing cells and ACE2-expressing cells. Even with the prolonged co-culture time, IL-1β-induced actin bundles formed at cell junctions consistently inhibited further syncytia formation <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref><bold>, bottom panel)</bold>.</p>
<p>Consistent with our previous results, immunofluorescence staining showed GFP-AHPH moving to the opposite of cell-cell junction and locating peripherally with syncytia formation <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref><bold>, top panel)</bold>, while upon IL-1β treatment, GFP-AHPH located at the cell-cell junction of authentic SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and neighboring cells <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref><bold>, bottom panel)</bold>. In parallel, staining results showed that F-actin at the cell-cell junction were disassembled during authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection; with the formation of syncytium, F-actin of syncytium was mainly distributed peripherally <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref><bold>, top panel)</bold>. However, actin bundles formed at cell-cell junction induced by IL-1β inhibited membrane fusion and further syncytia formation <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref><bold>, bottom panel)</bold>. Furthermore, we also observed the same results in authentic SARS-CoV-2 infected Caco-2 cells. F-actin of syncytium in control group was also distributed peripherally, the formation of syncytium promoted the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as N protein was widely distributed in the cytoplasm of the syncytium <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref><bold>, top panel)</bold>. While in IL-1β treated group, actin bundles formed at cell-cell junction between SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and neighboring cells prevented syncytia formation and further viral transmission <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref><bold>, bottom panel)</bold>. Together, these data revealed that IL-1β induced the formation of actin bundles at the cell-cell junction of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and neighboring cells through RhoA/ROCK pathway, which inhibited SARS-CoV-2 induced cell-cell fusion.</p>
<p>To further investigate the role of RhoA/ROCK pathway in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 induced cell-cell fusion, we co-transfected constitutively activated RhoA L63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nobes &amp; Hall, 1999</xref>) (RhoA-CA) plasmid with spike or ACE2 in HEK293T cells, and found that RhoA-CA significantly reduced the bioluminescence signal and S2’ cleavage in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). HEK293T-ACE2 <bold>(Fig. S12A)</bold>, Caco-2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>) and Calu-3 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>) expressing RhoA-CA also significantly reduced S2’ cleavage and N protein compared to the control group during authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Meanwhile, we observed that constitutive activation of RhoA enriches actin bundles at cell-cell junction, thus preventing SARS-CoV-2 induced cell-cell fusion in HEK293T-ACE2 <bold>(Fig. S12B)</bold>, Caco-2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>) and Calu-3 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p>

Indeed, Y-27632 treatment increased bioluminescence signal and S2’ cleavage in a dose-dependent manner, promoting syncytia formation. When treated with lower concentrations of Y-27632, IL-1β can eliminate Y-27632-enhanced cell-cell fusion. However, IL-1β was unable to inhibit cell-cell fusion in the presence of higher concentrations of Y-27632 <bold>(Fig. S12C)</bold>. Immunofluorescence results showed that although IL-1β induced actin bundles inhibited cell-cell fusion <bold>(Fig. S12D, top panel)</bold>, higher concentrations of ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 treatment prevented the formation of IL-1β-induced actin bundles at cell-cell junctions, promoting membrane fusion and cytoplasmic exchange between S-expressing cells and ACE2-expressing cells, which restored syncytia formation <bold>(Fig. S12D, bottom panel)</bold>. Furthermore, we verified that IL-1β was unable to reduce S2’ cleavage and N protein in the presence of Y-27632 in authentic SARS-CoV-2 infected Caco-2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>), Calu-3 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>) and human lung cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). Immunofluorescence results also confirmed that the elimination of IL-1β induced actin bundles by Y-27632 in Caco-2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>) and Calu-3 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>). These results indicated that preventing the formation of RhoA/ROCK mediated actin bundles at cell-cell junction promotes SARS-CoV-2 induced cell-cell fusion.</p>

<p>To further verify the function and mechanism of IL-1β in controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we treated BALB/c mice with PBS, IL-1β or ROCK inhibitor Y-26732 + IL-1β <bold>(Fig. S14A)</bold>, then isolated the lung tissue cells for authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that S2’ cleavage and N protein were significantly reduced in IL-1β treated mice compared to control mice at day 2, while Y-26732 treatment abolished the inhibitory effect of IL-1β on S2’ cleavage and N protein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we explored the functional roles of innate immune factors against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, IL-1β inhibited various SARS-CoV-2 variants and other beta-coronaviruses spike-induced cell-cell fusion. Mechanistically, IL-1β activates and enriches RhoA to the cell-cell junction between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and neighboring cells via the IL-1R-mediated signal to initiate actin bundle formation, preventing cell-cell fusion and viral spreading (<bold>Fig. S16</bold>). These findings revealed a critical antiviral function for pro-inflammatory cytokines to control viral infection.</p>
<p>Elevated IL-1β levels in severe COVID-19 patients is central to innate immune response as it induces the expression of other pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tahtinen et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, IL-1α is also secreted during SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>). Of note, several therapeutic strategies have employed the inhibition of IL-1 signal in an attempt to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Huet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ucciferri et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, although anakinra, a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist, improved clinical outcomes and reduced mortality in severe COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cavalli et al., 2020</xref>), it did not reduce mortality in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients, and even increased the probability of serious adverse events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Tharaux et al., 2021</xref>). With another note, IL-1 blockade significantly decreased the neutralizing activity of serous anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in severe COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Della-Torre et al., 2021</xref>). According to our finding that both IL-1β and IL-1α are able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion, inhibition of IL-1 signaling may have abolished the antiviral function of IL-1, thus failing to restrict virus-induced syncytia formation and transmission.</p>
<p>Notably, IL-1β plays a key role in triggering vaccine-induced innate immunity, suggesting that innate immune responses play important roles in the antiviral defense by enhancing the protective efficacy of vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eisenbarth, Colegio, O’Connor, Sutterwala, &amp; Flavell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tahtinen et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, vaccination with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) has been reported to confer nonspecific protection against heterologous pathogens, including protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in human and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hilligan et al., 2022</xref>; A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rivas et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) in mRNA vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Han et al., 2023</xref>) and penton base in adenovirus vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Di Paolo et al., 2009</xref>) can both activate innate immune cells to amplify the protective effect of vaccines, which may also be attributed to IL-1β-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion on top of adaptive immune responses induced by the vaccines.</p>
<p>With another note, patients with inherited MyD88 or IRAK4 deficiency have been reported to be selectively vulnerable to COVID-19 pneumonia. It was found that these patients’ susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 can be attributed to impaired type I IFN production, which do not sense the virus correctly in the absence of MyD88 or IRAK4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">García-García et al., 2023</xref>). In our study, MyD88 or IRAK4 deficiency abolished the inhibitory effect of IL-1β on SARS-CoV-2 induced cell-cell fusion, suggesting that these innate immune molecules are critical to contain SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this may be another mechanism accounting for the disease of those patients. Moreover, MyD88 signaling was essential for BCG induced innate and type 1 helper T cell (TH1 cell) responses, and protection against SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with our fundings.</p>
<p>Of note, cell-cell fusion is not limited to the process of viral infection, both normal and cancerous cells can utilize this physiological process in tissue regeneration or tumor evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Delespaul et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Powell et al., 2011</xref>). For example, myoblast fusion is the key process of skeletal muscle terminal differentiation, inactivation of RhoA/ROCK signaling is crucial for myoblast fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Nishiyama, Kii, &amp; Kudo, 2004</xref>). Our current work revealed that inhibition of RhoA/ROCK signaling promoted virus-induced cell-cell fusion, possibly due to the virus hijacking of such biological process. In turn, activated RhoA/ROCK signaling inhibits virus-induced cell-cell fusion, so it can be targeted for future therapeutic development to control viral transmission. Cell-cell fusion is mediated by actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, the dissolution of F-actin focus is essential for cell-cell fusion; in contrast, syncytia formation cannot proceed if disassembly of actin filaments or bundles is prevented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Doherty et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Rodríguez-Pérez et al., 2021</xref>). We uncovered that preventing actin bundles dissolution inhibited virus-induced cell-cell fusion, and IL-1β induced RhoA/ROCK signal promotes actin bundle formation at cell-cell junctions. As RhoA is ubiquitously expressed by all cell types, it is currently unclear whether IL-1-mediated RhoA activation is specific towards viral infection-associated cytoskeleton modification, or may regulate other RhoA-related processes, which is a limitation of the current work and remains to be investigated in future.</p>
<p>In summary, this study demonstrated the function and mechanism of IL-1β in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 induced syncytia formation, and highlighted the function of innate immune factors including cytokines against coronaviruses transmission, thus provide potential therapeutic targets for viral control.</p>

<p>All experiments involving authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus <italic>in vitro</italic> were conducted in the biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory of the Shanghai municipal center for disease control and prevention (CDC). The experiments and protocols in this study were approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the Shanghai CDC. Briefly, HEK293T-ACE2 or Caco-2 cells were seeded into 24-well or 96-well plates at a density of 4 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells per mL overnight, then pre-treated cells with different treatments for 1 hour before infected with 0.5 multiplicity of infection (MOI) Delta or WT authentic SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2 and Wuhan-Hu-1) for 24 hours. Calu-3 cells were seeded into 24-well or 96-well plates at a density of 4 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells per mL overnight, infected with 0.5 MOI WT authentic SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour, then washed with PBS before treated cells with different treatments for 24 hours. Brightfield images were captured to indicate the syncytia formation, cell lysates were collected for spike S2’ cleavage and N protein immunoblots.</p>
<p>For mice tissue cells, specific pathogen-free 6-week-old female BALB/c mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and intranasal with PBS, mIL-1β (1 μg/kg) or Y-26732 (1 mg/kg) + mIL-1β (1 μg/kg) at day 0, then mice were Intraperitoneal injection with PBS, mIL-1β (1 μg/kg) or Y-26732 (1 mg/kg) + mIL-1β (1 μg/kg) at day 1 and 2. At day 7, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of Avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol, Sigma-Aldrich), then the thoracic cavity and abdominal cavity of the mice were opened, an outlet was cut in the left ventricle of the mice, and then the right ventricle of the mice was perfused with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) through the pulmonary artery to remove blood cells in the lung. Next, the lung digestive solution with HBSS 1ml, 1 mg/ml collagenase IA, DnaseI (200 mg/ml; Roche), DispaseII (4 U/ml; Gibco) and 5% FBS was injected into the lung cavity; and the intestine digestive solution containing DMEM 10mL, 1 μM DTT, 0.25 μM EDTA and 5% FBS, then peeled off the lung or intestine organs, and digested for 30 min with shaking at 37°C. After digestion, the cells were resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S, subsequently infected cells with 1 MOI authentic SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 or BF.7 for 24 hours. All procedures were conducted in compliance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Shanghai Institute of Immunity and Infection, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>For human lung cells, the human lung tissues were cut into small pieces of about 2mm and washed three times with HBSS solution containing 1% PS, digested with collagenase type I (100 mg+50 mL PBS) in an incubator at 37°C for 4 hours. Then filtered through a 70 μm filter and centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min at room temperature. Lysed with 3 mL Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer for 5min at room temperature, and then centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min at room temperature, washed twice with HBSS solution containing 1% PS. Human lung cells were resuspended in B-ALI Growth Media and seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 4 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells per mL overnight, infected with 0.5 MOI WT authentic SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour, then washed with PBS before treated cells with different treatments for 24 hours. The experiments and protocols were approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the Shanghai CDC.</p>

<title>Authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection of BALB/c mice</title>
<p>Specific pathogen-free 6-week-old female BALB/c mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and intranasal with PBS, mIL-1β (1 μg/kg) or mIL-1RA (150 μg/kg) + mIL-1β (1 μg/kg) for 1 hour, then intranasal challenge with 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> FFU of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351. For booster injection, mice were Intraperitoneal injection with PBS, mIL-1β (1 μg/kg) or mIL-1RA (150 μg/kg) + mIL-1β (1 μg/kg) at 1– and 2-days post infection (dpi). Mice were monitored daily for weight loss. Lungs were removed into trizol or 4% PFA at 4 dpi. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Guangzhou Medical University.</p>

<title>Pulmonary histopathology</title>
<p>Lungs were collected from mice infected by SARS-CoV-2 at 4 dpi and fixed in 4% PFA (Bioss) for 12 hours followed by dehydrating, embedded in paraffin for sectioning, then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), immunohistochemistry (IHC) or immunofluorescence (IF). H&amp;E and IHC analyzed by PerkinElmer Vectra 3, IF analyzed by Olympus SpinSR10 confocal microscope. The pathological scores were judged according to this paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Curtis, Warnock, Arraj, &amp; Kaltreider, 1990</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 infection induces syncytia formation, which promotes viral transmission. In this paper, the authors aimed to understand how host-derived inflammatory cytokines IL-1α/β combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>First, they used a cell-cell fusion assay developed previously to identify IL-1α/β as the cytokines that inhibit syncytia formation. They co-cultured cells expressing the spike protein and cells expressing ACE2 and found that IL-1β treatment decreased syncytia formation and S2' cleavage.</p>
<p>Second, they investigated the IL-1 signaling pathway in detail, using knockouts or pharmacological perturbation to understand the signaling proteins responsible for blocking cell fusion. They found that IL-1 prevents cell-cell fusion through MyD88/IRAK/TRAF6 but not TAK1/IKK/NF-κB, as only knocking out MyD88/IRAK/TRAF6 eliminates the inhibitory effect on cell-cell fusion in response to IL-1β. This revealed that the inhibition of cell fusion did not require a transcriptional response and was mediated by IL-1R proximal signaling effectors.</p>
<p>Third, the authors identified RhoA/ROCK activation by IL-1 as the basis for this inhibition of cell fusion. By visualizing a RhoA biosensor and actin, they found a redistribution of RhoA to the cell periphery and cell-cell junctions after IL-1 stimulation. This triggered the formation of actin bundles at cell-cell junctions, preventing fusion and syncytia formation. The authors confirmed this molecular mechanism by using constitutively active RhoA and an inhibitor of ROCK.</p>
<p>Diverse Cell types and in vivo models were used, and consistent results were shown across diverse models. These results were convincing and well-presented.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As the authors point out in the discussion, whether IL-1-mediated RhoA activation is specific to viral infection or regulates other RhoA-regulated processes is unclear. We would also require high-magnification images of the subcellular organization of the cytoskeleton to appreciate the effect of IL-1 stimulation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Zheng et al investigated the role of inflammatory cytokines in protecting cells against SARS-CoV-2 infection. They demonstrate that soluble factors in the supernatants of TLR-stimulated THP1 cells reduce fusion events between HEK293 cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the ACE2 receptor. Using qRT-PCR and ELISA, they demonstrate that IL-1 cytokines are (not surprisingly) upregulated by TLR treatment in THP1 cells. Further, they convincingly demonstrate that recombinant IL-1 cytokines are sufficient to reduce cell-to-cell fusion mediated by the S protein. Using chemical inhibitors and CRISPR knock-out of key IL-1 receptor signaling components in HEK293 cells, they demonstrate that components of the myddosome (MYD88, IRAK1/4, and TRAF6) are required for fusion inhibition, but that downstream canonical signaling (i.e., TAK1 and NFKB activation) is not required. Instead, they provide evidence that IL-1-dependent non-canonical activation of RhoA/Rock is important for this phenotype. Importantly, the authors demonstrate that expression of a constitutively active RhoA alone is sufficient to inhibit fusion and that chemical inhibition of Rock could reverse this inhibition. The authors followed up these in vitro experiments by examining the effects of IL-1 on SARS-COV-2 infection in vivo and they demonstrate that recombinant IL-1 can reduce viral burden and lung pathogenesis in a mouse model of infection. However, the contribution of the RhoA/Rock pathway and inhibition of fusion to IL-1-mediated control of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo remains unclear.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The bioluminescence cell-cell fusion assay provides a robust quantitative method to examine cytokine effects on viral glycoprotein-mediated fusion.</p>
<p>(2) The study identifies a new mechanism by which IL-1 cytokines can limit virus infection.</p>
<p>(3) The authors tested IL-1 mediated inhibition of fusion induced by many different coronavirus S proteins and several SARS-CoV-2 strains.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The qualitative assay demonstrating S2 cleavage and IL-1 mediated inhibition of this phenotype is extremely variable across the data figures. Sometimes it appears like S2 cleavage (S2') is reduced, while in other figures immunoblots show that total S2 protein is decreased. Based on the proposed model the expectation would be that S2 abundance would be rescued when cleavage is inhibited.</p>
<p>(2) The text referencing Figure 1H suggests that TLR-stimulated THP-1 cell supernatants &quot;significantly&quot; reduce syncytia, but image quantification and statistics are not provided to support this statement.</p>
<p>(3) The authors conclude that because IL-1 accumulates in TLR2-stimulated THP1 monocyte supernatants, this cytokine accounts for the ability of these supernatants to inhibit cell-cell fusion. However, they do not directly test whether IL-1 is required for the phenotype. Inhibition of the IL-1 receptor in supernatant-treated cells would help support their conclusion.</p>
<p>(4) Immunoblot analysis of IL-1 treated HEK293 cells suggests that this cytokine does not reduce the abundance of ACE2 or total S protein in cells. However, it is possible that IL-1 signaling reduces the abundance of these proteins on the cell surface, which would result in a similar inhibition of cell-cell fusion. The authors should confirm that IL-1 treatment of their cells does not change Ace2 or S protein on the cell surface.</p>
<p>(5) In Figure 5A, expression of constitutively active RhoA appears to have profound effects on how ACE2 runs by SDS-PAGE, suggesting that RhoA may have additional effects on ACE2 biology that might account for the decreased cell-cell fusion. This phenotype should be addressed in the text and explored in more detail.</p>
<p>(6) The experiments linking IL-1 mediated restriction of SARS-COV-2 fusion to the control of virus infection in vivo are incomplete. The reported data demonstrate that recombinant IL-1 can restrict virus replication in vivo, but they fall short of confirming that the in vitro mechanism described (reduced fusion) contributes to the control of SARS-CoV2 replication in vivo. A critical piece of data that is missing is the demonstration that the ROCK inhibitor phenocopies IL-1RA treatment of SARS-COV-2 infected mice (viral infection and pathology).</p>
