<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The force developed by actively lengthened muscle depends on different structures across different scales of lengthening. Across short-range perturbations the active response of muscle is well captured by a stiff spring in parallel with a light damper, a response that originates from crossbridges. The force response of muscle to longer stretches is better represented by an compliant spring that can fix its end when activated. Experimental work has made it clear that the stiffness and damping (impedance) of muscle to short-range perturbations is of fundamental importance to motor learning and mechanical stability, while the huge forces developed during long active stretches are critical for simulating and predicting injury. Outside of motor learning and injury, muscle is actively lengthened as a part of nearly all terrestrial locomotion. Despite the functional importance of impedance and active lengthening, no single muscle model can emulate these mechanical properties. In this work, we present the visoelastic-crossbridge active-titin (VEXAT) model that can replicate the response of muscle to length changes great and small. To evaluate the VEXAT model, we compare its response to biological muscle by simulating experiments that measure the impedance of muscle, the forces developed during long active stretches, as well as the classic force-velocity and force-length characteristics of muscle. In addition, we have also compared the responses of the VEXAT model to a popular Hill-type muscle model. The VEXAT model more accurately captures the impedance of biological muscle and its responses to long active stretches than a Hill-type model while still retaining the ability to replicate the force-velocity and force-length properties of muscle. While the comparison between the VEXAT model and biological muscle is favorable, there are some phenomena that can be improved: the phase response of the model to low-frequency perturbations, and a mechanism to support passive force enhancement.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The stiffness and damping of muscle are properties of fundamental importance for motor control, and the accurate simulation of muscle force. The central nervous system (CNS) exploits the activation-dependent stiffness and damping (impedance) of muscle when learning new movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], and when moving in unstable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] or noisy environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Reaching experiments using haptic manipulanda show that the CNS uses co-contraction to increase the stiffness of the arm when perturbed by an unstable force field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. With time and repetition, the force field becomes learned and co-contraction is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>].</p>
<p>The force response of muscle is not uniform, but varies with both the length and time of perturbation. Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] were able to show that muscle behaves like a spring in parallel with a damper for small perturbations: a spring-damper of best fit captured over 90% of the observed variation in muscle force for small perturbations (1-3.8% optimal length) over a wide range of bandwidths (4-90Hz). When active muscle is stretched appreciably, titin can develop enormous forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], which may prevent further lengthening and injury. The stiffness that best captures the response of muscle to the small perturbations of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] is far greater than the stiffness that best captures the response of muscle to large perturbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Since everyday movements are often accompanied by both large and small kinematic perturbations, it is important to accurately capture these two processes.</p>
<p>However, there is likely no single muscle model that can replicate the force response of muscle to short-range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] and long-range perturbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] while also retaining the capability to reproduce the experiments of Hill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] and Gordon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Unfortunately, this means that simulation studies that depend on an accurate representation of muscle impedance may reach conclusions well justified in simulation but not in reality. In this work, we focus on formulating a mechanistic muscle model<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref></sup> that can replicate the force response of active muscle to length perturbations both great and small.</p>
<p>There are predominantly three classes of models that are used to simulate musculoskeletal responses: phenomenological models constructed using Hill’s famous force-velocity relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], mechanistic Huxley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] models in which individual elastic crossbridges are incorporated, and linearized muscle models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] which are accurate for small changes in muscle length. Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] demonstrated that, in the short-range, the force response of muscle is well represented by a spring in parallel with a damper. Neither Hill nor Huxley models are likely to replicate Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] experiments because a Hill muscle model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] does not contain any active spring elements; while a Huxley model lacks an active damping element. Although linearized muscle models can replicate Kirsch et al.’s experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], these models are only accurate for small changes in length and cannot replicate the Hill’s nonlinear force-velocity relation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], nor Gordon et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] nonlinear force-length relation. However, there have been significant improvements to the canonical forms of phenomenological, mechanistic, and linearized muscle models that warrant closer inspection.</p>
<p>Several novel muscle models have been proposed to improve upon the accuracy of Hill-type muscle models during large active stretches. Forcinito et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] modelled the velocity dependence of muscle using a rheological element<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">2</xref></sup> and an elastic rack rather than embedding the force-velocity relationship in equations directly, as is done in a typical Hill model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. This modification allows Forcinito et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] model to more faithfully replicate the force development of active muscle, as compared to a Hill-type model, during ramp length changes of <italic>≈</italic> 10%<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">3</xref></sup> of the optimal CE length, and across velocities of 4 − 11% of the maximum contraction velocity<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">4</xref></sup>. Haeufle et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] made use of a serial-parallel network of spring-dampers to allow their model to reproduce Hill’s force-velocity relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] mechanistically rather than embedding the experimental curve directly in their model. This modification allowed Haeufle et al.’s model to simulate high speed reaching movements that agree more closely with experimental data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] than is possible with a typical Hill model. Gü nther et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] evaluated how accurately a variety of spring-damper models were able to reproduce the microscopic increases in crossbridge force in response to small length changes. While each of these models improves upon the force response of the Hill model to ramp length changes, none are likely to reproduce Kirsch et al.’s experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] because the linearized versions of these models lead to a serial, rather than a parallel, connection of a spring and a damper: Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] specifically showed (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]) that a serial connection of a spring-damper fails to reproduce the phase shift between force and length present in their experimental data.</p>
<p>Titin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] has been more recently investigated to explain how lengthened muscle can develop active force when lengthened both within, and beyond, actin-myosin overlap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Titin is a gigantic multi-segmented protein that spans a half-sarcomere, attaching to the Z-line at one end and the middle of the thick filament at the other end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. In skeletal muscle, the two sections nearest to the Z-line, the proximal immunoglobulin (IgP) segment and the PEVK segment — rich in the amino acids proline (P), glutamate (E), valine (V) and lysine (K) — are the most compliant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] since the distal immunoglobulin (IgD) segments bind strongly to the thick filament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Titin has proven to be a complex filament, varying in composition and geometry between different muscle types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], widely between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], and can apply activation dependent forces to actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. It has proven challenging to determine which interactions dominate between the various segments of titin and the other filaments in a sarcomere. Experimental observations have reported titin-actin interactions at myosin-actin binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], between titin’s PEVK region and actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], between titin’s N2A region and actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], and between the PEVK-IgD regions of titin and myosin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. This large variety of experimental observations has led to a correspondingly large number of proposed hypotheses and models, most of which involve titin interacting with actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], and more recently with myosin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Although the addition of a titin element to a model will result in more accurate force production during large active length changes, a titin element alone does little to affect the stiffness and damping of muscle in the short range because of its relatively low stiffness. A single cross bridge has a stiffness of 0.69 ± 0.47 pN/nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], which is between 22-91 times greater than the average stiffness of a single titin molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] of 0.015 pN/nm from a human soleus muscle<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">5</xref></sup>. Taking into account the variability in observed stiffness of crossbridges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], and myosin filaments, the actin-myosin load path between the Z and M-line will be 54-233 times stiffer than the comparable titin load path assuming that only 25% of the crossbridges are attached [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. If the middle of titin’s PEVK region rigidly attaches to actin then the actin-myosin load path is only 15-68 times stiffer than the titin load path (see Appendix A for further details). Thus it is likely that attached cross-bridges dominate active stiffness of whole muscle in the short-range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Since titin-focused models have not made any changes to the modelled myosin-actin interaction beyond a Hill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] or Huxley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] model, it is unlikely that these models would be able to replicate Kirsch et al.’s experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Although most motor control simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>] make use of the canonical linearized muscle model, phenomenological muscle models have also been used and modified to include stiffness. Sartori et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>] modeled muscle stiffness by evaluating the partial derivative of the force developed by a Hill-type muscle model with respect to the contractile element (CE) length. Although this approach is mathematically correct, the resulting stiffness is heavily influenced by the shape of the force-length curve and can lead to inaccurate results: at the optimal CE length this approach would predict an active muscle stiffness of zero since the slope of the force-length curve is zero; on the descending limb this approach would predict a negative active muscle stiffness since the slope of the force-length curve is negative. In contrast, CE stiffness is large and positive near the optimal length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], and there is no evidence for negative stiffness on the descending limb of the force-length curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Although the stiffness of the CE can be kept positive by shifting the passive force-length curve, which is at times used in finite-element-models of muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>], this introduces a new problem: the resulting passive CE stiffness cannot be lowered to match a more flexible muscle. In contrast, De Groote et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] modeled short-range-stiffness using a stiff spring in parallel with the active force element of a Hill-type muscle model. While the approach of de Groote et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] likely does improve the response of a Hill-type muscle model for small perturbations, there are several drawbacks: the short-range-stiffness of the muscle sharply goes to zero outside of the specified range whereas in reality the stiffness is only reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] (see <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>); the damping of the canonical Hill-model has been left unchanged and likely differs substantially from biological muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>In this work, we propose a model that can capture the force development of muscle to perturbations that vary in size and timescale, and yet is described using only a few states making it well suited for large-scale simulations. The response of the model to all perturbations within actin-myosin overlap is dominated by a viscoelastic crossbridge element that has different dynamics over short and long time-scales: over short time-scales the viscoelasticity of the lumped crossbridge dominates the response of the muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], while over longer time-scales the response of the crossbridges is dominated by the force-velocity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] and force-length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] properties of muscle. To capture the active forces developed by muscle beyond actin-myosin overlap we added an active titin element which, similar to existing models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], features an activation-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">6</xref></sup> interaction between titin and actin. To ensure that the various parts of the model are bounded by reality, we have estimated the physical properties of the viscoelastic crossbridge element as well as the active titin element using data from the literature.</p>
<p>While our main focus is to develop a more accurate muscle model, we would like the model to be well suited to simulating systems that contain tens to hundreds of muscles. Although Huxley models have been used to simulate whole-body movements such as jumping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>], the memory and processing requirements associated with simulating a single muscle with thousands of states is high. Instead of modeling the force development of individual crossbridges, we lump all of the crossbridges in a muscle together so that we have a small number of states to simulate per muscle.</p>
<p>To evaluate the proposed model, we compare simulations of experiments to original data. We examine the response of active muscle to small perturbations over a wide bandwidth by simulating the stochastic perturbation experiments of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Herzog et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] active-lengthening experiments are used to evaluate the response of the model when it is actively lengthened within actin-myosin overlap. Next, we use Leonard et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] active lengthening experiments to see how the model compares to reality when it is actively lengthened beyond actin-myosin overlap. In addition, we examine how well the model can reproduce the force-velocity experiments of Hill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] and force-length experiments of Gordon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Since Hill-type models are so commonly used, we also replicate all of the simulated experiments using Millard et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] Hill-type muscle model to make the differences between these two types of models clear.</p>

<p>We begin by treating whole muscle as a scaled half-sarcomere that is pennated at an angle <italic>α</italic> with respect to a tendon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The assumption that mechanical properties scale with size is commonly used when modeling muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] and makes it possible to model vastly different musculotendon units (MTUs) by simply changing the architectural and contraction properties: the maximum isometric force <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, the optimal CE length <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (at which the CE develops <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>), the pennation angle of the CE with respect to the tendon <italic>α</italic><sub>o</sub> at a CE length of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, the maximum shortening velocity <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> of the CE, and the slack length of the tendon <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Many properties of sarcomeres scale with <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> scales with physiological cross-sectional area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>], the force-length property scales with <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>], the maximum normalized shortening velocity of different CE types scales with <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> across animals great and small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>], and that titin’s passive-force-length properties scale from single molecules to myofibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]</p>

<caption><p>The name of the VEXAT model comes from the viscoelastic crossbridge and active titin elements (A.) in the model. Active tension generated by the lumped crossbridge flows through actin, myosin, and the adjacent sarcomeres to the attached tendon (B.). Titin is modeled as two springs of length <italic>ℓ</italic><sup>1</sup> and <italic>ℓ</italic><sup>2</sup> in series with the rigid segments L<sup>T12</sup> and L<sup>IgD</sup>. Viscous forces act between the titin and actin in proportion to the activation of the muscle (C.), which reduces to negligible values in a purely passive muscle (D.).

<p>The proposed model has several additional properties that we assume to scale with <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and inversely with <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>: the maximum active isometric stiffness <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and damping <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, the passive forces due to the extracellular matrix (ECM), and passive forces due to titin. As crossbridge stiffness is well studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>], we assume that muscle stiffness due to crossbridges scales such that
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="534347v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is the maximum normalized stiffness. This scaling is just what would be expected when many crossbridges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>] act in parallel across the cross-sectional area of the muscle, and act in series along the length of the muscle. Although the intrinsic damping properties of crossbridges are not well studied, we assume that the linear increase in damping with activation observed by Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] is due to the intrinsic damping properties of individual crossbridges which will also scale linearly with <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and inversely with <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="534347v2_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline18.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is the maximum normalized damping. For the remainder of the paper, we refer to the proposed model as the VEXAT model due to the viscoelastic (VE) cross-bridge (X) and active-titin (AT) elements of the model.</p>
<p>To reduce the number of states needed to simulate the VEXAT model, we lump all of the attached crossbridges together to a single lumped crossbridge that attaches at <italic>ℓ</italic><sup>S</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) and has intrinsic stiffness and damping properties that vary with the activation and force-length properties of muscle. The active force developed by the XE at the attachment point to actin is transmitted to the main myosin filament, the M-line, and ultimately to the tendon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In addition, since the stiffness of actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>] and myosin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>] greatly exceeds that of crossbridges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], we treat actin and myosin filaments as rigid to reduce the number of states needed to simulate this model. Similarly, we have lumped the six titin filaments per half-sarcomere (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) together further reduce the number of states needed to simulate this model.</p>
<p>The addition of a titin filament to the model introduces an additional active load-path (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) and an additional passive load-path (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). As is typical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], we assume that the passive elasticity of these structures scale linearly with <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline19.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and inversely with <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline20.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Since the VEXAT model has two passive load paths (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), we further assume that the proportion of the passive force due to the extra-cellular-matrix (ECM) and titin does not follow a scale dependent pattern, but varies from muscle-to-muscle as observed by Prado et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>].</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, there are currently several competing theories to explain how titin interacts with the other filaments in activated muscle but no definitive data to support one theory over another. While there is evidence for titin-actin interaction near titin’s N2A region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], there is also support for a titin-actin interaction occurring near titin’s PEVK region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], and for a titin-myosin interaction near the PEVK-IgD region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. For the purposes of our model, we will assume a titin-actin interaction because current evidence weighs more heavily towards a titin-actin interaction than a titin-myosin interaction. Next, we assume that the titin-actin interaction takes place somewhere in the PEVK segment for two reasons: first, there is evidence for a titin-actin interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] in the PEVK segment; and second, there is evidence supporting an interaction at the proximal end of the PEVK segment (N2A-actin interaction) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. We have left the point within the PEVK segment that attaches to actin as a free variable since there is some uncertainty about what part of the PEVK segment interacts with actin.</p>
<p>The nature of the mechanical interaction between titin and the other filaments in an active sarcomere remains uncertain. Here we assume that this interaction is not a rigid attachment, but instead is an activation dependent damping to be consistent with Kellermayer et al.’s observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]: adding titin filaments and calcium slowed, but did not stop, the progression of actin filaments across an plate covered in active crossbridges (an in-vitro motility array). When activated, we assume that the amount of damping between the titin and actin scales linearly with <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline21.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and inversely with <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline22.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>After lumping all of the crossbridges and titin filaments together we are left with a rigid-tendon MTUmodel that has two generalized positions
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="534347v2_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>

</disp-formula>
is the difference between the half-sarcomere length and the sum of the average point of attachment <italic>ℓ</italic><sup>S</sup> and the length of the myosin filament L<sup>M</sup>. The length of <italic>ℓ</italic><sup>2</sup>, the lumped PEVK-IgD segment, is
<disp-formula id="eqn10">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="534347v2_eqn10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
the difference between the half-sarcomere length and the sum of the length from the Z-line to the actin binding site on titin (<italic>ℓ</italic><sup>1</sup>) and the length of the IgD segment that is bound to myosin (L<sup>IgD</sup>). Finally, the length of the extra-cellular-matrix <italic>ℓ</italic><sup>ECM</sup> is simply

</disp-formula>
half the length of the CE since we are modeling a half-sarcomere.</p>
<p>We have some freedom to choose the state vector of the model and the differential equations that define how the muscle responds to length and activation changes. The experiments we hope to replicate depend on phenomena that take place at different time-scales: Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] stochastic perturbations evolve over short time-scales, while all of the other experiments take place at much longer time-scales. Here we mathematically decouple phenomena that affect short and long time-scales by making a second-order model that has states of the average point of crossbridge attachment <italic>ℓ</italic><sup>S</sup>, and velocity <italic>v</italic><sup>S</sup>. When the activation <italic>a</italic> state and the titin-actin interaction model are included, the resulting rigid-tendon model that has a total of four states

five states. For the purpose of comparison, a Hill-type muscle model with a rigid-tendon has a single state (<italic>a</italic>), while an elastic-tendon model has two states (<italic>a</italic> and <italic>ℓ</italic><sup>M</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>

<caption><p>The passive force-length curve has been decomposed such that 56% of it comes from the ECM while 44% comes from titin to match the average of ECM-titin passive force distribution (which ranges from 43%-76%) reported by Prado [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] (A.). The elasticity of the titin segment has been further decomposed into two serially connected sections: the proximal section consisting of the T12, proximal IgP segment and part of the PEVK segment, and the distal section consisting of the remaining PEVK section and the distal Ig segment (B.). The stiffness of the IgP and PEVK segments has been chosen so that the model can reproduce the movements of IgP/PEVK and PEVK/IgD boundaries that Trombitás et al.

<p>The passive force developed by the CE in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn15">Eqn. 15</xref> is the sum of the elastic forces (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) developed by the force-length curves of titin <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline51.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline52.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and the ECM <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline53.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. We model titin’s elasticity as being due to two serially connected elastic segments: the first elastic segment <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline54.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is formed by lumping together the IgP segment and a fraction Q of the PEVK segment, while the second elastic segment <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline55.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is formed by lumping together the remaining (1 − Q) of the PEVK segment with the free IgD section. Our preliminary simulations of Herzog and Leonard’s active lengthening experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] indicate that a Q value of a half, positioning the PEVK-actin attachment point that is near the middle of the PEVK segment, allows the model to develop sufficient tension when actively lengthened. The large section of the IgD segment that is bound to myosin is treated as rigid.</p>
<p>The curves that form <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline56.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline57.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> have been carefully constructed to satisfy three experimental observations: that the total passive force-length curve of titin and the ECM match the observed passive force-length curve of the muscle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]; that the proportion of the passive force developed by titin and the ECM is within experimental observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>); and that the IgP and PEVK sections show the same relative elongation as observed by Trombitás et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Since both the passive–force-length relation and Trombitás et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] data is at modest lengths, we also consider two different extensions to the force-length relation to simulate extreme lengths: first, a simple linear extrapolation; second, we extend the force-length relation of each of titin’s segments to follow the worm-like-chain (WLC) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. For details, please see Appendix B.3.</p>
<p>When activated, we assume that some point of the PEVK segment bonds with actin through an activation-dependent damper, and that this bond forms within a specific range of CE lengths. Hisey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>] observed that active lengthening produces no residual force enhancement (RFE) on the ascending limb. In the VEXAT model, the distal segment of titin, <italic>ℓ</italic><sup>2</sup>, can contribute to RFE when the titin-actin bond is formed and CE is lengthened beyond <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline58.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, the length at which passive force begins to develop. To incorporate Hisey et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>] observed RFE length dependence, we introduce a smooth step function
<disp-formula id="eqn17">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="534347v2_eqn17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
that transitions from zero to one as <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline59.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> extends beyond <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline60.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. The sharpness of the transition of <italic>u</italic><sup>S</sup> between zero and one is controlled by R. At very long CE lengths, the modeled titin-actin bond can literally slip off of the end of the actin filament (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) when the distance between the Z-line and the bond, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline61.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, exceeds the length of the actin filament, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline62.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. To break the titin-actin bond at long CE lengths we introduce another smooth step function
<disp-formula id="eqn18">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="534347v2_eqn18.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
The strength of the titin-actin bond also appears to vary nonlinearly with activation. Fukutani and Herzog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>] observed that the absolute RFE magnitude produced by actively lengthened fibers is similar between normal and reduced contractile force states. Since these experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>] were performed beyond the optimal CE length, titin could be contributing to the observed RFE as previously described. The consistent pattern of absolute RFE values observed by Fukutani and Herzog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>] could be produced if the titin-actin bond saturated at its maximum strength even at a reduced contractile force state. To saturate the titin-actin bond, we use a final smooth step function
<disp-formula id="eqn19">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="534347v2_eqn19.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where A<sub>°</sub> is the threshold activation level at which the bond saturates. While we model the strength of the titin-actin bond as being a function of activation, which is proportional Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>], this is a mathematical convenience. The work of Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] makes it clear that both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cross-bridge cycling are needed to allow titin to develop enhanced forces during active lengthening: no enhanced forces are observed in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> when cross-bridge cycling is chemically inhibited. Putting this all together, the active damping acting between the titin and actin filaments is given by the product of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline63.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline64.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is the maximum damping coefficient.</p>
<p>With a model of the titin-actin bond derived, we can model how the bond location moves in response to applied forces. Since we are ignoring the mass of the titin filament, the PEVK-attachment point is balanced by the forces applied to it and the viscous forces developed between titin and actin

<p>The assumption of whether the tendon is rigid or elastic affects how the state derivative is evaluated and how expensive it is to compute. While all of the position dependent quantities can be evaluated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn6">Eqns. 6</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">11</xref> and the generalized positions, evaluating the generalized velocities of a rigid-tendon and elastic-tendon model differ substantially.

<p>Evaluating the CE rate of lengthening, <italic>v</italic><sup>M</sup>, for an elastic tendon muscle model is more involved. As is typical of lumped parameter muscle models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], here we assume that difference in tension, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline66.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, between the CE and the tendon

</disp-formula>
is negligible<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10">10</xref></sup>. During our preliminary simulations it became clear that treating the tendon as an idealized spring degraded the ability of the model to replicate the experiment of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] particularly at high frequencies. Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] observed a linear increase in the gain and phase profile between the output force and the input perturbation applied to the muscle. This pattern in gain and phase shift can be accurately reproduced by a spring in parallel with a damper. Due to the way that impedances combine in series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>], the models of both the CE and the tendon need to have parallel spring and damper elements so that the entire MTU, when linearized, appears to be a spring in parallel with a damping element. We model tendon force using a nonlinear spring and damper model
<disp-formula id="eqn23">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="534347v2_eqn23.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where the damping coefficient <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline67.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, is a linear scaling of the normalized tendon stiffness <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline68.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> by <italic>U</italic>, a constant scaling coefficient. We have chosen this specific damping model because it fits the data of Netti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>] and captures the structural coupling between tendon stiffness and damping (see Appendix B.1 and <xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15</xref> for further details).

Fortunately, there is enough experimental data in the literature that default values for these new parameters can be evaluated and normalized using the architectural properties of the muscle (Appendix B). These default values have been derived from experiments on cats and rabbits: assuming that musculotendon dynamics look similar when normalized, these default values should be reasonable first approximations for a wide variety of mammals and muscles.</p>

<title>Biological Benchmark Simulations</title>
<p>In order to evaluate the model, we have selected three experiments that capture the responses of active muscle to small, medium, and large length changes. The short-range (1-3.8% <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline79.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>) stochastic perturbation experiment of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] demonstrates that the impedance of muscle is well described by a stiff spring in parallel with a damper, and that the spring-damper coefficients vary linearly with active force. The active impedance of muscle is such a fundamental part of motor learning that the amount of impedance, as indicated by co-contraction, is used to define how much learning has actually taken place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]: co-contraction is high during initial learning, but decreases over time as a task becomes familiar. The active lengthening experiment of Herzog and Leonard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] shows that modestly stretched (7-21% <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline80.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>) biological muscle has positive stiffness even on the descending limb of the active force-length curve <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline81.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. In contrast, a conventional Hill model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] can have negative stiffness on the descending limb of the active-force-length curve, a property that is both mechanically unstable and unrealistic. The final active lengthening experiment of Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] unequivocally demonstrates that the CE continues to develop active forces during extreme lengthening <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline82.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> which exceeds actin-myosin overlap. Active force development beyond actin-myosin overlap is made possible by titin, and its activation dependent interaction with actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. The biological benchmark simulations conclude with a replication of the force-velocity experiments of Hill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] and the forcelength experiments of Gordon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Unless otherwise noted, all simulations are performed using the same model parameters.</p>

<title>Stochastic Length Perturbation Experiments</title>
<p>In Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] in-situ experiment, the force response of a cat’s soleus muscle under constant stimulation was measured as its length was changed by small amounts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] applied stochastic length perturbations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) to elicit force responses from the muscle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>) across a broad range of frequencies (4-90 Hz) and across a range of small length perturbations <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline83.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Next, they applied system identification methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>] to extract curves that defined how the gain and phase shift (between the output force of the muscle and the input length) varied as a function of frequency (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>

Astonishingly, Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] demonstrated that a spring-damper of best fit has a VAF of between 88-99% when compared to the experimentally measured forces <italic>f</italic><sup><italic>EXP</italic></sup>. By repeating this experiment over a variety of stimulation levels (using both electrical stimulation and the crossed-extension reflex) Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] showed that these stiffness and damping coefficients vary linearly with the active force developed by the muscle. Further, Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] repeated the experiment using perturbations that had a variety of lengths (0.4 mm, 0.8mm, and 1.6mm) and bandwidths (15Hz, 35Hz, and 90Hz) and observed a peculiar quality of muscle: the damping coefficient of best fit increases as the bandwidth of the perturbation decreases (See <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] for details). Here we simulate Kirsch et al.’s experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] to determine, first, the VAF of the VEXAT model and the Hill model in comparison to a spring-damper of best fit; second, to compare the gain and phase response of the models to biological muscle; and finally, to see if the spring-damper coefficients of best fit for both models increase with active force in a manner that is similar to the cat soleus that Kirsch et al. studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>To simulate the experiments of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] we begin by creating the 9 stochastic perturbation waveforms used in the experiment that vary in perturbation amplitude (0.4mm, 0.8mm, and 1.6mm) and bandwidth (0-15 Hz, 0-35 Hz, and 0-90 Hz)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11">11</xref></sup>. The waveform is created using a vector that is composed of random numbers with a range of [−1, 1] that begins and ends with a series of zero-valued padding points. Next, a forward pass of a 2<sup>nd</sup> order Butterworth filter is applied to the waveform and finally the signal is scaled to the appropriate amplitude (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The muscle model is then activated until it develops a constant tension at a length of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline84.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. The musculotendon unit is then simulated as the length is varied using the previously constructed waveforms while activation is held constant. To see how impedance varies with active force, we repeated these simulations at ten evenly spaced tensions from 2.5N to 11.5N. Ninety simulations are required to evaluate the nine different perturbation waveforms at each of the ten tension levels. The time-domain length perturbations and force responses of the modelled muscles are used to evaluate the gain and phase responses of the models in the frequency-domain (See Appendix D for details). Note that the frequency resolution of our simulations are finer than the Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] data since we can use all 6.15 seconds of the simulated data (2048 samples at 333 Hz), while Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] were restricted to analyzing smaller time windows during the experiment (also 2048 samples at 333 Hz) in which the average output of the muscle could be considered constant.</p>

While the VEXAT model has a gain profile in the frequency-domain that closer to Kirch et al.’s data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] than the Hill model (compare <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">H</xref>), both models have a greater phase shift than Kirch et al.’s data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] (compare <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">I</xref>). The gain response of the VEXAT model follows Kirsch et al.’s data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] closely, while the gain response of the Hill model has widely scattered coefficients due to the nonlinearity of the model’s response to even small perturbations (compare <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">K</xref>). The phase response of the VEXAT model to the 90 Hz perturbation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>) shows the consequences of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref>: at low frequencies the phase response of the VEXAT model is similar to that of the Hill model, while at higher frequencies the model’s response becomes similar to a spring-damper. This frequency dependent response is a consequence of the first term in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref>: the value of <italic>τ</italic><sup>S</sup> causes the response of the model to be similar to a Hill model at lower frequencies and mimic a spring-damper at higher frequencies. Both models show the same perturbation-dependent phase-response, as the damping coefficient of best fit increases as the perturbation bandwidth decreases: compare the damping coefficient of best fit for the 15Hz and 90Hz profiles for the VEXAT model (listed on <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>. and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">D</xref>.) and the Hill model (listed on <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>. and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">H</xref>., respectively).</p>

The response of the VEXAT model to the 90 Hz perturbations is much better: a VAF of 91% is reached in the time-domain (D.), the gain response follows the response of the cat soleus analyzed by Kirsch et al.

Although the Hill’s time-domain response to the 15 Hz signal has a higher VAF than the VEXAT model (G.), the RMSE of the Hill model’s gain response (H.) and phase response (I.) shows it to be more in error than the VEXAT model. While the VEXAT model’s response improved in response to the 90 Hz perturbation, the Hill model’s response does not: the VAF of the time-domain response remains low (J.), neither the gain (K.) nor phase responses (L.) follow the data of Kirsch et al.

<p>The closeness of each model’s response to the spring-damper of best fit changes when a rigid tendon is used instead of an elastic tendon. While the VEXAT model’s response to the 15 Hz and 90 Hz perturbations improve slightly (compare to <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-F</xref> to <xref rid="fig18" ref-type="fig">Fig. 18A-F</xref>), the response of the Hill model to the 15 Hz perturbation changes dramatically with the time-domain VAF rising from 51% to 81%. Although the Hill model’s VAF in response to the 15 Hz perturbation improved, the frequency response contains mixed results: the rigid-tendon Hill model’s gain response is better (<xref rid="fig18" ref-type="fig">Fig. 18H</xref>), while the phase response is worse in comparison to the elastic-tendon Hill model. While the rigid-tendon Hill model produces a better time-domain response to the 15 Hz perturbation than the elastic-tendon Hill model, this improvement has been made by using amounts of damping that exceeds that of biological muscle as indicated by Kirsch et al.’s analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>The gain and phase profiles of both models contain coefficients that do not follow a clear line, but instead are scattered. This scattering of coefficients occurs when the underlying plant being analyzed is nonlinear, even when subject to small perturbations. Much of the VEXAT model’s nonlinearities in this experiment come from the tendon tendon model (compare to <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-F</xref> to <xref rid="fig18" ref-type="fig">Fig. 18A-F</xref>), since the response of the VEXAT model with a rigid tendon is less scattered. The Hill model’s nonlinearities originate from the underlying expressions for stiffness and damping of the Hill model. The stiffness of a Hill model’s CE

is heavily influenced by the partial derivative of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline85.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> which has a region of negative stiffness. Although <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline86.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is well approximated as being linear for small length changes, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline87.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> changes sign across <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline88.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.

<p>By repeating the stochastic perturbation experiments across a range of isometric forces, Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] were able to show that the stiffness and damping of a muscle varies linearly with the active tension it develops (see <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref> of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]). We have repeated our simulations of Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] experiments at ten nominal forces (spaced evenly between 2.5N and 11.5 N) and compared how the VEXAT model and the Hill model’s stiffness and damping coefficients compare to <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref> of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). The VEXAT model develops stiffness and damping similar to Kirsch et al.’s data when coupled with either a viscoelastic tendon (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A &amp; B</xref>) or a rigid tendon (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C &amp; D</xref>), and with a high VAF. In contrast, when the Hill model is coupled with an elastic tendon, its damping is notably larger than Kirsch et al.’s data as is the model’s stiffness at the higher tensions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). This pattern changes when simulating a Hill model with a rigid tendon: the model’s stiffness is now half of Kirsch et al.’s data (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>), while the model’s final damping coefficient is nearly three times the value measured by Kirsch et al. (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). The tendon model also affects the VAF of the Hill model to a large degree: the elastic-tendon Hill model has a low VAF 31%-44% (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A &amp; B</xref>) while the rigid-tendon Hill model has a much higher VAF of 79%. While the VEXAT model’s stiffness and damping increases linearly with activation, consistent with Kirsch et al.’s data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], the stiffness and damping of the Hill model differs from Kirsch et al.’s data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], ranging from small amounts of error (rigid-tendon model developing low tensions shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C &amp; D</xref>) to large amounts of error (elastic-tendon model under high tension shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A &amp; B</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>When coupled with an elastic tendon, the stiffness (A.) and damping (B.) coefficients of best fit of both the VEXAT model and a Hill model increase with the tension developed by the MTU.

When coupled with rigid tendon the stiffness (C.) and damping (D.) coefficients of the VEXAT model remain similar, as the values for <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline253.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline254.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> have been chosen to take the tendon model into account. In contrast, the stiffness and damping coefficients of the rigid-tendon Hill model differ dramatically from the stiffness and damping coefficients of the elastic-tendon Hill model: while the elastic tendon Hill model is too stiff and damped, the rigid tendon Hill model is not stiff enough (compare A. to C.) and far too damped (compare B. to D.). Coupling the Hill model with a rigid tendon rather than an elastic tendon does have an unexpected benefit: the VAF increased from the 31%-44% range shown in A. and B. to 79% shown in C. and D. Although the Hill model’s response more closely resembles a spring-damper when coupled with a rigid tendon, the spring and damper coefficients fail to fit Kirsch et al.’s data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p></caption>

<p>When the VAF of the VEXAT and Hill model is evaluated across a range of tensions (ranging from 2.5-11.5N), frequencies (15 Hz, 35 Hz, and 90 Hz), amplitudes (0.4mm, 0.8mm, and 1.6mm), and tendon types (rigid and elastic) two things are clear: first, that the VAF of 80-100% of the VEXAT model is closer to the range of 88-99% reported by Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] than the range of 32-91% of the Hill model (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>); and second, that there are systematic variations in VAF, stiffness, and damping across the different perturbation magnitudes and frequencies as shown in <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Tables 4</xref> and <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">5</xref> (Appendix E). While the VAF of the VEXAT model is similar whether a rigid or elastic tendon is used across all frequencies (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A, B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">C</xref>), the Hill model’s VAF noticeably varies with tendon type: in the lower frequency range (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">B</xref>) the elastic-tendon Hill model has a far lower VAF than a rigid-tendon Hill model; while in the highest frequency range the VAF of the Hill model (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>) is not as affected by the elasticity of the tendon. While the VEXAT model’s lowest VAF occurs in response to the low frequency perturbations (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>), the Hill model’s lowest VAF varies with both tendon type and frequency: the rigid-tendon Hill model has its lowest VAF in response to high frequency perturbations (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>) while the elastictendon Hill model has its lowest VAF in response to the low frequency perturbations (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). It is unclear if biological muscle displays systematic shifts in VAF since Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] did not report the VAF of each trial, instead indicating that a spring-damper of best-fit displayed a VAF of 88-99% across all trials and specimens.</p>

We have repeated the perturbation experiments to evaluate the VAF across a range of conditions: two different tendon models, three perturbation bandwidths (15 Hz, 35 Hz, and 90 Hz), three perturbation magnitudes (0.4 mm, 0.8 mm and 1.6 mm), and ten nominal force values (spaced evenly between 2.5N and 11.5N). Each bar in the plot shows the mean VAF across all ten nominal force values, with the whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum value that occurred in each set.

Where the tendon model affects the VAF of the VEXAT model slightly, the tendon model causes the VAF of the Hill model to vary by nearly 60% depending on the condition: at the 15 Hz (A.) and 35 Hz (B.) the Hill model’s response is dramatically affected by the tendon model, while at the 90 Hz (C.) the tendon model does not exert such a large influence.</p></caption>

<title>Active lengthening on the descending limb</title>
<p>We now turn our attention to the active lengthening in-situ experiments of Herzog and Leonard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. During these experiments a cat soleus was actively lengthened by modest amounts <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline90.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> starting on the descending limb of the active-force-length curve <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline91.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). This starting point was chosen specifically because the stiffness of a Hill model may actually change sign and become negative because of the influence of the active-force-length curve on <italic>k</italic><sup>M</sup> as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn26">Eqn. 26</xref> as <italic>ℓ</italic><sup>M</sup> extends beyond <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline92.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Herzog and Leonard’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] experiment is important for showing that biological muscle does not exhibit negative stiffness on the descending limb of the active-force-length curve. In addition, this experiment also highlights the slow recovery of the muscle’s force after stretching has ceased, and the phenomena of passive force enhancement after stimulation is removed. Here we will examine the 9 mm/s ramp experiment in detail because the simulations of the 3 mm/s and 27 mm/s ramp experiments produces similar stereotypical patterns – see Appendix F for details.</p>
<p>When Herzog and Leonard’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] active ramp-lengthening (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>) experiment is simulated, both models produce a force transient initially (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>), but for different reasons. The VEXAT model’s transient is created when the lumped crossbridge spring (the <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline93.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> term in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn15">Eqn. 15</xref>) is stretched. In contrast, the Hill model’s transient is produced, not by spring forces, but by damping produced by the force-velocity curve as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn26">Eqn. 26</xref>.</p>
<fig id="fig10" position="float" fig-type="figure">

After the initial transient at 2.4s the Hill model’s output force drops (B.) because of the small region of negative stiffness (C.) created by the force-length curve.

</fig>
<p>After the initial force transient, the response of the two models diverges (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>): the VEXAT model continues to develop increased tension as it is lengthened, while the Hill model’s tension drops before recovering. The VEXAT model’s continued increase in force is due to the titin model: when activated, a section of titin’s PEVK region remains approximately fixed to the actin element (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). As a result, the <italic>ℓ</italic><sup>2</sup> element (composed of part of PEVK segment and the distal Ig segment) continues to stretch and generates higher forces than it would if the muscle were being passively stretched. While both the elastic and rigid tendon versions of the VEXAT model produce the same stereotypical ramp-lengthening response (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>), the musculotendon unit develops slightly more tension using a rigid tendon because the strain of the musculotendon unit is soley borne by the CE.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Hill model develops less force during lengthening when it enters a small region of negative stiffness (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">C</xref>) because the passive-force-length curve is too compliant to compensate for the negative slope of the active force-length curve. Similarly, the damping coefficient of the Hill model drops substantially during lengthening (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10D</xref>). <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn26">Equation 26</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> shows the reason that damping drops during lengthening: <italic>d</italic> <bold>f</bold> <sup>V</sup><italic>/dv</italic><sup>M</sup>, the slope of the line in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, is quite large when the muscle is isometric and becomes quite small as the rate of lengthening increases.</p>
<p>After the ramp stretch is completed (at time 3.4 seconds in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>), the tension developed by the cat soleus recovers slowly, following a profile that looks strikingly like a first-order decay. The large damping coefficient acting between the titin-actin bond slows the force recovery of the VEXAT model. We have tuned the value of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline94.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline95.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> for the elastic tendon model, and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline96.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> for the rigid tendon model, to match the rate of force decay of the cat soleus in Herzog and Leonard’s data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. The Hill model, in contrast, recovers to its isometric value quite rapidly. Since the Hill model’s force enhancement during lengthening is a function of the rate of lengthening, when the lengthening ceases, so too does the force enhancement.</p>
<p>Once activation is allowed to return to zero, Herzog and Leonard’s data shows that the cat soleus continues to develop a tension that is Δ<italic>f</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub> above passive levels (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref> for <italic>t &gt;</italic> 8.5<italic>s</italic>). The force Δ<italic>f</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub> is known as passive force enhancement, and is suspected to be caused by titin binding to actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. Since we model titin-actin forces using an activation-dependent damper, when activation goes to zero our titin model becomes unbound from actin. As such, both our model and a Hill model remain Δ<italic>f</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub> below the experimental data of Herzog and Leonard (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>) after lengthening and activation have ceased.</p>

<title>Active lengthening beyond actin-myosin overlap</title>
<p>One of the great challenges that remains is to decompose how much tension is developed by titin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) separately from myosin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) in an active sarcomere. Leonard et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] active-lengthening experiment provides some insight into this force distribution problem because they recorded active forces both within and far beyond actinmyosin overlap. Leonard et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] data shows that active force continues to develop linearly during lengthening, beyond actin-myosin overlap, until mechanical failure. When activated and lengthened, the myofibrils failed at a length of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline97.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and force of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline98.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, on average. In contrast, during passive lengthening myofibrils failed at a much shorter length of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline99.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> with a dramatically lower tension of of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline100.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. To show that the extraordinary forces beyond actin-myosin overlap can be ascribed to titin, Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] repeated the experiment but deleted titin using trypsin: the titin-deleted myofibrils failed at short lengths and insignificant stresses. Using the titin model of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn20">Eqn. 20</xref> as an interpretive lens (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), the huge forces developed during active lengthening would be created when titin is bound to actin leaving the distal segment of titin to take up all of the strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Conversely, our titin model would produce lower forces during passive lengthening because the proximal Ig, PEVK, and distal Ig regions would all be lengthening together (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>Since Leonard et al.’s experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] was performed on skinned rabbit myofibrils and not on whole muscle, both the VEXAT and Hill models had to be adjusted prior to simulation. To simulate a rabbit myofibril we created a force-length curve consistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>] with the actin filament lengths of rabbit skeletal muscle (1.12<italic>µ</italic>m actin, 1.63<italic>µ</italic>m myosin, and 0.07<italic>µ</italic>m z-line width [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]), set the dimensions of titin to be consistent with Prado et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] measurements (50 proximal Ig domains, 800 PEVK residues, and 22 distal Ig domains), used a rigid tendon of zero length, and set the pennation angle to zero. Since the evaluation of the model is done using normalized lengths and forces, we did not scale the lengths and forces of the model to reflect length and maximum tension of the fibrils tested by Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>As mentioned in Sec. 2, because this experiment includes extreme lengths, we consider two different force-length relations for each segment of titin (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11A</xref>): a linear extrapolation, and an extension that follows the WLC model. While both versions of the titin model are identical up to <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline101.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, beyond <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline102.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> the WLC model continues to develop larger and larger forces until all of the Ig domains and PEVK residues have been unfolded (see Appendix B.3 for details) and the segments of titin reach a physical singularity: at this point the Ig domains and PEVK residues cannot be elongated any further without breaking molecular bonds. Finally, our preliminary simulations indicated that the linear titin model’s titin-actin bond was not strong enough to support large tensions, and so we scaled the value of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline103.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> used to simulate an entire cat soleus by a factor of ten.</p>

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] observed that active myofibrils continue to develop increasing amounts of tension beyond actin-myosin overlap (B, grey lines with ±1 standard deviation shown). When this experiment is replicated using the VEXAT model (B., blue &amp; magenta lines) and a Hill model (C. red lines), only the VEXAT model with the linear extrapolated titin model is able to replicate the experiment with the titin-actin bond slipping off of the actin filament at <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline256.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.</p></caption>

<p>The Hill model was similarly modified, with the pennation angle set to zero and coupled with a rigid tendon of zero length. Since the Hill model lacks an ECM element the passive-force-length curve was instead fitted to match the passive forces produced in Leonard et al.’s data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. No adjustments were made to the active elements of the Hill model.</p>
<p>When the slow active stretch (0.1<italic>µm</italic>/sarcomere/s) of Leonard et al.’s experiment is simulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] only the VEXAT model with the linear titin element can match the experimental data of Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11B</xref>). The Hill model cannot produce active force for lengths greater than <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline103a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> since the active force-length curve goes to zero (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) and the model lacks any element capable of producing force beyond this length. In contrast, the linear titin model continues to develop active force until a length of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline103b.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is reached, at which point the titin-actin bond is pulled off the end of the actin filament and the active force is reduced to its passive value.</p>
<p>The WLC titin model is not able to reach the extreme lengths observed by Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. The distal segment of the WLC titin model approaches its contour length early in the simulation and ensures that the the titin-actin bond is dragged off the end of the actin filament at <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline104.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11B</xref>). After <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline105.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11B</xref>), the tension of the WLC titin model drops to its passive value but continues to increase until the contour lengths of all of the segments of titin are reached at <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline106.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Comparing the response of the linear model to the WLC titin model two things are clear: the linear titin model more faithfully follows the data of Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], but does so with titin segment lengths that exceed the maximum contour length expected for the isoform of titin in a rabbit myofibril.</p>
<p>This simulation has also uncovered a surprising fact: the myofibrils in Leonard et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] experiments do not fail at <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline107.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, as would be expected by the WLC model of titin, but instead reach much greater lengths (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Physically, it may be possible for a rabbit myofibril to reach these lengths (without exceeding the contour lengths of the proximal Ig, PEVK, and distal Ig segments) if the bond between the distal segment of titin and myosin breaks down. This would allow the large Ig segment, that is normally bound to myosin, to uncoil and continue to develop the forces observed by Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Unfortunately the precise mechanism which allowed the samples in Leonard et al.’s experiments to develop tension beyond titin’s contour length remains unknown.</p>

<title>Force-length and force-velocity</title>
<p>Although the active portion of the Hill model is embedded in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref>, it is not clear if the VEXAT model can still replicate Hill’s force-velocity experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] and Gordon et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] force-length experiments. Here we simulate both of these experiments using the cat soleus model that we have used for the simulations described in Sec. 3.1 and compare the results to the force-length and force-velocity curves that are used in the Hill model and in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref> of the VEXAT model.</p>
<p>Hill’s force-velocity experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] is simulated by activating the model, and then by changing its length to follow a shortening ramp and a lengthening ramp. During shortening experiments, the CE shortens from <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline108.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline109.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> with the measurement of active muscle force is made at <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline110.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Lengthening experiments are similarly made by measuring muscle force mid-way through a ramp stretch that begins at <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline111.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and ends at <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline112.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. When an elastic tendon model is used, we carefully evaluate initial and terminal path lengths to accommodate for the stretch of the tendon so that the CE still shortens from <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline113.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline114.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and lengthens from <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline115.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline116.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>The VEXAT model produces forces that differ slightly from the <bold>f</bold> <sup>V</sup> that is embedded in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref> while the Hill model reproduces the curve (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>).

While the force-velocity curves between the two models are similar, the time-domain force response of the two models differs substantially (B.).

<p>Gordon et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] force-length experiments were simulated by first passively lengthening the CE, and next by measuring the active force developed by the CE at a series of fixed lengths. Prior to activation, the passive CE was simulated for a short period of time in a passive state to reduce any history effects due to the active titin element. To be consistent with Gordon et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] experiment, we subtracted off the passive force from the active force before producing the active-force-length profile.</p>
<p>The simulation of Gordon et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] experiment shows that the VEXAT model (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13A</xref>, blue dots) produces a force-length profile that is shifted to the right of the Hill model (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13A</xref>, red line) due to the series elasticity introduced by the XE. We can solve for the size of this right-wards shift by noting that <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref> will drive the <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline119.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> to a length such that the isometric force developed by the XE is equal to that of the embedded Hill model

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A muscle model is defined by the experiments it can replicate and the mechanisms it embodies. We have developed the VEXAT muscle model to replicate the force response of muscle to a wide variety of perturbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] while also retaining the ability to reproduce Hill’s force-velocity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] experiment and Gordon et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] force-length experiments. The model we have developed uses two mechanisms to capture the force response of muscle over a large variety of time and length scales: first, a viscoelastic crossbridge model that over short time-scales appears as a spring-damper, and at longer time-scales mimics a Hill-model; second, a titin element that is capable of developing active force during large stretches.</p>
<p>The viscoelastic crossbridge and titin elements we have developed introduce a number of assumptions into the model. While there is evidence that the activation-dependent stiffness of muscle originates primarily from the stiffness of the attached crossbridges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], the origins of the activation-dependent damping observed by Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] have not yet been established. We assumed that, since the damping observed by Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] varies linearly with activation, the damping originates from the attached crossbridges. Whether this damping is intrinsic or is due to some other factor remains to be established. Next, we have also assumed that the force developed by the XE converges to a Hill model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] given enough time (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref>). A recent experiment of Tomalka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>] suggests the force developed by the XE might decrease during lengthening rather than increasing as is typical of a Hill model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. If Tomalka et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>] observations can be replicated, the VEXAT model will need to be adjusted so that the the XE element develops less force during active lengthening while the active-titin element develops more force. Finally, we have assumed that actin-myosin sliding acceleration (due to crossbridge cycling) occurs when there is a force imbalance between the external force applied to the XE and the internal force developed by the XE as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref>. This assumption is a departure from previous models: Hill-type models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] assume that the tension applied to the muscle instantaneously affects the actin-myosin sliding velocity; Huxley models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] assume that the actin-myosin sliding velocity directly affects the rate of attachment and detachment of crossbridges.</p>
<p>The active titin model that we have developed assumes that some part of the PEVK segment interacts with actin through an activation dependent damping force: the nature of this interaction is not clear, and many different mechanisms have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. The active damping element we have proposed is similar to Rode et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] sticky-spring model, but instead acts at a single location within the PEVK segment like the model of Schappacher-Tilp et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. What distinguishes our titin model is that it requires only a single state and its curves have been carefully constructed to satisfy three constraints: that the passive force-length curve of the ECM and titin together can be fit to measurements, ratio of the ECM to titin is within the range measured by Prado et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>], and the relative strains of the proximal Ig and PEVK sections are consistent with Trombitás et al.’s measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>].</p>
<p>The model we have proposed can replicate phenomena that occur at a wide variety of time and length scales: Kirsch et al.’s experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] which occur over small time and length scales; the active lengthening experiments of Herzog and Leonard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] and Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] which occur over physiological to supra-physiological length scales. In contrast, we have shown in Sec. 3.1 to 3.3 that a Hill-type model compares poorly to biological muscle when the same set of experiments are simulated. We expect that a Huxley model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] is also likely to have difficulty reproducing Kirsch et al.’s experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] because the model lacks an active damping element. Since titin was discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] long after Huxley’s model was proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], a Huxley model will be unable to replicate any experiment that is strongly influenced by titin such as Leonard et al.’s experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Although there have been several more recent muscle model formulations proposed, none have the properties to simultaneously reproduce the experiments of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], Herzog and Leonard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], Hill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], and Gordon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Linearized impedance models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] can reproduce Kirsch et al.’s experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], these models lack the nonlinear components needed to reproduce Gordon et al.’s force-length curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and Hill’s force-velocity curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. The models of Forcinito et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], Haeufle et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], Gü nther et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], and Tahir et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] all have a structure that places a damping element in series with a spring: Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] explicitly demonstrated that this type of model fails to reproduce the gain and phase response of biological muscle. De Groote et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] introduced a short-range-stiffness element in parallel to a Hill model to capture the stiffness of biological muscle. While De Groote et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] formulation improves upon a Hill model it is unlikely to reproduce Kirsch et al.’s experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] because we have shown in Sec. 3.1 that a Hill model has a frequency response that differs from biological muscle. Rode et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] muscle model also uses a Hill model for the CE and so we expect that this model will have the same difficulties reproducing Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] experiment. Schappacher-Tilp et al.’s model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] extends a Huxley model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] by adding a detailed titin element. Similar to a Huxley model, Schappacher-Tilp et al.’s model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] will likely have difficulty reproducing Kirsch et al.’s experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] because it is missing an active damping element.</p>
<p>While developing this model, we have come across open questions that we hope can be addressed in the future. How do muscle stiffness and damping change across the force-length curve? Does stiffness and damping change with velocity? What are the physical origins of the active damping observed by Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]? What are the conditions that affect passive-force enhancement, and its release? In addition to pursuing these questions, we hope that other researchers continue to contribute experiments that are amenable to simulation, and to develop musculotendon models that overcome the limitations of our model. To help others build upon our work, we have made the source code of the model and all simulations presented in this paper available online<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12">12</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>The stiffness of the actin-myosin and titin load paths</title>
<p>A single half-myosin can connect to the surrounding six actin filaments through nearly 100 crossbridges. A 0.800 <italic>µ</italic>m half-myosin has a pair crossbridges over 0.700<italic>µ</italic>m of its length every 14.3 nm which amounts to 97.9 per half-myosin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]. Assuming a duty cycle of 25% (values between 5-90% have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]), at full actin-myosin overlap there will be 24.5 attached crossbridges with a total stiffness of 5.4 − 28.4 pN/nm (24.5 <italic>×</italic> 0.69 ± 0.47 pN/nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]).</p>
<p>At full overlap, the Z-line is 1 actin filament length L <sup>A</sup> (1.27 <italic>µ</italic>m in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]) from the M-line and the average point of crossbridge attachment is in the middle of the half-myosin at a distance of 0.45 <italic>µm</italic> from the M-line (0.1<italic>µm</italic> is bare and 0.35<italic>µm</italic> is half of the remaining length), which is L <sup>A</sup> − 0.45 <italic>µ</italic>m from the Z-line. A single actin filament has a stiffness of 46-68 pN/nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Since stiffness scales inversely with length, the section between the Z-line and the average attachment point has a stiffness of 83.6-123 pN/nm. Assuming that load is evenly distributed, each actin filament contributes a third of its stiffness to each of the three half-sarcomeres that it borders. Since there are six actin filaments surrounding each myosin filament the total stiffness of the actin filaments for a half-sarcomere comes to 167-246 pN/nm. Myosin has a similar stiffness as a single actin filament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>], with the section between the average attachment point and the M-line having a stiffness of 81.8-121 pN/nm. The final active stiffness of half-sarcomere comes from the series connection of actin, 24.5 crossbridges, and myosin is 4.9-21.0 pN/nm.</p>
<p>The stiffness of the actin-myosin load path is between 54-233 times stiffer than the average stiffness of 0.09 nN/nm generated by the six free titin filaments from skeletal muscle (each with an average stiffness of 0.015 pN/nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]) that span each half-sarcomere. The stiffness of titin in skeletal muscle can change dramatically during activation. If we assume that the middle of the PEVK segment is rigidly fixed to actin during activation, the stiffness of each titin filament is 3.4 times higher since only half the PEVK region and the distal Ig segment is free to stretch. Despite this large increase in stiffness, the actin-myosin load path remains 15-68 times stiffer than the titin load path.</p>

<title>Model Fitting</title>
<p>Many of the experiments simulated in this work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] have been performed using a cat soleus muscle. While we have been able to extract some architectural parameters directly from the experiments we simulate (<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline122.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline123.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]), we have had to rely on the literature mentioned in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for the remaining parameters. The remaining properties of the model can be solved by first building a viscoelastic damping model of the tendon; next, by solving for the intrinsic stiffness and damping properties of the CE; and finally, by fitting the passive curves <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline124.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline125.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> to simultaneously fit the passive force-length curve recorded by Herzog and Leonard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], using a mixture of tension from titin and the ECM that is consistent with Prado et al.’s data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>], all while maintaining the geometric relationship between <bold>f</bold> <sup>IgP</sup> and <bold>f</bold> <sup>PEVK</sup> as measured by Trombitás et al.

<title>Fitting the tendon’s stiffness and damping</title>
<p>Similar to previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], we model the force-length relation of the tendon using a quintic Bézier spline (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15A</xref>) that begins at <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline126.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (where <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline127.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is tendon length normalized by <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline128.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline129.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is tension normalized by <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline130.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>), ends at <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline131.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> with a normalized stiffness of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline132.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and uses the constants <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline133.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline134.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (given <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline135.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> from Scott and Loeb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>], <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline136.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is thus 4.58%). Using the experimental data of Netti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>] we have also constructed a curve to evaluate the damping coefficient of the tendon. The normalized tendon stiffness (termed storage modulus by Netti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]) and normalized tendon damping (termed loss modulus by Netti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]) both have a similar shape as the tendon is stretched from slack to <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline136a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">C</xref>).

<p>The nonlinear characteristics (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15</xref>) tendon originates from its microscopic structure. Tendon is composed of many fiber bundles with differing resting lengths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. Initially the tendon’s fiber bundles begin crimped, but gradually stretch as the tendon lengthens, until finally all fiber bundles are stretched and the tendon achieves its maximum stiffness (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15B</xref>) and damping (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. Accordingly, in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn23">Eqn. 23</xref> we have described the normalized damping of the tendon as being equal to the normalized stiffness of the tendon scaled by a constant <italic>U</italic>. To estimate <italic>U</italic> we have used the measurements of Netti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>] (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15 B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">C</xref>) and solved a least-squares problem

to arrive at a value of <italic>U</italic> = 0.057. The resulting damping model (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15C</xref>) fits the measurements of Netti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>] closely.</p>

<title>Fitting the CE’s Impedance</title>
<p>We can now calculate the normalized impedance of the XE using the viscoelastic tendon model we have constructed and Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] measurements of the impedance of the entire MTU. Since an MTUis structured with a CE in series with a tendon, the compliance of the MTUis given by

where <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline137.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is the stiffness of the CE in the direction of the tendon. We can calculate <italic>k</italic><sup>M</sup> directly by fitting a line to the stiffness vs tension plot that appears in <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref> of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] (0.8mm, 0-35 Hz perturbation) and resulting in <italic>k</italic><sup>M</sup> =2.47 N/mm at a nominal force of 5N. Here we use a nominal tension of 5N so that we can later compare our model to the 5N frequency response reported in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Since Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] did not report the architectural properties of the experimental specimens, we assume that the architectural properties of the cat used in Kirsch et al.’s experiments are similar to the properties listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. We evaluate the stiffness of the tendon model by stretching it until it develops the nominal tension of Kirsch et al.’s <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> data (5N), and then compute its derivative which amounts to <italic>k</italic><sup>T</sup> =16.9 N/mm. Finally, using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn31">Eqn. 31</xref> we can solve for a value of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline138.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.

<disp-formula id="eqn32">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="534347v2_eqn32.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>

we can use a similar procedure to evaluate <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline139.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, the damping of the CE along the tendon.

<p>The nonlinear force-length curves used to describe titin (<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline147.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline148.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> in series), and the ECM <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline149.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> must satisfy three conditions: the total force-length curve produced by the sum of the ECM and titin must match the observed passive-force-length relation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]; the proportion of titin’s contribution relative to the ECM must be within measured bounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]; and finally the stiffness of the <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline150.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> must be a linear scaling of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline151.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> to match the observations of Trombitás et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>].</p>
<p>First, we fit the passive force-length curve to the data of Herzog and Leonard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] to serve as a reference. The curve <bold>f</bold> <sup>PE</sup> begins at the normalized length and force coordinates of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline152.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> with a slope of 0, ends at <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline153.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> with a slope of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline154.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and is linearly extrapolated outside of this region.</p>
<p>We solve for the <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline154a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline154b.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> such that

</disp-formula>
the squared differences between <bold>f</bold> <sup>PE</sup> and the passive force-length data of Herzog and Leonard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> shows both the data and the fitted <bold>f</bold> <sup>PE</sup> curve) are minimized. While <bold>f</bold> <sup>PE</sup> is not used directly in the model, it serves as a useful reference for constructing the ECM and titin force-length curves. We assume that the ECM force-length curve is a linear scaling of <bold>f</bold> <sup>PE</sup>
<disp-formula id="eqn47">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="534347v2_eqn47.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where P is a constant. In this work, we set P to 56% which is the average ECM contribution that Prado et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] measured across 5 different rabbit skeletal muscles<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13">13</xref></sup>. The remaining fraction, 1 − P, of the force-length curve comes from titin.</p>
<p>In mammalian skeletal muscle, titin has three elastic segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] connected in series: the proximal Ig segment, the PEVK segment, and the distal Ig segment that is between the PEVK region and the myosin filament (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Trombitás et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] labelled the PEVK region of titin with antibodies allowing them to measure the distance between the Z-line and the proximal Ig/PEVK boundary (<sup>Z</sup><italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>IgP/PEVK</sup>), and the distance between the Z-line and the PEVK/distal Ig boundary (<sup>Z</sup><italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>PEVK/IgD</sup>), while the passive sarcomere was stretched from 2.35 − 4.46<italic>µm</italic>. By fitting functions to Trombitás et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] data we can predict the length of any of titin’s segments under the following assumptions: the T12 segment is rigid (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), the distal Ig segment that overlaps with myosin is rigid (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), and that during passive stretching the tension throughout the titin filament is uniform. Since the sarcomeres in Trombitás et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] experiments were passively stretched it is reasonable to assume that tension throughout the free part of the titin filament is uniform because the bond between titin and actin depends on calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] and crossbridge attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>We begin by digitizing the data of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> of Trombitás et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] and using the least-squares method to fit lines to <sup>Z</sup><italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>IgP/PEVK</sup> and <sup>Z</sup><italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>PEVK/IgD</sup> (where the superscripts mean <sup>from</sup><italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>to</sup> and so <sup>Z</sup><italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>IgP/PEVK</sup> is the distance from the Z-line to the border of the IgP/PEVK segments). From these lines of best fit we can evaluate the normalized length of the proximal Ig segment

These coefficients have been extracted from data of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> of Trombitás et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] using a least-squares fit. Since <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> of Trombitás et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] plots the change in segment length of a single titin filament against the change in length of the entire sarcomere, the resulting slopes are in length normalized units. The slopes sum to 0.5, by construction, to reflect the fact that these three segments of titin stretch at half the rate of the entire sacromere (assuming symmetry). The cat soleus titin segment coefficients have been formed using a simple scaling of the human soleus titin segment coefficients, and so, are similar. Rabbit psoas titin geometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] differs drammatically from human soleus titin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] and produce a correspondingly large difference in the coefficients that describe the length of the segments of rabbit psoas titin.</p></caption>

<p>These functions can be scaled to fit a titin filament of a differing geometry. Many of the experiments simulated in this work used a cat soleus. Although the lengths of the segments in a cat soleus titin filament have not been measured, we assume that it is a scaled version of a human soleus titin filament (68 proximal Ig domains, 2174 PEVK residues, and 22 distal Ig domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]) since both muscles contain predominately slow-twich fibers: slow twitch fibers tend to express longer, more compliant titin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Since the optimal sarcomere length in cat skeletal muscle is shorter than in human skeletal muscle (2.43 <italic>µ</italic>m vs. 2.73 <italic>µ</italic>m, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]) the coefficients for <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn51">Eqns. 51</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn53">53</xref> differ slightly (see the feline soleus column in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In addition, by assuming that the titin filament of cat skeletal muscle is a scaled version of the titin filament found in human skeletal muscle, we have implicitly assumed that the cat’s skeletal muscle titin filament has 60.5 proximal Ig domains, 1934.7 PEVK residues, and 19.6 distal Ig domains. Although a fraction of a domain does not make physical sense, we have not rounded to the nearest domain and residue to preserve the sarcomere length-based scaling.</p>
<p>In contrast, the rabbit psoas fibril used in the simulation of Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] has a known titin geometry (50 proximal Ig domains, 800 PEVK residues, and 22 distal Ig domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]) which differs substantially from the isoform of titin expressed in the human soleus. To create the rabbit psoas titin length functions <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline156.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline157.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> we begin by scaling the human soleus PEVK length function <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline158.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> by the relative proportion of PEVK residues of 800/2174. The length of the two Ig segments
<disp-formula id="eqn54">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="534347v2_eqn54.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
is what remains from the half-sarcomere once the rigid lengths of titin (0.100 <italic>µ</italic>m for L<sup>T12</sup> and 0.8150 <italic>µ</italic>m for L<sup>IgD</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]) and the PEVK segment length have been subtracted away.

</disp-formula>
which produce the coefficients that appear in the rabbit psoas column in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. While we have applied this approach to extend Trombitás et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] results to a rabbit psoas, in principle this approach can be applied to any isoform of titin provided that its geometry is known, and the Ig domains and PEVK residues in the target titin behave similarly to those in human soleus titin.</p>
<p>The only detail that remains is to establish the shape of the IgP, PEVK, and IgD force-length curves. Studies of individual titin filaments, and of its segments, make it clear that titin is mechanically complex. For example, the tandem Ig segments (the IgD and IgP segments) are composed of many folded domains (titin from human soleus has two Ig segments that together have nearly 100 domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]). Each domain appears to be a simple nonlinear spring until it unfolds and elongates by nearly 25 nm in the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>]. Unfolding events appear to happen individually during lengthening experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>], with each unfolding event occurring at a slightly greater tension than the last, giving an Ig segment a force-length curve that is saw-toothed. Although detailed models of titin exist that can simulate the folding and unfolding of individual Ig domains, this level of detail comes at a cost of a state for each Ig domain which can add up to nearly a hundred extra states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] in total.</p>
<p>Active and passive lengthening experiments at the sarcomerelevel hide the complexity that is apparent when studying individual titin filaments. The experiments of Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] show that the sarcomeres in a filament (from rabbit psoas) mechanically fail when stretched passively to an average length of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline162.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> but can reach <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline163.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> when actively lengthened. Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] showed that titin was the filament bearing these large forces since the sarcomeres were incapable of developing active or passive tension when the experiment was repeated after the titin filaments were chemically cut. It is worth noting that the forces measured by Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] contain none of the complex saw-tooth pattern indicative of unfolding events even though 72 of these events would occur as each proximal and distal Ig domain fully unfolded and reached its maximal length<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14">14</xref></sup>. Although we cannot be sure how many unfolding events occurred during Leonard et al.’s experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], due to sarcomere non-homogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>], it is likely that many Ig unfolding events occurred since the average sarcomere length at failure <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline164.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> was longer than the maximum length of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline165.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> that would be predicted from the geometry of rabbit psoas titin<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Since we are interested in a computationally efficient model that is accurate at the whole muscle level, we model titin as a multi-segmented nonlinear spring but omit the states needed to simulate the folding and unfolding of Ig domains. Simulations of active lengthening using our titin model will exhibit the enhanced force development that appears in experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], but will lack the nonlinear saw-tooth force-length profile that is measured when individual titin filaments are lengthened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>]. To have the broadest possible application, we will fit titin’s force-length curves to provide reasonable results for both moderate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] and large active stretches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Depending on the application, it may be more appropriate to use a stiffer force-length curve for the Ig segment if normalized sarcomere lengths stays within <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline166.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and no unfolding events occur as was done by Trombitás et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Unfortunately, we cannot accurately capture the force development of the Ig segments at both short and long lengths without introducing many extra states to the model so that Ig domain unfolding and folding events can be simulated.</p>

Similarly, the <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline188.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> curve is made by shifting and scaling the (1 − P)<bold>f</bold> <sup>PE</sup> curve to develop a normalized tension of (1 − P) and a stiffness of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline189.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> at a length of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline190.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>By construction, the spring network formed by the <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline191.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline192.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> curves follows the fitted <bold>f</bold> <sup>PE</sup> curve (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) such that the ECM curve makes up 56% of the contribution. When the CE is active and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline193.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is effectively fixed in place, the distal segment of titin contributes higher forces since <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline194.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> undergoes higher strains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Finally, when the experiment of Trombitás et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] are simulated the movements of the IgP/PEVK and PEVK/IgD boundaries in the titin model closely follow the data (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>The process we have used to fit the ECM and titin’s segments makes use of data within modest normalized CE lengths (2.35-4.46<italic>µ</italic>m, or <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline195.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]). Scenarios in which the CE reaches extremely long lengths, such as during injury or during Leonard et al.’s experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], require fitting titin’s force-length curve beyond the typical ranges observed in-vivo. The WLC model has been used successfully to model the force-length relation of individual titin segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>] at extreme lengths. In this work, we consider two different extensions to <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline196.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline197.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>: a linear extrapolation, and the WLC model. Since the fitted <bold>f</bold> <sup>PE</sup> curve is linearly extrapolated, so too are the <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline198.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline199.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> curves by default. Applying the WLC to our titin curves requires a bit more effort.</p>
<p>We have modified the WLC to include a slack length <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline200.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> so that the WLC model can made to be continuous with the various force-length relations we have already derived. The normalized force developed by our WLC model is given by
<disp-formula id="eqn69">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="534347v2_eqn69.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where B is a scaling factor and the normalized segment length <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline201.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is defined as
<disp-formula id="eqn70">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="534347v2_eqn70.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline202.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is the slack length, and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline202a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is the contour length of the segment. To extend the <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline203.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> curve to follow the WLC model, we first note the normalized contour length of the <italic>ℓ</italic><sup>1</sup> segment
<disp-formula id="eqn71">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="534347v2_eqn71.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
by counting the number of proximal Ig domains (N<sup>IgP</sup>), the number of PEVK residues (QN<sup>PEVK</sup>) associated with <italic>ℓ</italic><sup>1</sup> and by scaling each by the maximum contour length of each Ig domain (25nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>]), and each PEVK residue (between 0.32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>] and 0.38 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>] see pg. 254). This contour length defines the maximum length of the segment, when all of the Ig domains and PEVK residues have been unfolded. Similarly, the contour length of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline204.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is given by
<disp-formula id="eqn72">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="534347v2_eqn72.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
Next, we define the slack length by linearly extrapolating backwards from the final fitted force (1 − P)
<disp-formula id="eqn73">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="534347v2_eqn73.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>

and similarly
<disp-formula id="eqn74">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="534347v2_eqn74.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
We can now solve for B in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn69">Eqn. 69</xref> so that <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline205.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline206.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> are continuous with each respective WLC extrapolation. However, we do not use the WLC model directly because it contains a numerical singularity which is problematic during numerical simulation. Instead, we add an additional Bézier segment to fit the WLC extension that spans between forces of (1 − P) and twice the normalized failure force <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline207.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> noted by Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. To fit the shape of the final Bézier segment, we adjust the locations of the internal control points to minimize the squared differences between the modified WLC model and the final Bézier curve (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11A</xref>). The final result is a set of curves <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline208.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v2_inline209.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> which, between forces 0 and (1 − P), will reproduce <bold>f</bold> <sup>PE</sup>, Trombitás et al.’s measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], and do so with a reasonable titin-ECM balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. For forces beyond (1 − P), the curve will follow the segment-specific WLC model up to twice the expected failure tension noted by Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>

The dimensionless titin parameters can be scaled to fit other MTUs provided these values are similar: P, A <sup>IgP</sup>, A <sup>PEVK</sup>, A <sup>IgD</sup>, and Q. The assumption that these parameters remain similar across different MTUs, even within the same animal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>], is crude at best. Prado et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] showed that P can vary between 43%-76% across different skeletal muscles of the same rabbit. In addition, Prado et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] also found that the overall stiffness of titin can vary by a factor of approximately 3.4 (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]) and weakly correlates with the fiber type of the myofibril: fast twitch fibers tend to express a shorter (stiffer) titin, while slow twitch fibers tend to express a longer more compliant titin. As data on P is challenging to obtain, and the variation of P is large, we have chosen to use the average value of P reported by Prado et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Since most of our simulated tests are applied to slow-twitch muscles, we have fit the stiffness of titin’s segments to the data of Trombitás et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] which comes from human soleus muscle, which is often dominated by slow twitch fibers.</p>

<p>Physically this assumption is equivalent to treating the CE and the tendon as massless.

Since everyday movements require comparatively tiny accelerations, ignoring inertial forces of muscle results in relatively small errors.</p>

<p>Muscle models are important tools in the fields of biomechanics and physiology. Muscle models serve a wide variety of functions, including validating existing theories, testing new hypotheses, and predicting forces produced by humans and animals in health and disease. This paper attempts to provide an alternative to Hill-type muscle models that includes contributions of titin to force enhancement over multiple time scales. Due to the significant limitations of Hill-type models, alternative models are needed and therefore the work is important and timely.</p>
<p>The effort to include a role for titin in muscle models is a major strength of the methods and results. The results clearly demonstrate the weaknesses of Hill models and the advantages of incorporating titin into theoretical treatments of muscle mechanics. Another strength is to address muscle mechanics over a large range of time scales. Weaknesses include the decision to use a MTU model to simulate experiments from single muscle fibers, and failure to systematically address the limitations of the model, including equations for activation dynamics with no length dependence. It would also be useful for readers if the authors provided a discussion of the types of data that can be simulated using the model, along with potential pitfalls and how to determine model parameters.</p>
<p>The authors succeed in demonstrating the need to incorporate titin in muscle models. However, it remains unclear whether it will be practical for others to use this particular model for different types of data. Several ad hoc modifications were described in the paper, and the degree to which the model requires parameter optimization for different muscles, preparations and experiment types is also unclear.</p>

<p>This model of skeletal muscle includes springs and dampers which aim to capture the effect of crossbridge and titin stiffness during the stretch of active muscle. While both crossbridge and titin stiffness have previously been incorporated, in some form, into models, this model is the first to simultaneously include both. The authors suggest that this will allow for the prediction of muscle force in response to short-, mid- and long-range stretches. All these types of stretch are likely to be experienced by muscle during in vivo perturbations, and are known to elicit different muscle responses. Hence, it is valuable to have a single model which can predict muscle force under all these physiologically relevant conditions. In addition, this model dramatically simplifies sarcomere structure to enable this muscle model to be used in multi-muscle simulations of whole-body movement.</p>
<p>In order to test this model, its force predictions are compared to 3 sets of experimental data which focus on short-, mid- and long-range perturbations, and to the predictions of a Hill-type muscle model. The choice of data sets is excellent and provide a robust test of the model's ability to predict forces over a range of length perturbations. However, I find the comparison to a Hill-type muscle model to be somewhat limiting. It is well established that Hill-type models do not have any mechanism by which they can predict the effect of active muscle stretch. Hence, that the model proposed here represents an improvement over such a model is not a surprise. Many other models, some of which are also simple enough to be incorporated into whole-body simulations, have incorporated mechanistic elements which allow for the prediction of force responses to muscle stretch. It is not clear from the results presented here that this model would outperform such models.</p>
<p>The paper begins by outlining the phenomenological vs mechanistic approaches taken to muscle modelling, historically. It appears, although is not directly specified, that this model combines these approaches. A somewhat mechanistic model of the response of the crossbridges and titin to active stretch is combined with a phenomenological implementation of force-length and force-velocity relationships. This combination of approaches may be useful in improving the accuracy of predictions of muscle models and whole-body simulations, which is certainly a worthy goal. However, it also may limit the insight that can be gained. For example, it does not seem that this model could reflect any effect of active titin properties on muscle shortening. In addition, it is not clear to me, either physiologically or in the model, what drives the shift from the high stiffness in short-range perturbations to the somewhat lower stiffness in mid-range perturbations.</p>
