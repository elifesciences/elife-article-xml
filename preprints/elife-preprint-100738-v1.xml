<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The nucleosome serves as the fundamental unit of chromatin organization, with electrostatic interactions acting as the driving forces in the folding of nucleosomes into chromatin. Perturbations in cellular pH conditions can lead to changes in the protonation states of titratable histone residues, impacting nucleosome surface electrostatic potentials and interactions. However, the effects of proton uptake or release of histone ionizable groups on nucleosome-partner protein interactions and higher-order chromatin structures remain largely unexplored. Here, we conducted comprehensive analyses of histone titratable residue pKa values in various nucleosome contexts, utilizing 96 experimentally determined structures. We revealed that pH-induced changes in histone residue protonation states modulated nucleosome surface electrostatic potentials and significantly influenced nucleosome-partner protein interactions. Furthermore, we observed that proton uptake or release often accompanied nucleosome-partner protein interactions, facilitating their binding processes. Additionally, using a dataset of 1266 recurrent histone cancer mutations, we systematically characterized their impact on nucleosome surface electrostatics, demonstrating their profound effects on electrostatic interactions between nucleosomes and partner proteins. Finally, our findings suggest that alterations in histone protonation or cancer mutations can also regulate nucleosome self-association, thereby modulating the organization and dynamics of higher-order chromatin structure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In eukaryotic cells, the nucleosome serves as the fundamental unit of chromatin, playing a crucial role in packaging and organizing DNA within the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The nucleosome core particle (NCP) consists of approximately 146-148 base pairs of DNA molecules wrapped around a histone octamer, which comprises two copies of each of the four histone proteins: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The compaction of nucleosomes into higher-order structures involves the stacking of nucleosomes on top of each other, facilitated by the flexible linker DNA between nucleosomes and the bridging of tails between adjacent NCPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Given the polyelectrolyte nature of nucleosome and linker DNA, electrostatic interactions are inherently the driving forces in the folding of arrays of nucleosomes into chromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>DNA is one of the most highly charged polymers in cells, generating a strong negative electrostatic field. To compact DNA, the electrostatic self-repulsion between DNA molecules needs to be overcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, the association of the DNA around the positively-charged histone octamer would help the electrostatic screening of negative charges on the DNA backbones. It has long been assumed that formation of nucleosome structure results in completely electrostatic screening of the DNA and a weak electrostatic field surrounding the nucleosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. However, recent studies have experimentally shown that despite the attenuation of charges in the complexation of the DNA into the nucleosome, nucleosome still maintains a strong, negative electrostatic field and it is important to consider the essential roles of polyelectrolyte nature of the NCPs in nucleosome compaction and interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Experimental evidence has demonstrated that the protonation states of titratable histone residues near the acidic patch can change within the physiological pH range, thereby affecting the nucleosome surface electrostatic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Biologically relevant fluctuations in intracellular pH can significantly impact the stability of nucleosome structures by altering the protonation states of titratable groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. However, it is still not well understood whether and how such changes in nucleosome electrostatics could modulate the nucleosome-nucleosome interactions and higher-order nucleosome structures.</p>
<p>The formation of protein complexes often entails changes in pKa values and protonation states of ionizable groups, driven by direct electrostatic interactions, structural rearrangements of receptors, and desolvation of the groups involved protein binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Nucleosomes interact with a plethora of chromatin factors, including chromatin-modifying enzymes, chromatin remodelers, and transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Given the polyelectrolyte nature of nucleosomes, it is reasonable to expect that the binding of proteins to nucleosomes frequently involves the proton uptake or release of ionizable groups. However, the underlying mechanisms of proton uptake or release in histone interactions and their effects on nucleosome-chromatin factor interactions were largely understudied.</p>
<p>Numerous recent studies have underscored the essential roles of histone mutations in the oncogenic development of various cancer types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and histone cancer mutations have profound effects on nucleosome dynamics, interactions, and higher-order chromatin structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Our recent computational analysis has further indicated that histone cancer mutations are enriched on histone binding interfaces and have strongly disruptive effects on histone-histone, histone-DNA, and histone-partner protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. These mutations can dramatically alter the physicochemical properties of the histone binding interface, suppressing both positive and negative net charges on the surface of the histone octamer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. These alterations may further affect nucleosome surface electrostatics and long-range electrostatic interactions, potentially leading to profound effects on nucleosome-partner protein interactions and higher-order chromatin structures.</p>
<p>Here, we conducted a systematic analysis of the pKa values of histone titratable residues in free dimers, nucleosomes, and nucleosome complex structures using a diverse array of experimentally determined structures. Through structural analyses and electrostatic calculations, we discovered that alterations in protonation states of key histone residues can occur due to perturbations in pH near cellular physiological conditions, resulting in significant effects on nucleosome surface electrostatic potentials and nucleosome-partner protein interactions. Additionally, through molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations, we demonstrated that the binding of regulatory proteins to nucleosomes was coupled with proton uptake or release of histone titratable residues, generally promoting nucleosome-partner protein interactions. Furthermore, we systematically characterized the impact of histone cancer mutations on nucleosome surface electrostatics, revealing profound effects on the strengths and directions of electrostatic forces between nucleosome and partner proteins. Finally, we explored the effects of changes in histone residue protonation and cancer mutations on nucleosome stacking and H4 tail-acidic patch interactions. Our results suggest that alterations in histone protonation or cancer mutations may not only impact individual nucleosomes but also influence nucleosome self-association and higher-order nucleosome structure, thereby contributing to the overall organization and dynamics of chromatin structure.</p>

<title>Collection of nucleosome complex structures</title>
<p>To analyze the electrostatic interactions between nucleosome and various regulatory proteins, we collected all available nucleosome complex structures from RCSB PDB bank<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, a total of 234 nucleosome structures up to the date of this paper submitted. Utilizing our developed histone interaction network, which encompasses 3808 histone-regulatory protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, we systematically characterized various types of histone binding interfaces. The interfacial residues were determined by residues located within a 5 Å distance between heavy atoms of histone and their respective binding partner. To eliminate redundancy, where the same nucleosome binding proteins may have multiple available complex structures, we selected representative structures for each binding protein following the criteria outlined in our recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Ultimately, 83 representative nucleosome complex structures were chosen for subsequent pKa calculations and electrostatic potential analyses (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1).</p>

<title>pKa calculations of nucleosome structures</title>
<p>To evaluate the influence of protein structure environment on histone residue protonation states, we computed the pKa values of histone titratable residues within histone dimers (H2A-H2B and H3-H4) and within the context of nucleosome structures. We selected 13 high-resolution nucleosome structures (Resolution &lt; 3 Å) for analysis, from three different organisms: Homo sapiens, Xenopus laevis, and Drosophila melanogaster (Supplementary Table 2). In each selected nucleosome structure, we extracted each copy of the H2A-H2B and H3-H4 histone dimers and subjected them to 20,000 steps of energetic minimization using Amber <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> with the ff14SB force field for proteins and OL15 for DNA. Subsequently, the minimized dimer structures were utilized for pKa calculations of histone titratable residues (Glu, Asp, Lys, His, and Arg) using PROPKA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). To analyze the pKa changes attributable to the protein environment in nucleosomes, the pKa values of histone titratable residues were computed using the corresponding nucleosome structures. The pKa shift of each histone residue was determined as follows:

<p>It is well-known that protein-protein and protein-nucleic interactions are associated with pKa shifts and changes in the protonation states of titratable residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Here, we systematically analyzed pKa shifts and protonation state changes of histone residues induced by the interaction between regulatory proteins and nucleosomes. We performed pKa calculations of histone titratable groups for 83 representative nucleosome complex structures using PROPKA3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). For each nucleosome complex structure, we initially computed the pKa values of protein residues within the nucleosome complex (bound state). Subsequently, we calculated the pKa values with the individual nucleosome structure (unbound state). The pKa shift (ΔpKa) for each titratable group induced by the interaction between nucleosome and binding protein was then determined using the following equation:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="597724v1_eqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
, where Z represents the titratable group (Glu, Asp, Lys, His, and Arg) in histones or nucleosome-binding proteins, and ΔpKa represents the change in pKa value of the titratable group from the unbound state to the bound state.</p>
<p>To analyze the pH-induced changes in protonation states of histone titratable residues, we categorized these residues into four classes based on the pKa calculations: i) Titratable groups experiencing changes in their protonation states within the physiological pH range (pH 6.5 to 7.5). ii) Titratable groups experiencing changes in protonation states under slightly acidic condition (pH 5 to 6.5). iii) Titratable groups experiencing changes in protonation states under weakly basic condition (pH 7.5 to 9). iv) Titratable groups that do not experience changes in their protonation states within the physiological or mildly acidic/basic pH ranges (5 &lt; pH &lt; 9, less sensitive to changes in pH within the typical cellular environment).</p>

<title>Molecular dynamics simulations of nucleosome complex structures under different protonation states of histone ionizable groups</title>
<p>Given that the binding of proteins to nucleosomes induces changes in the protonation states of key histone titratable residues, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations of nucleosome complex structures to explore how these changes could influence nucleosome-partner interactions. For our simulations, we chose seven representative nucleosome complex structures containing various nucleosome-binding proteins involved in epigenetic regulation processes, including regulatory protein SIR3, tumor suppressor p53-binding protein 1, SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler RSC, and DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p>For each nucleosome complex structure, we conducted two sets of simulations (Supplementary Table 3). In one set, histone residues were assigned protonation states corresponding to the unbound condition, while in the other set, histone residues were assigned protonation states reflecting the bound condition. By comparing the results of these simulations, our objective is to evaluate the influence of changes in the protonation states of histone residues on nucleosome-partner protein interactions.</p>
<p>All simulations were conducted under the AMBER force field (ff14SB force field for proteins and OL15 for DNA molecules) and employing the TIP4PEW water model in explicit solvent. In each simulation system, the initial structural model was solvated with 0.15 M NaCl in a cubic water box, maintaining a minimum distance of 10 Å from the atoms of the nucleosome complex to the edge of water box. The systems were kept at T=310 K using Langevin dynamics with a constant pressure simulation at 1 atm. SHAKE bond length constraints were applied for bonds involving hydrogens, with a non-bonded interaction cutoff distance set at 10 Å. Electrostatic calculations were performed using the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method, employing a spacing of 1 Å and a real-space cutoff of 12 Å. Periodic boundary conditions were applied, and trajectories were saved every 10 ps. Each system underwent 10,000 steepest descent minimizations followed by another 10,000 conjugate gradient minimizations. After minimization, the systems were gradually heated from 100 to 310 K in the NVT ensemble, followed by switching to the NPT ensemble for 2ns equilibrations before 100 ns production runs.</p>
<p>The binding free energies between the nucleosome and binding partners were calculated using the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) method implemented in the Amber22 package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Calculations were performed for every 100 ps frame, excluding the first 20 ns trajectories. Residue-wise decomposition was then applied to derive the binding energy per histone residue. The hydrogen bond and salt bridge in histone binding interfaces were analyzed using the customized VMD TCL scripts.</p>

<title>Analysis of histone cancer mutations</title>
<p>To examine the impact of histone cancer mutations on nucleosome electrostatic potentials and long-range electrostatic interactions, we utilized one recently compiled dataset of histone cancer-associated mutations, which encompasses 7940 mutations across 84 histone genes and 83 cancer types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Subsequently, we filtered out mutations previously documented in the dbSNP database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and the mutations from samples with a tumor mutation burden (TMB) of &gt; 10 mutations per megabase (Mb) following previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> and identified recurrent histone mutations, indicative of potential associations with cancer progression. Recurrent histone cancer mutations were defined as those occurring in at least two distinct patients within the dataset. Following this filtering process, we curated a refined dataset, termed the ‘refined histone cancer mutation set’, which comprises 1266 recurrent missense mutations across 77 histone genes and 55 cancer types. This refined dataset was then subjected to further electrostatic analyses in this study.</p>
<p>To assess the impact of mutation on nucleosome-partner protein interactions, we mapped histone cancer mutations onto our recently developed histone-partner protein interaction networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Then, the changes in protein binding free energy (ΔΔGs) caused by each mutation were calculated using the SAAMBE-3D approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, a newly developed machine learning algorithm to predict the effects of single amino acid substitutions on protein-protein interactions (PPIs).</p>

<title>Histone ionizable residues in nucleosome undergo substantial pKa changes due to protein environments</title>
<p>Wrapping of DNA molecules around histone octamers creates a unique protein environment in nucleosome structure, which can significantly influence the pKa values of histone residues and further impact the ionizable states of histone residues even at physiological pH condition. To systematically characterize the pKa changes and corresponding ionizable states of histone residues, we have performed structured-based pKa calculations of all histone titratable residues using 13 high-resolution nucleosome structures from three organisms (Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, the pKa values were further predicted using the corresponding refined H2A-H2B and H3-H4 dimer structures and the pKa changes of each histone titratable residues caused by the protein environment in nucleosome were derived using <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">equation 1</xref> (see methods section and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). To validate our predictions, we have further compared our predicted pKa values with experimental determined pKa values of nine titratable residues near the acidic patch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, which achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref> and Supplementary Table 4).</p>

<title>Protonation states of key histone residues modulate nucleosome surface electrostatic potential</title>
<p>We have demonstrated that histone residues within nucleosomes undergo substantial pKa shifts due to their protein environments. Such shifts in pKa values can indeed correspond to changes in the protonation states of histone ionizable residues, leading to alterations in nucleosome charges. Based on our pKa predictions, we categorized histone titratable residues into four classes based on their protonation states at different pH levels (see methods section and Supplementary Table 7). We identified 14 histone titratable residues whose protonation states were sensitive to changes in pH within the typical cellular environment (Supplementary Table 8). Additionally, four histone titratable residues exhibited protonation state changes even within physiological pH condition (pH 6.5-7.5), including H2BGlu71, H2BHis106, H3Glu97, and H3Glu105. According to the calculated pKa values, all four residues were protonated within physiological pH range from 6.5 to 7.5. H2BHis106 carried a positive net charge, while the protonated forms of H2BGlu71, H3Glu97, and H3Glu105 had neutral charges.</p>
<p>Since alterations in the protonation states of histone residues can influence the surface charges of the histone octamer, we investigated how these changes can affect nucleosome surface electrostatic potentials. Among the 14 identified histone titratable residues whose protonation states are sensitive to pH changes in cellular conditions, we found six located on the surface of the histone octamer, including H2AE61, H2AD90, H2BH46, H2BH106, H3E105 and H4E74, mostly located around acidic patch, H3 Alpha2-helix and H4 Alpha2-helix (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Changes in their protonation states can significantly impact the nucleosome surface electrostatic potentials.</p>
<p>Moreover, we performed electrostatic analysis of nucleosome structures with histone titratable residues in different pH environments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). Interestingly, we observed significant alterations in nucleosome surface electrostatic potentials resulting from changes in the protonation states of key histone residues. Specifically, under weakly acidic condition (pH 5-6.5), the protonation of H2AGlu61, H2AD90, H2BHis46, H4Glu74 and H2BH106 led to a substantial shift from negative electrostatic potentials to neutral or positive potentials near the acidic patch and H4 Alpha2-helix. Conversely, the deprotonation of H2BHis106 resulted in enhanced negative potentials under slightly basic conditions (pH 7.5-9). Overall, our results highlight that alterations in the protonation states of several key histone residues can occur due to perturbations in pH near cellular physiological conditions, leading to significant effects on nucleosome surface electrostatic potentials and potentially impacting nucleosome interactions and higher-order chromatin structures.</p>

<title>Histone residue protonation states regulate the long-range electrostatic interactions between nucleosome and chromatin factors</title>
<p>Changes in the protonation states of histone residues can lead to modifications in the electrostatic potential of the nucleosome surface. These alterations have the potential to influence interactions between nucleosomes and chromatin factors. To confirm our hypotheses, we conducted systematic analyses of the long-range electrostatic forces generated between nucleosomes and different binding proteins using representative nucleosome complex structures. These analyzed complexes contain seven distinct nucleosome-binding proteins known for their critical roles in processes such as PTM reading and writing, chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and DNA replication (Supplementary Table 9).</p>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that under cellular pH conditions, the strengths and directions of electrostatic forces can be significantly affected by changes in the protonation states of key histone titratable residues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). For example, we observed significant changes in the magnitude and direction of the electrostatic interaction between the nucleosome and Tumor suppressor p53-binding protein 1 across different pH ranges (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and Supplementary Figure 2). Specifically, under weakly acidic conditions (pH 5 to 6.5), the strength of the electrostatic force between the nucleosome and binding protein is minimal, while it reaches its maximum values under weakly basic conditions (pH 7.5 to 9). Moreover, the directions of the electrostatic forces are also shifted, indicating weakened electrostatic interactions between the nucleosome and binding proteins under weakly acidic conditions. Such trends were also observed for other nucleosome binding proteins such as PRC1, RSC, DOT1L and SIR3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and Supplementary Figures 2 and 3)</p>

<p>For the majority of analyzed nucleosome complexes, we observed that nucleosomes generally exhibited the strongest long-range electrostatic interactions with binding proteins under physiological or weakly basic conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and Supplementary Figure 3). This observation underscores the pivotal role of protonation state changes of key histone residues in modulating nucleosome surface electrostatic potentials. Specifically, under physiological or slightly basic pH conditions, nucleosome can maintain a stronger negative electrostatic potential around the acidic patch, H3 Alpha2-helix and H4 Alpha2-helix, thereby enhancing electrostatic interactions between the histone octamer and binding proteins.</p>

<title>Binding of regulatory proteins to nucleosome is coupled with proton uptake or release of histone titratable residues</title>
<p>Nucleosome harbors a plethora of interactions with various chromatin factors, and their binding interfaces are enriched with ionizable groups. Consequently, it is reasonable to expect that proton uptake or release of these ionizable groups occurs upon the binding of proteins to nucleosomes. However, the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon have not been systematically investigated. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic analysis using 83 representative nucleosome complex structures. These structures encompass nucleosome interactions with 200 distinct binding proteins, essential for a wide array of epigenetic regulation processes such as PTM reading, writing, and erasing, DNA repair and replication, chromatin remodeling, and gene transcription (Supplementary Figure 1).</p>
<p>For each nucleosome complex structure, we calculated pKa shifts and analyzed protonation state changes of histone residues resulting from the binding of regulatory proteins to nucleosomes (see the Methods section for details). Our analyses revealed positive pKa shifts of acidic residues and negative shifts of basic residues upon regulatory protein binding to nucleosomes, indicating suppression of acidity and basicity of histone ionizable groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). Furthermore, we identified 14 titratable acidic residues and 19 titratable basic residues exhibiting significant pKa shifts upon protein binding to nucleosomes (|ΔpKa| ≥ 1.5, observed in at least three different complex structures), with the largest changes up to 5.9 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). Among these residues, three are susceptible to proton uptake or release within physiological pH condition (H3E74, H2AE65, and H2AE93) and eight are susceptible to weakly acidic or basic pH conditions (Supplementary Table 10). These residues are distributed among all four histone types and are mostly located around the acidic patch and H3α1L1 elbow, suggesting potential effects on nucleosome surface electrostatics and interactions with partner proteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we investigated how such proton uptake or release of histone titratable residues could affect nucleosome-partner protein interactions. To answer this question, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of seven representative nucleosome complex structures by setting the protonation states of histone residues in two states: one with the protonation states when nucleosome bound with chromatin factors and another with the protonation states in the unbound state. Our calculations indicated that proton uptake or release in histone residues can generally promote the binding of proteins to nucleosome structures and increase the binding free energies (Supplementary Table 11). Indeed, in six out of the seven cases, we observed an increase in nucleosome-partner binding free energies with a mean value of 11.09 kcal/mol. Furthermore, we analyzed the hydrogen bonds and salt bridges formed between histones and binding proteins under different protonation states. Despite the decreased number of salt bridges due to changes in histone ionizable group protonation states in several cases, we observed a significant increase in hydrogen bonds within the binding interfaces, thereby promoting nucleosome-partner protein interactions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate the consequences of charge-altering mutations on nucleosome-partner binding energies, we calculated the binding free energy changes (ΔΔGs) of 153 histone recurrent mutations that were located on the binding interfaces of nucleosome-partner complex structures and altered the residue net charge. Our calculations revealed the strong destabilizing effects of these mutations on nucleosome-partner protein binding, with a mean decrease in binding free energy values of 1.29 kcal/mol, especially for the Type 1 and Type 3 mutations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Through electrostatic potential calculations, we demonstrated that even one or two histone cancer mutations can induce remarkable effects on the nucleosome surface electrostatic potentials (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> and Supplementary Table 12), with the mutations H2AE61K and H3E73K exhibiting particularly pronounced effects. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of charge-altering mutations on electrostatic interactions using nucleosome complex structures (Supplementary Table 13) and our results revealed their disruptive effects on the long-range electrostatic interactions between nucleosomes and various chromatin factors, such as PRC1, Regulatory protein SIR3 and Centromere proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> and Supplementary Figure 5).

<p>In addition to nucleosome-nucleosome interactions, we also investigated the impact of cancer mutations or pH perturbations on the binding between the H4 tail and the acidic patch. Our results indicated that the long-range electrostatic interactions can be considerably affected by the pH perturbations even in the cellular conditions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> and Supplementary Figure 7). The H4 tail-acidic patch interactions would be dramatically weakened when the pH was shifted to slightly acidic condition (pH from 5 to 6.5), thereby modulating the nucleosome compaction. Moreover, we identified six charge-altering cancer mutations on H4 tails and on the acidic patches, potentially leading to significantly effects on the electrostatic interactions (Supplementary Table 14). Using a model of the H4 tail-nucleosome complex built with AlphaFold3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, we calculated the electrostatic forces between the H4 tail and the acidic patch in wild-type and mutant states.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Electrostatic interactions are pivotal in biomolecular interactions, acting as long-range forces that govern the protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. While nucleosome formation reduces the net charge of DNA within chromatin, the nucleosome itself still maintains a strong negative electrostatic field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of electrostatic interactions in mediating nucleosome interactions with various chromatin factors, owing to the complementary charges present in the histone octamer and partner protein binding interfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. We show that histone residues in nucleosomes undergo significant pKa changes due to their protein environments, characterized by elevated pKa values for histone acidic residues and decreased values for basic residues. Our findings demonstrate that even minor perturbations in pH near cellular physiological conditions can profoundly alter nucleosome surface electrostatics, particularly in regions surrounding acidic patches. Elevated pKa values result in protonation of H4E74, H2AE61, H3E105 and H2AD90 within slightly acidic pH conditions, significantly dampening negative charges. Additionally, H2BH106 and H2BH46 become significantly protonated at slightly acidic pH, further reducing the electronegativity and hydrogen bonding capacity of the acidic patch. Utilizing experimentally determined nucleosome-partner protein complex structures, we have demonstrated that changes in the protonation states of key histone residues, such as H2AE93, H2BE103 and H3D82, can modulate the binding processes of various chromatin factors to nucleosomes by altering the directions and magnitudes of long-range electrostatic forces. Our findings indicate that nucleosomes typically exhibit stronger electrostatic forces with partner proteins under physiological or slightly basic pH conditions, whereas these forces are notably diminished under slightly acidic conditions.</p>
<p>In our investigation, we observed significant changes in pKa values and protonation states of ionizable groups accompanying nucleosome-partner protein binding, consistent with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Specifically, we identified 14 titratable acidic residues and 19 titratable basic residues exhibiting notable pKa shifts upon protein binding to nucleosomes, indicative of proton uptake or release during binding processes. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that the proton uptake or release of histone titratable residues generally promoted the formation of hydrogen bonds in the histone-partner protein binding interfaces, consequently enhancing their binding affinities. These findings underscore the crucial roles of protonation states of ionizable groups in modulating nucleosome-partner protein interactions, emphasizing the importance of considering these factors in future studies.</p>
<p>Electrostatic interactions serve as the primary driving forces in the folding of arrays of nucleosomes into chromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Notably, recent experiments have highlighted the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions between nucleosomes as a major biophysical driving force for organizing nucleosomes into euchromatin and heterochromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Furthermore, experimental evidence has demonstrated that charge-altering mutations at nucleosome-nucleosome interaction interfaces significantly impact chromatin compaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Utilizing two experimentally determined structures of nucleosome arrays, we demonstrate that even slight perturbations in pH conditions can induce significant alterations in nucleosome-nucleosome and H4 tail-acidic patch electrostatic interactions. Additionally, leveraging our previously constructed histone cancer mutation dataset, we show that even a single cancer mutation can induce significant alterations in the electrostatic interactions between H4 tail and acidic patch of neighboring nucleosome.</p>
<p>We conclude that electrostatic interactions are crucial in orchestrating the binding and recognition of various chromatin factors to nucleosomes and the folding of nucleosome arrays into chromatin (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Histone ionizable residues are highly sensitive to cellular pH fluctuations, leading to changes in their protonation states and consequent alterations in nucleosome surface electrostatic potentials and interactions. Such changes in protonation states should not be overlooked in studies of nucleosome-partner interactions and may contribute to intrinsic regulatory mechanisms. Additionally, we propose that alterations in histone residue protonation or cancer mutations have the potential to impact nucleosome self-association and higher-order chromatin structures. However, quantitatively characterizing these dynamic processes remains challenging. Future research efforts should focus on developing experimental and computational techniques to elucidate the spatial and temporal hierarchy of dynamic chromatin processes, thereby bridging the gap in our understanding.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a valuable study probing the impact of pH and cancer mutations on nucleosome interactions and higher-order chromatin structures.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is comprehensive, covering all the titratable residues of nucleosomes and all known cancer mutations. The analysis was rigorously carried out within the feasibility of current computational capabilities. The methods used in this study are also solid. The results of this study can enhance our understanding of higher-order chromatin organizations and their modulation by various genetic and epigenetic changes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The interpretation and illustration of the data need improvement, such as the change of protonation states of titratable residues on the nucleosome-protein interactions and higher-order chromatin structures.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper by Zhang et al. has two parts.</p>
<p>The first one presents a comprehensive study of the nucleosome pKs, including their shifts from reference values in solution. They also explore changes in the protonation states of the histone residue in response to the formation of various nucleosome complexes, including higher-order nucleosome structures. The overall conclusion is that pH-induced changes in histone residue protonation states modulate nucleosome surface electrostatic potentials, and influence nucleosome-partner protein interactions. Proton uptake or release often accompanied by nucleosome-partner protein interactions affects their binding processes.</p>
<p>In the second part, the authors study the effect of 1266 recurrent histone cancer mutations on the nucleosome surface electrostatics: they show a significant subset of these has a major effect on the nucleosome-partner interactions, with the potential to regulate nucleosome self-association, thereby affecting higher-order chromatin structures.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strengths of this work are its technical rigor, comprehensive nature, and novelty of several of its aspects. For example, I am not aware of another work that analyzed pK shifts in the nucleosome in such level of detail, and on for so many different structures. The same for pK shifts upon nucleosome-partner binding. The analysis of pK shifts in nucleosome-nucleosome binding is likely completely new. The authors use an established methodology, check it against experiment at least in some instances, and, very importantly, base their conclusions on many different structures. The specific pK-related numbers they report are believable.</p>
<p>Regarding the second part of the work: the specific connection made between a subset of cancer-associated mutations and the major electrostatic changes in the nucleosome is novel and should be of interest to a broad community. The authors conclude that cancer mutations can also regulate nucleosome self-association, modulating the organization and dynamics of higher-order chromatin structures.</p>
<p>The detailed and comprehensive analysis of the cancer-associated mutations, including their partitioning into multiple relevant categories, is of value in its own right.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness of the first (pK-related) part of this work is the lack of relevance to specific conditions in most living cells of higher eukaryotes. The problem is that the nucleosome resides in the nucleus, where the pH is very tightly controlled, and for good reasons. See e.g. Casey, J., Grinstein, S., and Orlowski, J. ``Sensors and regulators of intracellular pH.&quot; Nature Rev. Mol. Cell. Biology. (2009). Parker, M. D., and Boron, W. F. ``The divergence, actions, roles, and relatives of sodium-coupled bicarbonate transporters.&quot;, Physiol. Rev. (2013). While intracellular pH does deviate from about 7.2, the naturally occurring deviations are only of the order of 0.3 pH units. In that respect, what the authors call &quot;physiological&quot; range of 6.5 to 7.5 is still too broad, let alone the &quot;slightly basic (pH 5 to 6.5) or ``slightly acidic&quot; (pH 7.5 to 9) conditions, as defined by the authors. It is hard to imagine a situation where intra-nuclear pH changes from e.g. &quot;slightly acidic&quot; to neutral in a live cell nucleus.</p>
<p>This said, there is nothing wrong with studying the response of the nucleosome structures to these large variations of pH, which can be reproduced in-vitro. It is the relevance of the findings to in-vivo conditions that are highly questionable.</p>
<p>The second part of the work - the effect of cancer mutations - is free from this major defect. In the opinion of this reviewer, it can (and should) stand on its feet, as a separate work.</p>
<p>However, the lack of specific, testable (preferably quantitative) biologically relevant predictions is a weakness of both parts. For example, in &quot;Discussion&quot; the authors state that &quot;Histone ionizable residues are highly sensitive to cellular pH fluctuations, leading to changes in their protonation states and consequent alterations in nucleosome surface electrostatic potentials and interactions.&quot; This statement is certainly true, based on what is already known about the effect of pH on protein-DNA (or protein-protein) association, from previous works. But what are the specific predictions here?</p>
