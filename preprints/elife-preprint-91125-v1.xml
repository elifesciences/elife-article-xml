<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Bacterial cell surface glycoconjugates are critical for cell survival and for interactions between bacteria and their hosts. Consequently, the pathways responsible for their biosynthesis have untapped potential as therapeutic targets. The localization of many glycoconjugate biosynthesis enzymes to the membrane represents a significant challenge for expressing, purifying, and characterizing these enzymes. Here, we leverage cutting-edge methods to stabilize, purify, and structurally characterize WbaP, a phosphoglycosyl transferase (PGT) from <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (LT2) O-antigen biosynthesis without detergent solubilization from the lipid bilayer. From a functional perspective, these studies establish WbaP as a homodimer, reveal the structural elements responsible for oligomerization, shed light on the regulatory role of a domain of unknown function embedded within WbaP, and identify conserved structural motifs between PGTs and functionally unrelated UDP-sugar dehydratases. From a technological perspective, the strategy developed here is generalizable and provides a toolkit for studying small membrane proteins embedded in liponanoparticles beyond PGTs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Glycoconjugates are complex heterogeneous biopolymers found on the cell surface and secreted from all cells. In prokaryotes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> glycoconjugates play important roles in survival,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> antibiotic resistance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> immune evasion and immunogenicity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and biofilm formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> Genetic disruption or inhibition of the enzymes involved in glycoconjugate assembly can result in deleterious effects in many microorganisms and have been reported to attenuate virulence and pathogenicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Despite the overwhelming compositional diversity of prokaryotic glycoconjugates, the underlying logic for their biosynthesis is often conserved and most commonly localized to cell membranes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> Thus, structural and mechanistic studies of the machinery for glycoconjugate assembly are of considerable interest although the membrane localization of glycoconjugate assembly enzymes poses a significant hurdle for in-depth characterization.</p>
<p>The logic of the Wzx/Wzy-dependent glycoconjugate biosynthesis pathways is highly conserved and comprises a series of enzyme-catalyzed transfer reactions using nucleoside diphosphate sugar donor substrates and a membrane resident polyprenol phosphate (PrenP) acceptor such as undecaprenol phosphate (UndP). These pathways result in the production of a wide array of glycoconjugates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> O-antigen biosynthesis in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium LT2 is a well-studied example of a Wzx/Wzy-dependent pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> This pathway utilizes a phosphoglycosyl transferase (PGT) known as WbaP (formerly RfbP) to catalyze the transfer of phospho-galactose from UDP-galactose to UndP, forming Und-PP-galactose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> This reaction represents the initial membrane-committed step in O-antigen repeat unit (RU) biosynthesis and is followed by a series of glycosyl transfer reactions to form the O-antigen RU. The Und-PP-linked tetrasaccharide RU is then flipped across the inner bacterial membrane, polymerized into full-length O-antigen, and appended to the lipid A core for display on the outer membrane (Fig. S1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>PGTs belong to one of two superfamilies based on the membrane topology of the catalytic core structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Polytopic PGTs (polyPGTs), such as MraY,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> have a catalytic domain comprising multiple transmembrane helices (TMHs) and the catalytic core of monotopic PGTs (monoPGTs) contains a single re-entrant membrane helix (RMH).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> Analysis of the monoPGT superfamily utilizing a sequence similarity network (SSN) recently classified several family members each featuring variation around the core catalytic domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> Small monoPGTs (Sm-PGTs), such as PglC from the <italic>Campylobacter</italic> protein glycosylation pathways only include the catalytic core.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> Bifunctional monoPGTs (Bi-PGTs) include functional domains fused to either the N- or C-terminus of the monoPGT catalytic domain. Finally, large monoPGTs (Lg-PGTs), which are the most abundant, include both a predicted transmembrane four-helix bundle and a domain of unknown function (DUF) N-terminal to the monoPGT core catalytic domain. The DUF is highly conserved (PF13727) and has been computationally annotated as a CoA-binding domain, however, the roles of the conserved accessory domains in the Lg-PGTs remain unclear. The <italic>S. enterica</italic> WbaP is a prototypic Lg-PGT that has been biochemically characterized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> Initial computational assignment of the topology of Lg-PGTs mis-assigned the topology of the reentrant membrane helix (RMH) as a transmembrane helix (TMH), confounding interpretations of biological data, as well as the subcellular localization of the DUF in these proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> Currently, although the structure of PglC, a sm-PGT from <italic>Campylobacter concisus</italic> has been determined by X-ray crystallography,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> there is no experimental structure determination of a Lg-PGT to provide insight into the roles of the auxiliary domains or their interactions with the catalytic core. Furthermore, PglC was purified using detergent, potentially obscuring interactions that depend on the native membrane-bound environment of PglC.</p>

<p>Amphiphilic PrenPs are central to glycoconjugate assembly and represent an essential cellular resource with no other known function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> The low abundance of UndP (ca. 0.1% of membrane lipids)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> suggests PrenP-dependent pathways must be subject to regulation to ensure that supplies are maintained for critical pathways. For example, sequestration of UndP by disruption of O-antigen production in <italic>E. coli</italic> results in gross morphological defects and cell lysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> Despite this, our understanding of the regulation of Wzx/Wzy-dependent glycoconjugate biosynthesis remains limited. PGTs are likely to be subject to regulation, as they act as the initial “gatekeeper” enzyme to transfer glycosyl phosphates from soluble NDP-sugar substrates onto the membrane-embedded UndP. NDP-sugars used by PGTs are often highly modified or are shared with fundamental cellular processes such as glucose metabolism, placing a further metabolic burden on organisms to modulate PGT activity. Recently, the sm-PGT CapM from capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> was demonstrated to be activated via phosphorylation by a regulatory kinase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> Studies of a WbaP ortholog from <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> suggest that residues in the DUF may modulate PGT function or overall pathway flux, raising the possibility that the accessory domains found in Lg-PGT may serve a regulatory function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have recently reported a robust pipeline for solubilizing and purifying Lg-PGTs from several organisms, including WbaP from <italic>S. enterica</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> The strategy includes <italic>in vivo</italic> cleavage of an N-terminal SUMO tag via the protease Ulp1, application of the amphiphilic polymer SMALP-200 (formerly SMA30) for solubilization from <italic>E. coli</italic> membranes into styrene-maleic acid liponanoparticles (SMALPs), and purification via a dual-strep tag, which is exposed upon cleavage by Ulp1. The resulting protein is highly pure and stabilized in a native-like membrane environment by the SMALP. WbaP assembled in SMALP was vitrified on grids for CryoEM screening, and an initial dataset yielded 2D classes with unexpected symmetry. As these experiments were the first to study purified Lg-PGTs in a native-like lipid bilayer, the putative symmetry observed in SMALP prompted the investigation of the oligomeric state of Lg-PGTs in the liponanoparticles.</p>
<p>Here, we build upon the successful membrane protein solubilization techniques to further investigate the architecture of <italic>S. enterica</italic> WbaP in SMALP. We leverage AlphaFold modeling, crosslinking experiments, mass spectrometry, and CryoEM to map the structure of <italic>S. enterica</italic> WbaP in a native-like lipid bilayer environment. Insights from these experiments establish the oligomeric state of <italic>S. enterica</italic> WbaP as a dimer, facilitate the production of a soluble truncation construct to probe the role of the DUF, and highlight evolutionary relationships between Lg-PGTs and other enzymes from glycoconjugate biosynthetic pathways. These findings demonstrate SMALP as a useful platform for capturing and studying native oligomerization and for CryoEM of small membrane proteins. These structural studies now allow us to develop a clearer picture of the initial steps of glycoconjugate biosynthesis and membrane positioning of Lg-PGTs. Finally, we assign a nucleotide-sensing regulatory function to the DUF, establishing a role for this highly conserved non-catalytic domain in Lg-PGTs.</p>

<title>Characterization of S. enterica WbaP in SMALP</title>
<p>We took a multifaceted approach to investigate the putative oligomerization of <italic>S. enterica</italic> in liponanoparticles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>, S2). As SMALPs often display high heterogeneity we turned to size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) to remove aggregated material or free SMA polymer that had carried over through initial purification. A small peak was observed corresponding to the void volume of the column, but most of the material eluted in a sharp peak with a retention time of 11.09 min corresponding to a molecular weight of 464 kDa (Fig. S2). The predicted molecular weight of the expression construct of WbaP is 61.2 kDa. However, as the SMA and lipid accompanying WbaP in the SMALP may influence separation on SEC relative to globular standards, we sought alternative methods to accurately determine the mass of the WbaP SMALPs in solution. Size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS), mass photometry and Direct Mass Technology mode (Orbitrap enabled charge detection mass spectrometry)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> were utilized to assess the molar mass of WbaP in SMALP. In agreement with the initial SEC experiments, WbaP eluted in a sharp peak on an analytical SEC column in line with MALS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The polydispersity of this peak was calculated to 1.001, and the molar mass was calculated to 255 ± 9 kDa. Accurate assignment of mass of a species analyzed by SEC-MALS requires a precise assignment of the refractive index increment (dn/dc) of each component of the analyte.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> Despite the low polydispersity and narrow mass range assigned to this peak, the refractive index increment (dn/dc) for SMA polymers is under debate in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> obscuring the true mass calculation for WbaP in SMALP. To this end we turned to Direct Mass Technology mode and mass photometry, techniques that can accurately determine the mass of molecules in solution regardless of their composition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> When analyzed by mass photometry or Direct Mass Technology mode, WbaP-containing SMALPs were determined to have a molecular weight of ∼ 240 kDa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, C).As the monomer molecular weight of the WbaP construct was calculated to 61.2 kDa, and the SMA along with encapsulated lipids can add a variable amount of mass depending on the solubilized protein, we reasoned that WbaP could exist as a dimer or trimer in SMALP.</p>

</fig>
<p>To further define the oligomeric state of WbaP in SMALP, we utilized amine-reactive crosslinking probes. By selecting crosslinkers with a defined radius, we reasoned that we could covalently trap oligomers and distinguish dimer from trimer using non-reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Fig. S3A). A small panel of commonly used crosslinkers was selected to screen against WbaP in SMALP (Fig S3B). Of these, the crosslinker dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP), with a spacer length of 12.0 Å, readily crosslinked WbaP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, Table S1). Crosslinking efficiency was dependent on DSP concentration, with complete crosslinking observed with 5 mM DSP after a five-minute reaction. Crosslinking could be reversed by the addition of reducing agent. Fully crosslinked WbaP migrated at ∼2x the molecular weight of the non-crosslinked species, confirming a WbaP dimer in SMALP.</p>

<title>CryoEM of S. enterica WbaP in SMALP</title>
<p>With high confidence in the monodispersity of our sample and the oligomeric state of <italic>S. enterica</italic> WbaP in SMALP, we continued with CryoEM structure analysis. Prior to this work, only a small screening dataset had been collected on a Talos Arctica instrument.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> Grids were prepared using the highly purified eluent from SEC, movies were collected using a Titan Krios G3i microscope. 2D classes from extracted particles closely matched those observed earlier, and initial <italic>ab-initio</italic> 3D models displayed features consistent with a liponanoparticle, as well as two distinct lobes outside of the membrane (Fig. S4). However, various refinement strategies failed to yield even moderate-resolution reconstructions. Reasoning that the auto-generated refinement mask may include SMA and lipid regions, we sought to generate a reasonable model to assist in manual masking during data processing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Creation and validation of S. enterica WbaP dimer model</title>
<p>We turned to AlphaFold to generate models suitable for docking and refinement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> Although the prediction of <italic>S. enterica</italic> WbaP available from the AlphaFold protein structure database has high confidence throughout most of the model (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A</xref>, S5), we noted a region of moderate confidence between the DUF and the PGT catalytic domain. In particular, the placement of a predicted β-hairpin motif from Asn251 to Gln268 stood out as anomalous, as this motif was flipped away from the remainder of the protein, approximately 25 Å from the DUF, and ∼37 Å from the PGT domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). As AlphaFold multimer routine has been reported to successfully predict oligomeric complexes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> we assessed whether a dimer model of <italic>S. enterica</italic> WbaP would represent a better starting point for docking and refinement into the CryoEM reconstruction. The dimer was also predicted with high overall confidence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3B</xref>, S5). Unexpectedly, the β-hairpin motif that had poor placement in the monomer model was predicted to mediate domain swapping within the dimer model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> with the β-hairpin from chain A continuing a β-sheet structure present in the DUF of chain B (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). The predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) score assigned to each amino acid by AlphaFold can be used to judge the quality of a predicted model on a per-residue basis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> Amino acids with pLDDT scores &gt; 70 are considered to have high confidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> For the β-hairpin domain swap region, the average pLDDT score is 78, indicating high confidence in the placement of this motif (Fig. S5). Significantly, the prediction of structures of other Lg-PGTs reveals that this β-hairpin domain swap within a homodimer was highly conserved (Fig. S6).</p>

A set of Cys-pair variants of WbaP were constructed such that thiol-reactive crosslinkers with limited crosslinking radii could be used to “staple” the WbaP dimer at the predicted domain swap interface (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4A</xref>, B). For these experiments, we employed two different crosslinking strategies. For the first Cys-crosslinking experiment, we utilized Cu phenanthroline to catalyze the direct oxidation of Cys residues to form a disulfide bond between Cys residues within 2.05 Å. For the second strategy, we utilized dibromobimane (bBBr) to form a covalent crosslink between Cys residues within 4.88 Å. We observed concentration-dependent crosslinking for two discrete sets of crosslinking pairs along the predicted domain swap interface using either Cu phenanthroline or bBBr (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4D</xref>, E). No crosslinking was observed for wild-type protein using either crosslinking strategy, demonstrating that there are no native cysteines within crosslinking distance, (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>) as predicted by the AlphaFold dimer model.</p>

The majority of the DSS crosslinks localized to the solvent-accessible areas of the PGT domain, while several of the tBu-PhoX crosslinks localized to the membrane-adjacent regions at the putative dimer interface (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Inter vs intra crosslinkers were assigned by XMAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> based on distance constraints for each crosslinker (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).

<p>The overall architecture of the WbaP dimer is T-shaped, with the two four-TMH bundles forming the central stalk, each capped by a DUF. The dimer interface comprises ∼780 Å- of buried surface area, involving 7.1% of the residues of the protein. A modest (176 Å<sup>2</sup>) interface is found along the four TMH bundles, with the C-terminal half of helix 3 mediating contacts. While the C-terminal regions of helix 3 are within interacting distance, the N-termini (Pro82) are ∼32 Å apart, creating a large void in the center of the dimer, presumably occupied by phospholipid. The remainder of the dimer interface occurs at the DUF domains, mediated almost entirely by the β-hairpin domain crossover discussed above. Based on previous experiments establishing the topology of monoPGT catalytic domains, the DUF domains cap the cytosolic side of the four TMH bundles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The catalytic domains of the Lg-PGT protrude away from the dimer interface, placing the two active sites 77 Å apart. Despite the large distance between catalytic sites, the interdigitating β-hairpin motif at the dimer interface between the DUF domains places Ser259, found at the apex of the turn of the β-hairpin, only ∼23 Å from the active site of the opposite chain. Although the β-hairpin is poorly ordered in the experimental map, the targeted Cys-pair crosslinking confirms the placement of this motif found in the AlphaFold model. A predicted helix-turn-helix motif from residues 337-369 of the catalytic domain is also disordered in the experimental map (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). This region is analogous to a mobile loop found in <italic>C. concisus</italic> PglC, which has been implicated in formation of the substrate binding pocket.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> Although both the mobile loop in PglC and the helix-turn-helix found in WbaP are positioned proximal to the active site, the length, sequence conservation, and structural motifs of this region differ greatly between these two PGTs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). XLMS experiments demonstrate that lysines within the predicted helix-turn-helix of WbaP can crosslink with lysines across the soluble core of the catalytic domain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), giving high confidence to the placement of this region in the AlphaFold model, despite the lack of density in the experimental map.</p>

<p>During the course of this work, a structural description of a WbaP ortholog from <italic>E. coli</italic> (NCBI:txid562) by CryoEM was published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> This protein was purified using both detergent and amphipols, and was complexed with a nanobody fusion to facilitate particle identification and alignment during 3D-reconstruction. Although the maps and models associated with this data are not yet publicly available, visual comparison between <italic>S. enterica</italic> WbaP and published images of the <italic>E. coli</italic> WbaP reveals an overall similar architecture, including disorder in the helix-turn-helix region. However, the handedness of the <italic>E. coli</italic> WbaP reconstruction is inverted compared to <italic>S. enterica</italic> WbaP as well as the predicted AlphaFold model. Notably, AlphaFold multimer was not available at the time of publication of the <italic>E. coli</italic> structure and the handedness may be ambiguous at the observed resolution without a model for guidance.</p>
<p>With a clear idea of the overall architecture of WbaP, we sought to better understand the role of the DUF beyond stabilization of the dimer interface. To this end, we used both the CryoEM reconstruction and AlphaFold structural models to guide generation of truncated constructs of WbaP encoding only the DUF. A construct encoding residues 146 to 272 resulted in the production of soluble protein (Fig. S8), which was then used to screen for potential nucleotide ligands by nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nDSF, Fig. S9). This screen identified UMP, UDP, and UTP as potential ligands, and demonstrated that the UDP-Gal substrate of the catalytic domain destabilized the truncated DUF construct. These results imply the DUF plays a role in allosteric regulation by sensing nucleotides and nucleotide-sugars. Indeed, full-length WbaP was found to be strongly inhibited by UMP, with an apparent IC<sub>50</sub> of 4.1 μM (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). This is in close agreement with studies on the WbaP ortholog CpsE, for which UMP has an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> of 3 μM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> The unusual profile of the UMP inhibition curve may reflect UMP binding both competitively to UDP-Gal at the active site, as well as to an allosteric site within the DUF. Thus, it appears that the DUF acts as a regulatory domain, preventing overuse of UndP by modulating PGT activity in response to excess UMP production.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Detailed studies of monoPGTs are hampered by the perennial problems associated with the expression, purification, and structural characterization of membrane proteins. However, the essential role of monoPGTs in the first membrane-committed step of the biosynthesis of diverse classes of prokaryotic glycoconjugates makes structural and functional analysis of this prokaryote-specific enzyme superfamily imperative. Here, we build on our recent advances in the development of an optimized solubilization and purification strategy for the abundant Lg-PGT members of the monoPGT superfamily and present the structural characterization of WbaP, the initiating PGT from O-antigen biosynthesis in <italic>S. enterica</italic>. We anticipate that the strategy applied here will be broadly applicable to other bacterial membrane proteins and provide an efficient route to map the structure of target proteins in a near-native environment, even in the absence of high-resolution structural data. In addition, these methods will be well suited to the study of membrane protein complexes or membrane-bound metabolons,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> a long-standing goal in the study of glycoconjugate biosynthesis.</p>
<p>The structure presented represents the first monotopic PGT characterized in a native-like liponanoparticle. We show that in contrast to the Sm-PGT PglC from <italic>Campylobacter</italic>, which is functional as a monomer, the <italic>S. enterica</italic> Lg-PGT, WbaP, is a tightly associated dimer, with the majority of inter-chain contacts occurring in the highly conserved but previously uncharacterized DUF. Despite computational assignment as a CoA-binding domain, thermal denaturation binding experiments implicate the DUF in nucleotide and nucleotide-sugar binding. Biochemical assays show that UMP is a potent inhibitor of full-length WbaP activity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). The profile of the inhibition curve suggests additional UMP interactions beyond the active site in the full-length protein. Taken together, these results point toward the DUF serving both a <italic>structural and functional</italic> role in stabilizing the dimer and allosterically regulating the catalytic domain upon UMP binding. As UMP is produced by PGTs regardless of the sugar moiety of the NDP-sugar substrate, allosteric regulation of PGT catalysis via the DUF represents a one-size-fits-all approach to regulating Lg-PGTs with differing NDP-sugar substrates. DUF-based modulation of PGT function provides a consistent explanation for the <italic>in vivo</italic> observation that <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> CpsE accumulates suppressor mutations within its DUF in a system where PGT activity is lethal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Intriguingly, we observe a surprising structural homology between the N-terminal domains of Lg-PGTs and PglF-like dehydratases, which are common UDP-sugar modifying enzymes involved in the biogenesis of unusual carbohydrates for glycoconjugate biosynthesis. In this case, it is tempting to hypothesize that the DUFs may play a larger role in the modulation of the flux of glycoconjugate biosynthesis by subjecting both Lg-PGTs and PglF-like dehydratases to negative feedback by pathway side products.</p>
<p>Although PglC and WbaP are predicted to catalyze similar chemical transformations, these PGT enzymes exhibit different substrate specificity. PglC shows high specificity for UDP-diNAcBac, while WbaP is specific for UDP-Gal. Recently, structural and sequence elements were identified that facilitated the bioinformatic assignment of substrate specificity to Sm-PGTs that use the same UDP-diNAcBac substrate as PglC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> Interestingly, the major structural deviations between PglC and WbaP occur at these regions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). An extended loop containing a conserved “GLLP” motif in diNAcBac-utilizing PGTs is replaced with a predicted helix-turn-helix motif in WbaP. This region is poorly resolved in the experimental CryoEM reconstruction of WbaP, however, lysines in this putative structural motif crosslink with the main domain of the WbaP dimer. Given the apparent high degree of motion in the vitrified WbaP particles at this region, and the proximity of the helix-turn-helix motif to the active site, we envision a mechanism in which the active site “closes” upon the helix-turn-helix motion towards the center of the dimer, and the active site is “open” when the motif moves away, as observed in the AlphaFold model. This resembles structural conformers observed in both crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations of <italic>C. concisus</italic> PglC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> Another structural element in the diNAcBac-specific PGTs that is predictive of substrate specificity is an aromatic box motif comprising residues in the solvent-accessible region of the protein and a conserved Phe near the C-terminus of this subset of Sm-PGTs. In WbaP, the C-terminus of the catalytic domain is ∼14 amino acids shorter than in the diNAcBac Sm-PGTs, and the aromatic box motif is absent. These subtle changes surrounding the conserved Asp-Glu catalytic dyad are likely to drive the specificity of WbaP to UDP-Gal. As additional UDP-Gal utilizing PGTs are characterized, we envision the creation of a bioinformatic pipeline to identify the specific residues involved in substrate selection, akin to the method applied to the diNAcBac PGTs.</p>
<p>The liponanoparticle-based approach for purification of <italic>S. enterica</italic> WbaP provides a convenient way to add contrast to vitrified particles in CryoEM by way of additional lipid and SMA mass, similar to the rationale for utilization of nanobody fusion strategies in the study of other small membrane proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> Future efforts to improve the overall resolution of Lg-PGT CryoEM reconstructions may benefit from a combination of these approaches whereby mass from a liponanoparticle facilitates particle identification and picking, while bound nanobody or nanobody complexes/fusions reduce structural motion of the bound Lg-PGT and add distinct features to aid in masking and 3D refinement.</p>

Stock solutions were made of each crosslinker as follows: 50 mM dimethyl adipimidate (DMA) in water, 50 mM dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) in water, 25 mM bis[2-(succinimidyloxycarbonyloxy)ethyl]sulfone (BSOCOES) in dry DMSO, and 10 mM 3,3’-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (DTSSP) in water. Crosslinkers were immediately added to 15 µM WbaP in buffer C at a 20-40 fold molar excess. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 µL of 1.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 8. Samples were analyzed by Western blot to detect the presence of crosslinked oligomers. Crosslinking efficiency was annotated as high (&gt;30% total protein crosslinked to dimer), moderate (&lt;30 % total protein crosslinked to dimer), or none (no protein crosslinked to dimer).</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> manuscript provides <bold>solid</bold> methodologies for utilizing SMALP nanodisks for oligomer characterization. The authors present a platform for capturing and studying native membrane protein oligomerization and subsequent cryoEM analysis. The specific application of the method to WbaP, a membrane-bound phosphoglycosyl transferase, adds to our understanding of glycoconjugate production in bacteria.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors characterize S. enterica WbaP biochemically and structurally. The enzyme catalyzes the initial step in O antigen biosynthesis by transferring a phospho-galactosyl unit from UDP-galactose to undecaprenyl-phosphate. This initial primer is then extended by other glycosyltransferases to form the O antigen repeat unit.</p>
<p>To preserve the biologically functional unit of WbaP, the authors chose a 'detergent-free' purification method based on membrane extraction using SMALP polymers. The obtained material was characterized biochemically and by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors were able to isolate WbaP in a catalytically active and oligomeric form and determined a low-resolution cryo-EM structure of the dimeric complex. Using a disulfide cross-linking approach and other biophysical methods, the authors validated an AlphaFold predicted WbaP model used to interpret the experimental cryo-EM map.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The rationale for using SMALP to extract WbaP from the membrane was to 'preserve' the native lipid bilayer surrounding the protein. However, the physical properties of the lipids co-purifying with the protein are unclear. The volume of the EM map assigned to the SMALP polymers suggests a more micellar character.</p>
<p>Overall, the obtained cryo-EM map appears to be at fairly low resolution. Based on Figure 6, individual helices are not resolved, suggesting an overall resolution significantly below the stated 4.1 Å. Thus, the presented structure is the one of an AlphaFold WbaP model.</p>
<p>I believe the UMP titration analysis could be improved. The authors assume that a 'domain of unknown function (DUF)' binds UMP and regulates the enzyme's activity. UMP, a reaction product of WbaP, may also inhibit the enzyme competitively. Therefore, deleting the DUF for the UMP inhibition studies could help with data interpretation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors focused on delivering a comprehensive structural characterization of WbaP, a membrane-bound phosphoglycosyl transferase from Salmonella that is instrumental in bacterial glycoconjugate synthesis. Notably, the authors employed SMALP-200, an amphipathic copolymer, to extract WbaP in the form of native lipid bilayer nanodiscs. They then determined its oligomerization state through cross-linking and procured higher-resolution structural data via cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). While the authors successfully characterized WbaP in a native-like lipid bilayer setting, and their findings support this, the paper's claim of introducing a novel methodology is not robust. The real contribution of this work lies in the newfound insights about WbaP's structure.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The manuscript provides novel insights into WbaP's structure and oligomerization state, highlighting potentially significant interactions. The methodologies employed represent state-of-the-art practices in the field. Most of the drawn conclusions are well-supported by either experimental or computational data, with a few exceptions noted below.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
• Organization: The manuscript's organization lacks clarity. The authors seem to describe their processes in the sequence they occurred rather than a logical flow, leading to potential confusion. For instance, the authors delve into a series of inconclusive experiments to determine the oligomerization state of WbaP, utilizing techniques like SEC, SEC-MALS, mass photometry, and mass spectrometry. They then transition to cryo-EM but subsequently return to address the oligomerization issue, which they conclusively resolve using cross-linking experiments. Following this, they shift their focus to interpreting and discussing the structural features obtained from the cryo-EM data.</p>
<p>• Ambiguous and incorrect statements: There are instances of vague and at times inaccurate statements. Using more precise terminology like &quot;native nanodiscs&quot; or &quot;lipid bilayer nanodiscs&quot; would enhance clarity compared to the term &quot;liponanoparticles.&quot; The claim on page 8 concerning the refractive index increment of SMA polymers needs rectification. The real reason why SEC-MALS cannot provide absolute particle masses in this case is that using two independent concentration detectors (typically, absorbance and refractive index), the decomposition of elution profiles is necessarily limited to two chemical species of a known molar or specific absorbance and refractive index. Thus, it is clear that nanodiscs containing a protein, a polymer, and a chemically undefined mixture of native lipids cannot be analyzed by this technique.</p>
<p>• Overstating of technical aspects: The technical aspects seem overstated. While the extraction of membrane proteins into native lipid bilayer nanodiscs and their characterization by cross-linking and cryo-EM are standard (and were published before by the same authors in ref. 29), the authors appear to promote them as groundbreaking. The statement that this study presents a novel, universal strategy and toolkit for examining small membrane proteins within liponanoparticles seems overstated, especially given the previous existence of similar methods.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s careful analysis of our manuscript, and their attention to detail regarding the structural data. In a revised version of this manuscript, we will modify the discussion section to include a brief section focused on the liponanoparticle itself, comparing to other experimental structures in SMALP. Investigating the lipid microenvironment in SMALPs around both Lg- and Sm-PGTs is of great interest to our group. We have published initial data related to PglC from Campylobacter, but a systematic analysis of co-purified lipids from the growing number of SMALP-solubilized PGTs is an exciting future direction for this project. Expression and analysis of truncated constructs containing the catalytic domain of Lg-PGTs (including WbaP) has been attempted in our laboratory, with no success. This limits our ability to decouple DUF-mediated modulation of activity from interactions in the catalytic domain. Efforts to address this challenge are underway but will be the focus of future publications.
Regarding the overall resolution – for transparency - we will add a new figure that shows the local resolution throughout the experimental map.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s careful consideration of the steps that were taken and how they were presented. However, we need to reinforce that although the initial biophysical experiments do not provide the exact oligomeric state of the WbaP, they provide important new data. Together these data support that the intact liponanoparticle is large enough to accommodate a higher order oligomerization state along with native lipids and stabilizing SMA polymer – this was not known at the outset and led to Fig 2D showing the first demonstration of dimer that was then validated via XLMS and disulfide crosslinking. The process was logical and essential to this work. We recognize the reviewer’s point on the SEC-MALs experiment and will adjust the text accordingly.</p>
<p>We sought to distinguish the stabilization method used here from canonical MSP nanodiscs by using the term styrene maleic acid liponanoparticle (SMALP). The term SMALP is widely used in literature utilizing this technology, thus the use of other terms may lead to confusion.</p>
<p>Our manuscript in PExpPur was focused on enabling expression of sufficient quality and quantity for sophisticated downstream biophysical applications – that MS was intended to be enabling to the greater membrane protein community and is highly recognized and appreciated in “its own right.” This work presents the first in class structure of the large monoPGTs. Further only a single structure of the PGT domain itself has been solved and appears as an experimental structure in the PDB (also from our group) addressing the enigmatic additional domains and potential physiological relevance. It is also noteworthy that the Lg-monoPGTs dominate the superfamily. This is also the first time that any protein in SMALP has been characterized using direct mass technology, which provided the most accurate mass determination of the intact liponanoparticle/protein complex.</p>
