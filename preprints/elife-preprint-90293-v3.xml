<title>Abstract</title><p>Many cells in high glucose repress mitochondrial respiration, as observed in the Crabtree and Warburg effects. Our understanding of biochemical constraints for mitochondrial activation is limited. Using a <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> screen, we identified the conserved deubiquitinase Ubp3 (Usp10), as necessary for mitochondrial repression. Ubp3 mutants have increased mitochondrial activity despite abundant glucose, along with decreased glycolytic enzymes, and a rewired glucose metabolic network with increased trehalose production. Utilizing <italic>Δubp3</italic> cells, along with orthogonal approaches, we establish that the high glycolytic flux in glucose continuously consumes free Pi. This restricts mitochondrial access to inorganic phosphate (Pi), and prevents mitochondrial activation. Contrastingly, rewired glucose metabolism with enhanced trehalose production and reduced GAPDH (as in <italic>Δubp3</italic> cells) restores Pi. This collectively results in increased mitochondrial Pi and derepression, while restricting mitochondrial Pi transport prevents activation. We therefore suggest that glycolytic-flux dependent intracellular Pi budgeting is a key constraint for mitochondrial repression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Rapidly proliferating cells have substantial metabolic and energy demands in order to increase biomass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cai and Tu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zhu and Thompson, 2019</xref>). This includes a high ATP demand, obtained from cytosolic glycolysis or mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), to fuel multiple reactions (Nelson et al., 2008). Interestingly, many rapidly proliferating cells preferentially rely on ATP from glycolysis/fermentation over mitochondrial respiration even in oxygen-replete conditions, and is the well-known Warburg effect (Vander Heiden et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Warburg, 1925</xref>). Many such cells repress mitochondrial processes in high glucose, termed glucose-mediated mitochondrial repression or the Crabtree effect (Crabtree, 1929; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">De Deken, 1966</xref>). This is observed in some tumors (Vander Heiden et al., 2009), neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Xia et al., 2021</xref>), activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kornberg, 2020</xref>), stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdel-Haleem et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Pacini and Borziani, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tsogtbaatar et al., 2020</xref>), and famously <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">De Deken, 1966</xref>). Numerous studies have identified signaling programs or regulators of glucose-mediated mitochondrial repression. However, biochemical programs and regulatory processes in biology evolve around key biochemical constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cornish-Bowden, 2016</xref>). The biochemical constraints for mitochondrial repression remain unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Diaz-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hammad et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>There are two hypotheses on the biochemical principles driving mitochondrial repression. The first proposes direct roles for glycolytic intermediates in driving mitochondrial respiration, by inhibiting specific mitochondrial outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Díaz-Ruiz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lemus et al., 2018</xref>). The second hypothesizes that a competition between glycolytic and mitochondrial processes for mutually required metabolites/co-factors such as pyruvate, ADP or inorganic phosphate (Pi) could determine the extent of mitochondrial repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Diaz-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hammad et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Koobs, 1972</xref>). These are not all mutually exclusive, and a combination of these factors might dictate mitochondrial repression in high glucose. However, any hierarchies of importance are unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rodríguez-Enríquez et al., 2001</xref>), and experimental data for the necessary constraints for mitochondrial repression remains incomplete.</p>
<p>One approach to resolve this question has been to identify regulators of metabolic state under high glucose. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulated by signaling systems can regulate mitochondrial repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Broach, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hitosugi and Chen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tripodi et al., 2015</xref>). Ubiquitination is a PTM that regulates global proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>), but the roles of ubiquitination-dependent processes in regulating mitochondrial repression are poorly explored. Ubiquitination itself is determined by the balance between ubiquitination, and deubiquitinase (DUB) dependent deubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pickart and Eddins, 2004</xref>). Little is known about the roles of DUBs in regulating metabolic states, making the DUBs interesting candidate regulators of mitochondrial repression.</p>
<p>In this study, using an <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> DUB knock-out library-based screen, we identified the evolutionarily conserved deubiquitinase Ubp3 (mammalian Usp10) as required for mitochondrial repression in high glucose. Loss of Ubp3 resulted in mitochondrial activation, along with a reduction in the glycolytic enzymes-phosphofructokinase 1 (Pfk1) and GAPDH (Tdh2 and Tdh3). This consequently reroutes glucose flux and increases trehalose biosynthesis. This metabolic rewiring increases Pi release from trehalose synthesis, and decreases Pi consumption in glycolysis, to cumulatively increase Pi pools. Using <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells along with independent analysis of wild-type cells, and isolated mitochondrial fractions, we establish that glycolytic-flux dependent Pi allocations to mitochondria determines mitochondrial activity. Through these data, we propose how intracellular Pi balance as controlled by glycolytic flux, is a biochemical constraint for mitochondrial repression.</p>

<title>A deubiquitinase deletion screen identifies Ubp3 as a regulator of glucose-mediated mitochondrial repression</title>
<p>In cells such as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, high glucose represses mitochondrial activity as well as OXPHOS-dependent ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">De Deken, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Postma et al., 1989</xref>) (illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Our initial objective was to identify proteostasis regulators of glucose-mediated mitochondrial repression. We generated and used a deubiquitinase (DUB) deletion strain library of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>), to unbiasedly identify regulators of mitochondrial repression by measuring the fluorescence intensity of a potentiometric dye Mitotracker CMXRos (illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Using this screen, we identified DUB mutants with altered mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1 A</xref>). Note: WT cells in a respiratory medium (2% ethanol) were used as a control to estimate maximum mitotracker fluorescence intensity (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>A prominent ‘hit’ was the evolutionarily conserved deubiquitinase Ubp3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), (homologous to mammalian Usp10) (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1D</xref>). Due to its high degree of conservation across eukaryotes (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1D</xref>) as well as putative roles in metabolism or mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Isasa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nostramo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ossareh-Nazari et al., 2010</xref>), we focused our further attention on this DUB. Cells lacking Ubp3 showed an ∼1.5-fold increase in mitotracker fluorescence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A, C</xref>). Cells with catalyticaly inactive Ubp3 (Ubp3<sup>C469A</sup>), showed increased mitochondrial potential comparable to <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). This data confirmed that Ubp3 catalytic activity of is required to fully repress mitochondrial activity under high glucose. The catalytic site mutation did not affect steady-state Ubp3 levels (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, to assess the requirement of Ubp3 for mitochondrial function, we quantified the electron transport chain (ETC) complex IV subunit Cox2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fontanesi et al., 2006</xref>)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> had higher Cox2 than WT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). As a control, we estimated total mitochondrial content in WT and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells, using either estimates of the structural protein Tom70, or measuring the fluorescence-intensity in strains engineered with mitochondrial targeted mNeonGreen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dua et al., 2022</xref>). There was no increase in the total mitochondrial volume (estimated by measuring the intensity of mitochondria targeted mNeon green) (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1F</xref>) or mitochondrial outer membrane protein Tom70 (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1G</xref>). This suggests that the increased Cox2 is not merely because of higher total mitochondrial content. We next measured the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>, and basal OCR was higher in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>, indicating higher respiration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we asked if mitochondrial ATP synthesis was higher in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>. The total ATP levels in WT and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> were comparable (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). However, upon treatment with the ETC complex IV inhibitor sodium azide, ATP levels in WT were higher than <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>, contributing to ∼60% of the total ATP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). In contrast, the ATP levels in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> after sodium azide treatment were ∼ 40% of the total ATP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). These data suggest a higher contribution of mitochondrial ATP synthesis towards the total ATP pool in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>.</p>
<p>We next asked if <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> required higher mitochondrial activity for growth, using a series of mitochondrial activity inhibitors and comparing relative growth. In high glucose, WT cells show minimal growth inhibition in the presence of sodium azide, indicating lower reliance on mitochondrial function (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Contrastingly, <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> or Ubp3<sup>C469A</sup> show a severe growth defect in the presence of the mitochondrial ETC complex inhbitors sodium azide and oligomycin, and the mitochondrial OXPHOS uncoupler FCCP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1H</xref>). Additionally, the loss of Ubp3 in respiration defective cox2-62 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bonnefoy et al., 2001</xref>), or Rho0 cells (which lacks mitochondrial DNA) resulted in a severe growth defect (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1I</xref>). Deletion of ATP synthase subunits Atp1 and Atp10 also results in a severe growth defect in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> compared to WT (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1I</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the loss of Ubp3 makes cells dependent on mitochondrial ATP synthesis in high glucose.</p>
<p>In order to address whether the deletion of Ubp3 might increase ubiquitinated proteins and consequent proteostatic stress, we analysed the global ubquitination state in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells. WT and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells grown under brief (1 hour) heat stress, which increases protein ubiquitination, was used as a control. However, we did not observe a significant increase in the global ubiqutinatin state in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1J</xref>). This suggests that the altered mitochondrial metabolism in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells is unlikely to be due to proteostatic stress.</p>
<p>Collectively these data show that in 2% glucose, <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> have high mitochondrial activity, respiration, and rely on this mitochondrial function for ATP production and growth. We therefore decided to use <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells to start delineating requirements for glucose-mediated mitochondrial repression.</p>

<title>Key glycolytic enzymes decrease and glucose flux is rerouted in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells</title>
<p>Glucose-6 phosphate (G6P) is the central node in glucose metabolism where carbon-allocations are made towards distinct metabolic arms, primarily: glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and trehalose biosynthesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We first compared amounts of two key (‘rate-controling’) glycolytic enzymes - Phosphofructokinase 1 (Pfk1), GAPDH isozymes (Tdh2, Tdh3) (Nelson et al., 2008), along with the enolase isozymes (Eno1, Eno2) in WT and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells. Pfk1, Tdh2, and Tdh3 substantially decreased in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (but not Eno1 and Eno2) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Since deubiquitinases can control protein amounts by regulating proteasomal degradation, we asked if the decrease in Pfk1, Tdh2 and Tdh3 in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> is due to proteasomal degradation. To test this, we measured the levels of these enzymes in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> after treatement with proteasomal inhibitor MG132. We did not observe any rescue in the levels of these enzymes in MG132 treated samples, suggesting that the decreased levels of these enzymes were not due to increased proteasomal degradation (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1B</xref>). To further understand if these enzyme transcripts are altered in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>, we measured the mRNA levels of PFK1, TDH2 and TDH3 in WT, <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> and Ubp3<sup>C469A</sup> cells. The transcripts of all the three genes in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> and Ubp3<sup>C469A</sup> cells decreased (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that Ubp3 regulates the transcripts of these glycolytic enzyme genes. The reduction in the Pfk and GAPDH enzyme amounts was intriguing, because the Pfk and GAPDH steps are critical in determining glycolytic flux (Nelson et al., 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Shestov et al., 2014</xref>). A reduction in these enzymes could therefore decrease glycolytic flux, and would reroute glucose (G6P) allocations via mass action towards other branches of glucose metabolism, primarily the pentose phosphate pathway as well as trehalose biosynthesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). To assess this, we first measured the steady-state levels of key glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) intermediates, and trehalose in WT or <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> using targeted LC-MS/MS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1D</xref>). Glucose-6/fructose-6 phosphate (G6P/F6P) increased in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Concurrently, trehalose, and the PPP intermediates ribose 5-phosphate (R5P) and sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (S7P), increased in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>Since steady-state metabolite amounts cannot separate production from utilization, in order to unambiguously assess if glycolytic flux is reduced in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells, we utilized a pulse labeling of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub> glucose, following which the label incorporation into glycolytic and other intermediates was measured. Note that because glycolytic flux is very high in yeast, this experiment would require rapid pulsing and extraction of metabolites in order to stay in a linear range and avoid label saturation. We therefore established a very short time point of label-addition, quenching and metabolite extraction post <sup>13</sup>C glucose pulse. Since flux saturates/reaches steady-state in seconds, we first ensured that the label incorporation into individual metabolites after the <sup>13</sup>C glucose pulse was in the linear range, and for early glycolytic intermediates this was seconds after glucose addition. This new methodology is extensively described in materials and methods, with required controls shown in <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1F</xref>. WT and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells were grown in high glucose, pulsed with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub> glucose, and the relative <sup>13</sup>C label incorporation into glycolytic intermediates and trehalose were measured, as shown in the schematic (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1E</xref>). In <italic>ubp3Δ,</italic> <sup>13</sup>C label incorporation into G6P/F6P as well as trehalose substantially increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Contrastingly, <sup>13</sup>C label incorporation into glycolytic intermediates F1,6BP, G3P, 3PG and PEP decreased, indicating decreased glycolytic flux (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). We next measured ethanol concentrations and production rates, as an additional output of relative glycolytic rates. We observed decreased steady-state ethanol levels, as well as ethanol production rates in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>Glycolysis-derived pyruvate is transported to mitochondria and fuels the TCA cycle. Therefore, we asked if the decreased glycolytic rate result in a decrease in the TCA cycle flux as well. To test this, we first measured the steady state levels of TCA cycle intermediates in WT or <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> using targeted LC-MS/MS. We did not observe any significant change in the levels of TCA cycle intermediates in <italic>ubp3Δ,</italic> except malate which showed a significant decrease in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2A</xref>). Next, in order to assess if TCA cycle flux reduces in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells, WT and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells were grown in high glucose, pulsed with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub> glucose, and the relative <sup>13</sup>C label incorporation into TCA cycle intermediates was measured, as shown in the schematic (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2B</xref>). The kinetics of <sup>13</sup>C label incorporation in TCA cycle intermediates are shown in <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2C</xref>. We did not observe any significant change in the relative <sup>13</sup>C label incorporation in TCA cycle intermediates in <italic>ubp3Δ.</italic> Therefore, these data suggest that the decreased glycolytic flux in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> does not result in a decrease in TCA cycle flux. The increased respiration and mitochondrial activity in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells is therefore driven via other factors.</p>
<p>Collectively, these results reveal that that reduced Pfk1 and GAPDH (in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>) decrease glucose flux via glycolysis, which results in rewired glucose flux towards trehalose biosynthesis and the PPP.</p>

<title>Rerouted glucose flux results in phosphate (Pi) accumulation</title>
<p>We therefore asked if the proteomic state, as observed in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells, could provide clues to explain the coupling between mitochondrial derepression and rerouted glucose flux. A recent study by Isasa et al., had systematically quantified the changes in protein levels in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Isasa et al., 2015</xref>).

<p>One explanation for mitochondrial repression can be an internal competition for shared metabolites/co-factors between (cytosolic) glycolytic and mitochondrial processes, that mitochondria might not be sufficiently able to access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Diaz-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Koobs, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rodríguez-Enríquez et al., 2001</xref>). In this context, a plausible role for inorganic phosphate (Pi) in regulating mitochondrial repression can be hypothesized. Cytosolic glycolysis requires rapid, high consumption of net Pi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mason et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rodríguez-Enríquez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Van Heerden et al., 2014</xref>), and this could possibly limit the Pi that is continuously available for mitochondrial use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brazy et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Koobs, 1972</xref>), thereby repressing mitochondria. Contextually, the balance between reactions releasing vs consuming Pi could explain changes in global Pi levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gupta and Laxman, 2021</xref>). A continuous hub of Pi consumption is glycolysis. Here, GAPDH catalyzes G3P to 1,3BPG, converting ADP to ATP, while concurrently consuming a molecule of Pi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hohmann et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Van Heerden et al., 2014</xref>). This Pi that goes into ATP will subsequently be used for nucleotide biosynthesis, polyphosphate biosynthesis and protein phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gupta and Laxman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hunter, 2012</xref>). Therefore, we can surmise that in high glycolytic flux, the production of ATP, nucleotides and polyphosphates is concurrent with Pi consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Austin and Mayer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hohmann et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier, 2012</xref>). Could this reaction therefore limit cytosolic Pi for the mitochondria (as illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>)? Notably, <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> have reduced GAPDH levels and decreased glycolytic flux. Second, trehalose synthesis is a Pi releasing reaction, and a major source of free Pi that is critical for Pi homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gupta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Van Heerden et al., 2014</xref>). Flux through this reaction is also substantially higher in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>. Therefore, these cells might have increased Pi release (via trehalose), coupled with decreased Pi consumption (via decreased GAPDH). We therefore asked if total Pi increases in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>)?</p>
<p>To test this, we directly assessed total Pi levels in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> and WT. <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells had higher Pi than WT, and this was comparable to Pi in WT grown in excess Pi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly, Pi amounts also increased in Ubp3<sup>C469A</sup> (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, the loss of Ubp3 increases intracellular Pi levels. Next, we asked if <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells exhibit signatures of a ‘high Pi’ state. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> maintains internal Pi balance by controlling the expression of multiple genes collectively known as the Pho regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mouillon and Persson, 2006</xref>). The Pho regulon is induced under Pi limitation, and repressed during Pi sufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gupta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mouillon and Persson, 2006</xref>). We assessed two major Pho proteins (Pho84: a high-affinity membrane Pi transporter, and Pho12: an acid phosphatase) in WT and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> in high glucose. <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells have lower amounts of Pho84 and Pho12 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Further, upon shifting to low Pi for one hour, Pho84 and Pho12 increased in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>. These data suggest that reduced Pho84 and Pho12 amounts in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> are because of increased Pi, and not due to altered Pho regulon function itself (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). These data clarify earlier observations from <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> which noted reduced Pho proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Isasa et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> constitutively have higher Pi, and likely a consequent decrease in Pho proteins.</p>
<p>We next asked if the increased Pi in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> is because of altered G6P allocations towards different end-points, particularly trehalose synthesis, which can be a major node of Pi restoration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gupta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Van Heerden et al., 2014</xref>). We assessed the contribution of increased trehalose synthesis towards the high Pi in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>, by estimating Pi levels in the absence of trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase (Tps2), which catalyzes the Pi-releasing step in trehalose synthesis. Notably, loss of Tps2 in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> decreased Pi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). There was no additive difference in Pi between <italic>tps2Δ</italic> and <italic>ubp3Δtps2Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). As an added control, we assessed trehalose in WT and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> in the absence of Tps2, and found no difference (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, increasing G6P flux towards trehalose biosynthesis is a major source of the increased Pi in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>.</p>
<p>Since the major GAPDH isozymes, Tdh2 and Tdh3, are reduced in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>, we directly asked if reducing GAPDH can decrease Pi consumption and increase Pi. To assess this, we generated <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic> cells, which exhibit a growth defect, but are viable, permitting further analysis. <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic> had higher Pi in high glucose (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Expectedly, we observed a decrease in ethanol in <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1C</xref>), along with an accumulation of F1,6 BP and G3P, and decreased 3PG and PEP (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, G6P and trehalose levels between WT and <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic> were comparable (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). These data sugest that unlike in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>, the increased Pi in <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic> comes mainly from decreased Pi consumption (GAPDH step). To further assess the role of reduced glycolytic flux in increasing Pi (<italic>ubp3Δ</italic> and <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic>), we measured the Pi in these cells growing in a gluconeogenic medium – 2%, ethanol. In this scenario, the GAPDH catalyzed reaction will be reversed, converting 1,3BPG to G3P, which should release and not consume Pi. Compared to WT, the Pi levels decreased in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> and <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), suggesting that the changes in Pi in these mutants is driven by the relative change in Pi release vs consumption.</p>
<p>These results collectively indicate that the combined effect of increased Pi release coming from trehalose synthesis, and decreased Pi consumption from reduced GAPDH increase Pi levels in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial Pi availability correlates with mitochondrial activity in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic></title>
<p>We therefore wondered if this observed Pi increase from the combined rewiring of glucose metabolism resulted in more Pi becoming accessible to the mitochondria. This would effectively result in Pi budgeting between cytosolic glycolysis and mitochondria based on the relative flux in different arms of glucose metabolism, by increasing Pi availability for the mitochondria (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). If this were indeed so, a prediction would be that the pool of Pi in the mitochondria of <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells would be higher than WT cells, while the opposite would be expected in the cytosolic fraction of these cells, due to increased Pi in the mitochondria. To test if this were so, we first measured the cytosolic pools of Pi in WT and <italic>ubp3Δ.</italic> The cytosolic fraction was isolated (extensive experimental details are in the SI appendix) from WT and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells, and Pi levels in this fraction were estimated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B</xref>). We observed significantly reduced Pi in the cytosolic fraction in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells. Since total cellular Pi amounts is higher in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), a decreased cytolosolic Pi would be consistent with greater transport of Pi from cytosol to other organelles such as vacuole (where it is stored as polyphosphate) and/or mitochondria. Therefore, we next asked if the mitochondria in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> have correspondingly increased Pi. Mitochondria were isolated by immunoprecipitation from WT and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>, the isolation efficiency was analyzed (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A</xref>), and relative Pi levels compared. Pi levels were normalised to Idh1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase) in isolated mitochondria, since Idh1 protein levels did not decrease in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B</xref>), and consistent with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Isasa et al., 2015</xref>). Mitochondrial Pi was higher in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). We next asked if the increased mitochondrial activity in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> is a consequence of high Pi. If this were so, <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic> should partially phenocopy <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> with respect to mitochondrial activity. Consistently, <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic> have higher mitotracker intensity as well as Cox2 levels compared to WT (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Also consistent with this, a high basal OCR in <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic> was observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), together indicating high mitochondrial activity in <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic>, which is comparable to <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>.</p>

<p>We next asked if higher Pi is necessary to increase mitochondrial activity in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> and <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic>. Since glycolysis is defective in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> and <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic>, it is necessary to distinguish the effect of high Pi vs. only the effect of low glycolysis in activating mitochondria. Logically, if decreased glycolysis (independent of Pi) is sufficient to activate mitochondria, bringing down the Pi levels in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> to that of WT should not affect mitochondrial activity. Notably, <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> grown in low (1 mM) Pi have Pi levels similar to WT in standard (normal Pi) medium (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1D</xref>). <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> grown in low Pi also had decreased ethanol, suggesting reduced glycolysis (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1E</xref>). Therefore, we used this condition to further understand the role of Pi in inducing mitochondrial activity. Mitotracker fluorescence decreased in both <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> and <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic> in low Pi (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1F</xref>). Note: basal mitotracker fluorescence in WT also decreases in low Pi, which is consistent with a required role of Pi for mitochondrial activity (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1F</xref>). Similarly, Cox2 levels were reduced in both <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> and <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Consistent with both reduced mitotracker intensity and Cox2 levels, basal OCR also decreased in both <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> and <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic> in low Pi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). As an additional control, we used Rho0 strains (which have no mitochondrial DNA and therefore lack functional ETC) to compare basal OCR. The expectation in these strains is that basal OCR will not change if Pi changes. Consistently, we did not observe any significant difference in basal OCR in WT, <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> in low Pi in a Rho0 strain background (which lacks mitochondrial DNA) (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1G</xref>). These data collectively suggest that high intracellular Pi is necessary to increase mitochondrial activity in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> and <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic>.</p>
<p>Next, we asked how mitochondrial Pi transport regulates mitochondrial activity. Mir1 and Pic2 are mitochondrial Pi transporters, with Mir1 being the major Pi transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Murakami et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zara et al., 1996</xref>). We first limited mitochondrial Pi availability in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> by knocking-out <italic>MIR1</italic>. In <italic>mir1Δ</italic>, the increased Cox2 observed in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> was no longer observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Consistent with this, we observed no further increase in the basal OCR in <italic>mir1Δubp3Δ</italic> compared to <italic>mir1Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>mir1Δ</italic> showed decreased Cox2 as well as basal OCR even in WT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). These data together suggest that mitochondrial Pi transport is critical for increasing mitochondrial activity in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic>, and in maintaining basal mitochondrial activity even in high glucose.</p>
<p>As a control, no significant increase in Mir1 and Pic2 was observed in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1H</xref>), suggesting that <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> do not increase mitochondrial Pi by merely increasing the Pi transporters, but rather by increasing available Pi pools.</p>
<p>Taken together, these data suggest the possibility that the altered Pi homeostais in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells increases the mitochondrial Pi pool. This increased mitochondrial Pi pool correlates with increased mitochondrial activity. Decreasing mitochondrial Pi by either reducing total Pi, or by reducing mitochondrial Pi transport decreases mitochondrial activity.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial Pi availability constrains mitochondrial activity under high glucose</title>
<p>So far, these data suggest that the cytosolic Pi available for the mitochondria can determine the extent of mitochondrial activity. Therefore, we further investigated if mitochondrial Pi allocation was a necessary constraint for glucose-mediated mitochondrial repression.</p>
<p>To test this, we first asked how important mitochondrial Pi transport was to switch to increased respiration. In WT yeast, low glucose or glycolytic inhibition will result in increased respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Broach, 2012</xref>). What happens therefore if we restrict mitochondrial Pi in this context? For this, we measured the basal OCR in WT and <italic>mir1Δ</italic> after switching from high (2%) to low (0.1%) glucose. We observed a significant increase in the basal OCR in WT but not in <italic>mir1Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The alternate scenario is after glycolytic inhibition. We assessed the role of mitochondrial Pi in this context, by inhibiting glycolysis using 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). WT, but not <italic>mir1Δ</italic>, increased their OCR (respiration) upon a 1-hour treatment with 2DG (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Consistent with this, mitotracker fluorescence increased with an increase in 2DG in WT, but not in <italic>mir1Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A</xref>). We further asked if the mitochondrial Pi transporter itself glucose repressed, and therefore assessed Mir1 amounts in high and low glucose. Mir1 levels are higher upon a shift to low glucose, and in cells grown in 2% ethanol, suggesting that Mir1 is glucose repressed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data suggest that mitochondrial Pi transport is necessary for increasing mitochondrial activity after glucose derepression.</p>

<p>We next asked whether just adding external Pi was sufficient to increase mitochondrial activity, when cells are in high glucose. In medium supplemented with excess Pi, the internal Pi increases as seen earlier (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Therefore, a simplistic assumption would be that the addition of external Pi to cells in high glucose would also increase mitochondrial Pi. However, an alternate possibility presents itself whererin since glycolytic flux is already high in glucose, supplementing Pi will continue to fuel glycolysis. Indeed, this was originally obseved by Harden and Young in 1908, where adding Pi increased fermentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Harden and Young, 1906</xref>). In such a scenario, there could be an increase in the cytosolic Pi but not the mitochondrial Pi. We estimated the cytosolic and mitochondrial Pi in this condition where excess Pi was externally supplemented. Notably, cells grown in high Pi had increased cytosolic Pi, but decreased mitochondrial Pi (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1C</xref>), without any changes in total mitochondria volume or amounts (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, directly adding Pi to cells growing in high glucose also decreased basal OCR (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1E</xref>), consistent with decreased mitochondrial Pi. These data indicate that in high glucose, simply supplementing Pi will not increase Pi access to the mitochondria, and instead results in an accumulation of Pi in the cytosol (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1C</xref>). We therefore now asked, if we inhibit glycolytic flux and then supplement Pi, what would happen to mitochondrial activity. For this, we treated cells with 2DG, and subsequently added Pi and measured the OCR (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1F</xref>). In this case, supplementing Pi increased the basal OCR (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1F</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that a combination of decreasing glycolysis and increasing Pi can together increase respiration. Next, in order to directly test mitochondrial activation based on external Pi availability, we isolated mitochondria, and estimated activity <italic>in vitro</italic> upon adding increasing Pi. Mitochondrial activity increased with increased Pi, with maximum activity observed with 25 mM Pi supplemented (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). In a complementary experiment, we overexpressed the Mir1 transporter in wild-type cells, to increase Pi within mitochondria (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1G</xref>). Mir1-OE cells have higher Cox2 levels and basal OCR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E, 5F</xref>). Therefore, increasing Pi transport to mitochondria is sufficient to increase mitochondrial activity in high glucose.</p>
<p>Mitochondrial pyruvate transport is also required for mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Timoń-Gómez et al., 2013</xref>). We asked where Pi availability stands in a hierarchy of constraints for mitochondrial derepression, as compared to mitochondrial pyruvate transport. We measured the amounts of the Mpc3 subunit of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bender et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Timoń-Gómez et al., 2013</xref>). Mpc3 protein increases in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1H</xref>). This also correlated with the unimpaired TCA cycle flux (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2D</xref>) and the increased mitochondrial activity. Interestingly, in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> grown in low Pi, Mpc3 further increased (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1H</xref>), but as shown earlier this condition cannot increase OCR or mitochondrial activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1F</xref>). Basal Mpc3 levels decrease in <italic>mir1Δ</italic>, but upon shifting to 0.1% glucose, Mpc3 increases in both WT and <italic>mir1Δ</italic>, with higher levels in <italic>mir1Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1I</xref>). Therefore, even where Mpc3 is high (<italic>ubp3Δ</italic> in low Pi, and <italic>mir1Δ</italic> in low glucose), mitochondrial activity remains low if Pi is restricted (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F, 4H</xref>). There was also no decrease in basal OCR in <italic>mpc3Δ</italic> in high glucose, and the basal OCR increased to the same level as of WT after shifting to 0.1% glucose (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1J</xref>). Since Mpc3 changes with mitochondrial Pi availability (Figure S5G, S5H), we also measured Mpc3 in the Mir1OE. No further changes in Mpc3 were observed in Mir1OE (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1K</xref>), indicating that increasing mitochondrial Pi alone need not increase Mpc3. Overall, although Mpc3 levels corelate with decreased glycolysis (<italic>ubp3Δ</italic> - <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1H</xref>, <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> in low Pi-<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1H</xref>, low glucose - <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1I</xref>), increased Mpc3 alone cannot increase mitochondrial activity and respiration in the absence of adequate mitochondrial Pi.</p>
<p>Collectively, mitochondrial Pi availability constrains glucose-mediated mitochondrial repression. Increasing available pools of Pi to enter the mitochondria is sufficient to induce mitochondrial activity.</p>

<title>Repression of mitochondrial respiration via Pi budgeting is conserved in Ubp3 mutants across diverse yeast genetic backgrounds</title>
<p>So far, we have identified a role for intracellular Pi budgeting as a constraint for mitochondrial activity under high glucose. These were all carried out using a robust, prototrophic yeast strain from a CEN.PK background. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> however, while Crabtree positive, have tremendous genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Peter et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore asked if this mitochondrial repression through Pi budgeting (mediated by Ubp3 function) is conserved across other strains of <italic>S. cerevsiae</italic> as well. To test this, we generated Ubp3 deletion mutants in different genetic backgrounds of <italic>S.</italic> cerevsiae, including BY4742, W303 and Σ1278. In all these strain backgrounds, we observed a significant increase in mitotracker fluorescne intensity and Cox2 protein levels in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, B</xref>). This suggests the role of Ubp3 as a regulator of mitochondrial repression, independent of the genetic background of the yeast (<italic>S. cerevsiae</italic>) strain. To further assess if loss of Ubp3 shows a concurrent increase in Pi levels, we measured the total Pi levels in WT and <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> in a W303 strain background.

<p>Finally, we asked how important mitochondrial Pi transport was for growth, under glycolytic inhibition. Consistent with the requirement for mitochondrial Pi transport to increase mitochondrial respiration upon glycolytic inhibition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), WT cells only exhibit a slightly decreased growth in the presence of 2DG (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we highlight a role for Pi budgeting between cytosolic glycolysis and mitochondrial processes (which compete for Pi) in constraining mitochondrial repression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Ubp3 controls this process (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), by maintaining the amounts of the glycolytic enzymes Pfk1 and GAPDH (Tdh2 and Tdh3) and thereby allows high glycolytic flux. At high fermentation rates, glycolytic enzymes levels at maximal activity maintain high glycolytic rates (effectively following zero-order kinetics), and therefore, changes in the enzyme levels will have a direct, proportionate effect on flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grigaitis and Teusink, 2022</xref>). The loss of Ubp3 decreases glycolytic flux, resulting in a systems-level, mass-action based rewiring of glucose metabolism where more G6P is routed towards trehalose synthesis and PPP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Indeed, inhibiting just phosphofructokinase can reroute glucose flux from glycolysis to PPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hollinshead et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Miyazawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Yi et al., 2012</xref>), and our study now permits contextualized interpretations of these results. Such reallocations of glucose flux will collectively increase overall Pi, coming from the combined effect of increased Pi release from trehalose synthesis, and decreased Pi consumption via reduced GAPDH. This altered intracellular Pi economy increases Pi pools available to mitochondria, and increasing mitochondrial Pi is necessary and sufficient to increase respiration in high glucose (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Mitochondrial Pi transport maintains mitochondrial activity in high glucose, and increases mitochondrial activity in low glucose (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Finally, the mitochondrial Pi transporter Mir1 itself decreases in high glucose (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, this glucose-dependent repression of Mir1 also restricts mitochondrial Pi availability (and thereby activity) in high glucose.</p>
<p>Traditionally, loss-of-function mutants of metabolic enzymes are used to understand metabolic state regulation. This approach negates nuanced investigations, since metabolic enzymes are often essential for viability. Furthermore, metabolic pathways have multiple, contextually regulated nodes, through which cells maintain their metabolic state. Therefore, alternate approaches to identify global regulators of metabolic states (as opposed to single enzymes), might uncover ways via which multiple nodes are simultaneously tuned, and can reveal unanticipated systems-level principles of metabolic state rewiring. In this study of glucose-mediated mitochondrial repression, the loss of the DUB Ubp3 decreases glycolytic flux by reducing the enzymes at two critical nodes in the pathway - Pfk1 and GAPDH. Unlike loss of function mutants, a reduction in amounts will only rewire metabolic flux. By ‘hitting’ multiple steps in glycolysis simultaneously, <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> have decreased Pi consumption, as well as increased Pi release. Such a cumulative phenomenon reveals more than inhibiting only GAPDH, where increased Pi comes only from reduced Pi consumption, and not from increased trehalose biosynthesis. Our serendipitous identification of a regulator which regulates multiple steps in glucose metabolism to change the metabolic environment, now suggests a general basis of mitochondrial regulation that would have otherwise remained hidden. Separately, finding the substrates of Ubp3 and whether Ubp3 directly regulates glycolytic enzymes are exciting future research questions requiring concurrent innovations in accessible chemical-biological approaches to study DUBs.</p>
<p>Because phosphates are ubiquitous, it is challenging to identify hierarchies of Pi-dependent processes in metabolic state regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gupta and Laxman, 2021</xref>). Phosphate transfer reactions are the foundation of metabolism, driving multiple, thermodynamically unfavorable reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kamerlin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Westheimer, 1987</xref>). Contextually, the laws of mass action predict that the relative rates of these reactions will regulate overall Pi balance, and contrarily the Pi allocation to Pi-dependent reactions will determine reaction rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gupta and Laxman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Van Heerden et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, cells might control Pi allocations for different reactions via compartmentalizing Pi in organelles, to spatially restrict Pi availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Booth and Guidotti, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Solesio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Vila et al., 2022</xref>). Our data collectively suggest a paradigm where the combination of factors regulates mitochondrial Pi and thereby activity. In glycolytic yeast cells growing in high glucose, mitochondrial Pi availability becomes restricted due to higher utilization of Pi in glycolysis compared to mitochondria. Consistent with this, a rapid decrease in Pi upon glucose addition has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hohmann et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Koobs, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rodríguez-Enríquez et al., 2001</xref>). Interesting, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies with isolated mitochondria from tumor cells also find that decreasing Pi levels decreases respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rodríguez-Enríquez et al., 2001</xref>), which would be consistent with this scenario. Further, supplementing Pi correlates with decreased mitochondrial repression in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brin and McKee, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Koobs, 1972</xref>). By increasing Pi through a systems-level rewiring of glucose metabolism (such as in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells), cells can collectively increase mitochondrial access to Pi. This Pi budgeting determines mitochondrial activity. Supplementing Pi under conditions of low glycolysis (where mitochondrial Pi transport is enhanced), as well as directly supplementing Pi to isolated mitochondria, increases respiration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, this increased respiration does not happen upon directly supplementing Pi to highly glycolytic WT cells, where the Pi increases in cytosol, without increasing mitochondrial Pi (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, in order to derepress mitochondria, a combination of increased Pi along with decreased glycolysis is required. An additional systems-level phenomenon that might regulate Pi transport to the mitochondria is the decrease in cytosolic pH upon decreased glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dechant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Orij et al., 2011</xref>). The cytosolic pH in highly glycolytic cells is ∼7, and decreasing glycolysis results in cytosolic acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dechant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Orij et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, under conditions of decreased glycolysis (2DG treatment, deletion of Ubp3, and decreased GAPDH activity), cytosolic pH becomes acidic. Since mitochondrial Pi transport itself is dependent on the proton gradient, a low cytosolic pH would favour mitochondrial Pi transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hamel et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, under conditions of decreased glycolysis (2DG treatment, or loss of Ubp3, or decreased GAPDH activity), where cytosolic pH would be acidic, increasing cytosolic Pi might indirectly increase mitochondria Pi transport, thereby leading to increased respiration. Alternately, increasing mitochondrial Pi transporter amounts can achieve the same result, as seen by overexpressing Mir1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). A similar observation has been reported in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, reiterating an evolutionarily conserved role for mitochondrial Pi in controlling respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jia et al., 2015</xref>). Relatedly, glycolytic inhibition can suppress cell proliferation in Warburg-positive tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">O’Neill et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pelicano et al., 2006</xref>), or inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Soto-Heredero et al., 2020</xref>). However, these cells survive by switching to mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shiratori et al., 2019</xref>), requiring alternate approaches to prevent their proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>). Inhibiting mitochondrial Pi transport in combination with glycolytic inhibition could restrict the proliferation of Warburg/Crabtree positive cells. It is important to highlight that our experiments, whether involving Pi supplementation or Pi limitations, maintain the cellular Pi concentration within the millimolar range, and are conducted within a short timeframe (∼ 1 hour). This differs significantly from Pi starvation studies, where cells are subjected to prolonged and complete Pi deprivation. In those contexts, cells trigger extensive metabolic adaptations in order to sustain available Pi pools including an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential which can be independent of respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ouyang et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Since its discovery in the 1920s, the phenomenon of accelerated glycolysis with concurrent mitochondrial repression has been intensely researched. Yet, the biochemical constraints for glucose-mediated mitochondrial repression remains unresolved. One hypothesis suggests that the availability of glycolytic intermediates might determine the extent of mitochondrial repression. F1,6BP inhibits complex III and IV of the electron transport chain (ETC) in Crabtree positive yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Diaz-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Díaz-Ruiz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hammad et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lemus et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, the ratio between G6P and F1,6BP regulates the extent of mitochondrial repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Díaz-Ruiz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lemus et al., 2018</xref>). Although G6P/F6P accumulates in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), this is not the case in <italic>tdh2Δtdh3Δ</italic> (GAPDH mutant) (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that G6P/F6P accumulation in itself is not the criterion to increase mitochondrial activity. Separately, the competition for common metabolites/co-factors between glycolysis and respiration (such as ADP, Pi or pyruvate) could drive this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Diaz-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Koobs, 1972</xref>). Here we observe that Mpc3 mediated mitochondrial pyruvate transport alone cannot increase respiration. An additional consideration is the possible contribution of changes in ADP in regulating mitochondrial activity, where the use of ADP in glycolysis might limit mitochondrial ADP. Therefore, when Pi changes as a consequence of glycolysis, it coud be imagined that a change in ADP balance can coincidentally occur. However, prior studies show that even though cytosolic ADP decreases in the presence of glucose, this does not limit mitochondrial ADP uptake, or decrease respiration, due to the very high affinity of the mitochondrial ADP transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Diaz-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rodríguez-Enríquez et al., 2001</xref>). These collectively reiterate the importance of Pi access and transport to mitochondria in constraining mitochondrial respiration. Indeed, this interpretation can also contextually explain observations from other model systems where mitochondrial Pi transport seems to regulate respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Scheibye-Knudsen and Quistorff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Seifert et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>We parsimoniously suggest that Pi access to the mitochondria as a key constraint for mitochondrial repression under high glucose. In a hypothetical scenario, a single-step event in evolution, reducing mitochondrial Pi transporter amounts, and/or increasing glycolytic flux (to deplete cytosolic Pi), will result in whole-scale metabolic rewiring to repress mitochondria. More elaborate regulatory events can easily be imagined as subsequent adaptations to enforce mitochondrial repression. Given the central role played by Pi, something as fundamental as access to Pi will constrain mitochondrial repression. Concurrently, the rapid incorporation of Pi into faster glycolysis can give cells a competitive advantage, while also sequestering Pi in the form of usable ATP. Over the course of evolution, this could conceivably drive other regulatory mechanisms to enforce mitochondrial repression, leading to the currently observed complex regulatory networks and signaling programs observed in the Crabtree effect, and other examples of glucose-dependent mitochondrial repression.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The study by Vengayil et al. presented a role for Ubp3 for mediating inorganic phosphate (Pi) compartmentalization in cytosol and mitochondria, which regulates metabolic flux between cytosolic glycolysis and mitochondrial processes. Although the exact function of increased Pi in mitochondria is not investigated, findings have valuable implications for understanding the metabolic interplay between glycolysis and respiration under glucose-rich conditions. They showed that UBP3 KO cells regulated decreased glycolytic flux by reducing the key Pi-dependent-glycolytic enzyme abundances, consequently increasing Pi compartmentalization to mitochondria. Increased mitochondria Pi increases oxygen consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential, indicative of increased oxidative phosphorylation. In conclusion, the authors reported that the Pi utilization by cytosolic glycolytic enzymes is a key process for mitochondrial repression under glucose conditions.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>This reviewer appreciates the author's responses addressing some of the concerns.</p>
<p>(1) However, the concern of reproducibility and experimental methods applied to the study is still valid, particularly considering that many conclusions were drawn from western blot analysis. The authors used separate gel loading controls for western blot analysis, which is not a valid method. Considering loading and other errors/discrepancies during the transfer phase of the assay, the direct control should be analyzing the membrane after transfer or using an internal control antibody on the same membrane. None of the western blots are indicated with marker sizes, and it isn't very clear how many repeats there are and whether those repeats are biological or technical repeats.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this concern. This point requires detailed clarification regarding two key points: the first one regarding the use of Coomassie stained gels over internal ‘housekeeping gene’ antibodies, and the second one regarding the challenges in performing controls for western blots In case of high abundance proteins such as glycolytic enzymes.</p>
<p>(1) In our western blots, we have used Coomassie stained gel as a loading control for all our western blots. This is performed by cutting one half of the gel and using it for transfer followed by blotting and using the other half for Coomassie staining. I.e. This is not two separate gels that are loaded, but the same gel. Practically, this is no different from cutting a membrane to blot with different antibodies. This method is of course valid method for normalizing western blot data, and is used by multiple studies, for the reasons mentioned below. The historical use of a ‘house-keeping’ gene as a loading control for western blotting <italic>assumes</italic> that the protein levels of these does not change under different conditions. However, this approach has multiple, severe limitations (since a ‘housekeeping gene’ is entirely contextual, and indeed), and therefore it is correct to use <italic>total protein</italic> as a loading control. This is indeed recommended for use by multiple studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027015001909">Collins et al., 2015</ext-link>). Coomassie staining for total protein is far more reliable than using house-keeping genes as a loading control in western blots (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21186791/">Welinder and Ekblad, 2011</ext-link>). A notable example would be GAPDH itself, which is widely used as a loading control in many studies. As is clear from our data in this manuscript, GAPDH levels itself decrease in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells. Had we used GAPDH as a loading control, we wouldn’t have identified the decrease in glycolytic enzymes in <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells, and this story would have met with a tragic fate very early on in its inception. We have in fact be very careful with these quantitations, and even before loading samples on gels, they are first normalized using a standard protein estimation assay (Bradford), followed by normalized loading, followed by cutting the gel into two parts - one for coomassie staining and protein normalization, and the other for the western blot for the respective proteins. However, in point (2) below, we clarify on why sometimes we have to load a separate gel with normalized protein, which should resolve this point.</p>
<p>(2) Glycolytic enzymes are highly abundant proteins and to achieve a signal in the linear range of western blot, the protein extracts have to be diluted (up to 25 or 50 times). As discussed under point 1, an internal control ‘housekeeping gene’ antibody is not a reliable method to use as loading control. Even if we want to use an antibody for an internal protein as a control, there are not many proteins that are as abundant as metabolic enzymes and because of this simple reason, the sample dilution results in these proteins not getting detected in the western blot since the signal will be below the limit of detection. This leaves using a separate gel loading control as the only easy to perform, reliable option.</p>
<p>We would like to further highlight the fact that the changes in metabolic enzymes and ETC proteins that we observe in the ubp3 mutant by western blot, were also independently observed by large scale untargeted quantitative proteomics study by  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4802358/">Isasa et al., 2015</ext-link>), which we cite extensively in this manuscript. Since an entirelyindependent study, using a completely different (untargeted) method has also shown very similar  changes in proteins that we observe (mitochondrial, and glycolytic enzymes), there should be no room for doubt regarding the altered glycolytic enzyme and ETC protein  levels that we discover in this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>None of the western blots are indicated with marker sizes</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have clearly indicated the marker sizes in all our western blots. Separately, raw images of the blots and Coomassie stained gels have been provided with the manuscript raw data, and is therefore easily available for any interested reader.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It isn't very clear how many repeats there are and whether those repeats are biological or technical repeats.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have already clearly indicated the details of each blot in the figure legends. For example <italic>“A representative blot (out of three biological replicates, n=3) and their quantifications are shown. Data represent mean ± SD.”</italic> We kindly request the reviewer to thoroughly go through the figure legends for details regarding the western blots, or any other data. We hope this addresses all the reviewer concerns regarding the credibility of our western blot results and the method of using Coomassie stained gels as loading controls in this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Concern regarding citing the Ouyang et al. paper is still valid. This paper is an essential implication in phosphate metabolism and is directly related to some of the findings associated with mitochondrial function, along with conflicting results, which should be discussed in the discussion section. As a reviewer, I do not request citing any paper from the authors in general; however, considering some of the conflicting results here, citing and discussing paper from Ouyang et al. will improve the interoperation/value of their findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned in detail in our previous response  letter, we do not believe that the study from Ouyang et al., present ‘conflicting results’ of any kind. Nevertheless, in response to the reviewer's suggestion, we have revised the discussion section of our manuscript and added a few points that  incorporate the insights from Ouyang et al. These are in the discussion section (“It is important to highlight that our experiments, whether involving Pi supplementation or Pi limitations, maintain the cellular Pi concentration within the millimolar range and are conducted within a short timeframe (~ 1 hour). This differs significantly from Pi starvation studies, where cells are subjected to prolonged and complete Pi deprivation, triggering extensive metabolic adjustments to sustain available Pi pools, such as an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential, independent of respiration”). We trust that this modification will enhance the interested readers' understanding of our study's overarching conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Cells cultured in high glucose tend to repress mitochondrial biogenesis and activity, a prevailing phenotype type called Crabree effect that observed in different cell types and cancer. Many signaling pathways have been put forward to explain this effect. Vengayil et al proposed a new mechanism involved in Ubp3/Ubp10 and phosphate that controls the glucose repression of mitochondria. The central hypothesis is that ∆ubp3 shift the glycolysis to trehalose synthesis, therefore lead to the increase of Pi availability in the cytosol, then mitochondrial received more Pi and therefore the glucose repression is reduced.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength is that the authors used an array of different assays to test their hypothesis. Most assays were well designed and controlled.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I think the main conclusions are not strongly supported by the current dataset. Here are my comments on authors' response and model.</p>
<p>(1) The authors addressed some of my concerns related to ∆ubp3. But based on the results they observed and discussed, the ∆ubp3 redirect some glycolytic flux to gluconeogenesis while the 0.1% glucose in WT does not. Similarly, the shift of glycolysis to trehalose synthesis is also not relevant to the WT cells cultured in low glucose situation. This should be discussed in the manuscript to make sure readers are not misled to think ∆ubp3 mimic low glucose. It is likely that ∆ubp3 induce proteostasis stress, which is known to activate respiration and trehalose synthesis.</p>
<p>But based on the results they observed and discussed, the ∆ubp3 redirect some glycolytic flux to gluconeogenesis while the 0.1% glucose in WT does not. Similarly, the shift of glycolysis to trehalose synthesis is also not relevant to the WT cells cultured in low glucose situation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to clarify that we do not observe a redirection of glycolytic flux to gluconeogenesis in ubp3 mutant. What we observe is a rewiring of glycolytic flux into increased trehalose synthesis and PPP, and decreased glycolysis. Also, the shift of glycolysis to trehalose synthesis is relevant to WT cells cultured in low glucose. It is a well-known fact that the trehalose synthesis increases with decrease in media glucose. In case of 0.1% glucose, this increase in trehalose is not due to an increase in gluconeogenesis (since the pathways utilizing alternate carbon sources still remain repressed  in 0.1% glucose (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2958.2003.03478.x?sid=nlm%3Apubmed">Yin et al., 2003</ext-link>)), but by the increase in glycolytic flux towards trehalose. This is also supported by increase in Tps2 protein levels upon decreasing glucose concentration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S258900422202082X#:~:text=The%20key%20to%20yeast%20osmoregulation,protein%20kinase%20(MAPK)%20pathway.&amp;text=In%20particular%2C%20the%20redistribution%20of,a%20major%20process%20in%20osmoadaptation.">Shen et al., 2023</ext-link>). We will also note that there are very few studies that actually estimate gluconeogenic flux in cess (and they only rely on steady state measurements). Estimating gluconeogenic flux appropriately is challenging in itself (eg. see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1011202">Niphadkar et al 2024</ext-link>).</p>
<p>In case of glucose concentrations lower than 0.1%, the shift to trehalose synthesis might not be as relevant. We observe that the glycolysis defective mutant <italic>tdh2tdh3</italic> cells does not show an increase in trehalose synthesis (Figure 3-figure supplement 1E). However, in this context, the decrease in the rate of GAPDH catalyzed reaction alone appears to be sufficient to increase the Pi levels (Figure 3F) even without an increase in trehalose. Therefore, there might be differences in the relative contributions of these two arms towards Pi balance, based on whether it is low glucose in the environment, or a mutant such as <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> that modulates glycolytic flux. In <italic>ubp3Δ</italic> cells, the combination of low rate of GAPDH catalyzed reaction and high trehalose will happen (based on how glycolytic flux is modulated), vs only the low rate of the GAPDH catalyzed reaction in <italic>tdh2tdh3</italic> cells. As an end point the increase in Pi happens in both cases, but this happens via slightly differing outcomes. Also note: in terms of free Pi sources a low-glucose condition (with low glycolytic rate) is very different from a <italic>no-glucose, respiratory condition</italic> (where cells perform very high gluconeogenesis, at a rate that is an order of magnitude higher than in low glucose). In respiration-reliant conditions such as in ethanol, cells switch to high gluconeogenesis, where there is a large increase in trehalose synthesis as a default (eg see Varahan et al 2019). In this condition, trehalose synthesis could become a major source for Pi (eg see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63341">Gupta 2021</ext-link>). This could also support the increased mitochondrial respiration. In an ethanol-only medium, the directionality of the GAPDH reaction is itself reversed (i.e. G-1,3-BP → G-3-P). Therefore, this reaction now becomes an added source of Pi, instead of a net consumer of Pi (see illustration in Figure 3G). Therefore, a very reasonable inference is that a combination of increased trehalose and increased 1,3 BPG to G3P conversion can become a Pi source, supporting increased mitochondrial respiration in a non-glucose, respiratory medium.</p>
<p>We have now clarified these points in the discussion section in the updated version of our manuscript. Lines xxx. We hope that this updated discussion section satisfies the reviewer’s concern regarding how relevant the increase in trehalose synthesis is for altered Pi balance and increased mitochondrial respiration in WT cells.</p>

<p>It is likely that ∆ubp3 induce proteostasis stress, which is known to activate respiration and trehalose synthesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Apart from some <italic>general</italic> changes in metabolism, there are no reports whatsoever that suggest that general proteostasis stress can results in an extensive, precise metabolic rewiring - where there is an increased in respiration, mitochondrial de-repression, precise decrease in two limiting glycolytic enzyme levels, and a precise reduction in glycolytic flux, as observed in the ubp3 mutant. If this was the case, deletion of <italic>any</italic> deubiquitinase should result in an increase in trehalose and respiration which clearly does not happen (as is already clear from the large screen shown in Figure 1)</p>
<p>However, in response to this query, we performed experiments to assess the extent of proteostasis stress in ubp3 mutants. For this, we have now estimated the changes in global ubiquitination in WT vs ubp3 mutant, and compared this with conditions of moderate proteostasis stress (mild heat shock at 42C/~1hr). These data are now included in the revised manuscript as Figure 1- figure supplement 1J. Notably, our analysis reveals only very minor  alteration in global ubiquitination levels in ubp3 mutants compared to WT cells. This is in very stark contrast to  limited heat stress, where a clear increase in global ubiquitination can be easily observed. Given these data, we can conclude that there is no significant general proteostatic stress in ubp3 mutants, that could induce substantial metabolic rewiring of such precise nature.</p>

<p>(2) Pi flux: it is known that vacuole can compensate the reduction of Pi in the cytosol. The paper they cited in the response, especially the Van Heerden et al., 2014 showed that the pulse addition of glucose caused transient Pi reduction and then it came back to normal level after 10min or so. If the authors mean the transient change of glycolysis and respiration, they should point that out clearly in the abstract and introduction. If the authors are trying to put out a general model, then the model must be reconsidered.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Van Heerden et al., the pulse addition of glucose causes transient Pi reduction due to rapid Pi consumption in glycolysis. The phosphate levels came back to normal level because of the glucose flux into trehalose synthesis releasing free Pi. This is the entire crux of the study and this is the reason why tps2 mutants which cannot synthesize trehalose exhibit a growth defect and have decreased Pi levels. As explained in detail in our early response, the cellular Pi levels are maintained by a relative balance of reactions that consume and release Pi and therefore a change in this balance can change Pi as well. Indeed, if this were not the case, the tps2 mutants would simply maintain the Pi levels similar to WT cells by increasing Pi transport from the medium, which is clearly not the case (eg see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63341">Gupta 2021</ext-link>).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The cytosol has ~50mM Pi (van Eunen et al., 2010 FEBSJ), while only 1-2mM of glycolysis metabolites, not sure why partial reduction of several glycolysis enzymes will cause significant changes in cytosolic Pi level and make Pi the limiting factor for mitochondrial respiration. In response to this comment, the authors explained the metabolic flux that the rapid, continuous glycolysis will drain the Pi pool even each glycolytic metabolite is only 1-2mM. However, the metabolic flux both consume and release Pi, that's why there is such measurement of overall free Pi concentration amid the active metabolism. One possibility is that the observed cytosolic Pi level changes was caused by the measurement fluctuation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The measurement fluctuations that we mentioned in our previous response letter was in case of cells grown in high and low glucose, where there are multiple factors such as mitochondrial amount which complicates the Pi measurements. In case of ubp3 mutants which have a similar amount of total mitochondria as that of WT cells, there is minimal fluctuation for Pi measurement. We have done extensive standardization of mitochondrial isolation and Pi measurement in the isolated mitochondria (as explained in detail in the manuscript) to minimize any such fluctuations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct in pointing out that metabolic flux consume and release Pi. However, in glucose grown yeast cells, the rate of glycolysis which is a Pi consuming reaction is higher than any other metabolic pathway. In fact, the glycolytic rate in glucose-grown <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is one of the highest ever observed in any living system. A decrease in glycolysis and an increase in trehalose therefore shifts the balance in Pi utilization and results in increased free Pi in ubp3 cells. For a more detailed theoretical reasoning on the consumption and production of Pi, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63341">Gupta 2021</ext-link>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Importantly, the authors measured Pi inside mito for ethanol and glucose, but not the cytosolic Pi, which is the key hypothesis in their model. The model here is that the glycolysis competes with mito for free cytosolic Pi, so it needs to inhibit glycolysis to free up cytosolic Pi for mitochondrial import to increase respiration. I don't see measurement of cytosolic Pi upon different conditions, only the total Pi or mito Pi. The fact is that in Fig.3C they saw WT+Pi in the medium increase total free Pi more than the ∆ubc3, while WT decrease mito Pi compared to WT control and ∆ubc3 and therefore decrease basal OCR upon Pi supplement. A simple math of Pitotal = Pi cyto + Pi mito tells us that if WT has more Pitotal (Fig.3C) but less Pi mito (fig.5 supp 1C), then it has higher Pi cyto. This is contradictory to what the authors tried to rationalize. Furthermore, as I pointed out previously, the isolated mitochondria can import more Pi when supplemented, so if there is indeed higher Picyto, then the mito in WT should import more Pi. So, to address these contradictory points, the authors must measure Pi in the cytosol, which is a critical experiment not done for their model. For example, they hypothesized that adding 2-DG, or ∆ubp3, suppress glycolysis and thus increase the supply of cytosolic Pi for mito to import, but no cytosolic Pi was measured (need absolute value, not the relative fold changes). It is also important to specific how the experiments are done, was the measurement done shortly after adding 2-DG. Given that the cells response to glucose changes/pulses differently in transient vs stable state, the authors are encouraged to specify that.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>As clearly described in the manuscript, the key hypothesis that emerges is the role of the availability/accessibility of Pi for the mitochondria, in the context of activity. As discussed in detail in the discussion section, this can come from a combination of available Pi pools in the cytosol <italic>and</italic> increased transport of this Pi to the mitochondria. While it is true that the decreased glycolysis in ubp3 mutants frees up available Pi pools in the cytosol, measurement of cytosolic Pi in these mutants growing in log phase might not necessarily show an increased cytosolic Pi, if the Pi is being actively transported the the mitochondria at a rate higher that the WT, as indicated by the ~6 fold increase in mitochondrial Pi in ubp3 cells. This would require tools such as intracellular fluorescence based-Pi sensors that could accurately capture temporal changes in cytosolic and mitochondrial Pi following glycolytic inhibition. However, these tools are not available till date for use in yeast and measuring cytosolic Pi following glycolytic inhibition over time using colorimetric Pi assays are extremely difficult.</p>
<p>However, the reviewer does correctly state that we had not included measurement of cytosolic Pi. Since the mitochondrial Pi estimate was itself a very challenging (and critical) experiment we had originally thought that data was sufficient. We have therefore now performed a series of new experiments, where we first enrich the cytosolic fraction (without mitochondrial contamination), and estimated cytosolic Pi amounts in WT and ubp3 cells. Our Pi measurements indicate a cytosolic Pi concentration in the range of ~35 mM, which is similar to the earlier reported values in yeast. We further observe that the cytosolic Pi is about ~25% lower in ubp3 mutants (~25-27 mM) compared to WT cells (Figure 4B). As mentioned earlier, this would be consistent with higher transport of Pi from the cytosol to the mitochondria in these cells. Effectively, ubp3 cells have a total increase in cellular Pi, and with a Pi pool distribution such that there is increased Pi availability in mitochondria (Figure 4B). This further substantiates this hypothesis of an increased Pi allocation to mitochondria in ubp3 mutants. The reason for increased rate of Pi transport to mitochondria is not immediately clear, but could also come from changes in cytosolic pH - a possibility that we suggest in our discussion, and is discussed in a later section of this response letter as well.</p>

<p>In WT cells supplemented with external Pi (WT+Pi), there is an increased total Pi, but a decreased mitochondrial Pi. As discussed in the discussion section in the manuscript, this could be due to the supplemented Pi not being transported to mitochondria. The reviewer is correct in pointing out that as per simple math this should mean that the cytosolic Pi in WT+Pi should be high. We have now assessed cytosolic Pi upon external Pi supplementation, and this is exactly what we observe in our cytosolic Pi measurements now included in the revised manuscript (Figure 5-figure supplement 5C). There is a higher cytosolic Pi in WT+Pi (~52 mM) compared to WT cells (~35 mM) and ubp3 cells (~27 mM). We have now pointed this out in the discussion section in the revised manuscript “Notably, this increased respiration does not happen upon direct Pi supplementation to highly glycolytic WT cells, where the Pi accumulates in cytosol, without increasing mitochondrial Pi (Figure 5-figure supplement 1C).” We hope that these new data completely addresses the reviewer’s concern regarding the Pi allocations in case of WT+Pi cells.</p>

<p>We would like to clarify that the Pi measurements in WT+Pi absolutely do not contradict our hypothesis. Furthermore, nowhere do we claim that an increase in cytosolic Pi will increase mitochondrial Pi!! On the contrary, we explain in detail that supplementing Pi to WT cells (which increases cytosolic Pi) will not increase respiration if the increased Pi is not being transported to mitochondria. This is exactly what happens in WT+Pi, where Pi accumulates in the cytosol but does not result in increased mitochondrial Pi. The reviewer argues that if there is higher cyto Pi, mitochondria should import more Pi. This is true in case of transport via diffusion where the external concentration dictates the direction of metabolite transport, but is fundamentally wrong in case of transport of metabolites where active transporters and additional regulators are involved. This is the entire basis of the idea of metabolic compartmentalisation where  cells maintain pools of metabolites in different organelles which regulate the cellular metabolic state. A well-studied example is pyruvate, whose cytosolic concentration is high in glycolytic cells, but it's transport to mitochondria is reduced in glycolysis to maintain cytosolic fermentation. As discussed in the manuscript, a logical explanation for Pi supplementation not increasing respiration and mitochondria Pi is that there might be mechanisms in highly glycolytic cells that restrict the transport of Pi to mitochondria, thereby compartmentalizing Pi in the cytosol. One such possible mechanism is pH (discussed in a later section) and it is possible that there are other mechanisms involved.</p>
<p>In case of isolated mitochondria, Pi supplementation results in an increased respiration simply because it is an <italic>in vitro</italic> set up where we supplement metabolites such as pyruvate, malate and ADP along with phosphate to ensure that mitochondria is actively respiring and in this case Pi will be consumed since it is being used for ATP synthesis. This is entirely different from an <italic>in vivo</italic> scenario where cells are glycolytic, and mechanisms to prevent mitochondrial transport of metabolites such as pyruvate and phosphate are active.</p>

<p>Cells were treated with 2-DG for one hour and respiration was measured. We have mentioned these details clearly in the figure legends and methods.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>d) The most likely model to me is that, which is also the consensus in the field, is that no matter 2-DG or ∆ubp3, the cells re-wiring metabolism in both cytosol and mitochondria, and it is the total network shift that cause the mitochondrial respiration increase, which requires the increase of mito import of Pi, ADP, O2, and substrates, but not caused/controlled by the Pi that singled out by the authors in their model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The aim of our study is only to highlight the importance of mitochondrial Pi availability as a critical factor in controlling mitochondrial respiration. Of course this would require sufficient other factors such as ADP, substrates and oxygen. It cannot be otherwise. However, as we point out in the discussion, a major limiting factor might be Pi availability. While the altered glycolysis in ubp3 mutants might control availability of other factors such as pyruvate and ADP, this is not the focus of our study. We would also like to point out that prior studies show that even though cytosolic ADP decreases in the presence of glucose, this does  not limit mitochondrial ADP uptake, or decrease respiration, due to the very high affinity of the mitochondrial ADP transporter. This is discussed in our discussion section as well. Further we show that the levels of ETC proteins can be altered by changing Pi levels, which places Pi as a major regulator of respiration. We would like to point out once again that studies in other systems have also highlighted a major role of mitochondrial Pi availability in controlling respiration. These references are included in our manuscript (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18989695/">Scheibye-Knudsen</ext-link> et al., 2009, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26091567/">Seifer et al., 2015</ext-link>). This includes a recent study in T cells that clearly shows increased mitochondrial respiration upon overexpressing mitochondrial Pi transporter SLC25A3 alone (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42634-3">Wu et al., 2023</ext-link>). Our manuscript now in fact provides a contextual explanation of these diverse observations from other cellular systems where mitochondrial Pi transport appears to regulate respiration.</p>

<p>(3) The explanation that cytosolic pH reduction upon glucose depletion/2DG is a mistake. There are a lot of data in the literature showing the opposite. If the authors do think this is true, then need to show the data. Again, it is important to distinguish transient vs stable state for pH changes.</p>

<p>We observe that directly supplementing Pi to WT cells growing in high glucose does not result in higher mitochondrial Pi or increased respiration. However, supplementing Pi to WT cells increases mitochondrial respiration in the presence of glycolytic inhibitor 2-DG. We therefore merely suggest that cytosolic pH could be an additional regulator of mitochondrial Pi transport, since this will be consistent with the differences in mitochondrial Pi transport in highly glycolytic cells, and cells with decreased glycolysis ( such as 2-DG addition and ubp3 mutant). This is because in mitochondria, Pi is co-transported along with protons. Therefore, changes in cytosolic pH (which changes the proton gradient) will control the mitochondrial Pi transport (Hamel et al., 2004).  The glycolytic rate is itself a major factor that controls cytosolic pH. The cytosolic pH in highly glycolytic cells is maintained ~7, and decreasing glycolysis results in cytosolic acidification (Orij et al., 2011). Therefore, under conditions of decreased glycolysis (such as loss of Ubp3), cytosolic pH becomes acidic. Since mitochondrial Pi transport depends on the proton gradient, a low cytosolic pH would favour mitochondrial Pi transport. Therefore, under conditions of decreased glycolysis (2DG treatment, or loss of Ubp3), where cytosolic pH would be acidic, increasing cytosolic Pi might indirectly increase mitochondria Pi transport, thereby leading to increased respiration. But we certainly do leave alternate interpretations to the imagination of any reader, and are indeed open to them. These are all exciting future directions this study will enable a contextual interpretation of.</p>

<p>We have cited two independent studies which suggest that cytosolic pH decreases upon a decrease in glycolysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304416511000602#:~:text=Nearly%20all%20processes%20in%20living,as%20the%20availability%20of%20nutrients.">Orij et al.,2011</ext-link> ,<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20581803/">Dechant et al., 2010</ext-link>). This control of cytosolic pH by the glycolytic rate has been extensively shown using glycolytic mutants, cells in low glucose and cells grown in the presence of glycolytic inhibitors. According to the reviewer, this is a mistake and</p>

<p>In our literature review we did not come across any relevant studies that actually show the opposite. If the  reviewer still thinks this is a mistake, the reviewer is welcome to include some of the relevant literature that clearly shows the opposite in the comments, with actual measurements of cytosolic pH. Additionally,  the possible role of cytosolic pH in this context does not affect the conclusions of our study, and we only include this as a possibility in the discussion. Therefore, this is obviously well beyond the scope of experiments in our current study, and considering the extensive data from multiple studies that shows that cytosolic pH decreases under low glycolysis, there is no relevance  to including experiments to address the same in this study. We leave this as a point for an interested reader to think about, and it certainly can nucleate new directions of future study.</p>
