<title>Abstract</title><p>Overnutrition engenders the expansion of adipose tissue and the accumulation of immune cells, in particular, macrophages, in the adipose tissue, leading to chronic low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance. In obesity, several proinflammatory subpopulations of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) identified hitherto include the conventional “M1-like” CD11C-expressing ATM and the newly discovered metabolically activated CD9-expressing ATM; however, the relationship among ATM subpopulations is unclear. The ER stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) is activated in the adipocytes and immune cells under obesity. It is unknown whether targeting IRE1α is capable of reversing insulin resistance and obesity and modulating the metabolically activated ATMs. We report that pharmacological inhibition of IRE1α RNase significantly ameliorates insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in male mice with diet-induced obesity. IRE1α inhibition also increases thermogenesis and energy expenditure, and hence protects against high fat diet-induced obesity. Our study shows that the “M1-like” CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs are largely overlapping with but yet non-identical to CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs in obese white adipose tissue. Notably, IRE1α inhibition diminishes the accumulation of obesity-induced metabolically activated ATMs and “M1-like” ATMs, resulting in the curtailment of adipose inflammation and ensuing reactivation of thermogenesis, without augmentation of the alternatively activated M2 macrophage population. Our findings suggest the potential of targeting IRE1α for the therapeutic treatment of insulin resistance and obesity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Overnutrition and obesity are closely associated with insulin resistance which serves as a common precursor to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and other metabolic disorders. Under chronic energy overload, adipose tissue expands significantly for the storage of the excess energy in the form of lipids and this expansion coincides with the recruitment and accumulation of immune cells, in particular macrophages, in adipose tissue. Once the lipid storage capacity is reached, adipocytes can no longer incorporate lipids from the circulation but instead release fatty acids into the circulation through lipolysis. Meanwhile, the excess accumulation of immune cells in the adipose tissue leads to chronic low-grade inflammation, including aberrant proinflammatory cytokine production, in the adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Weisberg, McCann et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Xu, Barnes et al. 2003</xref>). Both aberrant adipocyte lipolysis and adipose tissue inflammation are known to exacerbate each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Foley, Chen et al. 2021</xref>) and are regarded as key factors contributing to insulin resistance in obesity.</p>
<p>The accumulated adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) were initially thought to undergo a phenotypic polarization from an anti-inflammatory M2 to a pro-inflammatory M1 state, promoting local and systemic inflammation with the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lumeng, Bodzin et al. 2007</xref>). However, there is a growing body of evidence that does not support this obesity-induced M1/M2 polarization model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Xu, Grijalva et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kratz, Coats et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Coats, Schoenfelt et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hill, Lim et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jaitin, Adlung et al. 2019</xref>). Instead, recent studies have identified a predominant population of ATMs that emerge in obesity and present a metabolically activated phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Xu, Grijalva et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kratz, Coats et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Coats, Schoenfelt et al. 2017</xref>). The metabolically activated ATMs have lately been shown to express CD9 and/or Trem2 by studies using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hill, Lim et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jaitin, Adlung et al. 2019</xref>). These obesity-associated metabolically active ATMs not only potentiate inflammation but also promote dead adipocyte clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kratz, Coats et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Coats, Schoenfelt et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hill, Lim et al. 2018</xref>). However, the relationship between the previously identified “M1-like” CD11c+ ATMs and the new CD9<sup>+</sup> and/or Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATM subpopulations is unclear.</p>
<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a major site for protein synthesis and folding and the synthesis of lipid and sterol. When the demand for protein folding in the ER exceeds its capacity, ER stress occurs. The three ER stress sensors, inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE)-1, PKR-like ER-regulating kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor (ATF)-6, are then activated to trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR) that initially serves as an adaptive means to resolve ER stress, but will eventually become maladaptive if the perturbation persists. IRE1α, the most evolutionarily conserved among the UPR sensors, is an ER transmembrane protein with dual serine/threonine kinase and RNase domains and once activated, can catalyze the unconventionally cleavage of XBP1 mRNA for XBP1 translation or initiate a process termed regulated IRE1-dependent decay of RNA (RIDD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fonseca, Gromada et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Back and Kaufman 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Papa 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hetz, Chevet et al. 2013</xref>). IRE1α activation was reported to induce/potentiate inflammatory cytokine production and inflammation through the control of transcriptional regulation and intracellular signaling pathways via its dual enzymatic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Martinon, Chen et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lerner, Upton et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Oslowski, Hara et al. 2012</xref>). ER stress and IRE1α activation has been reported in both human and rodent obese adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boden, Duan et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gregor, Yang et al. 2009</xref>) and in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue where ATMs are enriched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shan, Wang et al. 2017</xref>). Recent studies have implicated ER stress as an early event of nutrient excess in the development of insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ozcan, Cao et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boden, Duan et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cnop, Foufelle et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kawasaki, Asada et al. 2012</xref>). Accordingly, targeting ER stress/IRE1α has been proposed as a direction for the improvement of insulin resistance in obesity and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hetz, Chevet et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Marciniak, Chambers et al. 2021</xref>)</p>
<p>However, thus far, the exact role of IRE1α on the adipose function and remodeling remains inconclusive. For example, adipocyte-specific knockout of IRE1α was shown to promote brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) and alleviate diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance by suppressing its RNase-mediated degradation of the mRNA of thermogenic gene PGC1α and hence elevating UCP1 level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen, Wu et al. 2022</xref>). On the other hand, other studies reported that the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway is required for the transcriptional induction of UCP1 in brown adipocyte in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Asada, Kanemoto et al. 2015</xref>) and is indispensable for proper adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sha, He et al. 2009</xref>). Additionally, inhibiting IRE1α kinase activity was found to be sufficient enough to block the inflammation-induced lipolysis in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Foley, Chen et al. 2021</xref>), which contrasts with the observation that adipocyte deletion of IRE1α promotes β3-AR agonist-stimulated WAT lipolysis as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen, Wu et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The function of IRE1α on adipose tissue remodeling and insulin resistance has also been shown through its activity in ATMs. Deletion of IRE1α in myeloid lineage including macrophage was recently shown to prevent mice from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shan, Wang et al. 2017</xref>). The IRE1α deletion was reported to achieve this by reversing the obesity-induced M1/M2 polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shan, Wang et al. 2017</xref>), leading to the augmented M2 population in adipose tissue that induces BAT activation and WAT remodeling through the synthesis and action of catecholamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nguyen, Qiu et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shan, Wang et al. 2017</xref>). However, it was recently reported that the alternatively activated M2 macrophages do not synthesize catecholamines or contribute to adipose tissue adaptive thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fischer, Ruiz et al. 2017</xref>). Moreover, as mentioned above, the obesity-associated ATMs were recently shown to not undergo the classical M1/M2 switch but to adopt a metabolic activation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Xu, Grijalva et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kratz, Coats et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hill, Lim et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jaitin, Adlung et al. 2019</xref>). It is therefore unclear what changes in the ATM under IRE1α deletion are accountable for the protection against obesity and insulin resistance as observed in the myeloid-specific IRE1α knockout model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shan, Wang et al. 2017</xref>). It is unknown whether IRE1α inhibition has any effect on the obesity-induced metabolically activated ATM population.</p>
<p>In this study, we used a pharmacological inhibitor of IRE1α STF-083010 (STF) to investigate the effect of IRE1α inhibition on insulin resistance and obesity in the adult male mice. We observed that STF treatment improves insulin sensitivity and protects against weight gain in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. IRE1α inhibition also reverses the high fat diet (HFD)-induced whitening of BAT and WAT remodeling and increases thermogenesis. Notably, STF treatment suppressed the M2 ATM subpopulation in the DIO mice. Our studies also showed that IRE1α inhibition diminishes the obesity-elicited pro-inflammatory ATM subpopulations including the newly identified CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs and adipose inflammation which is known to suppress thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sakamoto, Takahashi et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Goto, Naknukool et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sakamoto, Nitta et al. 2016</xref>). In all, our study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which IRE1α inhibition protects against obesity and insulin resistance and serves as a foundation for targeting IRE1α as a therapeutic means in the treatment of obesity and insulin resistance.</p>

<title>Animal Studies</title>
<p>C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Jackson laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were kept in an animal facility with a 12 h light/dark cycle and temperature of 22 °C. All animals had access to diet and water ad libitum. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Oklahoma Health Science Center. All experiments were performed with age-matched male mice. The C57BL/6J male mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) (60% kcal fat, Bio-Serv, NJ, USA) at the age of 5-6 weeks. At the 8-week HFD feeding, mice were randomly divided into two groups and were administered with either vehicle (10% DMSO) or STF (10 mg/kg body weight in 10% DMSO) once daily through the route of intraperitoneal injection. Blood glucose levels were measured using the OneTouch Ultra2 glucometer after fasting for 6 h. Body weights were measured weekly.</p>

<title>Adipose stromal vascular fraction (SVF) isolation and flow cytometry</title>
<p>Mice were sacrificed and the epididymal visceral white adipose tissue (eWAT) was immediately washed by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The tissue was placed in 10-cm petri dish and excised into tiny bits with scissors at room temperature. Transfer the fine chopped tissue pieces in 10 mL plain DMEM containing Collagenase P (0.45 mg/mL) in 50 mL tubes. Keep the tubes in 37 C incubator shaker at a speed of 200 rpm for 30-40 minutes. Add 5 mL of media containing FBS to each tube and pipette well and spin at 700 g rcf for 10 minutes at 4°C. Remove gently all the supernatants, and the remaining pellet is stromal vascular fraction (reddish brown –containing RBC). For flow cytometry, cells were resuspended in sterile FACS buffer, then filter through 70 µm strainer and centrifuge at 1000 rpm at 4°C for 5 minutes. Resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of 1X RBC lysis buffer solution (Sigma) and incubated on ice for 2-3 min. Add 10 mL of PBS and spin the cells at 1100 rpm for 5 minutes. The resulting cell suspension was incubated with Fc Block (BD Biosciences) prior to staining with conjugated antibodies for 20 min at 4°C followed by 2 washes in FACS buffer. Samples were stained using the following antibodies: PerCP-conjugated anti-mouse CD45 (Cat# 110725, RRID:AB_893347), FITC-conjugated anti-mouse F4/80 (Cat# 123108, RRID:AB_893502), PE-conjugated anti-mouse/human CD11b (Cat# 101207, RRID:AB_312790), BV421-conjugated anti-mouse CD11c, (Cat# 117330, RRID:AB_11219593), Alexa Fluor 700-conjugated anti-mouse CD206 (Cat# 141734, RRID:AB_2629637), PE Dazzle594-conjugated anti-mouse CD9 (Cat# 124821, RRID:AB_2800601), and PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-mouse CD63 (Cat# 143909, RRID:AB_2565499), purchased from Biolegend. APC-conjugated Trem2 (Cat# FAB17291N, RRID:AB_3646995, R&amp;D Systems). Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls were included in the flow experiments. Cells were analyzed using Aurora Spectral Flow Cytometer (Cytek) and FlowJo software (FlowJo 10.10, LLC). Sorting was performed using MoFloXDP (Beckman Coulter). Single cells were sorted into 1.5 mL tube containing 50 μL of DMEM medium. Immediately after sorting, tubes were spun down and removed the medium, snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C until further processing.</p>

<title>IRE1α RNase inhibition ameliorates insulin resistance in mice with diet-induced obesity</title>
<p>We first examined whether the ER stress response/UPR pathway was altered in the adipose tissues of animals with obesity. In C57B/6J mice fed high fat diet for 14 weeks, we observed that the mRNA levels of genes representing all three branches of UPR [spliced <italic>Xbp1</italic> (<italic>Xbp1s</italic>) for IRE1α branch, <italic>Atf4</italic> and <italic>Chop</italic> for PERK branch, and <italic>Edem1</italic> and <italic>Bip</italic> for ATF6 branch] were up-regulated in both epididymal white adipose tissues (eWAT) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) and inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) (Fig. S1A). As IRE1α activation is associated with the IRE1-dependent decay of mRNA (RIDD) activity in which IRE1 cleaves mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hollien and Weissman 2006</xref>), we analyzed the mRNA levels of two RIDD targets <italic>Blos1</italic> and <italic>Col6a1</italic> by qRT-PCR. We observed that <italic>Blos1</italic> and <italic>Col6a1</italic> mRNA levels were decreased in the eWAT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) while <italic>Col6a1</italic> mRNA level was also down-regulated in the iWAT (Fig. S1B) of HFD-fed mice. These results suggest the over-nutrition/obesity triggers ER stress and IRE1α activity in adipose tissue.</p>

<p>We then asked whether IRE1α activation contributes to obesity-induced insulin resistance and importantly whether pharmacological inhibition of IRE1α can reverse the pre-existing obesity-induced insulin resistance. We used STF-083010 (STF), a member of hydroxy-aryl-aldehyde class of IRE1α RNase inhibitors that engage the RNase-active site of IRE1a with high affinity and specificity by exploiting a shallow complementary pocket through pi-stacking interactions with His910 and Phe889 and an essential Schiff base interaction between the aldehyde moiety of the inhibitor and the side chain amino group of Lys907 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sanches, Duffy et al. 2014</xref>), to treat diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice with established insulin resistance. Male C57B/6J mice fed on HFD for 8 weeks gained significant glucose intolerance (Fig. S1C) and were treated with STF at 10 mg/kg of BW once daily for 4 weeks (Fig. S1D) via IP injection, a dose previously shown to significantly inhibits IRE1α RNase activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Papandreou, Denko et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tufanli, Telkoparan Akillilar et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Herlea-Pana, Eeda et al. 2021</xref>), while still on HFD. We observed that STF treatment improved glucose tolerance with lower peak glucose level and decreased AOC (area of the curve) in response to a bolus of exogenous glucose compared to their vehicle-treated counterpart (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-C’</xref>). STF treatment significantly improved insulin sensitivity in DIO mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-D’</xref>). We also observed markedly decreased resting and glucose-stimulated plasma levels of insulin in DIO mice treated with STF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), indicative of increased insulin sensitivity in the STF-treated mice. To investigate whether the increased insulin sensitivity by STF is reflected in insulin signaling, we examined the phosphorylation status of Akt, an effector of insulin signaling pathway, in the adipose tissue. Contrary to the significant enhancement in the insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 observed in the epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) of non-HFD lean animals, the insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was blunted in the eWAT of DIO mice. However, STF treatment significantly reversed the insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F-F’</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that STF improves insulin sensitivity and glucose control under HFD.</p>
<p>To investigate whether the STF amelioration of insulin resistance and obesity reflects on its inhibition of IRE1α activity in adipose tissue, we examined the status of IRE1α-mediated <italic>Xbp1</italic> mRNA splicing in WAT from STF-treated DIO mice and observed that as assessed by RT-PCR followed by electrophoretic separation, the level of spliced <italic>Xbp1</italic> (<italic>XBP1s</italic>) mRNA was significantly reduced in both eWAT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G-G’</xref>) and iWAT (Fig. S1E-E’) from STF-treated animals relative to vehicle group. Moreover, the mRNA levels of XBP1 target genes <italic>Bip</italic> and <italic>Edem1</italic> were highly suppressed in both eWAT and iWAT from STF-treated mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref> and S1F). Interestingly, we also observed the decrease in the mRNA levels of <italic>Atf4</italic> and <italic>Chop</italic>, key components of the PERK pathway in eWAT and iWAT of STF-treated DIO mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref> and S1F). The effect of STF treatment on PERK pathway in the adipose tissue probably reflects the positive feedback loops among the branches of UPR under in vivo conditions as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tsuru, Fujimoto et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Márton, Kurucz et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kapuy, Márton et al. 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>STF protects against diet-induced obesity and obesity-associate morbidities</title>
<p>We observed that while vehicle-treated mice continued to gain weight on HFD, 4-week STF treatment slightly decreased the body weight (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and S2A), with no apparent food intake difference between the vehicle and STF groups (Fig. S2B). Body composition analysis using EchoMRI also revealed that STF treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the fat mass but without significant changes in the lean mass (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and Fig. S2C) in the HFD-fed mice. We next analyzed the size of adipocytes in WAT sections and observed that adipocytes were significantly smaller from STF-treated DIO mice than that of vehicle-treated ones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>) as shown in both average diameters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>) and frequencies in large adipocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>) in both eWAT and inguinal WAT (iWAT). The average area of adipocytes was similarly significantly shrunk in the eWAT (Fig. S2D) and iWAT (Fig. S2E) of DIO mice treated with STF relative to vehicle treatment. In addition, there was a significant reduction in lipid droplets in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) from STF-treated DIO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I-J</xref>).</p>

<p>A common comorbidity of obesity and insulin resistance is metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Khan, Bril et al. 2019</xref>). We therefore investigated the potential effects of STF on liver steatosis in obesity. First, we examined the liver histology in haematoxylin and eosin-(H.E.) stained sections. We observed the presence of numerous lipid droplets in the liver, a hallmark of live steatosis, in the vehicle-treated DIO mice compared to that in the BL/6 mice fed normal chow (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Strikingly, STF treatment markedly reduced the number of the lipid droplets in the liver of DIO mice compared to vehicle treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3A’</xref>). We next examined the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis in the liver of the STF- and vehicle-treated DIO mice and found that the lipogenic genes FASN, stearoly-coA desaturase-1 (<italic>SCD-1</italic>), and acetyl coA-carboxylase (<italic>ACC</italic>) were down-regulated in the liver of STF-treated DIO mice compared to vehicle-treated mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Furthermore, because MASLD is associated with an impaired suppression of hepatic glucose output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Marchesini, Brizi et al. 2001</xref>), we assessed the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, including <italic>glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit</italic> (<italic>G6PC</italic>) and <italic>phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase</italic> (<italic>Pepck)</italic>. We found that the expression level of G6PC in the liver from STF-treated DIO mice was also significantly decreased compared to that of vehicle-treated ones while there was no effect on <italic>Pepck</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). MASLD is also characterized by excessive inflammation, in particular macrophage accumulation, in addition to lipid deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lefere and Tacke 2019</xref>). We therefore investigated the effect of STF on macrophage population in the obese liver and observed that STF treatment suppressed the macrophage accumulation of DIO mice, as marked by the F4/80 immunofluorescent staining (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>). Furthermore, obesity is tightly associated with dyslipidemia. We therefore examined the effect of STF on dyslipidemia and observed that STF treatment decreased the plasma levels of triglyceride, free fatty acid (FFA), and total cholesterol (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-H</xref>).</p>

<title>STF treatment promotes thermogenesis and energy expenditure</title>
<p>The observation that STF treatment protects against HFD-induced obesity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) suggests an increase in energy expenditure (EE) in these mice.

<p>To ask whether the energy expenditure increase by STF is attributable to thermogenic heat production, we investigated the effect of STF treatment on the activation status of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in DIO animals. BAT is an organ specialized for energy expenditure through the action of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). During obesity, lipid-droplet content is increased in BAT (whitening of BAT), which impairs its ability to dissipate the energy. We observed that STF treatment reversed the whitening of BAT, as reflected in much less lipid droplet intensity in BAT, in DIO mice, compared to vehicle treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>). Immunofluorescent staining showed the elevated staining intensity of UCP1 protein in BAT per unit area in DIO mice compared to vehicle treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I-K</xref>). Furthermore, STF-treated mice showed increased expression of genes involved in thermogenic and mitochondrial functions, including <italic>Prdm16</italic>, <italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Cidea</italic>, <italic>Ppara</italic>, <italic>DIO2</italic>, <italic>Cox 5b</italic>, and <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> (<italic>Pgc1</italic>α), in BAT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref>). These data thereby suggest that STF promotes BAT activation. Induction of beige fat in the WAT also plays important role in the adaptive thermogenesis and energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kajimura, Spiegelman et al. 2015</xref>). We therefore examined the effect of STF on the status of beiging activation in the WAT. The immune-signal intensity of UCP1 protein was markedly increased in the eWAT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M</xref> and S3A) and iWAT (Fig. S3B-C) of DIO mice treated with STF. In addition, the expression of thermogenic genes was significantly increased in both eWAT and iWAT of DIO mice subjected to STF treatment compared to vehicle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N</xref> and Fig. S3D). These results suggest the involvement of beige fat activation in thermogenesis and energy expenditure in STF-treated mice. Moreover, we also investigated the effect of STF on the expression of β-adrenoceptors, which play important role in adaptive thermogenesis in response to cold stimulation, on adipose tissues and observed that STF treatment elevated the levels of both β2-adrenoceptor (<italic>β2ar</italic>) and β3-adrenoceptor (<italic>β3ar</italic>) in BAT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4O</xref>) and the levels of <italic>β3ar</italic> in iWAT and eWAT (Fig. S3E-F).</p>

<title>Effect of STF treatment on obesity-associated macrophage activation</title>
<p>Since adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) accumulation plays important role in contributing to insulin resistance and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Xu, Barnes et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lumeng, Bodzin et al. 2007</xref>), we investigate whether STF treatment impacts ATM accumulation in DIO mice as IRE1α activity was observed to be heightened in obese macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shan, Wang et al. 2017</xref>). During obesity, the expansion of adipose tissues accompanies the recruitment and accumulation of macrophages in the adipose tissue, and crown-like structures (CLS) are formed upon the infiltration and residence of macrophages around dead adipocytes in the adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cinti, Mitchell et al. 2005</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>, the area of CLS was drastically reduced in the eWAT of DIO mice treated with STF relative to vehicle-treated mice, although CLS area showed no significant difference in iWAT between vehicle and STF groups (Fig. S4A). Immunofluorescent staining of F4/80, a pan-macrophage marker, was drastically increased in the eWAT under HFD, but was reversed in STF-treated mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-C</xref>). Moreover, we examined the expression levels of pan-macrophage marker genes (<italic>CD68</italic> and <italic>F4/80</italic>) and found that STF treatment significantly alleviated the mRNA levels of <italic>CD68</italic> and <italic>F4/80</italic> in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF where immune cells reside) of the eWAT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Expectedly, STF treatment also inhibited the splicing of IRE1α target <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA in the eWAT SVF (Fig. S4B-D). Next, we used flow cytometry to analyze the changes of ATMs by STF treatment under HFD. We observed that the percentage of macrophage population (double positive for F4/80 and CD11b markers (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>)) did not alter substantially in the SVF fraction isolated from eWAT under HFD compared to normal chow (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5E</xref> and S5A); however, given the HFD-induced expansion of the eWAT, the total number of F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages has increased drastically by 49.6 fold: 0.29 ± 0.25 x10<sup>5</sup> (normal chow) vs. 1.43 ± 0.086 x10<sup>6</sup> (14-week HFD) cells/eWAT fat pad/mouse (P=0.0041) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1a</xref>). The density of F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophage population in eWAT also increased under HFD by 12.5 fold after normalizing the total number of macrophages to fat pad weight (0.62 ± 0.45 x10<sup>5</sup> (normal chow) vs. 0.77 ± 0.015 x10<sup>6</sup> cells (14-week HFD)/g of eWAT/mouse, P=0.0045, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1a</xref>). Excitingly, STF treatment significantly lessened the HFD-induced increases in the percentage, total number, and density of ATMs by 37.4%, 46%, and 54%, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5E</xref> and S5A and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1a</xref>). These results indicate that STF suppresses macrophage accumulation in the adipose tissue.</p>

<p>It was previously reported that macrophages that accumulated in adipose tissues undergo a “phenotypic switch” from an anti-inflammatory M2 (alternatively activated) phenotype to a proinflammatory M1 (classically activated) state, a process believed to be critical for the development of systemic insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lumeng, Bodzin et al. 2007</xref>). We therefore investigated the effect of STF treatment on such an ATM switch. We observed that under HFD, the percentage ((14.59% (ND) vs. 52.95% (HFD), P=0.007, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5F</xref> and S5A, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1b</xref>), total number/eWAT/mouse (0.25 ± 0.16 x10<sup>4</sup> (ND) vs. 0.75 ± 0.11 x10<sup>6</sup> (HFD), 299.58-fold, P&lt;0.0001, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1b</xref>), and density/g of eWAT/mouse (0.59 ± 0.23 x 10<sup>4</sup> (ND) vs. 4.11 ± 0.96 x 10<sup>5</sup> (HFD), 70-fold, P=0.0018, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1b</xref>) of F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> triple positive cells, which are typically characterized as the classical “M1-like” adipose tissue macrophages, were markedly increased in the eWAT. Unexpectedly, we found that the bulk majority of these CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs were also positive for CD206, a marker thought for M2 macrophages, in the eWAT under HFD (Fig. S5B), and that approximately half the population is positive for both CD11c and CD206 in DIO ATMs whereas there are only 8.55% CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup> ATMs under ND when gated against CD11c and CD206 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5G</xref> and S5A), suggesting the enrichment of a mixed M1/M2 phenotype, which is consistent with recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Shaul, Bennett et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wentworth, Naselli et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sica and Mantovani 2012</xref>). Moreover, we found that the total number and density of CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup> ATMs increased by 337- and 75-fold respectively under HFD (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1c</xref>), a greater increase than those of CD11C-postive alone (CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>-</sup>) ATMs under HFD (Table S1a). On the other hand, for CD206<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup> ATM subpopulation, a presumed M2-like ATM subpopulation which accounted for the majority of ATMs under ND as expected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1d</xref>), HFD drove the increase in the total cell number and density of this population by over 16- and 4-fold respectively despite the diminished percentage given the huge expansion of total ATMs (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1d</xref>), although to a lesser degree than that for CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup> or CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>-</sup> macrophages (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1c</xref> and S1a). Moreover, CD206<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup> ATM subpopulation also exhibited a trend similar to that of CD206<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup> ATMs (Table S1b). Our findings confirm the notion that ATMs do not follow the classic M2 to M1 switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Xu, Grijalva et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kratz, Coats et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hill, Lim et al. 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been reported that the germline deletion of IRE1α in myeloid lineage reverses the switch in M1/M2 polarization with the increase in M2 population to induce BAT activation and WAT remodeling and protect mice against diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shan, Wang et al. 2017</xref>). However, in light of increasing evidence from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Xu, Grijalva et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kratz, Coats et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hill, Lim et al. 2018</xref>) and our current findings that do not support a HFD-triggered classical M1/M2 polarization, we sought to interrogate the effect of IRE1α inhibition on ATM subpopulations, which by far is poorly understood. In DIO mice treated with STF for 4 weeks, we found that consistent with the overall reduction of ATM population (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1a</xref>), the percentage, total number, and density of the posited “M1-like” F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> triple positive cells were substantially diminished in the SVF of eWAT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref> and S5A, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1b</xref>), but to an even greater extent than the overall ATM population. The trend in the reduction of F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs by STF remains similar regardless of whether CD206<sup>+</sup> was positive (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup>) or negative (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>-</sup>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1c</xref> and S1a). In addition, the total number and density of M2-like CD206<sup>+</sup>CD11c <sup>-</sup> ATMs were also significantly reduced in the SVF of eWAT of STF- treated DIO animals (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1d</xref>), but to a lesser degree than CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs. In contrast, STF treatment even slightly increased the total number and density of the CD206 CD11c double-negative ATMs (CD206<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>) or non-macrophage (F4/80<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>-</sup>) populations (Tables S1b and S1c), although none of them reaching statistically significance.</p>
<p>As the “M1-like” CD11c<sup>+</sup> and M1/M2 mixed ATMs were reported to be associated with pro-inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Shaul, Bennett et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wentworth, Naselli et al. 2010</xref>), we examined the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokine genes —<italic>Tnfα</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Il-6</italic>, and <italic>monocyte chemoattractant protein-1</italic> (<italic>mcp-1</italic>)— and found that they were down-regulated in the SVFs of eWAT from STF-treated DIO mice compared to vehicle-treated counterparts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>), which correlates with our observed decreased populations of “M1-like” CD11c<sup>+</sup> and M1/M2 mixed ATMs in the STF-treated DIO animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E-F</xref>). Similarly, STF treatment also inhibited the mRNA levels of these cytokine genes in the SVFs of iWAT (Fig. S5C). Furthermore, in CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>) sorted from the eWAT SVFs of DIO mice, which expectedly expressed higher mRNA levels of <italic>Tnfα</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, and <italic>Mcp-1</italic> than CD11c<sup>-</sup> ATMs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>), STF treatment remarkably reduced the expression levels of <italic>Tnfα</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, and <italic>Mcp-1</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>). STF inhibited the IRE1α RNase activity in these cells as reflected by the diminished <italic>XBP1s</italic> mRNA levels (Fig. S5D). These results reveal that STF treatment suppresses the adipose tissue inflammation and the accumulation of pro-inflammatory ATM without augmenting (suppressing instead) M2-like ATMs.</p>

<title>Metabolically active ATMs are suppressed in DIO mice by STF treatment</title>
<p>Recent studies have shown that instead of the classical proinflammatory M1 polarization, obesity drives the expansion of metabolically active heterogeneous ATM populations. These metabolically active ATMs possess heightened lysosome and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Xu, Grijalva et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kratz, Coats et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Coats, Schoenfelt et al. 2017</xref>), express cell surface markers CD9 or Trem2 at a higher frequency, and are pro-inflammatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hill, Lim et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jaitin, Adlung et al. 2019</xref>). These studies reported that the CD9<sup>+</sup> macrophages have high amounts of intracellular lipid in lysosome like structures, express genes related to lysosomal-dependent lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hill, Lim et al. 2018</xref>) and represent the majority of total adipose tissue macrophages in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jaitin, Adlung et al. 2019</xref>). Given our findings on the significant inhibitory effect of STF on ATM accumulation and inflammation, we therefore investigated whether STF impacts these alterations in the adipose tissues of DIO mice. We first determined the effect of STF treatment on the metabolic activation of ATMs. Proteins involved in lipid metabolism including ABCA1, CD36, and PLIN2 were reported to be specifically up-regulated in metabolically active macrophages in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kratz, Coats et al. 2014</xref>). We observed that the mRNA levels of <italic>Abca1</italic>, <italic>Cd36</italic>, and <italic>Plin2</italic> were elevated in the SVF portion of the eWAT in DIO mice compared to their normal diet counterparts, but STF treatment significantly suppressed the up-regulation of these genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Moreover, genes involved in lysosomal biogenesis and phagocytosis including <italic>Atp6v1b2</italic>, <italic>Atp6v0d2</italic>, <italic>Lipa,</italic> and <italic>Lamp2</italic> were also reported to be induced in the ATMs in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Xu, Grijalva et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Coats, Schoenfelt et al. 2017</xref>). We therefore examined the effect of STF on the mRNA levels of <italic>Atp6v1b2</italic>, <italic>Atp6v0d2</italic>, <italic>Lipa,</italic> and <italic>Lamp2</italic> and observed that their mRNA levels were elevated in the SVF portion of the eWAT in DIO mice and that STF treatment suppressed the up-regulation of these genes, although the suppression on Lipa does not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). In addition, expression levels of other genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism and lysosomal biogenesis, including <italic>Fabp4</italic>, <italic>Fabp5</italic>, and <italic>Stsb1</italic>, were also suppressed in the SVF portion of the eWAT in DIO mice by the treatment of STF (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Lastly, we also observed a similar trend in the SVFs of the iWAT (Fig. S6A-B).</p>

<p>We next investigated the effect of STF on the newly identified ATM subpopulations. First we observed that the mRNA levels of <italic>CD9</italic> and <italic>Trem2</italic> were elevated in the SVFs of the eWAT and iWAT in DIO mice relative to age-matched normal chow-fed mice but STF treatment suppressed the up-regulation of these genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref> and S6C)). In addition, immunofluorescent staining of CD9 and Trem2 was drastically increased in the eWAT under HFD, relative to normal chow (Fig. S6D-E’), but was profoundly diminished in STF-treated DIO mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E-G</xref>). Similarly, we observed a similar trend in the effect of STF on the immunofluorescent staining of CD9 and Trem2 in BAT (Fig. S6F) and iWAT (Fig. S6G-H) slides from DIO mice treated with STF or Veh, although without reaching statistical significance. We then used flowcytometry to characterize the effect of STF on CD9- or Trem2-expressing ATM subpopulations. We initially examined the HFD-induced changes in these populations. As expected, the percentage (23.25 ± 8.75% (ND) vs. 72.70 ± 2.60% (HFD), P=0.032, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2a</xref>), total number (0.45 ± 0.32 x 10<sup>4</sup> /eWAT/mouse (ND) vs. 1.04 ± 0.026 x 10<sup>6.</sup> /eWAT/mouse (HFD), 228-fold, P=0.00062, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2a</xref>), and density (1.04 ± 0.51 x 10<sup>4</sup> /g of fat pad (ND) vs. 0.56 ± 0.032 x 10<sup>6</sup> /g of fat pad (HFD), 54-fold, P=0.0034, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2a</xref>) of the CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD9<sup>+</sup>) in the eWAT were increased under HFD. It was previously reported that CD63 is enriched in CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jaitin, Adlung et al. 2019</xref>); indeed, we found that up to 98% of CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs also expressed CD63 in HFD-fed mice (Fig. S7A). As expected, the percentage, total number, and density of CD9<sup>+</sup>CD63<sup>+</sup> ATMs increased significantly in the eWAT (Fig. S7B and Table S2). Similarly, Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATM subpopulation expanded markedly in the percentage, total number/eWAT/mouse, and density (number/g of fat pad/mouse) under HFD (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2b</xref>). In addition, we found that while only approximately 47% of the CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD9<sup>+</sup>) express Trem2, an overwhelming majority (∼86.7%) of Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>Trem2<sup>+</sup>) expresses CD9 (Fig. S7C), corroborating a previous finding that Trem2<sup>+</sup> expression emerges after CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs over the course of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jaitin, Adlung et al. 2019</xref>). As expected, double-positive CD9<sup>+</sup>Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATMs also expanded tremendously under HFD (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2c</xref>). In DIO mice treated with STF, we observed a decrease in the percentages of CD9<sup>+</sup>, Trem2<sup>+</sup>, and CD9<sup>+</sup>Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATMs relative to that of vehicle-treated mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6H-J</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Tables 2a-c</xref>). Further, STF treatment significantly diminished the total number and density of CD9<sup>+</sup>, Trem2<sup>+</sup>, and CD9<sup>+</sup>Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATM subpopulations all by over 60% (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Tables 2a-c</xref>).</p>

<p>The CD9-expressing ATM subpopulation under HFD was proposed to be pro-inflammatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hill, Lim et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jaitin, Adlung et al. 2019</xref>).

<p>To investigate whether IRE1α inhibition acts on ATMs directly, we examined the effect of STF on the macrophage population and inflammation in SVF cells (freshly isolated from obese eWATs) treated with STF. We observed that STF treatment for 20 hours slightly but statistically significantly diminished the percentage of ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>) (DMSO 56.03% vs. STF 49.30%, p=0.0024) as analyzed by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6O</xref>). When further gated against Trem2, we observed a trend similar to that for the overall ATMs in that STF treatment moderately but significantly decreased the percentage of Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>Trem2<sup>+</sup>) (DMSO 68.67% vs. STF 61.93%, p=0.0013) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6P</xref>). We also observed that STF mildly lessened the percentages of CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD9<sup>+</sup>) (DMSO 76.73% vs. STF 74.80%, p=0.013) (Fig. S8A) and of CD11C<sup>+</sup> ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11C<sup>+</sup>) (DMSO 81.23% vs. STF 77.63%, p=0.0040) (Fig. S8B). We next investigated the effect of STF on the expression levels of pro-inflammatory genes in ATMs sorted from STF- or DMSO-treated SVF cells. As expected, STF treatment decreased spliced XBP1 mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6Q</xref>, S8C, S8G, S8I), reflecting the inhibition of IRE1α RNase activity, and significantly down-regulated the expression levels of pro-inflammatory genes (<italic>Tnfα</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, and <italic>Mcp-1</italic>) in CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD9<sup>+</sup>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6R</xref>) and in CD11C<sup>+</sup> ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11C<sup>+</sup>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6S</xref>), relative to DMSO control-treated counterparts. Similarly, in CD9<sup>-</sup> ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD9<sup>-</sup>) or CD11C<sup>-</sup> ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11C<sup>-</sup>) sorted from STF- or DMSO-treated SVFs, which displayed lower mRNA expression levels of <italic>Tnfα</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, and <italic>Mcp-1</italic> compared to their respective CD9<sup>+</sup> or CD11C<sup>+</sup> counterparts (Fig. S8D-E), STF also down-regulated the mRNA levels of <italic>Tnfα</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, and <italic>Mcp-1</italic> (Fig. S8F, S8H). Together, these results indicate that STF likely acts directly on ATMs to regulate inflammation.</p>

<title>The CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs are overlapping with but yet distinctly different from metabolically active ATMs in obesity</title>
<p>One important question on the obesity-associated ATM accumulation is the obscure relationship between the newly-identified CD9<sup>+</sup> and Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATM populations and the originally identified “M1-like” CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hill, Lim et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wu and Ballantyne 2020</xref>). To investigate this relationship, we analyzed these populations using flow cytometry (Fig. S9). First, we asked whether the previously identified F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> triple positive ATMs express signature markers of the newly identified ATM subpopulations (CD9 and/or Trem2) in DIO mice. Our results showed that approximately 80% (91.30 ± 0.40%) of CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>) express CD9 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref> and <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3a</xref>). On the other hand, about 70. 4% of CD11c-negative ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup>) express CD9 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3a</xref>). We also found that 23.95% of F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs express CD9<sup>-hi</sup> while only 3.185% of CD11c-negative ATMs are positive for CD9<sup>-hi</sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Similarly, the percentage of cells expressing Trem2 was higher in the CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs than in CD11c<sup>-</sup> ATMs (43.55 ± 8.65% for CD11c<sup>+</sup> vs. 24.35 ± 4.05%, albeit not reaching statistical significance (P=0.074), <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, and <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3a</xref>). We also observed a higher percentage of the CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs (30.05 ± 5.55%) expressing both CD9 and Trem2 than that of CD11c<sup>-</sup> ATMs (8.35 ± 1.86%), P=0.066, (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref> and <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3a</xref>). These results revealed that CD9 and Trem2 are highly enriched but not exclusively expressed in the CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs under HFD.</p>

<p>In reciprocal studies, we analyzed the distribution of CD11c expression in CD9<sup>+</sup> and/or Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATMs under HFD. We observed heightened percentages of CD9<sup>+</sup>, Trem2<sup>+</sup>, and CD9<sup>+</sup>Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATMs that co-express CD11c (63.25 ± 10.85%, 78.25 ± 12.35%, and 78.65 ± 13.05%, respectively) relative to the CD9<sup>-</sup>, Trem2<sup>-</sup>, and CD9<sup>-</sup>Trem2<sup>-</sup> ATMs that co-express CD11c (29.90 ± 9.10%, 49.55 ± 9.85%, or 24.60 ± 5.90%, respectively), in the eWAT of HFD-fed mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D-F</xref> and <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3b</xref>). We also observed that higher percentage of CD9<sup>hi</sup> ATM subpopulation expresses CD11c than CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs (90.60 ± 1.4% vs. 63.25 ± 10.25%, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). These results showed that while CD11c expression is not exclusively expressed in CD9<sup>+</sup>, Trem2<sup>+</sup>, or CD9<sup>+</sup>Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATMs, it is highly enriched in all of these subpopulations. Together, these results reveal that in the eWAT under HFD, the majority of CD11c<sup>+</sup> or CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs expresses CD9 or CD11c, respectively. Indeed, up to half (45.45 ± 5.05%) of ATMs in the obese eWAT co-express CD9 and CD11c (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref> and <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3c</xref>). Notably, similar to its effects on CD9<sup>+</sup> or CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H-I</xref>), STF treatment substantially decreased the percentage, total number /eWAT/mouse, and density (per gram of fat pad/mouse) of the CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs in the eWAT of DIO mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3c</xref>). As CD9<sup>+</sup> and CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs were reported to be pro-inflammatory, we next compared the expression levels of proinflammatory genes in these ATM subpopulations from HFD-fed mice and observed that the mRNA levels of <italic>Tnfα</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, and <italic>Mcp-1</italic> were all up-regulated in sorted CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup>, CD9<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>, and CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs compared to the CD9<sup>-</sup> CD11c<sup>-</sup> ATMs, with the CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs expressing higher level of Mcp-1 and the CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup> ATMs expressing lower level of <italic>Il1b</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref>), suggesting that these ATM subpopulations are all proinflammatory but yet heterogeneous in nature.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have shown that the RNase activity of ER stress sensor IRE1α is up-regulated in the adipose tissue of mice with diet-induced obesity and that the increased IRE1α activity precedes the onset of diabetes in the mice with obesity. By pharmacologically inhibiting IRE1α using the chemical STF, we found that the inhibition of IRE1α activity is able to reverse HFD-induced insulin resistance and comorbidities, indicating that the increased IRE1α activity is an important contributor to obesity-associated insulin resistance. We showed that STF promotes thermogenesis and energy expenditure and counters diet-induced obesity. Our results also showed that the IRE1α inhibition by STF suppresses the accumulation of proinflammatory ATMs, including previously identified CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs and the recently identified CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs, and adipose inflammation. Our study also reveals that the CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs are largely overlapping with but yet non-identical to CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs in the eWAT under HFD.</p>
<p>ER stress and its sensor IRE1α are activated in adipose tissues of subjects with obesity. IRE1α activation is known to be linked to inflammation via its dual enzymatic activity and its control of transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Martinon, Chen et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lerner, Upton et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Oslowski, Hara et al. 2012</xref>) while macrophage activation and inflammation in adipose tissue is tightly associated with metabolic dysfunction. Targeting ER stress/IRE1α has thus been proposed for its potential in countering obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hetz, Chevet et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Marciniak, Chambers et al. 2021</xref>). Indeed, recent studies using tissue-specific deletion of IRE1α in mouse have shown that embryonic IRE1α deletion in macrophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shan, Wang et al. 2017</xref>) and in adipocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen, Wu et al. 2022</xref>) prevents diet-induced insulin resistance and obesity. In the present study, we have showed that STF inhibition of IRE1α is capable of reversing existing insulin resistance and obesity and therefore validate the notion of targeting IRE1α inhibition as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders.</p>
<p>In obese adipose tissue, IRE1α was activated in both adipocytes and ATMs. Activated IRE1α was reported to cause its RNase-mediated degradation of <italic>Pgc1</italic>α mRNA and in turn suppression of PGC1α-dependent UCP1 level in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen, Wu et al. 2022</xref>). Consistent with this finding, the present study observed that STF treatment decreases the level of IRE1α target RNA <italic>Xbp1s</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref> and S1D) and elevates the RNA levels of <italic>Pgc1</italic>α and <italic>Ucp1</italic> in adipose tissue of DIO mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4L, N</xref>). In the adipose tissue macrophage, IRE1α deletion in myeloid lineage using Ern1<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Lyz2-cre was reported to induce the beiging of WAT and protect against diet-induced obesity by augmenting M2 macrophage population through its synthesis and secretion of catecholamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shan, Wang et al. 2017</xref>). It is well established that catecholamines play critical roles on thermogenesis through the activation of β-adrenoceptor signaling in the adipocyte tissue, which is critical for BAT activation and WAT remodeling. Catecholamines are normally synthesized and secreted from sympathetic nerves to induce adaptive thermogenesis in response to cold stimulation. It was reported that M2 macrophages also produce catecholamines to sustain adaptive thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nguyen, Qiu et al. 2011</xref>). However, this finding was disputed by a recent study showing that M2 macrophages do not synthesize catecholamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fischer, Ruiz et al. 2017</xref>). Importantly, in contrast to the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shan, Wang et al. 2017</xref>), our present study showed that STF treatment does not promote M2 macrophage in the adipose tissue (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1d</xref>), arguing against the possibility that STF inhibition of IRE1α promotes thermogenesis by increasing M2 ATMs. Instead, STF treatment diminishes the M2 ATM population along with the decline of “M1-like” CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1b</xref>). Notably, STF treatment also significantly diminished the newly identified CD9<sup>+</sup>, Trem2<sup>+</sup>, and dual CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATM subpopulations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H-J</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2a-c</xref>). Like CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs, CD9<sup>+</sup>, Trem2<sup>+</sup>, and dual CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATM express higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5K-L</xref> and 7I), indicative of their pro-inflammatory nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hill, Lim et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jaitin, Adlung et al. 2019</xref>). STF treatment accordingly diminishes the expression levels of pro-inflammatory genes in both bulky adipose tissue (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>) and sorted ATMs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5J</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6M-N</xref>). Our in vitro experiments showed that STF treatment directly suppressed the ATM population and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in these primary ATMs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6Q-S</xref> and S8). Overall, our study indicates that STF inhibition of IRE1α reverses diet-induced adipose tissue inflammation and proinflammatory ATM subpopulations including the newly identified metabolically active CD9 ATMs.</p>
<p>Macrophage-derived proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL1b have been reported to directly suppress the induction of <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression in adipocytes and to impair cold-induced thermogenesis in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sakamoto, Takahashi et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Goto, Naknukool et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sakamoto, Nitta et al. 2016</xref>). Moreover, TNFα was shown to down-regulate the expression of β-adrenoceptor in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hadri, Courtalon et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Valentine, Ahmadian et al. 2022</xref>). HFD-induced obesity and chronic adipose inflammation are associated with the reduced expression of thermogenic/mitochondrial oxidation genes and the repression of thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Choi, Kim et al. 2015</xref>). In present study, we observed that STF treatment increases the expression of UCP1, β<sub>3</sub>-adrenoceptor, and other thermogenic genes in obese adipose tissue (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4L, N, O</xref> and S3D-F). These results suggest that the suppression of ATM population/inflammation by STF inhibition of IRE1α is able to reverse the expression levels of thermogenic/mitochondrial oxidation genes in obese adipose tissue to promote thermogenesis, in conjunction with STF’s action on the PGC1α expression in adipocytes.</p>
<p>We noticed that STF treatment protects against diet-induced obesity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>) and metabolic improvements (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). It exists a possibility that STF may cause body weight reduction, which results in secondary beneficial effects on glucose and insulin sensitivity, as well as on ATM accumulation. We argue that such a possibility is unlikely as STF was previously reported to have no effect on body weight in two other studies: one in mouse model of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tufanli, Telkoparan Akillilar et al. 2017</xref>), and the other in Akita mouse model of beta cell death/failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Herlea-Pana, Eeda et al. 2021</xref>). Second, in our study, we did not observe any apparent difference in food intake (Fig. S2B) that could otherwise affect body weight. Third, STF directly suppresses ATM population and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Finally, STF-treated DIO mice expended more energy than their vehicle-treated counterparts even at lower body weight (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-F</xref>). Although it is known that energy expenditure per unit body weight appears to be lower in subjects with obesity than in lean controls because obesity is associated with reduced thermogenesis, subjects with obesity still expend more energy than the lean controls at the organismal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Prentice, Black et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Trayhurn and Arch 2020</xref>). If there exists leanness-associated thermogenesis increase per unit weight in STF-treated DIO mice, it cannot fully account for the energy expenditure increase at the organismal level as observed in STF-treated DIO mice, arguing for the notion that STF treatment stimulates thermogenesis which in turn leads to body weight reduce in a positive feedback loop. We also note that as specific IRE1α RNase inhibitors, STF and other members of hydroxy-aryl-aldehyde class have been studied in mouse models of multiple diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tufanli, Telkoparan Akillilar et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lebeaupin, Vallée et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhan, Zhao et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Herlea-Pana, Eeda et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Marek-Iannucci, Yildirim et al. 2022</xref>), with beneficial effects and non-toxicity in general. Further studies on pharmacokinetic and toxicological parameters will be needed before any potential clinical trial is initiated.</p>
<p>Our study also shed new insight into the macrophage remodeling under obesity. Macrophage accumulation and activation in adipose tissue is known to contribute to insulin resistance in obesity. It was initially reported that adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) undergo an M2 to M1 polarization switch under obesity. Recent studies have however indicated that obese ATMs do not follow the canonical M1 polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Xu, Grijalva et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kratz, Coats et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hill, Lim et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jaitin, Adlung et al. 2019</xref>). In the present study, we found that first, “M1-like” ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>-</sup> cells) significantly increase under HFD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F-G</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1b-c</xref>); second, M2-like ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD206<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup> cells) also increase in total cell number and density in response to HFD (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1d</xref>), albeit to a smaller extent than the “M1-like” ATMs, a phenomenon previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Xu, Grijalva et al. 2013</xref>); and third, there is a significant increase (up to half of the ATMs gated with CD11c<sup>+</sup> and CD206<sup>+</sup>) in ATMs co-expressing both CD11c<sup>+</sup> and CD206<sup>+</sup> in the adipose tissue of HFD-induced mice with obesity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1c</xref>), supporting a mixed phenotype rather than distinct M1 or M2 phenotype. Previous studies have identified such ATM subpopulation that express both M1 and M2 surface markers in both human and rodent adipose tissues under obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Shaul, Bennett et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wentworth, Naselli et al. 2010</xref>). These findings are consistent with the notion that ATMs do not follow the classic M2 to M1 switch. Instead, recent studies employing single-cell RNA-seq technology have revealed the expansion/emergence of ATMs that express cell surface markers CD9 or Trem2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hill, Lim et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jaitin, Adlung et al. 2019</xref>). In the present study, we found that the percentage, density, and total number of CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD9<sup>+</sup>) in the eWAT are drastically increased under HFD (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2a</xref>). Similarly, Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>Trem2<sup>+</sup>) expand significantly in the eWAT of mice with obesity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2b</xref>), most of which also express CD9.</p>
<p>Our present study further investigated the relationship between the newly-identified CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs and the originally identified “M1-like” CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs as it remains unclear whether they are related or different ATM populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hill, Lim et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wu and Ballantyne 2020</xref>). Our results showed that CD9 and Trem2 are highly enriched but not exclusively expressed in the CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs under HFD (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-C</xref>). Reciprocally, CD11c expression is highly enriched but not exclusively expressed in CD9<sup>+</sup>, Trem2<sup>+</sup>, or CD9<sup>+</sup>Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATMs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D-F</xref>). As such, in the obese eWAT, up to half (49.95 ± 0.65%) of ATMs co-express CD9 and CD11c (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>). These results demonstrate that CD9<sup>+</sup> and CD11c<sup>+</sup> populations are highly overlapping. We further found that CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup>, CD9<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>, and CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs are all pro-inflammatory as the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes <italic>Tnfα</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, and <italic>Mcp-1</italic> are up-regulated in all these subpopulations than CD9<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup> ATMs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref>). However, the mRNA levels of individual <italic>Tnfα</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, or <italic>Mcp-1</italic> are differentially expressed among CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup>, CD9<sup>-</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup>, and CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref>), suggesting functional heterogeneity even among proinflammatory ATMs during obesity.</p>
<p>In summary, our present studies reveal two significant findings. First, we confirmed that the newly identified populations of proinflammatory ATMs (i.e., CD9<sup>+</sup> and Trem2<sup>+</sup>) are induced under high fat diet-mediated obesity and determined their relationships with the originally identified “M1-like” CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs. Second, we showed that STF inhibition of IRE1α reverses the accumulation of pro-inflammatory ATM populations including the new metabolically active CD9<sup>+</sup> and Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATMs and adipose tissue inflammation to promote thermogenesis and insulin sensitivity. These studies validate the potential of IRE1α inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of obesity, insulin resistance and comorbidities, which sets the foundation for further clinical development of IRE1α inhibitors as a therapeutical direction for diabetes and obesity.</p>

<p>First, the authors confirm the up-regulation of the main genes involved in the three branches of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) system in diet-induced obese mice in AT, observations that have been extensively reported before. Not surprisingly, IRE1a inhibition with STF led to an amelioration of the obesity and insulin resistance of the animals. Moreover, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was also improved by the treatment. More novel are their results in terms of thermogenesis and energy expenditure, where IRE1a seems to act via activation of brown AT. Finally, mice treated with STF exhibited significantly fewer metabolically active and M1-like macrophages in the AT compared to those under vehicle conditions. Overall, the authors conclude that targeting IRE1a has therapeutical potential for treating obesity and insulin resistance.</p>
<p>The study has some strengths, such as the detailed characterization of the effect of STF in different fat depots and a thorough analysis of macrophage populations. However, the lack of novelty in the findings somewhat limits the study´s impact on the field.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Wu D. et al. explores an innovative approach in immunometabolism and obesity by investigating the potential of targeting macrophage Inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) in cases of overnutrition. Their findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of IRE1α could influence key aspects such as adipose tissue inflammation, insulin resistance, and thermogenesis. Notable discoveries include the identification of High-Fat Diet (HFD)-induced CD9+ Trem2+ macrophages and the reversal of metabolically active macrophages' activity with IRE1α inhibition using STF. These insights could significantly impact future obesity treatments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study's key strengths lie in its identification of specific macrophage subsets and the demonstration that inhibiting IRE1α can reverse the activity of these macrophages. This provides a potential new avenue for developing obesity treatments and contributes valuable knowledge to the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The research lacks an in-depth exploration of the broader metabolic mechanisms involved in controlling diet-induced obesity (DIO). Addressing this gap would strengthen the understanding of how targeting IRE1α might fit into the larger metabolic landscape.</p>
<p>Impact and Utility:</p>
<p>The findings have the potential to advance the field of obesity treatment by offering a novel target for intervention. However, further research is needed to fully elucidate the metabolic pathways involved and to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of this approach. The methods and data presented are useful, but additional context and exploration are required for broader application and understanding.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The author has revised the manuscript and addressed the most relevant comments raised by the reviewers. The paper is now significantly improved, though two minor issues remain.</p>

<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>The study presents important findings on inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE1α) inhibition on diet-induced obesity (overnutrition) and insulin resistance where IRE1α inhibition enhances thermogenesis and reduces the metabolically active and M1-like macrophages in adipose tissue. The evidence supporting the conclusions is convincing but can be enhanced with information/data on the validity, specificity, selectivity, and toxicity of the IRE1α inhibitor and supported with more detail on the mechanisms by which adipose tissue macrophages influence adipocyte metabolism. The work will be of interest to cell biologists and biochemists working in metabolism, insulin resistance, and inflammation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the editors for the assessment and appreciation of our findings in this study. In the revision, we have added the information on the validity, selectivity and toxicity of IRE1α inhibitor. In addition, we also discussed the likelihood that suppression of metabolically activated proinflammatory macrophage population in adipose tissue on the reversal of adipose remodeling and thermogenesis. In the revision, we have improved the manuscript significantly throughout the text and figures following the recommends by the reviewers.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>First, the authors confirm the up-regulation of the main genes involved in the three branches of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) system in diet-induced obese mice in AT, observations that have been extensively reported before. Not surprisingly, IRE1a inhibition with STF led to an amelioration of the obesity and insulin resistance of the animals. Moreover, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was also improved by the treatment. More novel are their results in terms of thermogenesis and energy expenditure, where IRE1a seems to act via activation of brown AT. Finally, mice treated with STF exhibited significantly fewer metabolically active and M1-like macrophages in the AT compared to those under vehicle conditions. Overall, the authors conclude that targeting IRE1a has therapeutical potential for treating obesity and insulin resistance.</p>
<p>The study has some strengths, such as the detailed characterization of the effect of STF in different fat depots and a thorough analysis of macrophage populations. However, the lack of novelty in the findings somewhat limits the study´s impact on the field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the appreciation of our findings and the comments about the novelty. Regarding the novelty, we would emphasize several novelties presented in this manuscript. First, as the reviewer correctly pointed out, we discovered that IRE1 inhibition by STF activates brown AT and promotes thermogenesis and that IRE1 inhibition not only significantly attenuated the newly discovered CD9+ ATMs and the “M1-like” CD11c+ ATMs but also diminished the M2 ATMs for the first time. These discoveries are very important and novel. In obesity, it was originally proposed that ATM undergoes M1/M2 polarization from an anti-inflammatory M2 to a classical pro-inflammatory M1 state. It was further reported that IRE1 deletion improves thermogenesis by boosting M2 population which then synthesize and secrete catecholamines to promote thermogenesis. It is now known that M2 macrophages do not synthesize catecholamines or promote thermogenesis. In this study, we discovered that IRE1 inhibition doesn’t increase (but instead decrease) the M2 population and that IRE1 inhibition promotes thermogenesis likely by suppressing pro-inflammatory macrophage populations including the M1-like ATMs and most importantly the newly identified metabolically active macrophages, given that ATM inflammation has been reported to suppress thermogenesis. Second, this study presented the first characterization of relationship between the more classical M1-like ATMs and the newly discovered metabolically active ATMs, showing that the CD11c+ M1-like ATMs are largely overlapping with but yet non-identical to CD9+ ATMs in the eWAT under HFD. Third, although upregulation of ER stress response genes in the adipose tissues of diet-induced obese mice have been extensively reported, it doesn’t necessarily mean that targeting IRE1a or ER stress can reverse existing insulin resistance and obesity. It is not uncommon that a therapy doesn’t yield the desired effect as expected. For instance, amyloid plaques are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), interventions that prevent or reverse beta amyloid deposition have been expected to prevent progression or even reverse cognitive impairment in AD patients. However, clinical trials on such therapies have been disappointing. In essence, experimental demonstration of effectiveness or feasibility for any potential therapeutic targets is a first step for any future clinical implementation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript by Wu et al demonstrated that IRE1a inhibition mitigated insulin resistance and other comorbidities through increased energy expenditure in DIO mice. In this reviewer's opinion, this timely study has high significance in the field of metabolism research for the following reasons.</p>
<p>(1) The authors' findings are significant and may offer a new therapeutic target to treat metabolic diseases, including diabetes, obesity, NAFLD, etc.</p>
<p>(2) The authors carefully profiled the ATMs and examined the changes in gene expression after STF treatment.</p>
<p>(3) The authors presented evidence collected from both systemic indirect calorimetry and individual tissue gene expression to support the notion of increased energy expenditure.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors have presented sufficient background in a clear and logically organized structure, clearly stated the key question to be addressed, used the appropriate methodology, produced significant and innovative main findings, and made a justified conclusion.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Wu D. et al. explores an innovative approach to immunometabolism and obesity by investigating the potential of targeting macrophage Inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) in cases of overnutrition. Their findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of IRE1α could influence key aspects such as adipose tissue inflammation, insulin resistance, and thermogenesis. Notable discoveries include the identification of High-Fat Diet (HFD)-induced CD9+ Trem2+ macrophages and the reversal of metabolically active macrophages' activity with IRE1α inhibition using STF. These insights could significantly impact future obesity treatments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study's key strengths lie in its identification of specific macrophage subsets and the demonstration that inhibiting IRE1α can reverse the activity of these macrophages. This provides a potential new avenue for developing obesity treatments and contributes valuable knowledge to the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The research lacks an in-depth exploration of the broader metabolic mechanisms involved in controlling diet-induced obesity (DIO). Addressing this gap would strengthen the understanding of how targeting IRE1α might fit into the larger metabolic landscape.</p>
<p>Impact and Utility:</p>
<p>The findings have the potential to advance the field of obesity treatment by offering a novel target for intervention. However, further research is needed to fully elucidate the metabolic pathways involved and to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of this approach. The methods and data presented are useful, but additional context and exploration are required for broader application and understanding.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the appreciation of strengths in our manuscript. In particular, we appreciate the reviewer’s recommendation on the exploration of broader metabolic landscape, such as the effect of IRE1 inhibition on non-adipose tissue macrophages and metabolism. We agree that achieving these will certainly broaden the therapeutic potential of IRE1 inhibition to larger metabolic disorders and we will pursue these explorations in future studies.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>A list of recommendations for the authors is presented below:</p>
<p>(1) Please, update the literature review to include more recent studies relevant to the topic.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer’s suggestions. We have added more references from recent studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Please, provide a detailed explanation of how STF functions, including potential off-target effects or issues related to specificity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer’s suggestions. STF is a small-molecule inhibitor designed to selectively inhibit the RNase activity of IRE1a. Once IRE1a is activated (e.g., in obesity), its RNase domain initiates the unconventional splicing of the transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA and the Regulated IRE1-Dependent Decay (RIDD) of microRNAs, which is detrimental if prolonged. IRE1a RNase inhibitors including STF engage the RNase-active site of IRE1a with high affinity and specificity by exploiting a shallow complementary pocket through pi-stacking interactions with His910 and Phe889 and an essential Schiff base interaction between the aldehyde moiety of the inhibitor and the side chain amino group of Lys907 (Sanches et al., NComm 2014, PMID: 25164867). This specific and high affinity binding blocks the IRE1a RNase activity, preventing the splicing of XBP1 mRNA and RIDD. As IRE1a has been shown to be activated in multiple tissues under various pathological conditions and to be responsible for the progression of the pathological conditions, inhibition of IRE1a by pharmacological agents including STF has the great potential for the treatment of various pathological disorders. Several studies have reported that STF shows no overt toxicity when administered systemically (Madhavan, Aparajita, et al.2022, PMID 35105890; Herlea-Pana et al., 2021, PMID 34675883; Papandreou et al., 2011, PMID 21081713; Tufanli et al., 2017, PMID 28137856).</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer’s suggestion. A reference has been added.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) also contains a significant amount of preadipocytes and stem cells, not only macrophages, which might affect the conclusions reached by the authors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer’s comments. It is true that SVF consists of multiple cell types, including endothelial cells, macrophages, preadipocytes, and various stem cell populations. In HFD-induced obesity, adipose tissue undergoes significant remodeling, and the percentage of macrophages in the SVF of obese adipose tissue increases significantly relative to other cell types. In our studies, SVFs from adipose tissues of obese mice were isolated, cultured, and treated with STF for overnight.  We observed that IRE1 RNase activity in SVFs was inhibited by STF treatment, and that ATM population and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes were downregulated by STF. Given the short-term treatment, the parsimonious interpretation of the data would be that STF directly acts on ATMs.  However, we note that the possibility that the effect of STF on other cell types might influence the ATM and inflammatory gene expression can’t be totally ruled out. As such, we have modified our conclusion from “these results indicate that STF acts directly on ATMs to regulate inflammation” to “these results indicate that STF likely acts directly on ATMs to regulate inflammation”.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer’s comments. Regarding the XBP1 mRNA splicing, we see both ways of presentation in publications. There are quite a number of papers, for instance, PMID25018104, 2014, Cell; PMID23086298, 2012, NCB, that used the XBP1s/ (XBP1s+XBP1u) ratio.

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript can be further strengthened with more clarification on the following points.</p>
<p>(1) The use of IRE1a pharmacological inhibitor STF-083010 (STF) needs to be validated. How was the dose determined? Were there any dose-dependent studies? Under the current dosing regimen, what are the specificity, selectivity, and toxicity of STF? Also, were the serine/threonine kinase and RNase activities measured in the adipocytes and ATMs of the animals dosed with the compound? What's the PK data?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. In the animal study, we used STF 10 mg/kg for intraperitoneal injection. This dose was adopted from several recent studies (Madhavan, Aparajita, et al.2022, PMID 35105890; Herlea-Pana et al., 2021, PMID 34675883; Papandreou et al., 2011, PMID 21081713; Tufanli et al., 2017, PMID 28137856), in which STF treatment showed beneficial effect in their respective disease models. STF didn’t compromise cell viability or induce any other toxicity at the dose or concentration used in these studies (Papandreou I, et al., 2011; Upton JP, et al., 2012; Lerner AG, et al., 2012; Kemp KL, et al., 2013; Cross BC, et al., 2012). In our study, we didn’t observe any apparent toxicity on mice at this dose. Importantly, we did observe that STF inhibited IRE1 RNase activity in adipose tissues (F1G, S1D) and ATMs (F6Q, S8C, G, I) of the animals at this dose. As the IRE1 inhibitors including STF has been extensively examined and shown to have no effect on the kinase function of IRE1 (Cross et al., 2012, PMID: 22315414; Tufanli et al., 2017, PMID 28137856), we didn’t perform the assay on Ire1 kinase activity. Additionally, as the chemical has been administered into several animal models, with significant beneficial effects, one would assume decent pharmacokinetic parameters being achieved with the current dose. It would be important and necessary to have systematic PK studies in the future if clinical trials are to be considered.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The statistical method for individual panels in each figure needs to be specified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have specified the statistical method in the figure legends.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 1E, there's no difference in fasting insulin levels, though a difference was detected after the glucose load. This suggests an effect on insulin secretion but not insulin sensitivity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. The insulin levels are still different between Veh and STF groups at fasting, just not reaching statistically significant. Under glucose stimulation, the insulin levels all showed the same trend, which is, the STF group is lower than the Veh group. Even if the fasting insulin levels showed no difference between the two groups regardless of glucose stimulation, the fact that the blood glucose levels at all the time points are lower in STF group than Veh group (Fig. 1C) indicates that insulin sensitivity is improved. In our study, the insulin levels were lower in STF group, but the blood glucose levels were still lowered by STF, further strengthening the notion that STF treatment improves insulin sensitivity. This is indeed further corroborated by the ITT results (Fig. 1D).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 2 and S2A did not show a decrease in BW but rather BW gain. The statement (line 308) needs to be edited. As a result of this, the relative fat mass measurement (% of BW) needs to be presented in addition to Figure 2B.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comments/suggestions. As shown in Figs. 2A and S2A, we observed a slight decrease in body weight (~2g reduction) in STF-treated mice while Veh group increased body weight by ~3.5g, at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. As shown in Fig. 2B, this difference in body weight between Veh and STF groups was primarily due to a reduction in fat tissue. In the revision, we also added the percentages of fat and lean masses over total body weight in Supplemental Fig. 2B, which show the similar trend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The measurement of blood lipid levels in Figure 3F-H is informative. More importantly, hepatic lipid content needs to be measured.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for and agree on the comments. As this study is more focused on the insulin resistance and adipose tissue remodeling, we didn’t go deep into the comorbidities beyond the reported observations. It will be interesting to explore the effects of IRE1 inhibition on the obesity/insulin resistance comorbidities including hepatic lipid content measurement in future study.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The observations presented by Wu D. et al. in the manuscript are potentially interesting and relevant. The current study seeks to build upon previous findings, specifically from the work titled, &quot;Silencing IRE1α using myeloid-specific cre suppresses alternative activation of macrophages and impairs energy expenditure in obesity.&quot; By using a pharmacological inhibitor to modulate IRE1α activity in adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs), the authors aim to develop therapeutics that could significantly impact the treatment of obesity and metabolic disease.</p>
<p>The authors have performed some satisfactory experiments related to liver steatosis. However, the manuscript would benefit from a more comprehensive exploration of the mechanisms by which ATMs influence adipocyte metabolism, particularly in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT). In particular, the study should investigate how adiposity and lipid droplet size change in response to alterations in lipolysis and adipogenesis, as this could provide insights into how these processes contribute to the amelioration of the obesity phenotype.</p>
<p>Several issues should be addressed to strengthen the manuscript and make the study more convincing. Below are specific comments and recommendations:</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>(1) The indirect calorimetric data should be normalized for dependent variables such as body weight, lean mass, and fat mass+ lean mass to accurately interpret the results. The results for 24-hour energy expenditure should be included in Figure 4B-F to provide a more comprehensive analysis. It is recommended to plot bar graphs with all individual data points for the energy expenditure (EE) results shown in Figure 4B-F, to offer a clearer and more detailed presentation of the data (Figure 4B-F).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. Data analysis on the indirect calorimetric studies has evolved over the years. One common practice was/is to normalize the data by body weight. However, this approach was deemed improper some years ago (Tschop et al Nature Methods 2012, PMID: 22205519). Tschop paper also pointed out the shortcomings associated with normalization by lean mass. Instead, it concludes that “generalized linear model is the most appropriate statistical approach to accommodate discrete (genotype) and continuous (body mass) traits, rather than using a simple division by BW or lean BW”. In our study, we used CalR, an improved generalized linear model (which includes ANOVA and ANCOVA) (Mina et al Cell Metabolism 2018, PMID: 30017358) for all our energy expenditure data analysis (shown in Fig. 4A-E). In the revision, we also included data analysis normalized by BW (Fig. S2F-H’), which actually shows even wider difference between Veh and STF groups than the data shown in Fig. 4A-F. As STF decreased the fat mass and had little effect on lean mass, the difference would be more drastic for normalization with fat mass and with fat mass+ lean mass than the data shown in Fig. 4A-E and would be similar to the data shown in Fig. 4A-E for normalization with lean mass. In addition, we replotted the graphs in Fig. 4B, D, F-H with the individual data points.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) At the thermoneutral point (30{degree sign}C), the study could benefit from testing the indirect calorimetric models of human energy physiology. Future studies could also explore this to evaluate the implications for drug development.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer on the comments. In the future study, it will be very informative to investigate the effects of STF under thermoneutral conditions, which could provide more consistent data on how drugs affect metabolic processes in humans, improving translational research.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The current study missed the opportunity to investigate the effects of STF on non-adipose tissue (non-AT) resident macrophage populations, such as those in bone marrow or lymph-node macrophages. Understanding how STF modulates macrophage metabolism in these contexts would be valuable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for and agree on the comments. As this study is more focused on the insulin resistance and adipose tissue remodeling, we were mostly restricted to adipose tissue macrophage populations. In the future, it would be interesting to investigate the effect of STF on macrophages in other non-adipose tissues, which will provide a more comprehensive understanding of STF's effects on immune cell metabolism, which could inform its application in various therapeutic areas.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The study should explore how STF influences the expression of CD9, Trem2, (positive subpopulations), and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages, particularly in response to LPS and IFNγ activation in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BM-Macrophages).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for the comments. Under obesity, the ATM does not undergo the classical M1/M2 polarization; instead, both M1-like/pro-inflammatory macrophages and M2 macrophages increase drastically in obesity. It will be interesting to investigate the effects of STF on the newly identified CD9- and Trem2-positive macrophage subpopulations in SVF and bone marrow macrophages in response to LPS and IFNγ stimulation in the future, although these studies might not faithfully reflect the changes in adipose tissue under obesity as these stressors typically induce classical M1/M2 polarization.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Additional macrophage gating is necessary better to understand adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) inflammation. Specifically, CD11c−MHC2 low macrophages represent a newly identified inflammatory and dynamic subset in murine adipose tissue. These ATMs accumulate rapidly after ten days of a high-fat diet (HFD) and should increase further with prolonged HFD. For this study, CD11c−MHC2 low ATMs could be subdivided for flow cytometry analysis based on their MHC2 expression, distinguishing them from CD11c−MHC2 high ATMs. All macrophage subtypes categorized here can be studied for metabolic health using seahorse analysis as well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for the comments. It will be interesting to investigate the effects of STF on the newly identified CD11c−MHC2 low macrophage subpopulation in the future. Future studies certainly can include metabolic analysis with Seahorse which can corroborate the energy metabolism at the cellular level with organismal thermogenesis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) All flow cytometry histograms - are they showing mean fluorescence intensity or cell# per population? Please specify. All flow cytometry dot plots - It would be helpful for readers to see populations plotted as bar graphs next to respective flow plots, as opposed to being shown as supplemental tables. Additionally, labeling dot plots with the parent population from which cells were gated on would also help readers understand faster what we're looking at.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for the comments. In flow cytometry histograms, we used “normalized to mode”. The mode is often used to compare the distribution of fluorescence intensity between different samples. It focuses on the shape of the distribution (with a max of 100%) rather than the absolute cell counts, which helps remove variations caused by different cell numbers or sample sizes, making it easier to compare populations based on fluorescence intensity. When normalizing to the mode, the highest peak in the histogram is scaled to 100%, and all other values are scaled relative to that peak. This allows for easy comparison of multiple histograms, even if the total number of cells (or events) differs between samples.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The results appear to confuse the actual sample size and p-value. Please carefully review the statistical analyses to ensure that biological replicates are accurately represented. Additionally, include p-values alongside fold change data in the text for clarity represented.</p>

<p>(10) The manuscript does not demonstrate how STF inhibition of IRE1α in ATM, specifically through CD9 and Trem2, controls diet-induced obesity. This aspect should be further elucidated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for the comment. In this study, we observed that STF inhibits IRE1α RNase activity in SVF and in sorted ATMs as well as in adipose tissue. The improvement in diet-induced obesity can be attributable to IRE1α inhibition in both adipocytes and macrophages as shown previously by myeloid and adipocyte-specific knockouts of IRE1α. To conclude whether the IRE1α in CD9- and/or Trem2-positive ATMs controls diet-induced obesity, genetic means would be needed to generate CD9- and/or Trem2-positive ATMs-specific deletion of IRE1α, which will be technically challenging at this moment as there is no CD9 or Trem2-specific Cre lines available.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. In our studies, we determined CD9 and Trem2 expression through flow cytometry and immunostaining staining. In flow experiment, CD9 and Trem2 were acquired from Biolegend: PE/Dazzle™ 594 anti-mouse CD9 (BioLegend Cat# 124821, RRID:AB_2800601); APC-conjugated Trem2 (R&amp;D Systems Cat# FAB17291N, RRID:AB_3646995), which were validated for FACS. For immunostaining: CD9  (Abcam Cat# ab223052, RRID:AB_2922392). and Trem2 (R&amp;D Systems Cat# MAB17291, RRID:AB_2208679).</p>

<p>(11) Figure 3D Macrophage markers F4/80 stained differently in Figure 5B; to avoid false positive staining, show isotype control to confirm actual staining. For eWAT immunofluorescence (Figures 3D, 5B, 6E)., counterstaining is needed in addition to macrophages, such as for adipocytes-perilipin, and phalloidin for total cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. Yes, Figures 3D macrophage marker F4/80 stained is differently from that of Figure 5B, as they are in different tissues, with Figure 3D in liver samples while Figure 5B in adipose tissues. In the liver, subsets of macrophages are known as Kupffer cells. Kupffer cells have distinct morphology and behavior compared to other tissue-resident macrophages. When stained with F4/80 in the liver, the pattern may reflect the specialized role of Kupffer cells, typically showing a more diffuse or localized staining around blood vessels and sinusoids. In adipose tissue, macrophages tend to accumulate around dead or dying adipocytes, forming what is known as &quot;crown-like structures&quot; (CLS). The F4/80 staining in adipose tissue shows a more clustered pattern, particularly around areas of fat tissue undergoing remodeling or inflammation. In adipose tissue, you can still see clear, defined cells even without counterstaining like perilipin, and importantly, adipocytes are generally way larger than macrophages in size. Yes, we agree that if with counterstaining it would enhance the accuracy. In the future study, we will use perilipin staining to make it easier to differentiate adipocytes from other structures and provide stronger data.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. The resolution for the scale bars in the images obtained during acquisition, somehow, isn’t sufficient enough to be clearly visible and requires the enlargement of the images to be seen clearly. In the revision, we have manually added the scale bars for clarity.</p>
