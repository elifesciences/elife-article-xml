<title>Abstract</title><p>Innate immune cells can acquire a memory phenotype, termed trained immunity, but the mechanism underlying the regulation of trained immunity remains largely elusive. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of Aurora kinase A (AurA) dampens trained immunity induced by β-glucan. ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analysis reveals that AurA inhibition restricts chromatin accessibility of genes associated with inflammatory pathways such as JAK-STAT, TNF and NF-κB pathways. Specifically, AurA inhibition promotes nuclear localization of FOXO3 and the expression of glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), a key enzyme responsible for adenosylmethionine (SAM) consumption. Metabolomic analysis confirms a reduction in SAM level upon AurA inhibition. As a result of SAM deficiency, trained mouse macrophages exhibit decreased H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 enrichment on gene regions of <italic>Il6 and Tnfα</italic>. Additionally, the tumor inhibition effect of β-glucan is notably abolished by AurA inhibition. Together, our findings identify an essential role of AurA in regulating trained immunity via a methylation-dependent manner by maintaining endogenous SAM level through mTOR-FOXO3-GNMT axis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Trained immunity is depicted as a memory state of innate immune cell, independent on adaptive immunity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Naik &amp; Fuchs, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ochando, Mulder, Madsen, Netea, &amp; Duivenvoorden, 2023</xref>). It can be induced by microbial polysaccharide component such as β-glucan, candida albicans and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cirovic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kalafati et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Quintin et al., 2012</xref>). Trained immune cells exhibit a rapid and enhanced response to secondary related or unrelated stimulus, relying on chromatin remodeling and metabolic rewiring(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bekkering et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cirovic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Su et al., 2021b</xref>). In trained cells, histone modification associated with active transcription such as H3-histone-lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is enriched in promoter regions of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines, supporting fast gene induction in response to secondary stimulation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Su et al., 2022</xref>). Trained cells display metabolic rewiring from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, which depends on mTOR signaling pathway(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). Intermediate metabolites in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle such as fumarate and succinate function as DNA or histone demethylase inhibitors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arts et al., 2016</xref>), whereas methionine and SAM in one carbon metabolism act as substrates for methyltransferases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ampomah et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, metabolic processing and metabolites intertwined with epigenetic regulation by directly supplying methylation substrates or regulating methylation enzyme activities. SAM, a ubiquitous methyl donor in biological process, can be converted into S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) for the synthesis of cysteine in glutathione metabolism. The ratio of SAM/SAH is critical in support histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 36(H3K36me3) to enhance IL-1β transcription(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). However, it has not been clear how SAM level is regulated in the trained immunity process.</p>
<p>Aurora kinase A (AurA), a serine/threonine kinase, plays a critical role in mitosis and is frequently overexpressed in tumor tissues. Inhibition of AurA in tumor cells restricts cell proliferation, migration and induces cell death(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Donnella et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jingtai et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tham et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wang-Bishop et al., 2019</xref>). Despite the well-established role of AurA on tumor cells growth and tumorigenesis, its function in innate immune cells like macrophages or in inflammation is not well understood(L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ding, Gu, Gao, Xiong, &amp; Zheng, 2015</xref>). Recent study reports that alisertib, a specific inhibitor of AurA, upregulates repressive histone methylation at lysine 27 via suppressing demethylase <italic>KDM6B</italic> gene expression during THP-1 cell (a human monocyte-like cell line) differentiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Park, Cho, Oh, Kim, &amp; Seo, 2018</xref>). Whether AurA plays a similar role in regulating trained immunity in macrophages remains unknown. Trained immunity can lead to aberrant inflammatory activity as well as enhanced anti-tumor effect(T. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Understanding the role of AurA in trained immunity would enable us to further exploit AurA for clinical application in cancer therapy.</p>
<p>In this study, we screened an epigenetic drug library and found that AurA inhibitors notably attenuated the trained immunity induced by β-glucan. Genetic disruption of AurA also showed a similar inhibitory effect on trained immunity. Mechanistically, AurA inhibition reduced the activation of mTOR signaling, thus leading to the nuclear localization of transcription factor FOXO3. Nuclear FOXO3 promoted the expression of GNMT to decrease the intracellular level of SAM, thereby inhibiting H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 enrichment on the promoters of inflammatory genes such as IL-6 and TNF-α. Moreover, pretreatment with alisertib abolished the anti-tumor effect conferred by β-glucan training in vivo. Thus, we conclude that AurA is an essential kinase required for the epigenetic regulation and antitumor activity of trained immunity in macrophages.</p>

<title>Inhibition of Aurora kinase A suppresses trained immunity in macrophages</title>
<p>Trained immunity is orchestrated by epigenetic reprogramming, while the specific epigenetic modulators involved in regulating trained immunity remain incompletely understood. To uncover the key epigenetic modulators in trained immunity, we performed a small molecule inhibitor screening by using an epigenetic drug library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref><bold>, Appendix 1—table 1)</bold>. Briefly, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were trained by β-glucan in the presence of different inhibitors for 24 h, rested for 3 days, and then restimulated by LPS for secondary response. As trained immunity in macrophages strongly induces cytokines production including IL-6 and TNF-α upon restimulation by pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or DAMPs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chakraborty et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Netea et al., 2020</xref>), we used IL-6 level from the supernatant as a readout in our screening. Among a total of 305 inhibitors in the compound library, 8 AurA inhibitors showed inhibitory effect on trained immunity-induced IL6 production in both primary and secondary screening with different concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To further confirm whether AurA identified in our screening could modulate trained immunity, we optimized β-glucan training protocol and used three AurA-specific inhibitors, and found that all these AurA inhibitors significantly inhibited IL-6 production in β-glucan-trained mouse macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Among these inhibitors, alisertib is an orally active and highly selective inhibitor for AurA and has been applied in preclinical investigation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bavetsias &amp; Linardopoulos, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mosse et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">O’Connor et al., 2019</xref>). We further observed that alisertib obviously downregulated IL-6 and TNF-α in trained BMDMs in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting cell viability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref>). Moreover, alisertib also decreased the transcriptional level of <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Tnfα</italic> in trained BMDMs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of AurA was increased by β-glucan training but was blocked by alisertib (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). To further confirm the role of AurA in trained immunity, we knocked down the expression of AurA by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in BMDMs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Consistently, knocking down of AurA also inhibited the production levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in trained BMDMs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Consistent with a recent report showing that tumor cells or tumor cell culture supernatant could function as the second stimulus for trained BMDMs(C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ding et al., 2023</xref>), we also observed increased TNF-α and IL-6 production of trained macrophages upon secondary stimulation using MC38 tumor cells culture supernatant, and such effect was also inhibited by AurA knockdown or inhibition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). To verify whether AurA regulates trained immunity in different cell models, we trained J774A.1 cells as well as THP-1 cells with β-glucan and also observed a reduction of IL-6 and TNF-α levels under AurA knockdown or inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Moreover, intraperitoneal administration of alisertib together with β-glucan also attenuated trained immunity in vivo (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1H-I</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that AurA inhibition suppresses β-glucan-induced trained immunity both in vitro and in vivo.</p>

<title>Aurora kinase A inhibition remodels chromatin landscape of inflammatory genes</title>
<p>Epigenetic reprogramming towards an open chromatin status is considered the basis for innate immune memory(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jeljeli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Moorlag et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Novakovic et al., 2016</xref>). To clarify the status of chromatin landscape under AurA inhibition, we performed an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) in trained BMDMs. In detail, mice were trained by intraperitoneal injection with β-glucan with or without alisertib, and the bone marrow cells were isolated and differentiated into BMDMs for ATAC-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Principal component analysis showed divergent distribution between AurA-treated and -untreated trained BMDMs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). And the erased regions by AurA inhibition were mapped into cellular processes like “regulation of growth”, “myeloid leukocyte activation” and “MAPK cascade” (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Analysis of enriched transcriptional binding motifs indicated that the erased peaks by alisertib were transcriptionally regulated by IRF1/2, FOS and STAT1/2, while the written peaks were transcriptionally regulated by PPARG, KLF4, ELF4 and FOXO1/3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Recent report shows that PPARG and KLF4 were critical transcription factors in controlling genes of macrophage M2 polarization and FOXO3 regulates the expression of multiple genes involved in pathway such as anti-inflammation and oxidative stress resistance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allemann, Lee, Beer, &amp; Saeedi Saravi, 2023</xref>). Consistent with the reduced production of IL-6 and TNF-α proteins by alisertib, we observed a decreased chromatin accessibility of proinflammatory gene such as <italic>Il6</italic>, <italic>Tnfα</italic>, <italic>Cxcl2</italic> and <italic>Il1a</italic> by alisertib intervention (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, the peaks of genes encoded M2 marker <italic>mrc1</italic> as well as <italic>chil3</italic> were enhanced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). These results support that AurA regulate epigenetic changes in β-glucan-induced trained immunity and its inhibition restricts the chromatin accessibility for inflammatory genes in macrophages.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we also performed RNA-seq with the trained BMDMs after LPS restimulation. Analysis of the transcriptome revealed that alisertib inhibited genes associated with pro-inflammatory pathway including “JAK-STAT signaling pathway”, “TNF signaling pathway” as well as “NF-kappa B pathway” in trained BMDMs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). In contrast, the up-regulated genes by alisertib were enriched in anti-inflammation pathway such as “FOXO signaling pathway” (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Additionally, differentially expressed transcription factors were analyzed and mapped into Gene Ontology (GO) with enrichment in “negative regulation of Toll-like receptor signaling pathway”, “negative regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome complex assembly” and “negative regulation of interleukin-6 production” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). Moreover, multiplex chemokine/cytokines array showed that alisertib decreased the chemokine/cytokines in trained BMDMs such as IL-6, TNF-α, CXCL2 and IL-1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that alisertib restrict chromatin accessibility in genes associated with inflammation activation in trained BMDMs.</p>

<title>Alisertib inhibits glycolysis and remodel TCA cycle</title>
<p>Various studies show that metabolic rewiring such as glycolysis is critical for macrophage memory both in meeting energy demands and epigenetic modification(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bekkering et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bhargavi &amp; Subbian, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Liu et al., 2024</xref>). To determine the metabolic pathway that AurA may regulates in trained immunity, we analyzed the glucose metabolism in trained BMDMs. As expected, β-glucan increased glycolysis as indicated by higher extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), with enhanced basal and maximum extracellular acidification rate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), both of which were inhibited by alisertib. In accordance, U-[<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose tracer showed that β-glucan treatment upregulated the glucose incorporation into lactate, and this induction was significantly inhibited by alisertib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Meanwhile, metabolites in TCA cycle, including malate, citrate, α-KG, fumarate and succinate, were all decreased in alisertib-treated trained BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Previous study showed that fumarate was accumulated after β-glucan training, and it induced epigenetic reprogramming to facilitate trained immunity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arts et al., 2016</xref>). However, alisertib treatment did not affect fumarate accumulation induced by β-glucan training (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), but increased tyrosine level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As a recent report shows tyrosine could be interconverted to fumarate(J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2023</xref>), we speculated the decreased fumarate from TCA cycle by alisertib may be compensated from tyrosine metabolism. Taken together, AurA inhibition inhibits glycolysis and remodels glucose metabolism in trained immunity.</p>

<title>Aurora kinase A regulates S-adenosylmethionine level in trained BMDMs</title>
<p>Next, we planned to identify the specific metabolites that support the function of AurA in trained immunity. KEGG analysis by using the differently expressed genes (DEGs) showed that glutathione (GSH) metabolism was significantly enriched (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Consistently, the intracellular level of GSH induced by β-glucan training was notably reduced after AurA inhibition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). It has been reported that β-glucan training induces a modified cellular redox status as elevation of ROS level and enhanced synthesis of GSH(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ferreira et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ferreira et al., 2023</xref>). Genetic deletion of genes involved in GSH synthesis disrupts the cellular redox balance and dampens trained immunity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Su et al., 2021a</xref>). To investigate whether AurA functions on trained immunity directly though decreasing GSH, we measured the level of serine and SAM, both of which are precursors of GSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). By targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, we found a significant reduction of SAM level under Aura inhibition, while the serine level remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Next, we further detected the downstream products of SAM such as SAH and HCY. Consistently, we observed that alisertib also significantly decreased SAH and HCY in trained BMDMs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). The decreased intracellular level of these precursors of GSH indicated that GSH was probably not a metabolite that AurA directly acted on, and its reduction was a result from SAM deficiency. SAM is directly linked to epigenetics as a methyl donor. For example, SAM induction upregulates the total intracellular level of histone lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) and thus increase H3K36me3 modification at the gene region of <italic>Il1β</italic> to promote IL-1β expression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rodriguez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). Since AurA inhibition resulted in intracellular SAM reduction, we wondered whether SAM upregulation would rescue trained immunity inhibited by alisertib or by AurA knocking down. GNMT is a key enzyme responsible for the conversion from SAM to SAH, and its deficiency blocked the conversion from SAM to SAH and thus leading to the increased ratio of SAM to SAH(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hwang et al., 2021</xref>; C. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yen, Lin, Chen, Chen, &amp; Chen, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, we found that AurA inhibition upregulated GNMT protein level in trained BMDMs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). To verify whether intracellular SAM level was responsible for AurA-mediated trained immunity, we knocked down GNMT in BMDMs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>), and found that knockdown of GNMT increased the level of SAM while decreased the level of SAH, leading to increased ratio of SAM/SAH under AurA inhibition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of GNMT rescued the IL-6 and TNF-α production in trained immunity under AurA inhibition in response to MC38 cell culture supernatant and LPS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). These results suggest that AurA promotes trained immunity by supplying endogenous SAM level which is controlled by GNMT.</p>

<title>Inhibition of Aurora kinase A impairs histone trimethylation at H3K4 and H3K36</title>
<p>SAM is a well-known methyl donor for nearly all cellular methylation events including DNA, RNA and histone methylation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Keen &amp; Taylor, 2004</xref>). Recent study reports that SAM deficiency limits histone methylation by phosphorylation of Rph1, which is a demethylase for H3K36me3(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Ye et al., 2019</xref>). Meanwhile, SAM prefers to induce histone methylation changes in targeted sites like K4 without global changes to DNA and RNA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pham et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether changes in histone methylation occurred when intracellular SAM level was inhibited by AurA inhibition. Among the major active histone methylation markers and repressive markers, we found that trimethylation at H3K4 and H3K36, induced by β-glucan training, were decreased by alisertib. Meanwhile, alisertib did not affect trimethylation at H3K9 and monomethylation at H3K4, accompanied with a modest change but no significant difference in trimethylation at H3K27 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1 A</xref>). Epigenetic modification including H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 promotes chromatin accessibility thus promoting rapid transcription of genes in response to second stimulation in trained immunity. This prompted us to investigate whether alisertib dampened β-glucan-induced epigenetic modification in genes like <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Tnfα</italic>. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that both H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 enrichment on IL-6 and TNF-α promoters induced by β-glucan were notably decreased by alisertib (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Consistently, knockdown of GNMT recovered the expression level of histone methylation and the enrichment level of H3K4me3 as well as H3K36me3 on gene promoter of <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Tnfα</italic>, which was inhibited by alisertib (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Therefore, suppression of trained immunity caused by AurA inhibition is a consequence of decreased trimethylation events in histone by SAM deficiency.</p>

<title>Aurora kinase A regulates GNMT through transcription factor FOXO3</title>
<p>Given the role of GNMT in affecting SAM level, we questioned how AurA inhibition mediated GNMT expression in trained immunity. It was reported that nuclear FOXO3 facilitated GNMT expression to regulate the cell redox response(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hwang et al., 2021</xref>). Motif analysis of the ATAC-seq indicated that AurA inhibition promoted FOXO signal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that AurA inhibition upregulated GNMT expression via FOXO3. Firstly, we found that knockdown of FOXO3 inhibited GNMT protein level in BMDMs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Meanwhile, FOXO3 knockdown prevented the enhanced GNMT expression under AurA inhibition and knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B-C</xref>), indicating the involvement of FOXO3 in AurA function. Moreover, knockdown of FOXO3 also restored the trained immunity as indicated by elevation of IL-6 level, which was inhibited by alisertib (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). To further investigate how AurA regulates FOXO3, we detected the phosphorylation level of FOXO3. The result showed that β-glucan training induced the phosphorylation of FOXO3 at Ser315 and AurA inhibition prevented the phosphorylation induction by β-glucan (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Consistently, immunofluorescence detection showed a higher ratio of nuclear enrichment of FOXO3 by AurA inhibition compared with β-glucan training (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Nuclear enrichment of FOXO3 is inhibited by AKT-mTOR activation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">van der Vos et al., 2012</xref>). To demonstrate whether the increased FOXO3 nuclear localization by alisertib was associated with AKT-pathway activation, we checked the activation of AKT-mTOR in trained BMDMs. As expected, both pharmacological and genetic disruption of AurA significantly inhibited β-glucan-induced phosphorylation of AKT-mTOR-S6K-S6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Additionally, mTOR activation by its agonist MHY1485 promoted trained immunity under aurora kinase A inhibition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>), suggesting that AKT-mTOR-FOXO3 signaling pathway act downstream of AurA-mediated trained immunity. In conclusion, these results show the role of transcription factor FOXO3 in AurA-mediated GNMT expression in trained immunity, which depending on the activation of AKT-mTOR pathway.</p>

<title>Alisertib abrogates the anti-tumor effect induced by trained immunity</title>
<p>Trained immunity has been implicated in anti-tumor immunity and is considered as a new branch for cancer immunotherapy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bird, 2023</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ding et al., 2023</xref>; T. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wang et al., 2023</xref>).

Therefore, we conducted a tumor model in mice preinjected with β-glucan (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).

The population of myeloid cells or macrophage induced by β-glucan or by alisertib intervention showed no changes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Studies have shown that GNMT is a tumor suppressor gene and its expression is downregulated in tumor tissue(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">DebRoy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Simile et al., 2022</xref>). Considering that AurA inhibition enhanced GNMT expression in BMDMs in our experiment, we next detected GNMT expression in tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). We found that TAMs from alisertib inhibited mice exhibited a higher expression of GNMT, compared with β-glucan trained mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Moreover, compared with alisertib-treated mice, the CD45<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells in tumor tissue from β-glucan trained mice showed a higher intracellular phospho-S6, suggesting that AurA inhibition inhibited mTOR activation in macrophages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Trained immunity defines the memory ability of innate immune cells in response to second challenge. Despite the fact that trained immunity has been described decades ago, the mechanism that supports trained immunity is still elusive. In this study, we identified that AurA was required for trained immunity. AurA deficiency or inhibition decreased Il-6 and TNF-α production in β-glucan-trained BMDMs upon rechallenge by LPS or supernatant from tumor cells. Moreover, alisertib impaired the anti-tumor effect induced by β-glucan. We also discovered that alisertib induced GNMT expression via mTOR-FOXO3 axis and thus decreased SAM production, resulting in decreased H3K36me3 and H3K4me3 modification on the promotors of inflammatory genes, highlighting the role of AurA kinase as hub for methionine metabolism and epigenetics.</p>
<p>S-adenosylmethionine, is one of the most ubiquitous metabolites in host. It contains methyl group, adenosyl group and ACP group, all of which can be transferred by corresponding transferases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee, Ren, Jeon, &amp; Liu, 2023</xref>). It is reported that SAM supplement in mammals is consumed for methylation events on DNA or histone proteins, which affects biological process like tissue differentiation and gene expression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dai, Ramesh, &amp; Locasale, 2020</xref>). In macrophages, DNMT transfers methyl group from SAM to DNA and leads to gene repression such as <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Dusp4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ampomah et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ji et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jung, Park, &amp; Ko, 2020</xref>). However, SAM is also reported to play an active role in primary macrophage to increase IL-1β expression in response to LPS, and its precursor methionine can promote M1 macrophage activation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dos Santos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). While, whether SAM is involved in trained immunity is not investigated. In our study, AurA inhibition reduced endogenous SAM level in trained BMDMs. It also inhibited the trimethylation at H3K4 and histone H3K36 via upregulating GNMT. GNMT is a glycine methyltransferase, which transfers methyl group from SAM to glycine to lower intracellular SAM level(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Luka, Mudd, &amp; Wagner, 2009</xref>). It is well-known that inhibition of AurA would cause abnormal chromatin segregation and chromatin instability. Previous research report that chromatin instability make sensitivity to SAM and polyamine related gene including GNMT, which might also explain the function of AurA inhibition on SAM(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Islam et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, SAM is the precursor for glutathione. It has been reported that methionine and SAM reduce oxidative damage by increasing glutathione(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2022</xref>). However, we found that AurA inhibition didn’t increase the level of glutathione, which suggests that alisertib inhibited trained immunity in a ROS independent manner, but through SAM-mediated epigenetic regulation.</p>
<p>AurA belongs to serine and threonine kinase family. It plays critical role in centrosome and chromosome segregation and cell mitosis. Activation of AurA is associated with tumor progression and drug resistance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zhao, Zhang, Yang, &amp; Yang, 2023</xref>). During past two decades, there have been developed more than twenty agents for AurA including alisertib and VIC-1911(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Attwood, Fabbro, Sokolov, Knapp, &amp; Schioth, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bavetsias &amp; Linardopoulos, 2015</xref>). These agents have been evaluated across metastatic breast cancer, lung cancer, gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma in clinical trails(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Canova et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Haddad et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Melichar et al., 2015</xref>). Among these inhibitors, alisertib is a highly selective inhibitor for AurA. However, alisertib has limited efficacy against both solid and hematological tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Beltran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mosse et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">O’Connor et al., 2019</xref>). In recent years, there are researches trying to explain the resistance to AurA-targeted therapy and reveal feedback loops existed in tumor cells, which contributes to drug resistance. For example, AurA inhibition by alisertib upregulates PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and allows immune escape(X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). AurA inhibition also enhances fatty acid oxidation to overcome the glycolysis attenuation in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>). However, these studies mainly focus on investigating the role of AurA in tumor cells while its role in immune cells is rarely understood. In this study, we demonstrated that AurA regulated the trained immunity in macrophages. And AurA inhibition significantly decreased the trained immunity induced by β-glucan in vitro and in vivo. AurA is described to be expressed and activated in stem-cell like cells, bone marrow and epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Qi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rio-Vilarino et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>).Clinical data show that alisertib by oral administration of rapidly distributes in bone marrow, making bone marrow a site susceptible to side effect(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Oh, Power, Zhang, Daniels, &amp; Elmquist, 2022</xref>). Due to the inhibition effect of alisertib on trained immunity in bone marrow, this may be the potential explanation for the poor therapeutic efficacy or drug resistance of alisertib on patients with cancer. Trained immunity can reprogram the myeloid cells like neutrophils and enhance its anti-tumor activity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Moorlag et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, our findings provide a potential guidance for AurA inhibitor application in clinical cancer therapy, and the clues for design of new inhibitors such as avoiding targets on bone marrow.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that AurA supports trained immunity by maintain SAM level. As a result of SAM deficiency under AurA inhibition, H3K4m3 and H3K36me3 level are reduced and trained immunity is inhibited. Our finding reveals a novel AurA-SAM metabolic axis as a new mechanism for trained immunity. Furthermore, our findings also identify a potential guidance for the clinical application of AurA, and new clues for the design of next-generation AurA inhibitors in the future.</p>

<p>Drugs screening was performed using a drug library from TargetMol (Shanghai, China). A detailed drugs list was provided in <bold>Appendix 1—table 1</bold>. For the primary screening, 1×10<sup>5</sup> BMDMs were seeded into 96-wells plate. Following overnight incubation, the BMDMs were trained with β-glucan (100 μg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#G6513) in the presence of drugs at a concentration of 5 μM for 24 h while the secondary screening was performed with drugs at two concentrations of 0.2 and 1 μM. Control cells received vehicle control DMSO. After 24 h training, cells were washed with 1×PBS and further cultured in fresh complete medium (Containing 10% L929 supernatant) for 3 days, followed by LPS stimulation (100 ng/mL). The culture supernatant was subjected to ELISA to measure IL-6. The relative amount of IL-6 was calculated as the fold change of the drugs-treated trained cells compared with the glucan only-treated cells. The drugs that showed suppressing effects with fold changes of 0.8-fold or lower, were considered to be inhibitors for trained immunity.</p>

The findings are <bold>valuable</bold> to the trained immunity field because they provide an in-depth look at a common inducer of trained immunity, beta-glucan.</p>

<p>This work regards the role of Aurora Kinase A (AurA) in trained immunity. The authors claim that AurA is essential to the induction of trained immunity. The paper starts with a series of experiments showing the effects of suppressing AurA on beta-glucan-trained immunity. This is followed by an account of how AurA inhibition changes the epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming that are characteristic of trained immunity. The authors then zoom in on specific metabolic and epigenetic processes (regulation of S-adenocylmethionine metabolism &amp; histone methylation). Finally, an inhibitor of AurA is used to reduce beta-glucan's anti-tumour effects in a subcutaneous MC-38 model.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>With the exception of my confusion around the methods used for relative gene expression measurements, the experimental methods are generally well-described. I appreciate the authors' broad approach to studying different key aspects of trained immunity (from comprehensive transcriptome/chromatin accessibility measurements to detailed mechanistic experiments). Approaching the hypothesis from many different angles inspires confidence in the results (although not completely - see weaknesses section). Furthermore, the large drug-screening panel is a valuable tool as these drugs are readily available for translational drug-repurposing research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript contains factual inaccuracies such as:</p>
<p>
(a) Intro: the claim that trained cells display a shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis based on the paper by Cheng et al. in 2014; this was later shown to be dependent on the dose of stimulation and actually both glycolysis and OXPHOS are generally upregulated in trained cells (pmid 32320649)</p>
<p>
(b) Discussion: Trained immunity was first described as such in 2011, not decades ago.</p>
<p>(2) The authors approach their hypothesis from different angles, which inspires a degree of confidence in the results. However, the statistical methods and reporting are underwhelming.</p>
<p>
(a) Graphs depict mean +/- SEM, whereas mean +/- SD is almost always more informative.</p>
<p>
(b) The use of 1-tailed tests is dubious in this scenario. Furthermore, in many experiments/figures the case could be made that the comparisons should be considered paired (the responses of cells from the same animal are inherently not independent due to their shared genetic background and, up until cell isolation, the same host factors like serum composition/microbiome/systemic inflammation etc).</p>
<p>
(c) It could be explained a little more clearly how multiple testing correction was done and why specific tests were chosen in each instance.</p>
<p>
(d) Most experiments are done with n = 3, some experiments are done with n = 5. This is not a lot. While I don't think power analyses should be required for simple in vitro experiments, I would be wary of drawing conclusions based on n = 3. It is also not indicated if the data points were acquired in independent experiments. ATAC-seq/RNA-seq was, judging by the figures, done on only 2 mice per group. No power calculations were done for the in vivo tumor model.</p>
<p>
(e) Furthermore, the data spread in many experiments (particularly BMDM experiments) is extremely small. I wonder if these are true biological replicates, meaning each point represents BMDMs from a different animal? (disclaimer: I work with human materials where the spread is of course always much larger than in animal experiments, so I might be misjudging this.).</p>
<p>(3) Maybe the authors are reserving this for a separate paper, but it would be fantastic if the authors would report the outcomes of the entire drug screening instead of only a selected few. The field would benefit from this as it would save needless repeat experiments. The list of drugs contains several known inhibitors of training (e.g. mTOR inhibitors) so there must have been more 'hits' than the reported 8 Aurora inhibitors.</p>
<p>(4) Relating to the drug screen and subsequent experiments: it is unclear to me in supplementary figure 1B which concentrations belong to secondary screens #1/#2 - the methods mention 5 µM for the primary screen and &quot;0.2 and 1 µM&quot; for secondary screens, is it in this order or in order of descending concentration?</p>
<p>
(a) It is unclear if the drug screen was performed with technical replicates or not - the supplementary figure 1B suggests no replicates and quite a large spread (in some cases lower concentration works better?)</p>
<p>(5) The methods for (presumably) qPCR for measuring gene expression in Figure 1C are missing. Which reference gene was used and is this a suitably stable gene?</p>
<p>(6) From the complete unedited blot image of Figure 1D it appears that the p-Aurora and total Aurora are not from the same gel (discordant number of lanes and positioning). This could be alright if there are no/only slight technical errors, but I find it misleading as it is presented as if the actin (loading control to account for aforementioned technical errors!) counts for the entire figure.</p>
<p>(7) Figure 2: This figure highlights results that are by far not the strongest ones - I think the 'top hits' deserve some more glory. A small explanation on why the highlighted results were selected would have been fitting.</p>
<p>(8) Figure 3 incl supplement: the carbon tracing experiments show more glucose-carbon going into TCA cycle (suggesting upregulated oxidative metabolism), but no mito stress test was performed on the seahorse.</p>
<p>(9) Inconsistent use of an 'alisertib-alone' control in addition to 'medium', 'b-glucan', 'b-glucan + alisertib'. This control would be of great added value in many cases, in my opinion.</p>
<p>(10) Figure 4A: looking at the unedited blot images, the blot for H3K36me3 appears in its original orientation, whereas other images appear horizontally mirrored. Please note, I don't think there is any malicious intent but this is quite sloppy and the authors should explain why/how this happened (are they different gels and the loading sequence was reversed?)</p>
<p>(11) For many figures, for example prominently figure 5, the text describes 'beta-glucan training' whereas the figures actually depict acute stimulation with beta-glucan. While this is partially a semantic issue (technically, the stimulation is 'the training-phase' of the experiment), this could confuse the reader.</p>
<p>(12) Figure 6: Cytokines, especially IL-6 and IL-1β, can be excreted by tumour cells and have pro-tumoral functions. This is not likely in the context of the other results in this case, but since there is flow cytometry data from the tumour material it would have been nice to see also intracellular cytokine staining to pinpoint the source of these cytokines.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript investigates the inhibition of Aurora A and its impact on β-glucan-induced trained immunity via the FOXO3/GNMT pathway. The study demonstrates that inhibition of Aurora A leads to overconsumption of SAM, which subsequently impairs the epigenetic reprogramming of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, effectively abolishing the training effect.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors identify the role of Aurora A through small molecule screening and validation using a variety of molecular and biochemical approaches. Overall, the findings are interesting and shed light on the previously underexplored role of Aurora A in the induction of β-glucan-driven epigenetic change.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Given the established role of histone methylations, such as H3K4me3, in trained immunity, it is not surprising that depletion of the methyl donor SAM impairs the training response. Nonetheless, this study provides solid evidence supporting the role of Aurora A in β-glucan-induced trained immunity in murine macrophages. The part of in vivo trained immunity antitumor effect is insufficient to support the final claim as using Alisertib could inhibits Aurora A other cell types other than myeloid cells.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This work regards the role of Aurora Kinase A (AurA) in trained immunity. The authors claim that AurA is essential to the induction of trained immunity. The paper starts with a series of experiments showing the effects of suppressing AurA on beta-glucan-trained immunity. This is followed by an account of how AurA inhibition changes the epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming that are characteristic of trained immunity. The authors then zoom in on specific metabolic and epigenetic processes (regulation of S-adenosylmethionine metabolism &amp; histone methylation). Finally, an inhibitor of AurA is used to reduce beta-glucan's anti-tumour effects in a subcutaneous MC-38 model.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>With the exception of my confusion around the methods used for relative gene expression measurements, the experimental methods are generally well-described. I appreciate the authors' broad approach to studying different key aspects of trained immunity (from comprehensive transcriptome/chromatin accessibility measurements to detailed mechanistic experiments). Approaching the hypothesis from many different angles inspires confidence in the results (although not completely - see weaknesses section). Furthermore, the large drug-screening panel is a valuable tool as these drugs are readily available for translational drug-repurposing research.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive and encouraging comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript contains factual inaccuracies such as: (a) Intro: the claim that trained cells display a shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis based on the paper by Cheng et al. in 2014; this was later shown to be dependent on the dose of stimulation and actually both glycolysis and OXPHOS are generally upregulated in trained cells (pmid 32320649).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for pointing out this inaccuracy, and we will revise our statement to ensure accurate and updated description. We are aware that trained immunity involves different metabolic pathways, including both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation[1, 2]. We also detected Oxygen Consumption Rate (OCR, as detailed in comment#8) but observed no increase of oxygen consumption in trained BMDMs while previous study reported decreased oxidative phosphorylation[3]. We will discuss the potential reasons underlying such different results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) Discussion: Trained immunity was first described as such in 2011, not decades ago.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for the inaccurate description, and we will correct the statement in our revised manuscript as “Despite the fact that the concept of “trained immunity” has been proposed since 2011, the mechanisms that regulate trained immunity are still not completely understood.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors approach their hypothesis from different angles, which inspires a degree of confidence in the results. However, the statistical methods and reporting are underwhelming.</p>
<p>(a) Graphs depict mean +/- SEM, whereas mean +/- SD is almost always more informative. (b) The use of 1-tailed tests is dubious in this scenario. Furthermore, in many experiments/figures the case could be made that the comparisons should be considered paired (the responses of cells from the same animal are inherently not independent due to their shared genetic background and, up until cell isolation, the same host factors like serum composition/microbiome/systemic inflammation etc). (c) It could be explained a little more clearly how multiple testing correction was done and why specific tests were chosen in each instance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestions and we will revise all data presented as mean ± SEM in the manuscript to mean ± SD, and provide a detailed description of how multiple comparisons were performed and explain the rationale behind the different comparison methods used. Previous studies have shown that knockdown of GNMT increases intracellular SAM level and knockdown of GNMT is commonly used as a method to upregulate SAM[4-6]. Thus we used 1-tailed test in Figure 3J.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(d) Most experiments are done with n = 3, some experiments are done with n = 5. This is not a lot. While I don't think power analyses should be required for simple in vitro experiments, I would be wary of drawing conclusions based on n = 3. It is also not indicated if the data points were acquired in independent experiments. ATAC-seq/RNA-seq was, judging by the figures, done on only 2 mice per group. No power calculations were done for the in vivo tumor model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for the confusion in our description in figure legends. As for in vitro studies, we performed at least three independent experiments (BMs isolated from different mice) but we only display technical replicates data from one experiment in our manuscript. As for seq data, we acknowledge the reviewer's concern regarding the small sample size (n=2) in our RNA-seq/ATAC-seq experiment. We consider the sequencing experiment mainly as an exploratory approach, and performed rigorous quality control and normalization of the sequencing data to ensure the reliability of our findings. While we understand that a larger sample size would be ideal for drawing more definitive conclusions, we believe that the current data offer valuable preliminary insights that can inform future studies with larger cohorts. As a complementary method, we conducted ChIP PCR for detecting active histone modification enrichment in <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Tnf</italic> region to further verify the increased accessibility of trained immunity induced inflammatory genes and reliability of our conclusions despite the small sample size. We hope this clarifies our approach, and we would be happy to further acknowledge and discuss the limitations of the current study.</p>
<p>For the in vivo experiment, we determined the sample size by referring to the animal numbers used for similar experiments in literatures. And according to a reported resource equation approach for calculating sample size in animal studies[7], n=5-7 is suitable for most of our mouse experiments. We will describe the details in the revised methods part.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(e) Furthermore, the data spread in many experiments (particularly BMDM experiments) is extremely small. I wonder if these are true biological replicates, meaning each point represents BMDMs from a different animal? (disclaimer: I work with human materials where the spread is of course always much larger than in animal experiments, so I might be misjudging this.).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for the confusion in our description in figure legends. In vivo experiments represent individual mice as biological replicates, the exact values of n are reported in figure legends and each point represents data from a different animal (Figure 1I, and Figure 6). The in vitro cell assay was performed in triplicates, each experiment was independently replicated at least three times and points represents technical replicates.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Maybe the authors are reserving this for a separate paper, but it would be fantastic if the authors would report the outcomes of the entire drug screening instead of only a selected few. The field would benefit from this as it would save needless repeat experiments. The list of drugs contains several known inhibitors of training (e.g. mTOR inhibitors) so there must have been more 'hits' than the reported 8 Aurora inhibitors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion and we will report the outcomes of the entire drug screening in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Relating to the drug screen and subsequent experiments: it is unclear to me in supplementary figure 1B which concentrations belong to secondary screens #1/#2 - the methods mention 5 µM for the primary screen and &quot;0.2 and 1 µM&quot; for secondary screens, is it in this order or in order of descending concentration?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments and we are sorry for unclear labelled results in supplementary 1B. We performed secondary drug screen at two concentrations, and drug concentrations corresponding to secondary screen#1 and #2 are 0.2, 1 μM respectively. That is to say, it is just in this order, not in an order of descending concentration.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(a) It is unclear if the drug screen was performed with technical replicates or not - the supplementary figure 1B suggests no replicates and quite a large spread (in some cases lower concentration works better?)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your question. The drug screen was performed without technical replicates. Actually, we observed s a lower concentration works better in some cases. This might be due to the fact that the drug's effect correlates positively with its concentration only within a specific range (as seen in comment#4).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The methods for (presumably) qPCR for measuring gene expression in Figure 1C are missing. Which reference gene was used and is this a suitably stable gene?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for the omission for the qPCR method. The mRNA expression of <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Tnf</italic> in trained BMDMs was normalized to untrained BMDMs and β-actin served as a reference gene. And we will describe in detail in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) From the complete unedited blot image of Figure 1D it appears that the p-Aurora and total Aurora are not from the same gel (discordant number of lanes and positioning). This could be alright if there are no/only slight technical errors, but I find it misleading as it is presented as if the actin (loading control to account for aforementioned technical errors!) counts for the entire figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for this comment. In the original data, p-Aurora and total Aurora were from different gels. In this experiment the membrane stripping/reprobing after p-Aurora antibody did now work well, so we couldn’t get all results from one gel, and we had to run another gel using the same samples to blot with anti-aurora antibody. Yes we should have provided separated actin blots as loading controls for this experiment. We will repeat the experiment and provide original data of three biological replicates to confirm the experiment result.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 2: This figure highlights results that are by far not the strongest ones - I think the 'top hits' deserve some more glory. A small explanation on why the highlighted results were selected would have been fitting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the valuable suggestion. We will make a discussion in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Figure 3 incl supplement: the carbon tracing experiments show more glucose-carbon going into TCA cycle (suggesting upregulated oxidative metabolism), but no mito stress test was performed on the seahorse.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this question raised by the reviewer. We previously performed seahorse XF analyze to measure mito stress in β-glucan trained BMDMs in combination with alisertib (data not shown in our submitted manuscript). The results showed no increase in oxidative phosphorylation under β-glucan stimulation.</p>

<p>(8) Inconsistent use of an 'alisertib-alone' control in addition to 'medium', 'b-glucan', 'b-glucan + alisertib'. This control would be of great added value in many cases, in my opinion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We appreciate that including “alisertib-alone” group throughout all the experiments may add more value to the findings. We set the aim of the current study to investigate the role of Aurora kinase A in trained immunity. Therefore, in most settings, we did not focus on the role of aurora kinase A without β-glucan stimulation. Initially, we showed in Figure 1B and 1C that alisertib alone in a concentration lower than 1μM (included) does not affect the response to secondary stimulus. In a previous report, the authors showed that Aurora A inhibitor alone did not affect trained immunity[8]. Thus, we did not include this control group in all of the experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Figure 4A: looking at the unedited blot images, the blot for H3K36me3 appears in its original orientation, whereas other images appear horizontally mirrored. Please note, I don't think there is any malicious intent but this is quite sloppy and the authors should explain why/how this happened (are they different gels and the loading sequence was reversed?)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this error. After checking the original data, we found that we indeed misassembled the orientation of several blots. We went through the assembling process and figured out that some orientations were assembled according to the loading sequences but not saved, so that the orientations in Figure 4A were not consistent with the unedited blot image. We are sorry for the careless mistake, and we will double check to make sure all the blots are correctly assembled in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) For many figures, for example prominently figure 5, the text describes 'beta-glucan training' whereas the figures actually depict acute stimulation with beta-glucan. While this is partially a semantic issue (technically, the stimulation is 'the training-phase' of the experiment), this could confuse the reader.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion and we will reorganize our language to ensure clarity and avoid any inconsistencies that might lead to misunderstanding.</p>

<p>(11) Figure 6: Cytokines, especially IL-6 and IL-1β, can be excreted by tumour cells and have pro-tumoral functions. This is not likely in the context of the other results in this case, but since there is flow cytometry data from the tumour material it would have been nice to see also intracellular cytokine staining to pinpoint the source of these cytokines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. To address potential concerns raised by the reviewers, we will perform intracellular cytokines staining in tumor experiments with mice trained with β-glucan or in combination with alisertib followed MC38 inoculation.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript investigates the inhibition of Aurora A and its impact on β-glucan-induced trained immunity via the FOXO3/GNMT pathway. The study demonstrates that inhibition of Aurora A leads to overconsumption of SAM, which subsequently impairs the epigenetic reprogramming of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, effectively abolishing the training effect.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors identify the role of Aurora A through small molecule screening and validation using a variety of molecular and biochemical approaches. Overall, the findings are interesting and shed light on the previously underexplored role of Aurora A in the induction of β-glucan-driven epigenetic change.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive and encouraging comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Given the established role of histone methylations, such as H3K4me3, in trained immunity, it is not surprising that depletion of the methyl donor SAM impairs the training response. Nonetheless, this study provides solid evidence supporting the role of Aurora A in β-glucan-induced trained immunity in murine macrophages. The part of in vivo trained immunity antitumor effect is insufficient to support the final claim as using Alisertib could inhibits Aurora A other cell types other than myeloid cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the question raised by the reviewer. Though SAM generally acts as methyl donor, whether the epigenetic reprogram in trained immunity is directly linked to SAM metabolism is not known. In our study, we provided evidence suggesting the necessity of SAM maintenance in supporting trained immunity. As for in vivo tumor model, tumor cells were subcutaneously inoculated 24 h after oral administration of alisertib. Previous studies showed alisertib administered orally had a half-life of 10 h and 90% concentration reduction in serum after 24 h [9, 10]. Therefore, we suppose that tumor cells are more susceptible to long-term effects of drugs on the immune system rather than directly affected by alisertib. To further address the reviewer’s concern, we will perform bone marrow transplantation (trained mice as donor and naïve mice as recipient) to clarify the mechanistic contribution of trained immunity versus off-target effects.</p>
