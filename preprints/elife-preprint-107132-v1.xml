<title>Abstract</title><p>The emergence and progression of tuberculosis (TB) result from the intricate interplay among the pathogen, host, and environmental factors. In 2022, there were 10.6 million new TB cases reported globally, leading to 1.3 million deaths. In regions with a high prevalence of zoonotic TB, <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> (<italic>M. bovis</italic>) accounts for approximately 10% of human TB cases. The immune evasion mechanisms and latent infections of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>M. tb</italic>) complicate our understanding of the host immune response to TB. This study identifies a novel host factor, RNA-binding motif protein X-linked 2 (RBMX2), which shows potential against <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection. However, the specific molecular mechanisms and roles of RBMX2 during <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection remain poorly understood. Our investigations revealed that following infection, RBMX2 was highly expressed in various cell types, including embryonic bovine lung (EBL) cells, bovine macrophage (BoMac) cells, bovine lung alveolar primary cells, and human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (A549). Using a multifaceted approach that included global transcriptional sequencing, proteomics, cell adhesion assays, ChIP-PCR, and Western blot analyses, we demonstrated that RBMX2 inhibits cell adhesion and tight junction formation in EBL cells while promoting the adhesion and invasion of <italic>M. bovis</italic> through the activation of the p65 pathway. Furthermore, our data suggest that RBMX2 regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process strongly associated with cancer, as indicated by our global transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics analyses. To further explore the relationship between RBMX2 and cancer, we analyzed the TIMER2.0 database and found elevated expression levels of RBMX2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) tissues compared to normal lung tissues. This finding was corroborated by immunofluorescence validation. After constructing an <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected BoMac-induced EBL-EMT model, we confirmed that RBMX2 contributes to EMT by activating the p65/MMP-9 pathway post-infection.</p>
<p>This study elucidates the role of <italic>RBMX2</italic> as a novel host factor with potential anti-TB functions that inhibit TB-induced EMT. These insights have vital implications for the development of TB vaccines and therapeutic strategies for TB-mediated lung cancer, highlighting <italic>RBMX2</italic> as a promising target for future research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health challenge, with approximately 10.6 million new cases reported in 2022, leading to 1.3 million deaths worldwide <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>M. tb</italic>) variant <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> (<italic>M. bovis</italic>), a zoonotic pathogen, accounts for approximately 10% of human TB cases in regions with high prevalence of zoonotic diseases. The immune evasion mechanisms employed by <italic>M. tb</italic> pose challenges in understanding the host immune response and the progression of TB.</p>
<p>Recent studies have highlighted the interplay between chronic infections, such as TB, and cancer development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Emerging evidence suggests that the inflammatory environment induced by persistent infections can contribute to cellular transformations associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process linked to cancer metastasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. However, the specific mechanisms underlying this relationship, particularly concerning host factors involved in TB infection, remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>In this context, we focus on RNA-binding motif protein X-linked 2 (RBMX2), a host factor that has emerged as a potential modulator of both TB infection and cancer progression. In previous studies, we also reported that RBMX2 can regulate the retention of APAF-1 introns through alternative splicing, mediating apoptosis following <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, previous research also indicates that RBMX displays significant and contrasting effects depending on the tumor type, functioning either as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor. For instance, its overexpression has been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and T-cell lymphomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, while a reduction in RBMX levels has been noted in Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, RBMX2 involvement in TB infection and its regulatory effects on EMT have not been thoroughly investigated.</p>
<p>This study aims to elucidate the role of RBMX2 in <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection and its impact on EMT in epithelial cells. We hypothesize that RBMX2 promotes the adhesion and invasion of <italic>M. bovis</italic> in host cells while facilitating the EMT process through the activation of the p65/MMP-9 signaling pathway. By investigating these interactions, we seek to provide insights into the potential dual role of RBMX2 in TB and lung cancer, highlighting its significance as a therapeutic target.</p>

<title>Elevated expression of RBMX2 in <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic>-infected cells and tuberculous Lesions</title>
<p><italic>M. bovis</italic> was used to infect the EBL cell library that was constructed using CRISPR/Cas9 technology in our laboratory at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100:1. We assessed cell survival and conducted high-throughput sequencing on the viable cells to identify key host factors with potential anti-<italic>M. bovis</italic> capabilities. Notably, the RBMX2 knockout cells exhibited significant resistance to the infection.</p>
<p>Further analysis using AlphaFold multimer revealed that amino acid positions 56–134 of <italic>RBMX2</italic> contain an RNA recognition sequence (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). Additionally, we identified 611 RBM family sequences at the bovine protein exon level and categorized them into subfamilies based on motif similarity. <italic>RBMX2</italic> was primarily classified within subfamily VII, which includes proteins such as <italic>EIF3G</italic>, <italic>RBM14</italic>, <italic>RBM42</italic>, <italic>RBMX44</italic>, <italic>RBM17</italic>, <italic>PUF60</italic>, <italic>SART3</italic>, and <italic>RBM25</italic> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>). A comparison of amino acid sequences indicated a high degree of conservation of RBMX2 across different species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1a">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>To further confirm <italic>RBMX2</italic> expression in EBL cells following infection with <italic>M. bovis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> Bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG), we collected RNA samples at 24, 48, and 72 hours post-infection (hpi). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results demonstrated that <italic>RBMX2</italic> expression was significantly upregulated after both <italic>M. bovis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG infections (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Moreover, elevated <italic>RBMX2</italic> levels were observed in bovine lung macrophages (BoMac cells), bovine lung alveolar primary cells, and human lung epithelial cells (A549 cells) following <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1C-E</xref>).</p>

<p>In generating <italic>RBMX2</italic> monoclonal knockout (KO) cells, monoclonal cells were selected through limited dilution in 96-well plates. Sanger sequencing was conducted to identify different monoclonal cells with distinct knockout sites (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>The impact of <italic>RBMX2</italic> knockout on EBL cells indicated that <italic>RBMX2</italic> did not alter cell morphology, as evidenced by cytoskeleton staining using phalloidine (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>). Additionally, cellular proliferation was assessed using the EDU assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1G and H</xref>) and CCK-8 assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>), along with cell cycle progression evaluated by Flow cytometry (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the potential role of <italic>RBMX2</italic> in resistance to <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection, we assessed the survival rate of EBL cells and H1299 cells at different hours post-infection using CCK-8 assay.

<p>The functional significance of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in EBL cells infected with <italic>RBMX2</italic> knockout was further explored using GO and KEGG analyses. The most significantly affected biological processes included epithelial cell differentiation, cell adhesion and biological adhesion. The cellular components most affected were the extracellular region, extracellular region part, extracellular space, and plasma membrane part. The molecular functions primarily associated with activin receptor activity, type I (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>The KEGG pathway entries revealed that these genes were linked to a various pathways, including ECM–receptor interaction, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and vascular smooth muscle contraction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Proteomics also validated these phenotypes related to cell tight junction and EMT using 48hpi protein samples, highlighting pathways such as extracellular space, integrin binding, basement membrane, and glucose homeostasis via GO analysis, along with cell adhesion molecules, ECM-receptor interaction, and TGF-beta signaling pathway through KEGG analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2D and E</xref>).</p>
<p>We also examined the impact of varying infection durations on <italic>RBMX2</italic> knockout EBL cellular lines via GO analysis. At 0 hpi, genes were primarily related to the pathways of cell junctions, extracellular regions, and cell junction organization (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>). At 24 hpi, genes were mainly associated with pathways of the basement membrane, cell adhesion, integrin binding and cell migration (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3B</xref>). By 48 hpi, genes were annotated into epithelial cell differentiation and were negatively regulated during epithelial cell proliferation (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3C</xref>). This indicated that <italic>RBMX2</italic> can regulate cellular connectivity throughout the stages of <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection.</p>
<p>For KEGG analysis, genes linked to the <italic>MAPK</italic> signaling pathway, chemical carcinogen-DNA adducts, and chemical carcinogen–receptor activation were observed at 0 hpi (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3D</xref>). At 24 hpi, significant enrichment was found in the ECM–receptor interaction, PI3K–Akt signaling pathway, and focal adhesion (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3E</xref>). Upon enrichment analysis at 48 hpi, significant enrichment was noted in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, microRNAs in cancer, small cell lung cancer, and p53 signaling pathway (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>To validate the RNA-seq data, we confirmed a random selection of 10 genes using RT-qPCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). The mRNA levels of the selected genes were consistent with the RNA-seq outcomes, including <italic>FRMD4B</italic>, <italic>MCTP1</italic>, <italic>HSPB8</italic>, <italic>ST14</italic>, and <italic>OMD</italic>, which are linked to scaffold proteins, cell adhesion, and epithelial barriers.

<p>Based on these finding,we hypothesized that <italic>RBMX2</italic> could damage the integrity of epithelial cell tight junction. To validate this prediction, we constructed a model of <italic>M. bovis</italic>-destroyed tight junctions in EBL cells. EBL cells were infected with <italic>M. bovis</italic> and we subsequently performed RT-qPCR and Western blot (WB) analyses to assess the expression of cell tight junction-related mRNAs (<italic>TJP1</italic>, <italic>OCLN</italic>, <italic>CLDN-5</italic>, and <italic>CLDN-7</italic>) and proteins (ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN-5). We found that the expression levels of all mRNAs and proteins was significantly reduced following <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection compared to the uninfected coutrol (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3C and D</xref>).</p>
<p>Tight junctions are critical intercellular adhesion structures that define the permeability of barrier-forming epithelial cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.

To further investigate the effect of <italic>M. bovis</italic> on epithelial cell adhesion, we conducted a cell adhesion assay, revealing a significant decrease in the intercellular adhesion ratio (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). These results validated that <italic>M. bovis</italic> can compromise the tight junction of EBL cells.</p>
<p>To explore the impact of <italic>RBMX2</italic> on the epithelial cells barrier, we infected RBMX2 knockout and WT EBL cells with <italic>M. bovis</italic> and assessed the expression of epithelial barrier-related mRNAs (<italic>TJP1</italic>, <italic>OCLN</italic>, and <italic>CLDN-5</italic>) and proteins (ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN-5) using RT-qPCR and WB. The <italic>RBMX2</italic> knockout EBL cells exhibited a significant upregulation of all three proteins compared to WT EBL cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3F and G</xref>).

<p>To determine whether RBMX2 specifically regulates the MAPK/p38/JNK proteins and p65 to promote tight junction disruption and decrease intercellular adhesion, <italic>RBMX2</italic> knockout EBL cells were treated with <italic>PMA</italic> (<italic>p65</italic> activator), <italic>Anisomycin</italic> (<italic>JNK</italic> activator), and <italic>ML141</italic> (<italic>p38</italic> activator) for 12 h prior to <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection.

WB results indicated that the p65 and <italic>MAPK/p38</italic> pathways could impede the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN-5) following <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4C and D</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine whether RBMX2 regulates cell adhesion ratio via p65 and MAPK/p38/JNK pathways, we investigated the impact of <italic>p65, p38</italic> and <italic>JNK</italic> activators on cell adhesion in <italic>RBMX2</italic> knockout EBL cells.

<p>To further substantiating the association between p65 and tight junction regulation in WT EBL cells after <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection, we used siRNA to inhibit p65. WB analysis demonstrated that siRNA significantly reduced p65 and <italic>p-p65</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4G and H</xref>). WB and Immunofluorescence (IF) analyses revealed that suppressing p65 facilitated the expression of ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN-5 after <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4G</xref>, H and I). Additionally, silencing p65 in WT EBL cells inhibited the invasion of <italic>M. bovis</italic> into epithelial cells, as shown by plate counting assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, to investigate the relationship between <italic>RBMX2</italic>-mediated p65 and the findings above, EBL cells were infected with <italic>M. bovis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG.

<p>Disrupting the intercellular tight junction barrier enhances bacterial adhesion and invasion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that <italic>RBMX2</italic> may facilitates the adhesion and invasion of <italic>M. bovis</italic> by degrading the tight junction proteins in EBL cells. To test this hypothesis, EBL cells were infected with <italic>M. bovis</italic> at an MOI of 20:1, plate count assays indicated a significant reduction in <italic>M. bovis</italic> adhesion in <italic>RBMX2</italic>-KO#17 and KO#23 EBL cells compared with WT EBL cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M</xref>) at 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h post-infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N</xref>). Furthermore, the invasion of <italic>M. bovis</italic> in <italic>RBMX2</italic>-KO#17 and KO#23 EBL cells was decreased at 2, 4, and 6 h post-infection compared with WT EBL cells. Additionally, the intracellular survival of <italic>M. bovis</italic> in <italic>RBMX2</italic>-KO#17 and KO#23 EBL cells was lower at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hpi compared with WT EBL cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4O</xref>). Silencing <italic>RBMX2</italic> in human lung epithelial cells (H1299) also led to a significant reduction in the adhesion, invasion, and intracellular survival of <italic>M. bovis</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4P-R</xref>). Thus, the host factor <italic>RBMX2</italic> is critical for promoting the adhesion, invasion, and intracellular survival of <italic>M. bovis</italic>.</p>
<p>In addtion, pathway activators were employed to investigate the relationship between pathway activation and the regulation of <italic>M. bovis</italic> adhesion and invasion by <italic>RBMX2</italic>. The results showed that applying a p65 activator to <italic>RBMX2</italic> knockout EBL cells significantly impaired the tight junction function of the epithelial barrier, thereby enhancing <italic>M. bovis</italic> adhesion and invasion in EBL cells by regulating the phosphorylation and nucleation of p65 (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 6A</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Hence, RBMX2 promotes <italic>M. bovis</italic> adhesion and invasion in EBL cells by regulating the phosphorylation and nucleation of p65</p>
<p>To further explore the influence of <italic>RBMX2</italic> on adhesion and invasion in the context of different virulence <italic>Mycobacterial</italic> species, we utilized attenuated virulent <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG and <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> (<italic>M. smegmatis</italic>) to infect EBL cells. The plate count assays revealed a significant reduction in the adhesion of both <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG and <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> in <italic>RBMX2</italic> knockout EBL cells at various time points post-infection compared to WT EBL cells (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 6C</xref> and D). Additionally, the invasion of <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG and <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> was markedly diminished at different hpi in <italic>RBMX2</italic> knockout EBL cells (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 6E</xref> and F). Consequently, the virulence of <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> does not appear to affect the capacity of <italic>RBMX2</italic> to promote the adhesion and invasion of <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG and <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> in EBL cells.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we examined the role of <italic>RBMX2</italic> in regulating other bacteria associated with bovine pneumonia by infecting EBL cells with <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>). Our findings indicated that <italic>RBMX2</italic> knockout EBL cells exhibited a degree of inhibition in bacterial adhesion and invasion across all tested bacterial species compared to WT EBL cells (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 6G-J</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, our experiments provide compelling evidence that RBMX2 broadly promotes the adhesion and invasion of pathogens associated with bovine pneumonia, highlighting its potential as a target for developing disease-resistant cattle.</p>

<p>We then examined the morphology changes in epithelial cells within the coculture model using electron microscopy. The results demonstrated that most cells transitioned from circular to an elongated morphology (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Staining of the EBL cells cytoskeleton with ghost pen cyclic peptide highlighted significant morphological alterations, with EBL cells transforming from spherical to spindle-shaped (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, we assessed the expression of EMT-related mRNAs and proteins in EBL cells after coculture with <italic>M. bovis-infected</italic> BoMac cells. This analysis reveald a significant downregulation of the epithelial cell marker protein <italic>E-cadherin</italic> and a notable upregulation of mesenchymal markers <italic>N-cadherin</italic> and <italic>MMP-9</italic>, as determined by RT-qPCR and WB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7D</xref>). The coculture with, <italic>M. bovis-infected</italic> BoMac cells enhanced the migratory and invasive properties of EBL cells, as demonstrated by Transwell assay (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6F and G</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm the impact of <italic>RBMX2</italic> knockout on the EMT process in the coculture model, we observed that <italic>RBMX2</italic> knockout cells exhibited significant upregulation of the epithelial cell marker protein <italic>E-cadherin</italic> and downregulation of the mesenchymal cell marker <italic>N-cadherin</italic> and <italic>MMP-9</italic> compared to WT EBL cells, as shown by RT-qPCR and WB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7E</xref>). Wound healing and Transwell assays demonstrated that the migration and invasion rates of <italic>RBMX2</italic> knockout cells were markedly lower than those of WT EBL cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6I, J, and</xref> K).</p>
<p>Finally, we silenced RBMX2 in the human lung cancer epithelial cell line H1299, which expresses high levels of RBMX2, to assess the effect on EMT-related proteins, as well as invasion and migration ability following <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection. The results indicated that RBMX2 significantly inhibited the EMT process in H1299 cells post-infection (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 8A</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">B</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we successfully established a coculture model involving <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected BoMac cells that induce EMT in EBL cells, thereby demonstrating that the host factor <italic>RBMX2</italic> effectively promotes the EMT process in this context.</p>

<p>Invasion and migration are critical stages in tumor development, influenced by <italic>p65</italic>-dependent factors such as matrix metalloproteinases, urokinase fibrinogen activators, and interleukin-8 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. To further substantiate the correlation between the p65 protein and the regulation of the EMT process in EBL cells post-<italic>M. bovis</italic> infection, we employed siRNA to inhibit p65 expression in WT EBL cells.

<p>To verify the regulatory mechanism between <italic>RBMX2</italic> and <italic>p65</italic>, we first identified multiple amino acid residues in the <italic>RBMX2</italic> promoter that form strong interactions through docking (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The resurgence of <italic>M. bovis</italic>-associated TB presents a substantial global challenge, affecting both livestock and human populations. Notably, <italic>M. bovis</italic> exhibits over 99% nucleotide similarity with <italic>M. tb</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. The pathogenesis of TB is complex process influenced by a confluence of bacterial, host, and environmental factors. Both <italic>M. tb</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> have evolved sophisticated strategies to evade host immune responses, enabling their long-term intracellular persistence. It is estimated that approximately one-third of the global population harbors latent TB infections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The successful establishment of infection by mycobacteria is contingent upon their ability to circumvent early innate immune defenses, employing both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory strategies within host macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Despite notable advancements in the field, unraveling the mechanisms of immune evasion and understanding the dynamics of latent infections caused by <italic>M. tb</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> remains a substantial challenge. The cellular immune response to these pathogens is inherently complex, further compounded by the microdiversity of mycobacteria within individual hosts and the variability of immune responses among different individuals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Lung epithelial cells serve as the primary physical barrier against infection and play a pivotal role in the innate immune response. These cells not only function as a frontline defense but also recruit and activate antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages, to initiate adaptive immune responses against <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Given that alveolar epithelial cells can act as reservoirs for <italic>M. bovis</italic>, their role in the infection process is particularly significant. Additionally, activated macrophages and neutrophils enhance the bactericidal effects of alveolar epithelial cells, further contributing to the host’s defense mechanisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In our study, we utilized a CRISPR-Cas9 mutant library developed in our laboratory to investigate potential host factors influencing M. bovis infection. Notably, we identified <italic>RBMX2</italic> as a protein with significant anti-<italic>M. bovis</italic> infection capabilities. The <italic>RBMX2</italic> protein, characterized by an RNA recognition motif within its 56-134 amino acid residue region, is implicated in mRNA splicing through spliceosomes and is emerging as a potential molecular marker for sperm activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. The downregulation of RBMX2 in the X chromosome of lung telocytes suggests its involvement in cellular immunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Further exploration of RBM genes in cattle revealed that EIF3G, RBM14, RBM42, RBMX44, RBM17, PUF60, SART3, and RBM25 belong to the same subfamily as RBMX2. Previous studies have demonstrated that genes within this subfamily can regulate the proliferation and lifecycle of cancer cells. For instance, EIF3G modulates the mTOR signaling pathway, inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of bladder cancer cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Similarly, RBM14 has been linked to the reprogramming of glycolysis in lung cancer, acting as a novel epigenetically activated oncogene <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Despite these insights, the specific function of RBMX2 in the context of <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection and its potential role in cancer pathogenesis remain largely unexplored.</p>
<p>Our findings reveal that RBMX2 is upregulated in TB-infected cells and tissues, demonstrating the capacity to inhibit <italic>M. bovis</italic> invasion. Transcriptomic analyses indicate that RBMX2 may disrupt tight junctions within epithelial cells and promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) following <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection.</p>
<p>Our findings reveal that <italic>RBMX2</italic> is upregulated in TB-infected cells and tissues, demonstrating its capacity to inhibit <italic>M. bovis</italic> invasion. Transcriptomic analyses suggest that <italic>RBMX2</italic> may disrupt tight junctions within epithelial cells and promote EMT following <italic>M. bovi</italic>s infection.</p>
<p>Epithelial cells serve as more than passive barriers; they actively participate in innate immunity by regulating cytokine secretion and maintaining barrier integrity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Disruptions in epithelial tight junctions, often exacerbated by pro-inflammatory stimuli from pathogenic bacteria, can facilitate bacterial translocation and subsequent infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our experiments, we observed that the disruption of the epithelial barrier facilitated <italic>M. bovis</italic> adhesion and invasion. Conversely, the knockout of RBMX2 stabilized the epithelial barrier, attenuating <italic>M. bovis</italic> invasion and intracellular survival. This stabilization also mitigated downstream innate immune responses, reducing cellular inflammation, ROS production, and apoptosis.</p>
<p>The loss of tight junction integrity is a precursor to EMT, a process increasingly recognized for its role in cancer progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Recent studies have established a link between bacterial infections and EMT induction, particularly in the context of gastric adenocarcinomas <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Epidemiological evidence suggests that TB may serve as a risk factor for lung cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>; however, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain elusive. Chronic TB infection has been implicated in lung carcinogenesis, with reports indicating that BCG vaccination can enhance the survival of tumor cells under inflammatory conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Moreover, <italic>M. tb</italic>-infected THP-1 cells have been shown to induce EMT in lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Chronic infection with <italic>M. tb</italic> is associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine production, fostering an environment conducive to tumor progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. Our analysis of RBMX2 across various cancers revealed increased expression levels in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), suggesting a conserved role in tumor biology across species.</p>
<p>In light of these findings, we constructed a model of <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection in EBL cells to investigate EMT induction. Initial results indicated that <italic>M. bovis</italic> alone did not induce EMT; however, a co-culture model incorporating <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected BoMac cells successfully induced EMT in EBL cells. Notably, the knockout of RBMX2 in this context inhibited EMT, suggesting that RBMX2 may elevate the risk of lung cancer through EMT induction following <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study identifies <italic>RBMX2</italic> as a novel host factor influencing susceptibility to <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection, playing a crucial role in both TB pathogenesis and the EMT process associated with lung cancer. Targeting RBMX2 may present a promising avenue for the prevention and treatment of TB in both humans and animals. Additionally, the effective modulation of <italic>RBMX2</italic> could potentially mitigate the incidence of TB-associated EMT and its implications for lung cancer development in the near future.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that <italic>RBMX2</italic> significantly facilitates the invasion of <italic>M. bovis</italic> by promoting the activation of the p65 protein. This activation undermines the integrity of the epithelial cell barrier and promotes the EMT of epithelial cells through the <italic>p65/MMP-9</italic> signaling pathway. These insights elucidate the critical role of RBMX2 in <italic>M. bovis</italic> pathogenesis and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for mitigating infection-related complications.</p>

<title>Extraction of total RNA and RT-qPCR</title>
<p>Cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, HyClone, China) was used to wash the cells three times, after which 1 mL of Trizol (Invitrogen, USA) was added per well to lyse the cells. The lysate was collected in EP tubes, and 200 μL of chloroform was subsequently added. The mixture was vortexed for 30 seconds and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. Following centrifugation, 500 μL of the supernatant was transferred to a new EP tube. To this supernatant, 500 μL of isopropanol was added and mixed gently by inversion. The mixture was allowed to stand for 10 minutes at 4°C before being centrifuged again at 12,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, revealing the RNA pellet. Next, the RNA pellet was washed with 1 mL of 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 7,500 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was removed, and the RNA pellet was air-dried for 15 minutes. Subsequently, 20 μL of DEPC-treated water was added, and the mixture was incubated at 58°C in a water bath for 10 minutes to dissolve the RNA. Purified RNA was then obtained.</p>
<p>To assess RNA purity, the OD260/OD280 ratio was measured using a NanoDrop ND-1000 instrument (Agilent Inc., USA), with values between 1.8 and 2.0 indicating acceptable purity. RNA integrity and potential contamination with genomic DNA were evaluated using denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. The samples were stored at -80°C for later analysis.</p>
<p>Reverse transcription of the RNA samples was performed using HiScript III RT SuperMix for qPCR (+gDNA wiper, Vazyme, China). Four microliters of 4× gDNA wiper mix were added to 1 μg of RNA, followed by the addition of 16 μL of RNase-free ddH2O. The mixture was incubated at 42°C for 2 minutes to eliminate genomic DNA. Reverse transcription was subsequently carried out by adding 4 μL of 5× HiScript III qRT SuperMix, with the mixture incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes and then at 85°C for 5 seconds to synthesize cDNA.</p>

<title>RNA-Seq, proteomics and metabolomics</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies), and the concentration, quality, and integrity were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Three micrograms of RNA were used as input material for RNA sample preparation. Sequencing libraries were generated according to the following steps: mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Fragmentation was performed using divalent cations under elevated temperature in an Illumina proprietary fragmentation buffer. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using random oligonucleotides and Super Script II. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. The remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities, and the enzymes were removed. After adenylation of the 3′ ends of the DNA fragments, Illumina PE adapter oligonucleotides were ligated for hybridization. To select cDNA fragments of the preferred length of 400–500 bp, the library fragments were purified using the AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, CA, USA). DNA fragments with ligated adaptor molecules at both ends were selectively enriched using the Illumina PCR Primer Cocktail in a 15-cycle PCR reaction. The products were purified (AMPure XP system) and quantified using the Agilent high-sensitivity DNA assay on a Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent). The sequencing library was then sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina) by Shanghai Personal Biotechnology Co., Ltd.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript presents a compelling study identifying RBMX2 as a novel host factor upregulated during Mycobacterium bovis infection.</p>
<p>The study demonstrates that RBMX2 plays a role in:</p>
<p>(1) Facilitating M. bovis adhesion, invasion, and survival in epithelial cells.</p>
<p>(2) Disrupting tight junctions and promoting EMT.</p>
<p>(3) Contributing to inflammatory responses and possibly predisposing infected tissue to lung cancer development.</p>
<p>By using a combination of CRISPR-Cas9 library screening, multi-omics, coculture models, and bioinformatics, the authors establish a detailed mechanistic link between M. bovis infection and cancer-related EMT through the p65/MMP-9 signaling axis. Identification of RBMX2 as a bridge between TB infection and EMT is novel.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This topic and data are both novel and significant, expanding the understanding of transcriptomic diversity beyond RBM2 in M. bovis responsive functions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The abstract and introduction sometimes suggest RBMX2 has protective anti-TB functions, yet results show it facilitates pathogen adhesion and survival. The authors need to rephrase claims to avoid contradiction.</p>
<p>(2) While p65/MMP-9 is convincingly implicated, the role of MAPK/p38 and JNK is less clearly resolved.</p>
<p>(3) Metabolomics results are interesting but not integrated deeply into the main EMT narrative.</p>
<p>(4) A key finding and starting point of this study is the upregulation of RBMX2 upon M. bovis infection. However, the authors have only assessed RBMX2 expression at the mRNA level following infection with M. bovis and BCG. To strengthen this conclusion, it is essential to validate RBMX2 expression at the protein level through techniques such as Western blotting or immunofluorescence. This would significantly enhance the credibility and impact of the study's foundational observation.</p>
<p>(5) The manuscript would benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the relationship between tuberculosis (TB) and lung cancer. While the study provides experimental evidence suggesting a link via EMT induction, integrating current literature on the epidemiological and mechanistic connections between chronic TB infection and lung tumorigenesis would provide important context and reinforce the translational relevance of the findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>I am not familiar with cancer biology, so my review mainly focuses on the infection part of the manuscript. Wang et al identified an RNA-binding protein RBMX2 that links the Mycobacterium bovis infection to the epithelial-Mesenchymal transition and lung cancer progression. Upon mycobacterium infection, the expression of RBMX2 was moderately increased in multiple bovine and human cell lines, as well as bovine lung and liver tissues. Using global approaches, including RNA-seq and proteomics, the authors identified differential gene expression caused by the RBMX2 knockout during M. bovis infection. Knockout of RBMX2 led to significant upregulations of tight-junction related genes such as CLDN-5, OCLN, ZO-1, whereas M. bovis infection affects the integrity of epithelial cell tight junctions and inflammatory responses. This study establishes that RBMX2 is an important host factor that modulates the infection process of M. bovis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This study tested multiple types of bovine and human cells, including macrophages, epithelial cells, and clinical tissues at multiple timepoints, and firmly confirmed the induced expression of RBMX2 upon M. bovis infection.</p>
<p>(2) The authors have generated the monoclonal RBMX2 knockout cell lines and comprehensively characterized the RBMX2-dependent gene expression changes using a combination of global omics approaches. The study has validated the impact of RBMX2 knockout on the tight-junction pathway and on the M. bovis infection, establishing RBMX2 as a crucial host factor.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The RBMX2 was only moderately induced (less than 2-fold) upon M. bovis infection, arguing its contribution may be small. Its value as a therapeutic target is not justified. How RBMX2 was activated by M. bovis infection was unclear.</p>
<p>(2) Although multiple time points have been included in the study, most analyses lack temporal resolution. It is difficult to appreciate the impact/consequence of M. bovis infection on the analyzed pathways and processes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates the role of the host protein RBMX2 in regulating the response to Mycobacterium bovis infection and its connection to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key pathway in cancer progression. Using bovine and human cell models, the authors have wisely shown that RBMX2 expression is upregulated following M. bovis infection and promotes bacterial adhesion, invasion, and survival by disrupting epithelial tight junctions via the p65/MMP-9 signaling pathway. They also demonstrate that RBMX2 facilitates EMT and is overexpressed in human lung cancers, suggesting a potential link between chronic infection and tumor progression. The study highlights RBMX2 as a novel host factor that could serve as a therapeutic target for both TB pathogenesis and infection-related cancer risk.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strengths lie in its multi-omics integration (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) to map RBMX2's impact on host pathways, combined with rigorous functional assays (knockout/knockdown, adhesion/invasion, barrier tests) that establish causality through the p65/MMP-9 axis. Validation across bovine and human cell models and in clinical tissue samples enhances translational relevance. Finally, identifying RBMX2 as a novel regulator linking mycobacterial infection to EMT and cancer progression opens exciting therapeutic avenues.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although it's a solid study, there are a few weaknesses noted below.</p>
<p>(1) In the transcriptomics analysis, the authors performed (GO/KEGG) to explore biological functions. Did they perform the search locally or globally? If the search was performed with a global reference, then I would recommend doing a local search. That would give more relevant results. What is the logic behind highlighting some of the enriched pathways (in red), and how are they relevant to the current study?</p>
<p>(2) While the authors show that RBMX2 expression correlates with EMT-related gene expression and barrier dysfunction, the evidence for direct association remains limited in this study. How does RBMX2 activate p65? Does it bind directly to p65 or modulate any upstream kinases? Could ChIP-seq or CLIP-seq provide further evidence for direct RNA or DNA targets of RBMX2 that drive EMT or NF-κB signaling?</p>
<p>(3) The manuscript suggests that RBMX2 enhances adhesion/invasion of several bacterial species (e.g., E. coli, Salmonella), not just M. bovis. This raises questions about the specificity of RBMX2's role in Mycobacterium-specific pathogenesis. Is RBMX2 a general epithelial barrier regulator or does it exhibit preferential effects in mycobacterial infection contexts? How does this generality affect its potential as a TB-specific therapeutic target?</p>
<p>(4) The quality of the figures is very poor. High-resolution images should be provided.</p>
<p>(5) The methods are not very descriptive, particularly the omics section.</p>
<p>(6) The manuscript is too dense, with extensive multi-omics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) but relatively little mechanistic integration. The authors should have focused on the key mechanistic pathways in the figures. Improving the narratives in the Results and Discussion section could help readers follow the logic of the experimental design and conclusions.</p>

<p>(1) Facilitating M. bovis adhesion, invasion, and survival in epithelial cells.</p>
<p>(2) Disrupting tight junctions and promoting EMT.</p>
<p>(3) Contributing to inflammatory responses and possibly predisposing infected tissue to lung cancer development.</p>
<p>By using a combination of CRISPR-Cas9 library screening, multi-omics, coculture models, and bioinformatics, the authors establish a detailed mechanistic link between M. bovis infection and cancer-related EMT through the p65/MMP-9 signaling axis. Identification of RBMX2 as a bridge between TB infection and EMT is novel.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This topic and data are both novel and significant, expanding the understanding of transcriptomic diversity beyond RBM2 in M. bovis responsive functions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The abstract and introduction sometimes suggest RBMX2 has protective anti-TB functions, yet results show it facilitates pathogen adhesion and survival. The authors need to rephrase claims to avoid contradiction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer's valuable feedback regarding the need to clarify RBMX2's role throughout the manuscript. We have carefully revised the text to ensure consistent messaging about RBMX2's function in promoting M. bovis infection. Below we detail the specific modifications made:</p>
<p>(1) Introduction Revisions:</p>
<p>Changed &quot;The objective of this study was to elucidate the correlation between host genes and the susceptibility of M.bovis infection&quot; to &quot;The objective of this study was to identify host factors that promote susceptibility to M.bovis infection&quot;</p>
<p>Revised &quot;RBMX2 polyclonal and monoclonal cell lines exhibited favorable phenotypes&quot; to &quot;RBMX2 knockout cell lines showed reduced bacterial survival&quot;</p>
<p>Replaced &quot;The immune regulatory mechanism of RBMX2&quot; with &quot;The role of RBMX2 in facilitating M.bovis immune evasion&quot;</p>
<p>(2) Results Revisions:</p>
<p>Modified &quot;RBMX2 fails to affect cell morphology and the ability to proliferate and promotes M.bovis infection&quot; to &quot;RBMX2 does not alter cell viability but significantly enhances M.bovis infection&quot;</p>
<p>Strengthened conclusion in Figure 4: &quot;RBMX2 actively disrupts tight junctions to facilitate bacterial invasion&quot;</p>
<p>(3) Discussion Revisions:</p>
<p>Revised screening description: &quot;We screened host factors affecting M.bovis susceptibility and identified RBMX2 as a key promoter of infection&quot;</p>
<p>Strengthened concluding statement: &quot;In summary, RBMX2 drives TB pathogenesis by compromising epithelial barriers and inducing EMT&quot;</p>
<p>These targeted revisions ensure that:</p>
<p>All sections consistently present RBMX2 as promoting infection; the language aligns with our experimental finding; potential protective interpretations have been eliminated. We believe these modifications have successfully addressed the reviewer's concern while maintaining the manuscript's original structure and scientific content. We appreciate the opportunity to improve our manuscript and thank the reviewer for this constructive suggestion.</p>
<p>(2) &gt;While p65/MMP-9 is convincingly implicated, the role of MAPK/p38 and JNK is less clearly resolved.</p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer's insightful comment regarding the roles of MAPK/p38 and JNK in our study. Our experimental data clearly demonstrated that RBMX2 knockout significantly reduced phosphorylation levels of p65, p38, and JNK (Fig. 5A), indicating potential involvement of all three pathways in RBMX2-mediated regulation.</p>
<p>Through systematic functional validation, we obtained several important findings:</p>
<p>In pathway inhibition experiments, p65 activation (PMA treatment) showed the most dramatic effects on both tight junction disruption (ZO-1, OCLN reduction) and EMT marker regulation (E-cadherin downregulation, N-cadherin upregulation);</p>
<p>p38 activation (ML141 treatment) exhibited moderate effects on these processes;</p>
<p>JNK activation (Anisomycin treatment) displayed minimal impact.</p>
<p>Most conclusively, siRNA-mediated silencing of p65 alone was sufficient to:</p>
<p>Restore epithelial barrier function</p>
<p>Reverse EMT marker expression</p>
<p>Reduce bacterial adhesion and invasion</p>
<p>These results establish a clear hierarchy in pathway importance: p65 serves as the primary mediator of RBMX2's effects, while p38 plays a secondary role and JNK appears non-essential under our experimental conditions. We have now clarified this relationship in the revised Discussion section to strengthen this conclusion.</p>
<p>This refined understanding of pathway hierarchy provides important mechanistic insights while maintaining consistency with all our experimental data. We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion that helped improve our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Metabolomics results are interesting but not integrated deeply into the main EMT narrative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this constructive suggestion. In this article, we detected the metabolome of RBMX2 knockout and wild-type cells after Mycobacterium bovis infection, which mainly served as supporting evidence for our EMT model. However, we did not conduct an in-depth discussion of these findings. We have now added a detailed discussion of this section to further support our EMT model.</p>
<p>ADD:Meanwhile, metabolic pathways enriched after RBMX2 deletion, such as nucleotide metabolism, nucleotide sugar synthesis, and pentose interconversion, primarily support cell proliferation and migration during EMT by providing energy precursors, regulating glycosylation modifications, and maintaining redox balance; cofactor synthesis and amino sugar metabolism participate in EMT regulation through influencing metabolic remodeling and extracellular matrix interactions; chemokine and cGMP-PKG signaling pathways may further mediate inflammatory responses and cytoskeletal rearrangements, collectively promoting the EMT process.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) A key finding and starting point of this study is the upregulation of RBMX2 upon M. bovis infection. However, the authors have only assessed RBMX2 expression at the mRNA level following infection with M. bovis and BCG. To strengthen this conclusion, it is essential to validate RBMX2 expression at the protein level through techniques such as Western blotting or immunofluorescence. This would significantly enhance the credibility and impact of the study's foundational observation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We have supplemented the experiments in this part and found that Mycobacterium bovis infection can significantly enhance the expression level of RBMX2 protein.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The manuscript would benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the relationship between tuberculosis (TB) and lung cancer. While the study provides experimental evidence suggesting a link via EMT induction, integrating current literature on the epidemiological and mechanistic connections between chronic TB infection and lung tumorigenesis would provide important context and reinforce the translational relevance of the findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the valuable comments from the reviewer. We fully agree with your suggestion to further explore the relationship between tuberculosis (TB) and lung cancer. In the revised manuscript, we will add a new paragraph in the Discussion section to systematically integrate the current literature on the epidemiological and mechanistic links between chronic tuberculosis infection and lung cancer development, including the potential bridging roles of chronic inflammation, tissue damage repair, immune microenvironment remodeling, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. This addition will help more comprehensively interpret the clinical implications of the observed EMT activation in the context of our study, thereby enhancing the biological plausibility and clinical translational value of our findings.</p>
<p>ADD:There is growing epidemiological evidence suggesting that chronic TB infection represents a potential risk factor for the development of lung cancer. Studies have shown that individuals with a history of TB exhibit a significantly increased risk of lung cancer, particularly in areas of the lung with pre-existing fibrotic scars, indicating that chronic inflammation, tissue repair, and immune microenvironment remodeling may collectively contribute to malignant transformation 74. Moreover, EMT not only endows epithelial cells with mesenchymal features that enhance migratory and invasive capacity but is also associated with the acquisition of cancer stem cell-like properties and therapeutic resistance 75. Therefore, EMT may serve as a crucial molecular link connecting chronic TB infection with the malignant transformation of lung epithelial cells, warranting further investigation in the intersection of infection and tumorigenesis.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>I am not familiar with cancer biology, so my review mainly focuses on the infection part of the manuscript. Wang et al identified an RNA-binding protein RBMX2 that links the Mycobacterium bovis infection to the epithelial-Mesenchymal transition and lung cancer progression. Upon mycobacterium infection, the expression of RBMX2 was moderately increased in multiple bovine and human cell lines, as well as bovine lung and liver tissues. Using global approaches, including RNA-seq and proteomics, the authors identified differential gene expression caused by the RBMX2 knockout during M. bovis infection. Knockout of RBMX2 led to significant upregulations of tight-junction related genes such as CLDN-5, OCLN, ZO-1, whereas M. bovis infection affects the integrity of epithelial cell tight junctions and inflammatory responses. This study establishes that RBMX2 is an important host factor that modulates the infection process of M. bovis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This study tested multiple types of bovine and human cells, including macrophages, epithelial cells, and clinical tissues at multiple timepoints, and firmly confirmed the induced expression of RBMX2 upon M. bovis infection.</p>
<p>(2) The authors have generated the monoclonal RBMX2 knockout cell lines and comprehensively characterized the RBMX2-dependent gene expression changes using a combination of global omics approaches. The study has validated the impact of RBMX2 knockout on the tight-junction pathway and on the M. bovis infection, establishing RBMX2 as a crucial host factor.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The RBMX2 was only moderately induced (less than 2-fold) upon M. bovis infection, arguing its contribution may be small. Its value as a therapeutic target is not justified. How RBMX2 was activated by M. bovis infection was unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable and constructive comments. In this study, we primarily utilized the CRISPR whole-genome screening approach to identify key factors involved in bovine tuberculosis infection. Through four rounds of screening using a whole-genome knockout cell line of bovine lung epithelial cells infected with Mycobacterium bovis, we identified RBMX2 as a critical factor.</p>
<p>Although the transcriptional level change of RBMX2 was less than two-fold, following the suggestion of Reviewer 1, we examined its expression at the protein level, where the change was more pronounced, and we have added these results to the manuscript.</p>
<p>Regarding the mechanism by which RBMX2 is activated upon M. bovis infection, we previously screened for interacting proteins using a Mycobacterium tuberculosis secreted and membrane protein library, but unfortunately, we did not identify any direct interacting proteins from M. tuberculosis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1173">https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1173</ext-link>).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Although multiple time points have been included in the study, most analyses lack temporal resolution. It is difficult to appreciate the impact/consequence of M. bovis infection on the analyzed pathways and processes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the valuable comments from the reviewers. Although our study included multiple time points post-infection, in our experimental design we focused on different biological processes and phenotypes at distinct time points:</p>
<p>During the early phase (e.g., 2 hours post-infection), we focused on barrier phenotypes; during the intermediate phase (e.g., 24 hours post-infection), we concentrated more on pathway activation and EMT phenotypes;</p>
<p>And during the later phase (e.g., 48–72 hours post-infection), we focused more on cell death phenotypes, which were validated in another FII article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1431207">https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1431207</ext-link>).</p>
<p>We also examined the impact of varying infection durations on RBMX2 knockout EBL cellular lines via GO analysis. At 0 hpi, genes were primarily related to the pathways of cell junctions, extracellular regions, and cell junction organization. At 24 hpi, genes were mainly associated with pathways of the basement membrane, cell adhesion, integrin binding and cell migration By 48 hpi, genes were annotated into epithelial cell differentiation and were negatively regulated during epithelial cell proliferation. This indicated that RBMX2 can regulate cellular connectivity throughout the stages of M. bovis infection.</p>
<p>For KEGG analysis, genes linked to the MAPK signaling pathway, chemical carcinogen-DNA adducts, and chemical carcinogen-receptor activation were observed at 0 hpi. At 24 hpi, significant enrichment was found in the ECM-receptor interaction, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and focal adhesion. Upon enrichment analysis at 48 hpi, significant enrichment was noted in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, microRNAs in cancer, small cell lung cancer, and p53 signaling pathway.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates the role of the host protein RBMX2 in regulating the response to Mycobacterium bovis infection and its connection to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key pathway in cancer progression. Using bovine and human cell models, the authors have wisely shown that RBMX2 expression is upregulated following M. bovis infection and promotes bacterial adhesion, invasion, and survival by disrupting epithelial tight junctions via the p65/MMP-9 signaling pathway. They also demonstrate that RBMX2 facilitates EMT and is overexpressed in human lung cancers, suggesting a potential link between chronic infection and tumor progression. The study highlights RBMX2 as a novel host factor that could serve as a therapeutic target for both TB pathogenesis and infection-related cancer risk.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strengths lie in its multi-omics integration (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) to map RBMX2's impact on host pathways, combined with rigorous functional assays (knockout/knockdown, adhesion/invasion, barrier tests) that establish causality through the p65/MMP-9 axis. Validation across bovine and human cell models and in clinical tissue samples enhances translational relevance. Finally, identifying RBMX2 as a novel regulator linking mycobacterial infection to EMT and cancer progression opens exciting therapeutic avenues.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although it's a solid study, there are a few weaknesses noted below.</p>
<p>(1) In the transcriptomics analysis, the authors performed (GO/KEGG) to explore biological functions. Did they perform the search locally or globally? If the search was performed with a global reference, then I would recommend doing a local search. That would give more relevant results. What is the logic behind highlighting some of the enriched pathways (in red), and how are they relevant to the current study?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's thoughtful questions regarding our transcriptomic analysis. In this study, we employed a localized enrichment approach focusing specifically on gene expression profiles from our bovine lung epithelial cell system. This cell-type-specific analysis provides more biologically relevant results than global database searches alone.</p>
<p>Regarding the highlighted pathways, these represent:</p>
<p>(1) Temporally significant pathways showing strongest enrichment at each stage:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>0h: Cell junction organization (immediate barrier response)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>24h: ECM-receptor interaction (early EMT initiation)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>48h: TGF-β signaling (chronic remodeling)</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>(2) Mechanistically linked to our core findings about RBMX2's role in:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Epithelial barrier disruption</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>Mesenchymal transition</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>Chronic infection outcomes</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>We selected these particular pathways because they:</p>
<p>(1) Showed the most statistically significant changes (FDR &lt;0.001)</p>
<p>(2) Formed a coherent biological narrative across infection stages</p>
<p>(3) Were independently validated in our functional assays</p>
<p>This targeted approach allows us to focus on the most infection-relevant pathways while maintaining statistical rigor.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) While the authors show that RBMX2 expression correlates with EMT-related gene expression and barrier dysfunction, the evidence for direct association remains limited in this study. How does RBMX2 activate p65? Does it bind directly to p65 or modulate any upstream kinases? Could ChIP-seq or CLIP-seq provide further evidence for direct RNA or DNA targets of RBMX2 that drive EMT or NF-κB signaling?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer's in-depth questions regarding the mechanisms by which RBMX2 activates p65 and its association with EMT. Although the molecular mechanism remains to be fully elucidated, our study has provided experimental evidence supporting a direct regulatory relationship between RBMX2 and the p65 subunit of the NF-κB pathway. Specifically, we investigated whether the transcription factor p65 could directly bind to the promoter region of RBMX2 using CHIP experiments. The results demonstrated that the transcription factor p65 can physically bind to the RBMX2 region.</p>
<p>Furthermore, dual-luciferase reporter assays were conducted, showing that p65 significantly enhances the transcriptional activity of the RBMX2 promoter, indicating a direct regulatory effect of RBMX2 on p65 expression.</p>
<p>These findings support our hypothesis that RBMX2 activates the NF-κB signaling pathway through direct interaction with the p65 protein, thereby participating in the regulation of EMT progression and barrier function.</p>
<p>In our subsequent work papers, we will also employ experiments such as CLIP to further investigate the specific mechanisms through which RBMX2 exerts its regulatory functions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The manuscript suggests that RBMX2 enhances adhesion/invasion of several bacterial species (e.g., E. coli, Salmonella), not just M. bovis. This raises questions about the specificity of RBMX2's role in Mycobacterium-specific pathogenesis. Is RBMX2 a general epithelial barrier regulator or does it exhibit preferential effects in mycobacterial infection contexts? How does this generality affect its potential as a TB-specific therapeutic target?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comments. When we initially designed this experiment, we were interested in whether the RBMX2 knockout cell line could confer effective resistance not only against Mycobacterium bovis but also against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Surprisingly, we indeed observed resistance to the invasion of these pathogens, albeit weaker compared to that against Mycobacterium bovis.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we believe these findings merit publication in eLife. Moreover, RBMX2 knockout does not affect the phenotype of epithelial barrier disruption under normal conditions; its significant regulatory effect on barrier function is only evident upon infection with Mycobacterium bovis.</p>
<p>Importantly, during our genome-wide knockout library screening, RBMX2 was not identified in the screening models for Salmonella or Escherichia coli, but was consistently detected across multiple rounds of screening in the Mycobacterium bovis model.</p>

<p>(5) The methods are not very descriptive, particularly the omics section.</p>

<p>(6) The manuscript is too dense, with extensive multi-omics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) but relatively little mechanistic integration. The authors should have focused on the key mechanistic pathways in the figures. Improving the narratives in the Results and Discussion section could help readers follow the logic of the experimental design and conclusions.</p>
