<title>Abstract</title><p>Dental caries is one of the most common health issues worldwide arising from the complex interactions of bacteria. In response to harmful stimuli, desirable outcome for the tooth is the formation of tertiary dentin, a protective reparative process that generates new hard tissue. This reparative dentinogenesis is associated with significant inflammation, which triggers the recruitment and differentiation of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). Previously, we have shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB, key mediators of neural functions, are activated during the DPSC-mediated dentin regeneration process. In this study, we further define the role of inflammation in this process and apply stem cell engineering to enhance dentin regeneration in injured teeth. Our data show that TrkB expression and activation in DPSCs rapidly increase during odontogenic differentiation, further amplified by inflammatory inducers and mediators such as TNFα, LTA, and LPS. An in vivo dentin formation assessment was conducted using a mouse pulp-capping/caries model, where CRISPR-engineered DPSCs overexpressing BDNF were transplanted into inflamed pulp tissue. This transplantation significantly enhanced dentin regeneration in injured teeth. To further explore potential downstream pathways, we conducted transcriptomic profiling of TNFα-treated DPSCs, both with and without TrkB antagonist CTX-B. The results revealed significant changes in gene expression related to immune response, cytokine signaling, and extracellular matrix interactions. Taken together, our study advances our understanding of the role of BDNF in dental tissue engineering using DPSCs and identifies potential therapeutic avenues for improving dental tissue repair and regeneration strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dental caries, commonly known as tooth decay, remains one of the most prevalent chronic diseases, affecting a significant portion of the global population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Peres et al., 2019</xref>). This condition results from the complex interplay between bacterial biofilms, dietary sugars, and host factors, leading to the demineralization of tooth enamel and dentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bowen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Mosaddad et al., 2019</xref>). In recent years, there has been growing interest in the role of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) in regenerative dentistry due to their ability to differentiate into dentin-forming odontoblast-like cells and their potential in tooth repair and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Potdar &amp; Jethmalani, 2015</xref>). It is widely recognized that the regeneration of the dental-pulp complex is closely associated with inflammation, especially since dental caries and the subsequent regenerative processes take place within an inflammatory environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Galler et al., 2021</xref>). Inflammation serves as a vital biological response for ensuring host survival in the face of infection and tissue injury, playing a crucial role in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Peiseler &amp; Kubes, 2018</xref>). It is generally accepted that the regeneration of the injured tooth is closely tied to inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lin &amp; Rosenberg, 2011</xref>). Specifically, it plays a pivotal role in the regeneration of injured dental tissues by stimulating the recruitment, proliferation, and differentiation of pulp progenitor cells and odontoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Nakashima et al., 2013</xref>). However, an imbalance between inflammation and repair can lead to irreversible tissue damage. While inflammation is recognized as necessary for proficient tissue regeneration, only a few studies have explored its role in dentin regeneration.</p>
<p>The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), constitute a critical signaling pathway involved in the survival, development, and function of neurons (F. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that the BDNF-TrkB pathway also plays a significant role in the inflammatory response and tissue repair processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cappoli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hang et al., 2021</xref>). The overexpression of BDNF in DPSCs has been shown to enhance their regenerative capabilities, which may be particularly beneficial in the context of dental caries where inflammation and tissue damage are prominent. Indeed, our previous study demonstrated the critical role of BDNF/TrkB in the DPSC odontoblastic differentiation under inflammation. (Kim, Irfan, Hossain, George, et al., 2023) TNFα (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)-stimulated BDNF/TrkB showed an enhanced odontoblast differentiation of DPSCs.</p>
<p>Although the general principles for successful BDNF-induced regeneration have been proposed, achieving clinical success remains challenging. One significant obstacle is the clinical application of BDNF itself, as the recombinant protein has an extremely short half-life, which greatly diminishes its effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Miranda-Lourenço et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, establishing a stable and continuous BDNF production platform is essential, and stem cell engineering could potentially address this critical need in the future. Considering the essential role of BDNF/TrkB signaling activation in the inflammatory dentinogenesis observed in cell culture conditions, there is a strong case for validating BDNF/TrkB data in vivo. In this study, we further explore the role of various inflammatory agents in modulating two BDNF receptors, TrkA and TrkB, as well as the potential therapeutic applications of BDNF overexpression in DPSCs using CRISPR technology for the treatment of dental caries. By uncovering the mechanisms through which the BDNF-TrkB pathway affects DPSC function and inflammation, we aim to offer insights into innovative regenerative strategies that could enhance dental health outcomes.</p>

<title>Various inflammatory mediators increase TrkB expression and activation in DPSCs</title>
<p>Our previous study demonstrated that TNFα augments the odontoblast differentiation of DPSCs in a TrkB-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Irfan &amp; Chung, 2023</xref>; Kim, Irfan, Hossain, George, et al., 2023). The literature indicates that pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, LTA (lymphotoxin-alpha), and LPS (lipopolysaccharides), play significant roles in the formation of tertiary dentin (Irfan, Kim, Marzban, et al., 2022). To further confirm the role of inflammation in this process, various inflammatory mediators were applied during DPSC odontoblastic differentiation. The outline of the experimental timeline is shown (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Human DPSCs were seeded on Day 0, followed by culture in normal growth media. On Day 3, the cells were transferred to dentinogenic media. TNFα, LTA, and LPS treatments were initiated every other three days. The representative image shows the immunofluorescence staining results for TrkB and phosphorylated TrkB (p-TrkB) under various treatments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The quantification of fluorescence intensity across these different treatment groups was analyzed by percentages of control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). TrkB expression and activation in DPSCs were significantly upregulated during odontogenic differentiation, especially under inflammatory stimulants such as TNFα, LTA, and LPS by 301 ± 17, 320 ± 15.2, and 250 ± 19, respectively vs control 165 ± 12.4 (p &lt; 0.01). The spatial distribution of fluorescence intensity for TrkB and p-TrkB was measured across different treatment groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Figures were analyzed using ZEN (blue) software, and graphs were created. This spatial analysis confirms the enhanced and localized expression of TrkB and p-TrkB in response to inflammatory stimuli.</p>

<p>Next, we examined the expression levels of TrkA and TrkB receptors in response to various inflammatory stimuli in normal and dentinogenic media. The results indicate significant differential expression of these receptors under both conditions. TrkB expression was modulated by the media and stimuli (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Under control conditions, no significant differences were observed between the media types. However, LPS, LTA, TNFα, and C5a significantly increased TrkB expression in dentinogenic media compared to normal media (p &lt; 0.001 for LPS, TNFα, and C5a; p &lt; 0.05 for LTA). IL-5 caused a slight but significant increase in TrkB expression in dentinogenic o media (p &lt; 0.05). Conversely, baseline TrkA expression showed no significant difference between normal and dentinogenic media (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), and C5a and IL-5 did not induce significant changes in TrkA expression in either medium.</p>

While these inflammatory components do not affect much the expression of TrkA or TrkB in normal growth medium, inflammatory mediators such as LPS, LTA, and TNFα stimulation increase TrkB expression in DPSCs undergoing odontoblastic differentiation (orange bars “LPS, LTA &amp; TNFα” vs. orange bar “Control”).

DPSCs were cultured in regular or dentinogenic/osteogenic medium and with 0, 0.1, 1, 10, or 20 ng/mL of TNFα. TrkB mRNA expression was determined by real-time PCR analysis after 24 h of culture. TNFα stimulation, independent of the concentration used, quickly potentiates the odontogenesis-regulated expression of TrkB. However, this TrkB expression increase is sustained with increasing concentrations of TNFα treatment, even at 20 ng/mL. <bold>(F)</bold> Real-time PCR was used to evaluate the level of TrkB mRNA in DPSCs after 1, 3, 7, 10, and d 14 of culture in regular medium (blue lines) or dentinogenic medium (orange lines) in TNFα-stimulated DPSCs odontoblastic differentiation. In contrast to relatively stable TrkB levels in undifferentiated DPSCs, TrkB expression quickly increased in dentinogenic medium, with the most significant increase detected between 7 and 10 d (fold increase: 7 d = 12.04 ± 2.1, 10 d = 14.1 ± 1.72). Results are expressed as relative expression to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).

<p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref> show the effect of TNFα stimulation on the expression of TrkA and TrkB and their phosphorylation vs control. 2D and 2.5 models show fluorescence spikes to evident the phenomenon. It is obvious that TNFα stimulation caused significant phosphorylation of TrkB (p &lt; 0.01) compared to TrkA (p &lt; 0.05). Graphs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>1 and D1) show significant changes among TNFα treated cells vs control. So, we chose TrkB as a target receptor for our further study.</p>
<p>The dose-dependent response of TrkB to TNFα (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) revealed minimal baseline expression at 0 ng/mL TNFα, with significant increases at 0.1 ng/mL, 1 ng/mL, and a pronounced peak at 10 ng/mL in dentinogenic media (p &lt; 0.001). At 20 ng/mL TNFα, TrkB expression remained significantly higher in dentinogenic media compared to normal media (p &lt; 0.001). The time-dependent response to a fixed TNFα concentration (10 ng/mL) showed that TrkB expression in dentinogenic media was significantly higher on day 1, further increased by day 3, and peaked on day 7 (p &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Although TrkB levels slightly decreased on days 10 and 14, they remained significantly elevated compared to normal media. These findings emphasize the importance of the local microenvironment in influencing receptor expression and inflammatory responses.</p>

<title>TrkB expression is increased in human carious teeth and in DPSCs</title>
<p>Regenerative odontogenic differentiation in the context of caries occurs within an inflammatory environment, making it essential to understand the impact of inflammation on DPSCs to comprehend dentin regeneration fully (Kim, Irfan, Hossain, Shin, et al., 2023). Immunofluorescence double staining was employed to analyze the expression of STRO-1, which is a stem cell marker, and TrkB in human carious and normal teeth, as well as in DPSCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-K</xref>). The in vivo analysis revealed that STRO-1 was primarily localized around blood vessels, while TrkB was more abundantly expressed in the inflamed pulp tissue of carious teeth compared to normal teeth. Quantitative analysis revealed significantly higher TrkB expression in carious teeth (p &lt; 0.001). In vitro, both STRO-1 and TrkB were expressed in control DPSCs, but TNFα treatment markedly increased TrkB expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L-T</xref>). The data showed that TrkB expression was significantly elevated in TNFα-treated DPSCs (p &lt; 0.01). These findings suggest that TrkB is upregulated in response to inflammation in both carious teeth and DPSCs.</p>

<title>Transplantation of GFP-tagged CRISPR-engineered BDNF-overexpressing DPSCs enhances dentin regeneration in a pulp-capping mouse model</title>
<p>Our previous data demonstrated that inflammation and BDNF-induced DPSC odontogenic differentiation increased the expression of odontogenic differentiation markers. (Kim, Irfan, Hossain, George, et al., 2023). To investigate whether BDNF-TrkB signaling controls dentin regeneration following inflammation in vivo, we utilized CRISPR-engineered BDNF-overexpressing DPSCs in a pulp-capping mouse model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We initially utilized the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) technique to activate BDNF expression in DPSCs. Transfection of DPSCs with the BDNF CRISPR activation plasmid was confirmed through Western blot analysis, which revealed increased BDNF expression compared to the control group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Quantification of the integrated intensity relative to beta-actin further indicated a significant increase in BDNF expression in CRISPR-activated DPSCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Histological analysis of H&amp;E-stained sections was performed to evaluate tissue morphology and surgery site from the transplantation of CRISPR-engineered BDNF-overexpressing DPSCs in a pulp-capping mouse model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>Following confirmation of successful CRISPR activation, we conducted the transplantation of CRISPR-engineered BDNF-overexpressing DPSCs on dentin regeneration in a pulp-capping mouse model. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging was utilized to assess dentin volume in both sham control and experimental groups. The sham control group [<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>(a-h)] exhibited a clear demarcation of the injured dentin area, highlighted by the white arrow indicating the drilling operation and the dotted line specifying the damaged region. In contrast, the experimental group treated with CRISPR-engineered BDNF-overexpressing DPSCs [<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>(i-p)] showed a notable increase in dentin formation at the injury site. A quantitative analysis of dentin density (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>) revealed a significant increase in the dentin volume in the group treated with CRISPR-engineered BDNF-overexpressing DPSCs compared to the sham control group. Specifically, the dentin volume in the treated group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) was 1241 ± 51 mg HA/ccm, significantly higher than the control group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), which measured at 1169 ± 9 mg HA/ccm (p &lt; 0.05).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Odontoblastic differentiation of DPSCs in response to caries injury takes place within an inflammatory environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chmilewsky et al., 2016</xref>). However, there is still limited information on the role of inflammation in reparative dentinogenesis and the biology of DPSCs. Our findings demonstrate the activation of TrkB during the caries process. Consistent with this, our in vitro data confirmed that various inflammatory mediators increase TrkB expression and activation in DPSCs. These findings suggest that BDNF/TrkB directly affects the pulpal response to caries. In vivo, TrkB is more highly expressed in inflamed pulp compared to normal tissue. The transplantation of CRISPR-engineered BDNF-overexpressing DPSCs in a pulp-capping mouse model significantly enhances dentin regeneration and repair, as demonstrated by increased dentin volume and improved tissue morphology. Furthermore, RNA sequencing reveals significant transcriptomic changes in TNFα-treated DPSCs, affecting cellular signaling and extracellular matrix pathways. These results underscore the critical role of TrkB in inflammatory responses and dentin repair, suggesting potential for targeted TrkB modulation in dental tissue regeneration.</p>
<p>TNFα and LTA are known to mediate inflammatory responses and contribute to the recruitment and activation of immune cells at the injury site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Farges et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kawai &amp; Akira, 2010</xref>). This inflammatory response is crucial for eliminating pathogens and debris, setting the stage for tissue repair. In the context of dentin formation, these cytokines promote the differentiation and activity of odontoblast-like cells, which are responsible for producing the reparative dentin matrix. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Durand et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Keller et al., 2010</xref>) Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, also stimulate an inflammatory response when they infiltrate the dental pulp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brodzikowska et al., 2022</xref>) The presence of LPS triggers the release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, further enhancing the recruitment of immune cells and promoting the processes necessary for tertiary dentin formation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Widbiller et al., 2018</xref>) These pro-inflammatory cytokines coordinate a complex cascade of events that lead to the regeneration of dentin, highlighting their importance in dental tissue repair mechanisms.</p>
<p>Our study confirms the impact of pro-inflammatory stimuli on the expression and activation of TrkB in DPSCs. Immunofluorescence analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) demonstrated that exposure to LPS, LTA, and TNFα significantly upregulated both TrkB and its phosphorylated form, p-TrkB, compared to the control. This suggests that these inflammatory agents can activate TrkB signaling pathways in DPSCs, potentially influencing their behavior and differentiation. TNFα showed the most pronounced effect, indicating its potent role in activating TrkB signaling. These findings are consistent with previous studies indicating that TNFα can enhance TrkB expression and activation in various cell types, promoting cellular responses to inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Irfan et al., 2024</xref>; Kim, Irfan, Hossain, George, et al., 2023; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Paula-Silva et al., 2009</xref>). These results suggest that pro-inflammatory stimuli such as LPS, LTA, and TNFα can significantly enhance TrkB and p-TrkB expression in DPSCs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our data demonstrate that significant upregulation of TrkA and TrkB expressions in dentinogenic media in response to inflammatory components. TrkB expression was notably increased by LPS, LTA, TNFα, and C5a, suggesting widespread receptor activation. This upregulation may play a critical role in mediating the cellular responses to inflammation, potentially influencing the behavior of DPSCs in the context of dental pulp inflammation and regeneration. Particularly, TNFα induced the highest TrkB upregulation in both media types, emphasizing the role of TrkB in mediating responses to neurotrophic factors and involvement in inflammatory pathways (Irfan, Kim, Druzinsky, et al., 2022). The differential expression in dentinogenic media indicates enhanced receptor sensitivity and signaling in an inflammatory environment (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). A dose-dependent increase in TrkB expression was observed with escalating TNFα concentrations, with significant upregulation at 10 ng/mL, beyond which further increases in TNFα did not enhance expression. This suggests that higher doses are unnecessary to avoid inflammation related to degeneration or infection (Kim, Irfan, Hossain, George, et al., 2023). The time-dependent response to a fixed TNFα concentration showed a peak at day 7, indicating that a minimum of 7 days of differentiation is necessary for culturing DPSCs in inflammatory responses related to TrkB expression. In vivo, TrkB expression was significantly higher in the inflamed pulp tissue of carious teeth, indicating that TrkB may play a critical role in the response to dental caries and pulp inflammation. This suggests that BDNF-TrkB signaling could be crucial in the neurogenic and angiogenic processes involved in pulp tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">De Moraes et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The transplantation of CRISPR-engineered BDNF-overexpressing DPSCs has demonstrated promising results in enhancing dentin regeneration in a pulp-capping mouse model. Both micro-CT images and H&amp;E staining analyses indicate that the overexpression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) via CRISPR engineering significantly promotes dentin repair at the injury site. BDNF is known for its role in molecular and physiological involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). Its application in dental tissue engineering suggests that it may also play a crucial role in odontogenesis and dentinogenesis (Kim, Irfan, Hossain, George, et al., 2023). The significant increase in dentin volume in the micro-CT experiment observed in this study supports the hypothesis that BDNF can enhance the regenerative capabilities of DPSCs, leading to improved outcomes in dentin repair. Enhanced dentinogenesis was evidenced by the well-organized and structurally similar new dentin formation in the transplantation group compared to the native dentin structure. The histological analysis with H&amp;E staining further verified these findings, showing a marked improvement in dentin formation and reduced inflammation in the BDNF-DPSC transplantation group compared to the control group. This suggests that BDNF enhances dentin regeneration, creating a conducive environment for tissue repair. Several potential mechanisms could explain that BDNF may enhance the proliferation and differentiation of DPSCs into odontoblast-like cells, promoting reparative dentin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Tsutsui, 2020</xref>). Moreover, the neurotrophic properties of BDNF could support the survival and function of sensory nerve fibers within the pulp, which may play a role in regulating the repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bathina &amp; Das, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>In vitro experiments with DPSCs further supported these findings, demonstrating that TrkB expression is significantly upregulated in response to TNFα treatment. This suggests that inflammation enhances the neurogenic potential of DPSCs through TrkB signaling. The co-expression of TrkB in both carious teeth and DPSCs highlights the potential of targeting the BDNF-TrkB pathway in dental regenerative therapies. Modulating the inflammatory environment to enhance TrkB signaling could improve the regenerative properties of DPSCs, offering promising strategies for managing dental caries and pulpitis. The combined treatment of TNFα and CTX-B elucidates the significant transcriptional reprogramming compared with the control. The volcano plots highlight a substantial number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), indicating both upregulation and downregulation of gene expression compared to control. The GO enrichment analysis reveals that these DEGs are predominantly associated with biological processes such as extracellular matrix organization, inflammatory response, and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways. This is further supported by the GO term statistics, where notable terms like extracellular space and cartilage homeostasis are enriched, suggesting alterations in the cellular microenvironment and immune response.</p>
<p>Additionally, the pathway enrichment analysis identifies critical pathways such as TNF signaling, NF-κB signaling, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, underscoring the crucial role of inflammatory signaling in the observed transcriptional changes. Finally, the gene expression analysis under TNFα + CTX-B treatment provides specific examples of genes with altered expression patterns, confirming the extensive impact of the treatment at the molecular level. These findings suggest that TNFα treatment mediated by BDNF/TrkB pathway induces a complex network of transcriptional changes that modulate the extracellular matrix and inflammatory signaling pathways.</p>

The use of CRISPR-engineered BDNF-overexpressing DPSCs could offer a novel and effective approach for enhancing dentin repair and regeneration in cases of dental pulp injury. This approach could potentially reduce the need for more invasive treatments, such as root canal therapy, and improve outcomes for patients with dental trauma or disease. Further studies are necessary to investigate the long-term effects of BDNF overexpression on dentin regeneration and to explore the underlying mechanisms driving this enhanced repair process. Additionally, assessing the potential for clinical translation of this approach will be crucial in determining its viability as a therapeutic option for dental pulp injuries and related conditions.</p>

<p>This study provides a potentially <bold>useful</bold> investigation into the positive role of BDNF/TrkB signaling in implanted dental pulp stem cells to enhance dentin regeneration in the context of dental caries. Some of the key methods used need to be much better documented, and the data should be strengthened and added to in support of several of the claims of functional benefit, which are <bold>inadequately</bold> supported at present. Additional details for the validation of the reagents and techniques are needed to support the interpretation of the results.</p>

<p>This work employs both in vitro and in vivo/transplant methods to investigate the contribution of BDNF/TrkB signaling to enhancing differentiation and dentin-repair capabilities of dental pulp stem cells in the context of exposure to a variety of inflammatory cytokines. A particular emphasis of the approach is the employment of dental pulp stem cells in which BDNF expression has been enhanced using CRISPR technology. Transplantation of such cells is said to improve dentin regeneration in a mouse model of tooth decay.</p>
<p>The study provides several interesting findings, including demonstrating that exposure to several cytokines/inflammatory agents increases the quantity of (activated) phospho-Trk B in dental pulp stem cells.</p>
<p>However, a variety of technical issues weaken support for the major conclusions offered by the authors. These technical issues include the following:</p>
<p>(1) It remains unclear exactly how the cytokines tested affect BDNF/TrkB signaling. For example, in Figure 1C, TNF-alpha increases TrkB and phospho-TrkB immunoreactivity to the same degree, suggesting that the cytokine promotes TrkB abundance without stimulating pathways that activate TrkB, whereas in Figure 2D, TNF-alpha has little effect on the abundance of TrkB, while increasing phospho-TrkB, suggesting that it affects TrkB activation and not TrkB abundance.</p>
<p>(2) I find the histological images in Figure 3 to be difficult to interpret. I would have imagined that DAPI nuclear stains would reveal the odontoblast layer, but this is not apparent. An adjacent section labeled with conventional histological stains would be helpful here. Others have described Stro-1 as a stem cell marker that is expressed on a minority of cells associated with vasculature in the dental pulp, but in the images in Figure 3, Stro-l label is essentially co-distributed with DAPI, in both control and injured teeth, indicating that it is expressed in nearly all cells. Although the authors state that the Stro-1-positive cells are associated with vasculature, but I see no evidence that is true.</p>
<p>(3) The data presented convincingly demonstrate that they have elevated BDNF expression in their dental pulp stem cells using a CRISPR-based approach I have a number of questions about these findings. Firstly, nowhere in the paper do they describe the nature of the CRISPR plasmid they are transiently transfecting. Some published methods delete segments of the BDNF 3'-UTR while others use an inactivated Cas9 to position an active transactivator to sequences in the BDNF promoter. If it is the latter approach, transient transfection will yield transient increases in BDNF expression. Also, as BDNF employs multiple promoters, it would be helpful to know which promoter sequence is targeted, and finally, knowing the identity of the guide RNAs would allow assessment for the potential of off-target effects I am guessing that the investigators employ a commercially obtained system from Santa Cruz, but nowhere is this mentioned. Please provide this information.</p>
<p>(4) Another question left unresolved is whether their approach elevated BDNF, proBDNF, or both. Their 28 kDa western blot band apparently represents proBDNF exclusively, with no mature BDNF apparent, yet only mature BDNF effectively activates TrkB receptors. On the other hand, proBDNF preferentially activates p75NTR receptors. The present paper never mentions p75NTR, which is a significant omission, since other investigators have demonstrated that p75NTR controls odontoblast differentiation.</p>
<p>(5) In any case, no evidence is presented to support the conclusion that the artificially elevated BDNF expression has any effect on the capability of the dental pulp stem cells to promote dentin regeneration. The results shown in Figures 4 and 5 compare dentin regeneration with BDNF-over-expressing stem cells with results lacking any stem cell transplantation. A suitable control is required to allow any conclusion about the benefit of over-expressing BDNF.</p>
<p>(6) Whether increased BDNF expression is beneficial or not, the evidence that the BDNF-overexpressing dental pulp stem cells promote dentin regeneration is somewhat weak. The data presented indicate that the cells increase dentin density by only 6%. The text and figure legend disagree on whether the p-value for this effect is 0.05 or 0.01. In either case, nowhere is the value of N for this statistic mentioned, leaving uncertainty about whether the effect is real.</p>
<p>(7) The final set of experiments applies transcriptomic analysis to address the mechanisms mediating function differences in dental pulp stem cell behavior. Unfortunately, while the Abstract indicates &quot; we conducted transcriptomic profiling of TNFα-treated DPSCs, both with and without TrkB antagonist CTX-B&quot; that does not describe the experiment described, which compared the transcriptome of control cells with cells simultaneously exposed to TNF-alpha and CTX-B. Since CTX-B blocks the functional response of cells to TNF-alpha, I don't understand how any useful interpretation can be attached to the data without controls for the effect of TNF alone and CTX-B alone.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, the authors investigate the potential for overexpressing BDNF in dental pulp stem cells to enhance dentin regeneration. They suggest that in the inflammatory environment of injured teeth, there is increased signaling of TrkB in response to elevated levels of inflammatory molecules.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The potential application to dentin regeneration is interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are a number of concerns with this manuscript to be addressed.</p>
<p>(1) Insufficient citation of the literature. There is a vast literature on BDNF-TrkB regulating survival, development, and function of neurons, yet there is only one citation (Zhang et al 2012) which is on Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>(2) There are several incorrect statements. For example, in the introduction (line 80) TrkA is not a BDNF receptor.</p>
<p>(3) Most important - Specific antibodies must be identified by their RRID numbers. To state that &quot;Various antibodies were procured:... from BioLegend&quot; is unacceptable, and calls into question the entire analysis. Specifically, their Western blot in Figure 4B indicates a band at 28 kDa that they say is BDNF, however the size of BDNF is 14 kDa, and the size of proBDNF is 32 and 37 kDa, therefore it is not clear what they are indicating at 28 kDa. The validation is critical to their analysis of BDNF-expressing cells.</p>
<p>(4) Figure 2 indicates increased expression of TrkB and TrkA, as well as their phosphorylated forms in response to inflammatory stimuli. Do these treatments elicit increased secretion of the ligands for these receptors, BDNF and NGF, respectively, to activate their phosphorylation? Or are they suggesting that the inflammatory molecules directly activate the Trk receptors? If so, further validation is necessary to demonstrate that.</p>
<p>(5) Figure 7 - RNA-Seq data, what is the rationale for treatment with TNF+ CTX-B? How does this identify any role for TrkB signaling? They never define their abbreviations, but if CTX-B refers to cholera toxin subunit B, which is what it usually refers to, then it is certainly not a TrkB antagonist.</p>

<p>In general, although the authors interpret their results as pointing towards a possible role of BDNF in dentin regeneration, the results are over-interpreted due to the lack of proper controls and focus on TrkB expression, but not its isoforms in inflammatory processes. Surprisingly, the authors do not study the possible role of p75 in this process, which could be one of the mechanisms intervening under inflammatory conditions.</p>
<p>(1) The authors claim that there are two Trk receptors for BDNF, TrkA and TrkB. To date, I am unaware of any evidence that BDNF binds to TrkA to activate it. It is true that two receptors have been described in the literature, TrkB and p75 or NGFR, but the latter is not TrkA despite its name and capacity to bind NGF along with other neurotrophins. It is crucial for the authors to provide a reference stating that TrkA is a receptor for BDNF or, alternatively, to correct this paragraph.</p>
<p>(2) The authors discuss BDNF/TrkB in inflammation. Is there any possibility of p75 involvement in this process?</p>
<p>(3) The authors present immunofluorescence (IF) images against TrkB and pTrkB in the first figure. While they mention in the materials and methods section that these antibodies were generated for this study, there is no proof of their specificity. It should be noted that most commercial antibodies labeled as anti-TrkB recognize the extracellular domain of all TrkB isoforms. There are indications in the literature that pathological and excitotoxic conditions change the expression levels of TrkB-Fl and TrkB-T1. Therefore, it is necessary to demonstrate which isoform of TrkB the authors are showing as increased under their conditions. Similarly, it is essential to prove that the new anti-p-TrkB antibody is specific to this Trk receptor and, unlike other commercial antibodies, does not act as an anti-phospho-pan-Trk antibody.</p>
<p>(4) I believe this initial conclusion could be significantly strengthened, without opening up other interpretations of the results, by demonstrating the specificity of the antibodies via Western blot (WB), both in the presence and absence of BDNF and other neurotrophins, NGF, and NT-3. Additionally, using WB could help reinforce the quantification of fluorescence intensity presented by the authors in Figure 1. It's worth noting that the authors fixed the cells with 4% PFA for 2 hours, which can significantly increase cellular autofluorescence due to the extended fixation time, favoring PFA autofluorescence. They have not performed negative controls without primary antibodies to determine the level of autofluorescence and nonspecific background. Nor have they indicated optimizing the concentration of primary antibodies to find the optimal point where the signal is strong without a significant increase in background. The authors also do not mention using reference markers to normalize specific fluorescence or indicating that they normalized fluorescence intensity against a standard control, which can indeed be done using specific signal quantification techniques in immunocytochemistry with a slide graded in black-and-white intensity controls. From my experience, I recommend caution with interpretations from fluorescence quantification assays without considering the aforementioned controls.</p>
<p>(5) In Figure 2, the authors determine the expression levels of TrkA and TrkB using qPCR. Although they specify the primers used for GAPDH as a control in materials and methods, they do not indicate which primers they used to detect TrkA and TrkB transcripts, which is essential for determining which isoform of these receptors they are detecting under different stimulations. Similarly, I recommend following the MIQE guidelines (Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR experiments), so they should indicate the amplification efficiency of their primers, the use of negative and positive controls to validate both the primer concentration used, and the reaction, the use of several stable reference genes, not just one.</p>
<p>(6) Moreover, the authors claim they are using the same amounts of cDNA for qPCRs since they have quantified the amounts using a Nanodrop. Given that dNTPs are used during cDNA synthesis, and high levels remain after cDNA synthesis from mRNA, it is not possible to accurately measure cDNA levels without first cleaning it from the residual dNTPs. Therefore, I recommend that the authors clarify this point to determine how they actually performed the qPCRs. I also recommend using two other reference genes like 18S and TATA Binding Protein alongside GAPDH, calculating the geometric mean of the three to correctly apply the 2^-ΔΔCt formula.</p>
<p>(7) Similarly, given that the newly generated antibodies have not been validated, I recommend introducing appropriate controls for the validation of in-cell Western assays.</p>
<p>(8) The authors' conclusion that TrkB levels are minimal (Figure 2E) raises questions about what they are actually detecting in the previous experiments might not be the TrkB-Fl form. Therefore, it is essential to demonstrate beyond any doubt that both the antibodies used to detect TrkB and the primers used for qPCR are correct, and in the latter case, specify at which cycle (Ct) the basal detection of TrkB transcripts occurs. Treatment with TNF-alpha for 14 days could lead to increased cell proliferation or differentiation, potentially increasing overall TrkB transcript levels due to the number of cells in culture, not necessarily an increase in TrkB transcripts per cell.</p>
<p>(9) Overall, there are reasonable doubts about whether the authors are actually detecting TrkB in the first three images, as well as the phosphorylation levels and localization of this receptor in the cells. For example, in Figure 3 A to J, it is not clear where TrkB is expressed, necessitating better resolution images and a magnified image to show in which cellular structure TrkB is expressed.</p>
<p>(10) In Figure 4, the authors indicate they have generated cells overexpressing BDNF after recombination using CRISPR technology. However, the WB they show in Figure 4B, performed under denaturing conditions, displays a band at approximately 28kDa. This WB is absolutely incorrect with all published data on BDNF detection via this technique. I believe the authors should demonstrate BDNF presence by showing a WB with appropriate controls and BDNF appearing at 14kDa to assume they are indeed detecting BDNF and that the cells are producing and secreting it. What antibodies have been used by the authors to detect BDNF? Have the authors validated it? There are some studies reporting the lack of specificity of certain commercial BDNF antibodies, therefore it is necessary to show that the authors are convincingly detecting BDNF.</p>
<p>(11) While the RNA sequencing data indicate changes in gene expression in cells treated with TNFalpha+CTX-B compared to control, the authors do not show a direct relationship between these genetic modifications with the rest of their manuscript's argument. I believe the results from these RNA sequencing assays should be put into the context of BDNF and TrkB, indicating which genes in this signaling pathway are or are not regulated, and their importance in this context.</p>
