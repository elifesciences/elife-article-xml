<title>Abstract</title><p>Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays an important evolutionary role in prokaryotes, but its role in mammals is poorly defined. We previously reported that cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs) - chromosomal fragments released from the billions of dying cells - that circulate in human blood are horizontally transferred to healthy cells with biological effects. However, the underlying mechanism and function of these effects remained unclear. We treated NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts cells with cfChPs isolated from human serum and serially passaged the cells. The intracellular activities of cfChPs were analysed using chromatin fibre fluorography, cytogenetic analysis, immuno-fluorescence and fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation. We discovered that the internalised cfChPs comprising of widely disparate DNA sequences had randomly combined to form complex concatemers some of which were ostensibly multi-mega base pairs in size. The concatemers exhibited variable and bizarre spatial relationships with the host cell interphase DNA with many remaining in the cytoplasm and others aligning themselves with the mouse chromosomal DNA. The concatemers performed many functions attributable to the nuclear genome. They could replicate, synthesise RNA, RNA polymerase, ribosomal RNA, ribosomal proteins, and numerous other human proteins within the mouse cells which manifested as complex multi-peptide fusion proteins. The concatemers harboured human LINE-1 and <italic>Alu</italic> elements which markedly amplified themselves and increased their copy number with time in culture and exhibited the potential to rearrange themselves within the mouse genome. These findings lead us to hypothesise that a cell simultaneously harbours two genome forms that function autonomously: one that is inherited (hereditary genome) and numerous others that are acquired (predatory genomes). The presence of predatory genomes has evolutionary implications given their ability to generate a plethora of novel proteins and to serve as vehicles for transposable elements. Finally, our results suggest that HGT occurs in mammalian cells on a massive scale via the medium of cfChPs that have undergone extensive and complex modifications resulting in their behaviour as “foreign” genetic elements.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays an important role in the adaptation of microorganisms to changing environments and in evolutionary processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bushman, 2002</xref>). However, defining the evolutionary role of HGT in mammals has remained a challenge. Nonetheless, experimental studies on HGT have offered insight into the regulations and functions of exogenously introduced genes and facilitated the design of drug-resistant cells, transgenic plants, and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hofmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Nagler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Puonti-Kaerlas et al., 1990</xref>). Indeed, gene therapy is founded on the principle of HGT; and several studies have indicated that oncogenes can be horizontally transferred across mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anker et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bergsmedh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dvořáková et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">García-Olmo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Trejo-Becerril et al., 2012</xref>). These observations support the hypothesis that HGT may occur naturally in mammalian cells and contributes to evolutionary and potentially oncogenic processes.</p>
<p>Several hundred billion to trillion cells die in the human body every day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fliedner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sender and Milo, 2021</xref>) and release chromosomal fragments in the form of cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs), which enter the extracellular compartments, including the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Holdenrieder and Stieber, 2009</xref>). We previously reported that cfChPs circulating in the blood and those that are released locally from dying cells are readily internalised by living cells through horizontal transfer followed by their association with the host cell genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mittra et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2017</xref>). The latter was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing and fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (FISH) analysis, as well as by the detection of multiple human <italic>Alu</italic> elements in the mouse recipient cells. Cellular uptake of cfChPs has several biological ramifications such as induction of DNA damage and the activation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mittra et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2017</xref>). Given the high turnover of cells, it can be assumed that all cells in the body continually internalise horizontally transferred cfChPs throughout their lifespan, leading to somatic mosaicism, which may be associated with ageing, chronic diseases, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Raghuram et al., 2019</xref>). However, the mechanisms and processes governing the intracellular consequences of horizontally transferred cfChPs remain unclear.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the intracellular processes and functions that regulate the various biological activities of cfChPs. We selected NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells for our experiments as we have extensive experience using this cell line for studies relating to cellular transformation; and these cells have also been widely used in various studies relating to oncogene discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Parada et al., 1982</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aaronson et al., 1982</xref>). In our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mittra et al., 2015</xref>), we investigated the relative biological activities and functions of healthy and cancerous cfChPs. We found that cfChPs isolated from cancer patients had significantly greater activity in terms of DNA damage and activation of apoptotic pathways than those isolated from healthy individuals. We had also reported that cfChPs released from dying cells can horizontally transfer themselves into healthy bystander cells leading to DNA damage and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Mittra et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, in the present study, we treated NIH3T3 cells with cfChPs isolated from the sera of both cancer patients and healthy individuals, as well as with those released from hypoxia induced dying MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. The cells were serially passaged following cfChPs treatment. Using chromatin fibre fluorography, cytogenetic analysis, and treatment with appropriate antibodies and fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (FISH) probes, we analysed the intracellular dynamics and processes that regulate the functional properties of the internalised cfChPs. Our findings described in this article provide novel insights and research directions to obtain a new perspective about the process of evolution.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Our results are described under three separate headings depending on whether NIH3T3 cells were treated with cfChPs isolated from sera of cancer patients or healthy individuals or with cfChPs that were released from hypoxia induced dying MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Most experiments were performed more than once with reproducible results.</p>

<sec id="s2a1">
<label>1.1</label><title>cfChPs are rapidly and abundantly internalised by NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells</title>
<p>We isolated cfChPs from the sera of cancer patients by a protocol described by us earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mittra et al., 2015</xref>). A representative electron microscopy image of the cfChPs is given in Supplementary Fig. S1. In order to track the intracellular activities of cfChPs, we fluorescently dually labelled the isolated cfChPs in their DNA with Platinum Bright Red 550 and in their histones with ATTO-488 and applied them (10ng) to NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells. A representative image of isolated cfChPs that had been fluorescently dually labelled and used to treat the NIH3T3 cells is given in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>. Examination of NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts treated with the dually fluorescently labelled cfChPs confirmed our earlier observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mittra et al., 2015</xref>) that cfChPs can readily and rapidly horizontally transfer themselves to healthy cells via phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Mittra et al., 2017</xref>) to accumulate in their cytoplasm and nuclei by 6 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). The fluorescent cfChPs appeared prominent, ostensibly owing to the amalgamation of multiple cfChPs to form large concatemers following their cellular entry (described in detail later). Chromatin fibres prepared from similarly treated NIH3T3 cells at 6h revealed the presence of numerous dually labelled cfChPs of varying sizes, which were present in both the cytoplasm and overlapping with mouse chromatin fibres (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Since chromatin fibres are derived from interphase cells, we further investigated whether the internalised concatemers could also be detected in metaphase cells. Metaphase spreads prepared from cfChPs-treated NIH3T3 cells at 6 h revealed many dually labelled cfChPs, some of which were associated with the chromosomes while others were present in extrachromosomal spaces (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>

<label>1.2</label><title>cfChPs randomly combine to form complex concatemers</title>
<p>We had earlier hypothesised that when the cfChPs are horizontally transferred to another cell, the latter perceives the dsDNA breaks present in their two ends as damaged ‘self’ DNA, and in an attempt to repair the ‘perceived damage’, activates proteins of the DDR pathway which links-up multiple disparate cfChPs as a part of the repair process leading to the formation of concatemers of variable sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mittra et al., 2015</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we performed FISH analysis using multiple different pairs of human chromosome-specific FISH probes on chromatin fibres and metaphase spreads prepared from cfChPs treated NIH3T3 cells that were in continuous passage. Since these chromosome specific probes were custom synthesized, we ensured that the probes that we used were human specific and did not cross-react with mouse chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S2a and S2b). We detected frequent co-localisation of red and green fluorescent signals suggesting that unrelated chromosomal fragments containing disparate DNA sequences had randomly amalgamated with each other to form highly complex concatemers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Some of the concatemers appeared strikingly prominent, which is particularly evident from images presented in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>. This suggested that the components of the concatemer had been markedly amplified. Even the small fluorescent signals shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref> appeared as concatemers. As the analytical resolution of a FISH signal under a fluorescent microscope is in the range of 100–200 Kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cui et al., 2016</xref>) even the small concatemers can be assumed to be at least of a similar size range. Surprisingly, we detected the fluorescence signals of chromosome 4 to co-localise with those of centromeres and of chromosome 20 to co-localise with those of telomeres. This finding highlighted the extent of genetic complexity and chaotic nature of the concatemers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, panels 4&amp;5). Perhaps the ultimate evidence of the chaotic nature of the concatemers comes from our detection of co-localising signals of telomeres and centromeres (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, panel 6). The centromeric signal seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, panel 4 is strikingly prominent, suggesting that the concatemers had not only incorporated centromeric DNA sequences (171bp in size) within their folds but that they had undergone large-scale amplification. Results of quantitative analysis of the degree of co-localisation of fluorescent signals generated upon treatment with FISH probes specific to different chromosome pairs are given in Supplementary Fig. S3a. The extent of co-localization ranged between 8% and 18%. Concatemerisation could also be detected in metaphase spreads prepared from serially passaged cfChPs-treated NIH3T3 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Negative control experiments performed on native NIH3T3 cells that had not been exposed to cfChPs treatment did not react with human specific FISH probes against chromosome 4 and chromosome 16 which were tested (Supplementary Fig. S4a).</p>

<label>1.3</label><title>Concatemers exhibit variable spatial relationships with mouse chromatin fibres</title>
<p>We next undertook immuno-FISH analysis using an antibody against histone H4 and a human whole genomic FISH probe on chromatin fibres prepared from cfChPs-treated NIH3T3 cells in continuous passage. We detected numerous dually labelled signals representing concatemers which exhibited extensive structural and size variability, as well as remarkably variable spatial relationships with mouse chromatin fibres (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Many concatemers were detected in the cytoplasm or to have aligned with long stretches of mouse DNA, while others exhibited unusual conformations or were seen to be dangling from the mouse DNA. A similar peculiar conformation was found in clone D5 which had been developed several years earlier by treatment of NIH3T3 cells with cfChPs isolated from sera of cancer patients and which had undergone numerous passages and multiple freeze–thaw cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mittra et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). This finding suggested that concatemers once formed are not eliminated or degraded and can remain within the cell for long periods. The fluorescent signals of the concatemers were also strikingly prominent, suggesting that they greatly exceeded the threshold of detection of FISH signals (100– 200 kb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cui et al., 2016</xref>). Control experiments were performed to confirm that the whole genomic DNA FISH probe used was human specific and did not cross-react with mouse (Supplementary Fig. S13).</p>

<label>1.4</label><title>Concatemers synthesise DNA polymerase and can replicate</title>
<p>Cells in continuous passage were pulse-labelled with BrdU followed by immuno-FISH analysis using an antibody against BrdU and a human genomic DNA probe. The analysis revealed co-localisation of the fluorescent signals of BrdU and DNA, indicating that the concatemers were actively synthesising DNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, upper panel). Immuno-FISH experiments further revealed that the concatemers expressed human DNA polymerase γ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, middle panel), while dual immunofluorescence staining using antibodies against BrdU and human specific DNA polymerase γ revealed co-localised signals, indicating that the concatemers had the potential to autonomously replicate themselves (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, lower panel). Since human DNA polymerases is well conserved in mouse and across mammals, we ensured that the antibodies against DNA Polymerase γ was human specific and did not cross-react with mouse (Supplementary Fig. S5). Results of quantitative analysis of the degree of co-localisation of fluorescent signals of human DNA and BrdU; human DNA and human DNA polymerase γ; and BrdU and human DNA polymerase γ are given in Supplementary Fig. S3b. The extent of co-localization ranged between 18% and 27%. These findings were confirmed on metaphase preparations from serially passaged cfChP-treated NIH3T3 cells wherein we detected multiple co-localising signals of human DNA and BrdU, human DNA and human DNA polymerase γ and BrdU and human DNA polymerase γ in the extrachromosomal spaces (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Negative control experiments performed on native NIH3T3 cells that had not been exposed to cfChPs treatment did not react with either to the human genomic DNA probe or the antibody against human DNA polymerase γ (Supplementary Fig. S4b).</p>

<p>Given the above results that the concatemers expressed DNA polymerase which co-localised with BrdU signals, we investigated their potential for self-replication. Ten metaphase spreads were prepared from cells in each successively increasing passage and the number of human FISH signals (representing concatemers) per chromosome was determined. The result showed that human FISH signals on mouse chromosomes increased progressively such that the number of signals at passage 198 was 4.07 times higher than those in passage 2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). It should be noted that this analysis is restricted to the proliferative capacity of concatemers that were associated with the chromosomes and did not take into account the replicative potential of those that are present in the cytoplasm. We also did a similar exercise to investigate whether the concatemers could amplify themselves with time by estimating the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) per chromosome. We found that the increase in MFI between passage 2 and 198 was 237.2 fold (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p>

<p>The ability of the concatemers to synthesise RNA led us to investigate whether they were involved in protein synthesis. We looked for three critical components of protein synthetic machinery viz. ribosomal RNA, RNA polymerase and ribosomal protein. For detection of ribosomal RNA we undertook dual-FISH using a human genomic FISH probe (to detect the concatemers) and a FISH probe against human ribosomal RNA. We ensured that the latter FISH probe was specific to human and did not cross-react with mouse (Supplementary Fig. S6, upper panel). Dual FISH analysis on chromatin fibres prepared from serially passaged cfChP-treated cells revealed strictly co-localised signals, indicating that the concatemers were synthesising ribosomal RNA (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>, upper panel). We next investigated whether the concatemers could synthesise the other two components of the protein synthetic machinery viz. RNA polymerase and ribosomal protein after ensuring that the antibodies against them were specific to humans (Supplementary Fig. S6, middle and lower panels). Immuno-FISH analysis revealed co-localised fluorescent signals generated by a human-specific genomic DNA probe and antibodies against RNA polymerase III and ribosomal protein (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>, middle and lower panels, respectively). These findings indicated that concatemers could autonomously synthesise critical components of the protein synthetic machinery. Results of quantitative analysis of the degree of co-localisation of fluorescent signals of human DNA and human ribosomal RNA; human DNA and RNA polymerase III; and human DNA and ribosomal protein are given in Supplementary Fig. S3c. The extent of co-localization ranged between 17% and 29%. We confirmed these findings in metaphase preparations from serially passaged cells for all three components of the protein synthetic machinery mentioned above (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b</xref>).

<p>Having confirmed that concatemers are capable of synthesising RNA and assembling their own protein synthetic machinery, we went on to investigate whether they were capable of autonomously synthesising proteins. We conducted immune-FISH experiments using a human specific genomic DNA probe (to detect the concatemers) and antibodies against various proteins. We found that the fluorescent signals of the various proteins frequently co-localized with those of human DNA suggesting that the concatemers were capable of synthesizing proteins (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9a</xref>). Significantly, the newly synthesised proteins consistently remained associated with the concatemers of their origin (identified by fluorescent human DNA signals). This finding suggested that, although the concatemers contained the critical components of a protein synthetic machinery, they apparently lacked the machinery required for protein sorting. It should be noted that all the proteins that we detected seemed to be over-expressed, confirming that the gene segments corresponding to the proteins within the concatemers were amplified. Results of quantitative analysis of the degree of co-localisation of fluorescent signals of human DNA and of various human proteins are given in Supplementary Fig. S3d.

We also conducted extensive control experiments on native NIH3T3 cells that had not been exposed to cfChPs treatment using a variety of human specific antibodies and found that none of them showed any positive fluorescent signals (Supplementary Fig. S4d).

Results of quantitative analysis of the degree of co-localisation of fluorescent FISH signals of human DNA and human LINE-1 and Alu on chromatin fibres are given in Supplementary Fig. S3f.

Hypoxia-induced cfChPs were collected in 1 ml of culture medium and added to NIH3T3 cells (please see Materials and Methods). We observed that cfChPs that were released from hypoxia-induced dying MDA-MB-231 cells could reciprocate all the intracellular activities and functions that were observed using cfChPs isolated from serum of both cancer patients and healthy individuals (Supplementary Fig. S11).</p>

<sec id="s3">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study is founded on our earlier reports that cfChPs released from the billions of cells that die in the body everyday can horizontally transfer themselves to healthy cells resulting in activation of several biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mittra et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2017</xref>). Herein, we have reported multiple additional activities and biological processes which can be summarised as follows. The internalised cfChPs containing widely disparate DNA sequences randomly combined to form complex concatemers of variable sizes many of which were ostensibly multi-mega base pairs in size. The concatemers exhibited variable and bizarre spatial relationships with the host cell interphase DNA with many remaining in the cytoplasm and others being directly associated with the mouse chromosomal DNA. The concatemers exhibited the potential to perform many functions attributable to the nuclear genome including the ability to replicate and to synthesise RNA, RNA polymerase, ribosomal RNA, ribosomal proteins, and numerous other human proteins in the mouse cells. The latter manifested as complex multi-peptide fusion proteins which were often highly overexpressed. Further analysis demonstrated that the concatemers harboured human LINE-1 and <italic>Alu</italic> elements which increased their copy numbers and extensively amplied themselves with time. The concatemers were also associated with the enzymes reverse transcriptase and transposase, suggesting their potential to rearrange themselves within the mouse genome. Taken together, the above findings lead us to conclude that the concatemers that form following horizontal transfer of cfChPs act as “predatory” genomes which function independently of the “inherited” genome.</p>
<p>Some of the summary points mentioned above call for further elaboration. For example, our demonstration that the concatemers synthesise ribosomal RNA, RNA polymerase and ribosomal protein suggests that they are capable of creating their own autonomous protein synthesis machinery. The concatemers being composed of open chromatin are apparently able to indiscriminately transcribe their DNA via RNA polymerase; the RNAs thus generated are translated into proteins with the help of their own ribosomal RNA and ribosomal proteins. Significantly, the newly synthesised proteins remained strictly associated with their concatemers of origin suggesting that, although the concatemers contained the critical components of a protein synthetic machinery, they lacked the machinery required for protein sorting. Taken together, these findings suggest a novel mechanism of protein synthesis which function autonomously without recourse to the cells own protein synthetic machinery. Clearly, such an assertion, which defies existing knowledge, requires critical experimental scrutiny to establish the mechanistic processes that might underlie such a unique biological process. Furthermore, our demonstration that the concatemers act as vehicles of human LINE-1 and <italic>Alu</italic> elements raise the hypothesise that transposable elements are not inherent to the cell, but rather that they are acquired from the exterior from other dying cells via the horizontal transfer of cfChPs. Confirming this hypothesis may help resolve the considerable uncertainty that surrounds the origin of these elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gilbert and Feschotte, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Panaud, 2016</xref>). Nonetheless, our results suggest that cfChPs derived from the billions of cells that die in the body daily and are horizontally transferred to living cells may have evolutionary functions by acting as transposable elements.</p>
<p>Our detection of the unusual intracellular characteristics and functions of cfChPs was facilitated by three factors. First, our trans-species model comprising of mouse recipient cells and cfChPs derived from human serum. This allowed us to track the activities of internalised human cfChPs within the mouse cells using appropriate human-specific FISH probes and antibodies. Second, the chromatin fibre technique facilitated the detection of spatial relationships between internalised cfChPs concatemers and the mouse interphase DNA. Third, our use of human specific genomic DNA FISH probes and antibodies which could detect short DNA sequences and small peptides by binding to the corresponding sequences and epitopes within the compacted concatemers. These would not have been detectable by the standard techniques of molecular biology (discussed in the next paragraph).</p>
<p>Numerous attempts on our part to characterise the concatemers by conventional real time PCR were unsuccessful. Given the complex and chaotic amalgams of disparate DNA fragments that comprise the concatemers, the primer sequences specific to a particular gene could not find the appropriate DNA sequences to bind to. Advanced sequencing technologies may help to define the complex nature of the DNA sequences that comprise the concatemers. Likewise, multiple attempts to detect the components of the fusion proteins by Western blotting proved unsuccessful. Even if an antibody reacted to a peptide component of a fusion protein, the band obtained would not correspond to the molecular weight of the positive control band, and the possibility of it being an artefact could not be excluded. Studies using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry may help to delineate the composition of the fusion proteins.</p>
<p>Conventionally, HGT refers to the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another. Although HGT occurs extensively in microorganisms, it has thus far been difficult to define HGT in mammals. Our results suggest that HGT occurs in mammalian cells on a massive scale via cfChPs released from the billions of host cells that die on a daily basis. We previously proposed that these cfChPs released from dying cells function as a new class of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) that act intra-corporeally and transfer themselves horizontally to the organism’s self-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Mittra, 2015</xref>). Although cfChPs (acting as MGEs) comprise of fragments of the host’s own cellular genome, they undergo extensive and complex modifications following cellular apoptosis to such an extent that they act as “foreign” genetic elements when horizontally transferred to the new host cells.</p>
<p>Thus, we hypothesise that evolutionary changes in mammals are brought about not necessarily by foreign genes being transferred from another organism, but rather by the host’s own genomic fragments that have been extensively modified to act as foreign genetic elements. However, for cfChPs to have evolutionary relevance in mammals, they need to be transferred to the germ line. The latter is not unlikely given the high turnover of daily cell death and release of cfChPs in the blood circulation which could carry them to all cells and tissues of the body including the germ line cells.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that extreme environmental stress plays a critical role in the adaptation and evolution of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bijlsma and Loeschcke, 2005</xref>; Hoffmann and Parsons, 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Nevo, 2011</xref>). We previously hypothesised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Raghuram et al., 2017</xref>) that extreme environmental stress may lead to organismal death via apoptosis or similar processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bayles, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Häcker, 2013</xref>), resulting in the generation of cfChP-like DNA– protein complexes. In particular, we demonstrated that while high-molecular-weight DNA is incapable of entering foreign cells, once the DNA is reduced to cfChP-sized fragments by sonication, they can readily undergo horizontal transfer to foreign cells regardless of species or even kingdom boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Raghuram et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, fragmented cfChP-like particles of human origin and those from bacteria and plants can readily enter mouse cells, and those from humans, bacteria, and plants can be transferred into bacteria. These findings together with those reported herein may provide new research directions linking cfChP-like DNA–protein complexes in the evolution of species in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Raghuram et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The presence of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) has been described in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wong and Wildman, 1972</xref>), yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Møller et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Shoura et al., 2017</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Stanfield and Lengyel, 1979</xref>), mice, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Møller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Shibata et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in the role of ecDNA in cancer. In particular, it has been suggested that ecDNA can be a source of extreme gene amplification enabling a cell to harbour multiple copies of oncogenes and can potentially promote tumour heterogeneity and therapy resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yan et al., 2024</xref>). The results of the present study raise the possibility that the ecDNAs detected in human cancers may represent “predatory” genomes formed by the amalgamation of multiple unrelated cfChPs which have been acquired from the surrounding dying cancer cells.</p>
<p>Our study leaves many unanswered questions, and our findings will require to be validated in future research. As such, our results should be seen as representing an expansive theory, wherein the activities of the concatemers formed by amalgamation of the horizontally transferred cfChPs are governed by unknown biological processes that are distinct from those that govern the nuclear genome. We believe that an understanding of these unexplored biological processes could offer a new perspective on the complex process of natural evolution.</p>
<p>In summary, the present findings lead to a novel hypothesis that a cell simultaneously harbours two genome forms that function autonomously: one that is inherited (hereditary genome) and numerous others that are acquired (predatory genomes). The predatory genomes may perform evolutionary functions by acting as vehicles of transposable elements and generating a plethora of novel proteins. Our results suggest that the biological life of the genome is not a co-terminus with the death of a cell, but rather that the genome is recycled in a fragmented and extensively modified incarnation to perform new functions in distant destinations as foreign genetic elements within the body. This suggests that a cell’s propensity to internalise cfChPs represents a natural process to modify the hereditary genome, which in turn may promote evolutionary change.</p>

<title>Ethics approval</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) of the Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre for the collection of blood (10 mL) from cancer patients and healthy individuals for the isolation of cfChPs (approval no. 900520). A formal informed consent form that was approved by the IEC was signed by each participant.</p>

<title>Isolation of cfChPs from human serum</title>
<p>cfChPs were isolated from sera of five patients suffering from cancer and five healthy volunteers using the protocol described by us earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mittra et al., 2015</xref>). Serum from five donors of each group was pooled prior to a cfChPs isolation. The steps of the isolation protocol can be summarized as follows: 1) centrifugation of the pooled serum samples (1 mL) at 700,000g for 16 h at 4°C; 2) treating the pellet obtained with lysis buffer; 3) centrifugation of the lysate at 700,000g for 16 h at 4°C; 4) suspension of the pellet in 1 ml PBS; 5) passing the suspension through an affinity column (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) containing biotinylated anti-histone H4 antibody (125 µg) bound to 2 mL of Pierce® Streptavidin Plus Ultralink® Resin (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA); 6) elution of the column with 1 mL 0.25 M NaCl; 7) ultra-centrifuging the elute as described above and suspending the pellet containing cfChPs in 1 mL PBS. The presence of cfChPs was confirmed using a nucleosome specific sandwich ELISA kit (Cell Death Detection ELISA<sup>PLUS</sup> kit, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany). A representative electron microscopy image of the isolated cfChPs is given in Supplementary Fig. S1. The concentrations of cfChPs in the isolates are expressed in terms of their DNA content, as estimated using the PicoGreen dsDNA quantitation assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mittra et al., 2015</xref>).

<title>Cell lines and culture</title>
<p>NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% bovine calf serum and grown at 37°C in 35-mm culture dishes in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 95% humidity. The cells (10 × 10<sup>4</sup>) were treated with 10 ng of cfChPs isolated from the serum of cancer patients or healthy individuals and maintained in continuous culture by passaging every fourth day.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Collection of conditioned medium containing cfChPs released from dying MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells</title>
<p>In addition to cfChPs isolated from the cancer patients and healthy individuals, we also investigated the effects of treating NIH3T3 cells with cfChPs that were released into the conditioned medium from hypoxia-induced dying MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. The protocol for collecting cfChPs from hypoxia induced dying cells has been described by us in detail earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Raghuram et al., 2024</xref>). The only difference was that in the earlier study we had used dying NIH3T3 cells instead of MDA-MB-231 cells for collecting media containing hypoxia induced cfChPs. In the dual-chamber system used in these experiments, the pore size of the filter separating the two chambers was 400µm. Consequently, the cfChPs from the dying MDA-MB-231 cells that were collected in the lower chamber were &lt;400µm in size. NIH3T3 cells (1 × 10<sup>5</sup>) were treated with 1 ml of the hypoxic media containing cfChPs.</p>

<title>Fluorescent dual labelling of cfChPs</title>
<p>In some experiments, the DNA and histones of the isolated cfChPs from serum were fluorescently dually labelled with Platinum Bright™ 550 Red Nucleic Acid Labelling Kit (Kreatech Diagnostics, Cat # GLK-004) and ATTO 488 NHS-ester (ATTO-TEC GmbH, Cat # AD488-35), respectively, according to our previously reported protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mittra et al., 2015</xref>). NIH3T3 cells were treated with 10 ng of dually labelled cfChPs for 6 h, washed with PBS x 3 and examined under a confocal microscope (Carl-Zeiss, GmbH, Germany). A representative image of dually labelled cfChPs is given in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>.</p>

<title>Preparation of chromatin fibres</title>
<p>Chromatin fibres were prepared from NIH3T3 cells according to previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Nieminuszczy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Quinet et al., 2017</xref>) with minor modifications. Although the inventers of this technique had described the fibres as DNA fibres, when stained with histone H4 antibody, we found the fibres to comprise of chromatin (Supplementary Fig. S12). To prepare the chromatin fibres, 2 µl of the cfChPs treated NIH3T3 cell suspension was spotted at one end of a glass slide and semi-evaporated for 10 min at room temperature (∼25°C). The spotted cells were incubated with 7 μL of lysis buffer (0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate in phosphate-buffered saline) for 2 min with gentle shaking, and the slides were tilted at an angle of 15°–25° to allow the cell lysate containing the chromatin fibres to roll down along the slide surface. The slides were fixed with chilled methanol for 10 min and processed for immunofluorescence and FISH analyses.</p>

<title>Metaphase spread preparation</title>
<p>Metaphase spreads from NIH3T3 cells treated with cfChPs in continuous culture were prepared using a standard protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mittra et al., 2015</xref>). The slides were processed for immunofluorescence and FISH analyses.</p>

<title>Human specificity of antibodies and FISH probes</title>
<p>Sources and other details of the antibodies and FISH probes used in this study are provided in Supplementary Table S2. Irrespective of the specifications of the antibodies given in the vendors’ data sheets, and the custom synthesised FISH probes, we independently verified their human specificity by undertaking extensive positive and negative control experiments to ensure that all antibodies and FISH probes were human specific. The results of these control experiments are given in Supplementary Figs. S2 and S5 – S9 and S13.</p>

<sec id="s4h">
<title>Immunofluorescence and FISH</title>
<p>The expression of various proteins in the cells was evaluated using indirect immunofluorescence, and the presence of human DNA in chromatin fibres and metaphase spreads was detected using FISH, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mittra et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, for immunofluorescence, the chromatin fibres were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, blocking in saponin buffer containing 10% normal goat serum followed by immune-staining with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. In order to remove unbound antibodies, 1X PBS containing 0.05% Tween20 washes were given x 3 before mounting with VectaShield DAPI for microscopic examination. In case of immunofluorescence on metaphase spreads, the paraformaldehyde fixation step was omitted. For FISH on both chromatin fibres and metaphase spreads, the slides were dehydrated using alcohol series (70%, 80% and 100%) followed by hybridisation overnight with appropriate FISH probes in a humidified chamber at 37⁰C. In order to remove the unbound probes, the slides were washed in 0.4X SSC at 70°C for 1 minute followed by 4X SSCT (4X SSC in 0.05% Tween20) washes at 45°C for 5 minutes each. The final wash was in 4X SSCT for 2 minutes at room temperature followed by mounting with VectaShield DAPI for microscopic examination. For immuno-FISH experiments, the slides were first stained for immunofluorescence as described above and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes followed by FISH procedure as described above. For microscopic examination, immunofluorescence slides were imaged at 400× magnification while FISH slides were analysed at 600× under an Applied Spectral Bio-imaging System (Applied Spectral Imaging, Israel). The immuno-FISH slides were analysed at 600× magnification.</p>

<p>To detect DNA synthesis on chromatin fibres and metaphase spreads, cells were pulse-labelled while in culture with 10 µM bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 24h, washed in PBS x 3, trypsinized and used for preparing chromatin fibres and metaphase spreads. Newly synthesized DNA was detected using anti-BrdU antibody.</p>

<p>The authors examine the effect of cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs) derived from human serum or from dying human cells on mouse cells in culture and propose that these cfChPs can serve as vehicles for cell-to-cell active transfer of foreign genetic elements. The work presented in this paper is intriguing and potentially <bold>important</bold>, but it is <bold>incomplete</bold>. At this stage, the claim that horizontal gene transfer can occur via cfChPs would strongly benefit from additional evidence emerging from multiple independent approaches. The evolutionary interpretations associated with the concept of &quot;predatory genome&quot; are premature based on the strength of evidence.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Horizontal gene transfer is the transmission of genetic material between organisms through ways other than reproduction. Frequent in prokaryotes, this mode of genetic exchange is scarcer in eukaryotes, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Furthermore, the mechanisms involved in eukaryotic HGT are unknown. This article by Banerjee et al. claims that HGT occurs massively between cells of multicellular organisms. According to this study, the cell free chromatin particles (cfChPs) that are massively released by dying cells are incorporated in the nucleus of neighboring cells. These cfChPs are frequently rearranged and amplified to form concatemers, they are made of open chromatin, expressed, and capable of producing proteins. Furthermore, the study also suggests that cfChPs transmit transposable elements (TEs) between cells on a regular basis, and that these TEs can transpose, multiply, and invade receiving cells. These conclusions are based on a series of experiments consisting in releasing cfChPs isolated from various human sera into the culture medium of mouse cells, and using FISH and immunofluorescence to monitor the state and fate of cfChPs after several passages of the mouse cell line.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The results presented in this study are interesting because they may reveal unsuspected properties of some cell types that may be able to internalize free-circulating chromatin, leading to its chromosomal incorporation, expression, and unleashing of TEs. The authors propose that this phenomenon may have profound impacts in terms of diseases and genome evolution. They even suggest that this could occur in germ cells, leading to within-organism HGT with long-term consequences.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The claims of massive HGT between cells through internalization of cfChPs are not well supported because they are only based on evidence from one type of methodological approach: immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using protein antibodies and DNA probes. Yet, such strong claims require validation by at least one, but preferably multiple, additional orthogonal approaches. This includes, for example, whole genome sequencing (to validate concatemerization, integration in receiving cells, transposition in receiving cells), RNA-seq (to validate expression), ChiP-seq (to validate chromatin state).</p>
<p>Another weakness of this study is that it is performed only in one receiving cell type (NIH3T3 mouse cells). Thus, rather than a general phenomenon occurring on a massive scale in every multicellular organism, it could merely reflect aberrant properties of a cell line that for some reason became permeable to exogenous cfChPs. This begs the question of the relevance of this study for living organisms.</p>
<p>Should HGT through internalization of circulating chromatin occur on a massive scale, as claimed in this study, and as illustrated by the many FISH foci observed in Fig 3 for example, one would expect that the level of somatic mosaicism may be so high that it would prevent assembling a contiguous genome for a given organism. Yet, telomere-to-telomere genomes have been produced for many eukaryote species, calling into question the conclusions of this study.</p>

<p>I must note that my comments pertain to the evolutionary interpretations rather than the study's technical results. The techniques appear to be appropriately applied and interpreted, but I do not feel sufficiently qualified to assess this aspect of the work in detail.</p>
<p>I was repeatedly puzzled by the use of the term &quot;function.&quot; Part of the issue may stem from slightly different interpretations of this word in different fields. In my understanding, &quot;function&quot; should denote not just what a structure does, but what it has been selected for. In this context, where it is unclear if cfChPs have been selected for in any way, the use of this term seems questionable.</p>
<p>Similarly, the term &quot;predatory genome,&quot; used in the title and throughout the paper, appears ambiguous and unjustified. At this stage, I am unconvinced that cfChPs provide any evolutionary advantage to the genome. It is entirely possible that these structures have no function whatsoever and could simply be byproducts of other processes. The findings presented in this study do not rule out this neutral hypothesis. Alternatively, some particular components of the genome could be driving the process and may have been selected to do so. This brings us to the hypothesis that cfChPs could serve as vehicles for transposable elements. While speculative, this idea seems to be compatible with the study's findings and merits further exploration.</p>
<p>I also found some elements of the discussion unclear and speculative, particularly the final section on the evolution of mammals. If the intention is simply to highlight the evolutionary impact of horizontal transfer of transposable elements (e.g., as a source of new mutations), this should be explicitly stated. In any case, this part of the discussion requires further clarification and justification.</p>
<p>In summary, this study presents important new findings on the behavior of cfChPs when introduced into a foreign cellular context. However, it overextends its evolutionary interpretations, often in an unclear and speculative manner. The concept of the &quot;predatory genome&quot; should be better defined and justified or removed altogether. Conversely, the suggestion that cfChPs may function at the level of transposable elements (rather than the entire genome or organism) could be given more emphasis.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer’s suggestions. We propose to use RNA-seq using an orthogonal platform as a solution. This will allow us to answer multiple questions viz. validation of expression of human DNA in mouse cells, obtaining a detailed insight into genes and pathways driven by human cfChPs and enable us to identify chimeric human and mouse transcripts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Another weakness of this study is that it is performed only in one receiving cell type (NIH3T3 mouse cells).

This begs the question of the relevance of this study for living organisms.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion. We propose to show horizontal transfer of cfChPs using four different cell-lines representing four different species.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is right in expecting that the level of somatic mosaicism may be so high that it would prevent assembling a contiguous genome. This is indeed the case, and we find that beyond ~ 250 passages the genomes of the cfChPs treated NIH3T3 cells begin to die out apparently become their genomes have become too unstable for survival. This point will be highlighted in the revised version. It is likely that cell death resulting from large scale HGT creates a vicious cycle of more cell death induced by cfChPs thereby helping to explain the massive daily turnover of cells in the body (10<sup>9</sup> – 10<sup>12</sup> cells per day).</p>

<p>We think this is a matter of semantics. We have used the term “function” since cfChPs that enter the cell are biologically active; they transcribe, translate, synthesize, proteins and proliferate. We, therefore feel that the term function is not inappropriate.</p>

<p>Similarly, the term &quot;predatory genome,&quot; used in the title and throughout the paper, appears ambiguous and unjustified.

<p>We take the reviewer’s point. We will replace the term “predatory genome” with a more neutral and factual term “supernumerary genome” in the title and throughout the manuscript in the revised version.</p>

<p>We propose to revise the “discussion” section taking into account the issues raised by the reviewer and highlight the potential role of cfChPs in evolution by acting as vehicles of transposable elements.</p>
