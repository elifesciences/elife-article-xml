<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Extremely preterm birth (at &lt; 28 postconceptional weeks) leads to brain injury and represents the leading cause of childhood-onset neuropsychiatric diseases. No effective therapeutics exist to reduce the incidence and severity of brain injury of prematurity. Hypoxic events are the most important environmental factor, along with inflammation. Among other developmental processes, the second half of in utero fetal development coincides with the migration of cortical interneurons from the ganglionic eminences into the cortex; this process is thus prone to disruptions following extremely preterm birth. To date, no studies have directly investigated the migration of human cortical inhibitory neurons under hypoxic conditions. Using multi-day confocal live imaging in human forebrain assembloids (hFA) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and <italic>ex vivo</italic> developing human brain tissue, we found a substantial reduction in the migration of hypoxic interneurons. Using transcriptomics, we identified adrenomedullin (<italic>ADM</italic>) as the gene with the highest fold change increase in expression. Based on previous literature about the protective role of supplemental ADM for other injuries, here, we demonstrated that addition of exogenous ADM to the hypoxic media restores the migration defects of interneurons. Lastly, we showed that one of the mechanisms of protection by ADM is through the activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway and subsequent pCREB-dependent rescued expression of a subset of GABA receptors, which are known to promote migration. Overall, in this manuscript we provide the first direct evidence for hypoxia-induced deficits in the migration of human cortical interneurons and identify ADM as a possible target for therapeutic development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Extremely preterm birth (at &lt; 28 postconceptional weeks) is commonly associated with brain injury of prematurity, and represents the leading risk factor for childhood-onset neuropsychiatric diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Clinical studies have identified postnatal hypoxic events as one of the most important environmental risk factors for brain injury of prematurity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Despite important clinical progress in understanding brain injury of prematurity from a histologic and radiologic perspective, the cell type-specific biological mechanisms of injury remain largely understudied in humans.</p>
<p>Among other phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, histology studies demonstrate a substantial reduction in the number of cortical interneurons in post-mortem tissue samples from individuals previously born extremely premature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. This decrease is now suggested as a significant contributor to the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with preterm birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Cortical interneurons are born and proliferate in the ganglionic eminences before migrating to the cortex, where they eventually become part of the cortical synaptic networks in a process that evolves over multiple years in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Of all these developmental stages, migration toward the cortex is the process most active during the second half of in utero development, which, in extremely preterm infants is replaced by postnatal hospitalization in the Neonatal ICU and associated with hypoxic events due to lung immaturity and inability to transfer oxygen from the environment to the tissues.</p>
<p>Despite migration defects being highly suspected to be impaired in hypoxic brain injury of prematurity, the investigation of this process in preclinical models has been uniquely challenging to study, because this migration mostly happens in utero in the majority of species. As a result, to date, no studies have yet been able to directly visualize the migration patterns of cortical interneurons upon exposure to hypoxia. Moreover, no in-depth data exist about the molecular mechanisms of injury in hypoxic migrating interneurons, thus making therapeutic discovery challenging. Previous animal models for hypoxic brain injury of prematurity have, however, replicated the human-observed histologic decrease in cortical interneurons in the dorsal forebrain of pre-born embryos as early as 4 days after exposing the pregnant dam to a hypoxic injury, and suggested that this decrease is related to a defect in the migration of interneurons that have already exited the ganglionic eminences at the time of hypoxia exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. These findings are encouraging and support the hypothesis that migration is affected by hypoxia and highlight the need for further investigation using newly emerging scientific tools.</p>
<p>To study the effects of hypoxia on the migration of cortical interneurons and advance our mechanistic understanding of prematurity-associated interneuronopathies, we developed two complementary human cellular models which consist of a stem cell-based <italic>in vitro</italic> human cellular platform, and an <italic>ex vivo</italic> developing human brain tissue platform. Specifically, we established a multi-day confocal live imaging setup for the visualization of migrating cortical interneurons within human forebrain assembloids (hFAs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, and within <italic>ex vivo</italic> developing human brain tissue.</p>
<p>Using these new models, we identified substantial migration deficits during exposure to hypoxia, thus providing the first direct evidence for the long-proposed migration delays induced by hypoxia. These findings are important because delays in reaching the specified cortical targets within the developmentally appropriate window are known to lead to elimination of cortical interneurons through apoptosis, and the direct demonstration of this deficit strengthens the hypothesis that delayed migration contributes to the decrease in the number of cortical interneurons observed in post-mortem brain tissues from preterm individuals.</p>
<p>Additionally, we demonstrated that supplementation with exogenous ADM peptide restores the migration cortical interneurons during exposure to hypoxia. Adrenomedullin peptide (ADM) has been previously shown to acutely increase in various non-neurologic and neurologic hypoxic and inflammatory conditions, in both clinical and preclinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Moreover, it has been demonstrated to be a direct binding partner for HIF1α, which is a hallmark of hypoxia, but is also stabilized in inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Interestingly, ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease have shown therapeutic promise and safety upon administration of exogenous ADM at supraphysiological levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Our data, in conjunction with previous findings, suggest exogenous administration of ADM as a therapeutic intervention should be further investigated in vivo and for various hypoxic injuries.</p>

<title>Development of a human cellular model to study the migration of hypoxic cortical interneurons</title>
<p>The hFAs recapitulate key developmental aspects of cortical interneurons migration from the medial ganglionic eminences (MGE) into the dorsal forebrain. To study the effects of hypoxia on the migration of human cortical interneurons, we established a model for hypoxic injury using hFAs. Using standardized published protocols we previously contributed to developing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, we generated hFAs through the differentiation of hiPSCs into human cortical organoids (hCO) containing dorsal forebrain excitatory neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, and human subpallial organoids (hSO) containing cortical interneurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. To visualize migrating cortical interneurons, we first fluorescently tagged cells within hSOs with a forebrain interneurons cell-type specific lentiviral reporter (Dlxi1/2b::eGFP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Subsequently, we fused the labeled hSOs with hCOs to generate hFAs. At approximately 10-14 days after fusion into hFAs, we observed substantial and active migration of Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup> cortical interneurons on the hCO side of hFAs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, Fig. S1A).</p>

</fig>
<p>To monitor the migration patterns of cortical interneurons under control and hypoxic stress, we established a long-term live imaging microscopy setup in intact hFAs using a confocal microscope with a motorized stage (Zeiss LSM 980 with Airyscan 2) equipped with an environmentally controlled chamber (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) and an oxygen level controller (Okolab Bold Line). For this, the hFAs were transferred to the confocal microscope in a glass-bottom 96-well plate with fresh cell culture media. We imaged individual Dlxi1/2b::eGFP-tagged interneurons within the hCOs for a total of 48 hrs: 24 hrs (0-24 hrs) under control conditions (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2,</sub> 21% O<sub>2</sub>), followed by 24 hrs (24-48 hrs) in pre-equilibrated hypoxic media (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 94.5% N<sub>2</sub>, &lt;1% O<sub>2</sub>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>To validate the decrease in partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> (PO<sub>2</sub>) in the culture media in hypoxic conditions, we used an oxygen optical microsensor OXB50 (50 μm, PyroScience) attached to a fiber-optic multi-analyte meter (FireStingO<sub>2</sub>, PyroSciences). In line with our previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, we observed a decrease in the media PO<sub>2</sub> level from ∼150 mmHg in control conditions, to ∼25-30 mmHg in the confocal microscope environmental chamber in hypoxic conditions (Fig. S1B).</p>
<p>Next, we confirmed that these conditions are sufficient to activate the hypoxia response pathway in hSOs within 24 hrs of exposure, without inducing extensive death of cortical interneurons. Specifically, to validate the induction of hypoxia, we demonstrated the stabilization of HIF1α hypoxia-marker protein using western blot analyses in hSOs derived from 4 individual cell lines (two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test, P=0.01) (Fig. S1C,D). Separately, we validated the activation of the hypoxia-response pathway using targeted transcriptional analyses for hypoxia-responsive genes, including <italic>PFKP</italic> (two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test, P=0.004), <italic>PDK1</italic> (two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test, P=0.001), <italic>VEGFA</italic> (two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test, P=0.003) (Fig. S1E, Table S2). To check whether Dlxi1/2b::eGFP-tagged interneurons start expressing cell markers for cell death, we used two different assays: we performed FACS-based Annexin V analyses in fluorescently-tagged interneurons, as well as immunostainings for cleaved caspase 3 (c-CAS3). We found no significant difference between control and hypoxic conditions using Annexin V (unpaired <italic>t-</italic>test, P=0.362) (Fig. S1F) nor c-CAS3 (unpaired <italic>t-</italic>test, P=0.125) (Fig. S1G,H).</p>
<p>These results demonstrate that our target hypoxic conditions (PO<sub>2</sub> ∼25-30 mmHg) are sufficient to induce and activate the hypoxia response pathway, but do not induce cell death. This experimental design aligns with our goal of targeting mild hypoxic stress, partly because mild hypoxic episodes are much more common than the severe ones in preterm infants, and partly because we wanted to define, for the first time, the altered molecular pathways in hypoxic (but live) cortical interneurons.</p>

<title>Human cortical interneurons display migration deficits upon exposure to hypoxia</title>
<p>The migration of cortical interneurons from the ganglionic eminences into the dorsal forebrain is at its peak during the second half of pregnancy in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. It is characterized by repetitive cycles of nuclear saltations (nucleokinesis events) in the direction of the leading process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. To study migration patterns of hypoxic cortical interneurons we followed the movement of the same individual Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup> cortical interneurons for a total of 48 hrs (control conditions: hours 0-24; hypoxia: hours 24-48). We analyzed the number of nuclear saltations, saltation length and the directionality of the migration in interneurons that had already migrated into the hCO at the time of the hypoxia exposure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, C</xref>).</p>
<p>To quantify the number of saltations, we focused on interneurons that had at least one saltation within the first 24 hours under control conditions and remained visible throughout the entire 48 hrs of imaging. This experimental approach was specifically chosen to focus the analyses on actively migrating cells, while excluding those that may have ceased migration and begun integrating into synaptic networks at the time of imaging. To quantify saltation length and directionality, we narrowed the cell population to the subset of cells that had at least one saltation in both control and hypoxic conditions, as a minimum of 1 saltation/condition is a prerequisite for direct comparisons for these parameters.</p>
<p>To identify defects in the migration patterns of interneurons in hypoxia, we analyzed migrating interneurons for 24 hrs in control conditions (hours 0-24), followed by another 24 hrs in hypoxic conditions (hours 24-48). We observed a ∼58% decrease in the number of saltations of individual interneurons (paired Wilcoxon test, P&lt;0.0001), and demonstrated that the phenotype is present in hFAs derived using hiPSCs from 4 separate individuals (two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test, P=0.003) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Importantly, 70 out of 129 actively migrating cortical interneurons, not only decreased the number of saltations, but became completely stationary upon exposure to hypoxia for 24 hrs. However, we found no significant differences in the average length of saltation of cells when analyzed by individual cells (paired Wilcoxon test, P=0.29) and by hiPSC line (two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test, P=0.15) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). In addition, we did not observe any differences in the directionality of migration measured by the ratio of Euclidean/accumulated distance when analyzed by individual cells (paired Wilcoxon test, P=0.36) and by hiPSC line (two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test, P=0.47) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>To ensure that the confocal chamber environment during the prolonged live imaging does not result by itself in defects in migration of the cortical interneurons, or that a possible hypoxia phenotype could be related to a physiologic saltatory pause in the second half of imaging, we performed two separate types of experiments. First, we compared the migration patterns in control conditions (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2,</sub> 21% O<sub>2</sub>) in the first 24 hrs (hours 0-24) versus the second 24 hrs (hours 24-48). We identified no differences in the total number of saltations/24 hrs when analyzed by individual cells (paired Wilcoxon test, P=0.09) and hiPSC line (two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test, P=0.2) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>); no difference in average saltation length when analyzed by individual cells (two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test, P=0.79) and by hiPSC line (two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test, P=0.47) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>); no difference in directionality of migration when analyzed by individual cells (paired Wilcoxon test, P=0.38) and by hiPSC line (two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test, P=0.62) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). Second, to ensure that the deliberate exclusion from analyses of cortical interneurons that display no saltations in control conditions do not bias the migration phenotype by excluding cells that might otherwise migrate more in the 24-48 hrs of imaging, we identified all cortical interneurons that displayed no migration in control conditions (0-24 hrs) and quantified their migration in hypoxia. Out of 113 total cells, 108 (95.6%) remained stationary (Fig. S1I), suggesting these cells are not in a highly migratory phase at the time of imaging.</p>
<p>Overall, the experiments in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and S1 suggest mild hypoxia preferentially affects the total migration length of cortical interneurons by decreasing the number of saltations, however it does not interfere with the length of individual saltations nor the directionality of the migration. The additional validation experiments demonstrate the robustness of the experimental design and strengthen the validity of saltation deficit phenotype in hypoxia. Details on the number of cells, experiments and number of hiPSC lines used for each experiment are presented in Table S1.</p>

<p>Hierarchical clustering of the gene expression profiles showed clear separation between hSOs from the control (control 12hr, control 24hr, control 72hr), hypoxia-exposed (hypoxia 12hr, hypoxia 24hr), and hypoxia followed by reoxygenation samples (hypoxia 72hr after &lt;1%) (Fig. S2b), suggesting that hypoxia exposure induces strong transcriptional profile changes in hSOs, and these largely recover following 72 hrs of reoxygenation. For this experiment, we used hSOs derived from 4 individual hiPSC lines, two XX and two XY genotypes (details by hiPSC line are presented in Table S1).</p>
<p>Next, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between control, hypoxia-exposed, and reoxygenated samples (padj&lt;0.05, fold change&gt;1.5), controlling for potential confounding variables as described in detail in the methods section. We identified 734 differentially expressed genes at 12 hrs, 985 genes at 24 hrs, and 21 genes at 72 hrs after reoxygenation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, 2c, Data File S1).</p>
<p>Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) demonstrated changes in molecular pathways associated with exposure to hypoxia (including glycolysis, mTORC1, KRAS), inflammatory response pathways (represented by nonspecific immune-related cell surface receptors), estrogen response pathways and unfolded protein response. In addition, we identified changes in genes associated with general cellular migration (e.g. <italic>AXL</italic>, <italic>GLIPR1</italic>, etc) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) (Data File S2).</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found that the adrenomedullin (<italic>ADM</italic>) gene had the highest fold change among DEGs at 24 hrs of hypoxia exposure (log<sub>2</sub>FC=4.06, padj=6.08E-19) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). To validate the increase in gene expression level of <italic>ADM</italic> under hypoxic conditions observed in bulk RNA-sequencing, we performed qPCR analyses using hypoxia-exposed intact hSOs. We confirmed the significant transcriptional upregulation of <italic>ADM</italic> gene expression (two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test, P=0.02) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>To check whether the transcriptional upregulation of <italic>ADM</italic> gene expression translates into changes at a protein level, we quantified ADM peptide levels using quantitative an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, EK-010-01) in cell culture media from intact hSOs exposed and non-exposed to hypoxia for 24 hrs.

<p>First, we performed Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction for hSOs non-exposed (n = 8,691cells) and exposed to hypoxia (n = 7,331 cells). We identified five distinct cell clusters including ventral forebrain progenitors and early cortical interneurons (<italic>NKX2.1</italic><sup>+</sup>, DLX2<sup>+</sup>, <italic>GAD1</italic><sup>+</sup>), cycling progenitors (<italic>TOP2A</italic><sup>+</sup>), astrocytes (<italic>S100A10</italic><sup>+</sup>) and a small cluster of radial glia (<italic>SOX9</italic><sup>+</sup>); as expected due to the previous fusion into hFA, we identified a cluster of cortical glutamatergic neurons (<italic>STMN2</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>NEUROD2</italic><sup>+</sup>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, Fig. S3A). For hCOs non-exposed (n = 6,786 cells) and exposed to hypoxia (n = 5,781cells), we also identified five cellular clusters consisting of dorsal forebrain progenitors (<italic>SOX2</italic><sup>+</sup>), cycling progenitors (<italic>TOP2A</italic><sup>+</sup>), cortical glutamatergic neurons (<italic>STMN2</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>NEUROD2</italic><sup>+</sup>), and a small cluster of choroid plexus cells (<italic>TTR</italic><sup>+</sup>); as expected due to the migration of interneurons from the hSO side, we identified a cluster of cortical interneurons (<italic>NKX2.1</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>GAD1</italic><sup>+</sup>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, Fig. S3B). All these cell clusters from hSOs and hCOs demonstrated increased expression of hypoxia-related genes (PDK1, PFKP) (Fig. S3C, D).</p>
<p>Next, we assessed the expression of <italic>ADM</italic> in individual cell types. We found that under hypoxic conditions, the expression level of <italic>ADM</italic> increases in all cell types, but more so in ventral neural progenitors and astrocytes within hSOs, and in dorsal neural progenitors and choroid plexus cells in hCOs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, we evaluated the cell type-specific expression of <italic>RAMP1, RAMP2</italic> and <italic>RAMP3</italic>, the known receptors for ADM peptide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Since the previous literature suggests RAMP2 is the main receptor for ADM, we checked the expression of the <italic>RAMP1-3</italic> receptors in control conditions and found that <italic>RAMP2</italic> is indeed the most expressed receptor. Interestingly, we found this receptor is preferentially expressed by interneurons (hSOs) and glutamatergic neurons (hCOs) when compared to other cell types (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>To validate the findings about the higher expression of RAMP2 in control conditions at a protein level, we performed Western blot analyses for RAMP1 and RAMP2 in hSOs in control conditions and found that, indeed, RAMP2 was significantly more expressed at baseline than RAMP1 by individual cell (two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test, P=0.0004) and by hiPSC line (two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test, P=0.0036) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F,G</xref>). To validate the findings about the increase in RAMP2 expression in hypoxia in hSOs, we checked for changes in the expression of RAMP2 at a protein level and identified a significant increase when analyzed by individual cell (two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test, P=0.0027) and by hiPSC line (two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test, P=0.0235) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H,I</xref>). These experiments were performed in 3 separate biological replicates of hSOs, each derived from 4 hiPSC lines in one differentiation experiment. Details by hiPSC line are presented in Table S1.</p>
<p>Together, these results provide the first cell type-specific characterization of the expression of ADM and its receptors in the brain in control and hypoxic conditions. Importantly, we identify complementary responses of different cell types, with neurons increasing the expression of the receptors for ADM, while astrocytes, choroid plexus and progenitors increasing the expression of ADM, suggesting a possible evolutionary adaptation mechanism of cells to protect neurons during hypoxia as an environmental stressor.</p>

<p>To check whether exogenous ADM peptide changes the migration of cortical interneurons under control conditions, or whether this is hypoxia-specific, we analyzed the number of saltations of cortical interneurons under control conditions for a total of 48 hrs: 24 hrs under control conditions (0-24 hrs), followed by 24 hrs in control + ADM (24-48 hrs). We identified no difference in the total number of saltations/24 hrs when analyzed by individual cells (paired Wilcoxon test, P=0.23), and hiPSC line (two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test, P=0.77) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), suggesting ADM is not a main mechanism for migration under baseline conditions. These results align with the data about the low baseline expression of ADM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>) in control conditions, and its known increase as an acute phase reactant in hypoxia and inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To verify that the saltation rescue is directly linked to the administration of exogenous ADM, we next performed two types of experiments.</p>
<p>First, we disrupted the disulfide bond between Cys16 and Cys21, which has been shown to be important for ADMs’ biological activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, by denaturing and alkylating it using iodoacetamide (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, Fig. S4A). Next, we repeated the hypoxia experiments in the presence of 0.5 μM human denatured ADM (dADM) and demonstrated that it does not rescue the saltation deficit under hypoxic conditions, when analyzed by individual cells (paired Wilcoxon test, P&lt;0.0001) and by hiPSC line (paired <italic>t</italic>-test test, P=0.04) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, we performed pharmacological blocking RAMP2, the primary recognized receptor for ADM in the literature and in our data. For this, we added 10 μM adrenomedullin fragment 22-52 (ADM<sub>22-52</sub>) (Cayman Chemical Company 24892) to the hypoxic media already supplemented with exogenous ADM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). We validated the saltation deficit in hypoxia and the rescue by exogenous ADM and found that the addition of ADM<sub>22-52</sub> to the hypoxia + ADM condition was sufficient to prevent the saltation rescue when analyzed in individual cells (paired Wilcoxon test, P&lt;0.0001) and by hiPSC line (paired <italic>t</italic>-test test, P=0.003) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>).</p>

<title>Migration deficits persist in the acute phases of reoxygenation but administration of exogenous ADM during hypoxia provides partial protection</title>
<p>To investigate whether migration of interneurons is restored upon reoxygenation, we quantified the saltations of individual migrating cortical interneurons for a total of 72 hrs: 24 hrs in control (0-24 hrs), 24 hrs in hypoxia (24-48 hrs), followed by 24 hrs in reoxygenation (48-72 hrs). Similar to our experiments from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, we observed a ∼53% decrease in saltations in hypoxia compared to control (Friedman test, P&lt;0.0001).

In contrast, the presence of exogenous ADM during hypoxia exposure (not during reoxygenation) fully rescued the migration in hypoxia as previously shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, and provided partial protection in the first 24 hrs after reoxygenation limiting the decrease to 35% compared to control when analyzed by individual cells (Friedman test, P=0.05) (Fig.S4C) and by hiPSC line (one-way ANOVA, P=0.84) (Fig S4C); again, this is in contrast to the hypoxia conditions without ADM that see a 65% decrease in saltations during reoxygenation.</p>

<p>To assess whether exposure to hypoxia is sufficient to induce a migration deficit in <italic>ex vivo</italic> human cortical interneurons as observed in hFA, we employed the live-imaging setup established for hFA and monitored the migration patterns of the Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup>-tagged interneurons for 24 hrs under control conditions (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2,</sub> 21% O<sub>2</sub>). We then transitioned the sections into pre-equilibrated hypoxic media (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 94.5% N<sub>2</sub>, &lt;1% O<sub>2</sub>) and imaged the same cells for another 24 hrs. Similar to hypoxic hSOs, we observed a significant transcriptional increase in <italic>ADM</italic> gene by qPCR (two-tailed unpaired <italic>t-</italic>test, P=0.0005) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Following exposure to hypoxia for 24 hrs, we identified ∼55 % decrease in the number of saltations (paired Wilcoxon test, P&lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>), but no changes in the average saltation length (paired Wilcoxon test, P=0.88) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>) nor in directionality (Wilcoxon test, P=0.3) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, we found addition of 0.5 μM ADM peptide during the hypoxia exposure was sufficient to rescue the saltation numbers (paired Wilcoxon test, P=0.09) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>).</p>

<title>Proposed molecular mechanism that contributes to the rescue by exogenous ADM administration</title>
<p>First, we performed EIA analyses focused on cAMP/PKA, AKT/pAKT and ERK/pERK pathways, which have been previously shown to be modulated by ADM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). We found that the concentration of cAMP was not affected by hypoxia but was significantly increased in the hypoxia + ADM conditions, both when analyzed by individual samples (one-way ANOVA test, P=0.0007), and by hiPSC line (one-way ANOVA test, P=0.002) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). These results were complemented by increased PKA activity in hypoxia + ADM conditions when analyzed by individual samples (one-way ANOVA test, P&lt;0.0001), and by hiPSC line (one-way ANOVA, P&lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). In contrast, the ratio of pAKT/AKT was significantly decreased in hypoxia samples when analyzed by individual samples (one-way ANOVA, P&lt;0.0001) and by hiPSC line (Kruskal-Wallis test, P=0.01), but was not rescued in hypoxia + ADM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). These findings were similar for the ratio of pERK/ERK in individual samples (one-way ANOVA test, P=0.001) and by hiPSC line (one-way ANOVA, P=0.02) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Lastly, we quantified the ratio of pCREB/CREB which is downstream of all these pathways. We found that hypoxia induced a significant decrease in the ratio of pCREB/CREB when compared to control when analyzed by individual samples (one-way ANOVA test, P=0.003) and by hiPSC line (P=0.048). However, this ratio was restored in hypoxia + ADM conditions when analyzed by individual samples (one-way ANOVA test, P=0.27) and by hiPSC lines (one-way ANOVA, P=0.6) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). These results suggest the cAMP/PKA/pCREB pathway is modulated by exogenous ADM administration in hypoxia in hSOs.</p>

<p>Previous reports demonstrated that increased ratio of pCREB/CREB is directly involved in increasing the expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, which in turn, are well-documented to facilitate interneuron migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. To check whether the expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors is affected under hypoxic conditions and rescued by ADM, we quantified the expression of several GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits in the presence or absence of ADM during hypoxia exposure. We specifically focused on the most common pentameric combination, α1β2γ2, encoded by <italic>GABRA1</italic>, <italic>GABRB2</italic> and <italic>GABRG2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). We found a significant decrease in expression in hypoxia (one-way ANOVA test; control vs hypoxia: P=0.002) and rescue by ADM for <italic>GABRA1</italic> (one-way ANOVA test; P=0.17); no significant change in expression in <italic>GABRB2</italic> (Kruskal-Wallis test; control versus hypoxia: P=0.08; control versus hypoxia + ADM: P=0.25); a significant decrease in expression in hypoxia (one-way ANOVA test; control versus hypoxia: P=0.007) and rescue by ADM for <italic>GABRG2</italic> (one-way ANOVA test; P=0.23) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). Moreover, we analyzed other receptor subunits and found mild but still significant decrease in hypoxia and rescue by ADM for receptors <italic>GABRB3</italic> (Kruskal-Wallis test; control versus hypoxia: P=0.02; control versus hypoxia + ADM: P=0.05) and <italic>GABRG3</italic> (one-way ANOVA test; control versus hypoxia: P=0.01; control versus hypoxia + ADM: P=0.1); no change in expression under hypoxic conditions for receptors <italic>GABRA2</italic> (one-way ANOVA; control versus hypoxia: P=0.8; control versus hypoxia + ADM: P=0.75) (Fig. S6A).</p>
<p>Separately, we investigated the expression of <italic>CXCR4</italic>, <italic>CXCR7</italic> and <italic>CXCL12</italic>, as some of the best-known chemokines/chemokine receptors involved in interneuron migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we found a significant increase of <italic>CXCR4</italic> in hypoxia but no rescue by ADM (one-way ANOVA test; control versus hypoxia: P=0.0005; control versus hypoxia +ADM: P=0.0031), a significant decrease of <italic>CXCR7</italic> in hypoxia but no rescue by ADM (one-way ANOVA test; control versus hypoxia: P=0.026; control versus hypoxia + ADM: P=0.043), and a significant decrease of <italic>CXCL12</italic> in hypoxia but no rescue by ADM (one-way ANOVA test; control versus hypoxia: P=0.024; control versus hypoxia + ADM: P=0.0039) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6I</xref>).

<caption><title>Schematic of the overall proposed mechanism of interneuron migration defect rescue by ADM upon hypoxia exposure.</title>
<p>Based on our findings and existing data from literature, we propose endogenously produced ADM has decreased biological activity by impaired ability to form the necessary di-sulfide bond in the absence of oxygen in hypoxia. However, exogenous ADM does have biological activity as the di-sulfide bond is present, and thus it binds efficiently to its receptors, especially RAMP2. This binding initiates an activation of the cAMP/PKA/pCREB pathway, which in turn restore the expression of GABAA receptors and rescue the migration.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Accumulating evidence demonstrates the power of human cellular models for the study of neurodevelopmental diseases of genetic or environmental etiology, including tuberous sclerosis, Timothy syndrome, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, ZikV exposure, preterm birth, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Disruptions in cortical interneurons migration from the ganglionic eminences toward the cortex have been long suggested as a contributing factor to the increased risk for neuropsychiatric diseases in hypoxic brain injury of prematurity, because this critical developmental process occurs predominantly during the latter half of pregnancy and is likely to be affected by preterm birth. However the migration patterns under hypoxic conditions have proved difficult to investigate in animal models, and no data exist for human cortical interneurons.</p>
<p>In this study, we established the first live imaging microscopy platform for the direct investigation of the migration patterns on human cortical interneurons in control and hypoxic conditions, thus overcoming a long-term challenge in the field. The high technical and scientific relevance of this novel platform for disease investigation is further amplified by the concomitant use of two human models consisting of hFAs derived from hiPSCs and <italic>ex vivo</italic> developing human cortical tissue, an approach that helps mitigate potential confounding factors associated with possible interspecies differences in how brain cells respond to hypoxia and other environmental stressors.</p>
<p>Using these human cellular platforms, we directly demonstrate a substantial saltation deficit of human cortical interneurons exposed to mild hypoxia. Importantly, we provide the first characterization of molecular changes in interneurons in hypoxia, identify exogenous adrenomedullin (ADM) peptide supplementation as an effective pharmacological rescue for this phenotype and bring evidence that this is, at least partly, mediated by the cAMP/PKA/pCREB pathway and rescue of the expression of specific subunits that form the α1β2γ2 pentameric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor. Since exogenous ADM administration is already showing promise in clinical trials for inflammatory bowel disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, this new knowledge could serve as a starting point for the investigation of ADM as a possible future target for therapeutic interventions for hypoxic brain injuries. Moreover, the novel and interesting findings about the cell type-specific expression of ADM and its receptors on brain cells add important biologic knowledge and will inform future studies focused on the role of ADM in the brain.</p>
<p>Our manuscript has several limitations. First, while hFAs and <italic>ex vivo</italic> developing human cortical tissue are the “best next thing” after in vivo human brain, they do remain a model, like all other preclinical models. Future studies should focus on the translational potential of ADM for brain injury of prematurity using large in vivo animal models (e.g. piglet, lambs, non-human primates) which have more similar brain developmental trajectories to humans, allow reliable modeling of preterm birth and multiple complex analyses (e.g. blood draws, neurological monitoring etc), which are not feasible in organoids. Second, in this study we provide preliminary evidence for the ongoing migration deficits in the first 24 hrs after reoxygenation and the possible protective effect of exogenous ADM administration, however we do not provide in depth phenotypic cellular and molecular characterization of this injury. Since reoxygenation injury is an important, yet separate entity in the complex pathophysiology of hypoxic brain injury, future studies should adapt our current experimental design to focus on this question, which will be highly relevant for the future development of ADM and other compounds as therapeutics. Lastly, this study was specifically focused on studying the migration of cortical interneurons, because this process in the overall development and maturation of cortical interneurons is the most relevant for preterm birth. Other studies should investigate progenitor proliferation within the GE, as well as the effects of hypoxia on the function of more mature cortical interneurons that are already integrated in the synaptic networks. Along with previous disease models using human cellular models for brain development and injury, our study further strengthens the power of organoids to identify cellular and molecular mechanisms of disease and complement findings from animal studies, to advance the identification of therapeutic candidates with high potential for translation into effective clinical interventions.</p>

Briefly, hiPSCs were maintained in six-well plates coated with recombinant human vitronectin (VTN-N, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A14700) in Essential 8 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1517001). For differentiation, hiPSC colonies were lifted from the plates using Accutase (Innovate Cell Technologies, AT-104). Approximately 3 million cells were transferred to each well in AggreWell 800 (STEMCELL Technologies, 34815) and centrifuged at 100g for 3 minutes in hiPSC medium supplemented with ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (Selleck Chemicals, S1049). After 24 hrs, the newly formed organoids were transferred into ultra-low-attachment plastic dishes (Corning, 430293) in Essential 6 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1516401) supplemented with dorsomorphin (2.5 μM, SigmaAldrich, P5499) and SB-431542 (10 μM, Tocris, 1614) and additional XAV-939 (hCO 0.5 μM, hSO: 2.5 μM Tocris, 3748). This medium was replaced daily for the first five days.

<p>Samples were imaged for 24 hrs under control conditions (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 21% O<sub>2</sub>). To induce acute hypoxia, media was carefully removed and replaced with pre-equilibrated hypoxic media. All procedures were performed in the controlled hypoxic environment of the HypoxyLab (Oxford Optronix).

<p>Post-acquisition analyses of cell mobility were performed using ImageJ (v:2.00-rc-69/1.52n). Individual cells were identified and followed both in control and hypoxic conditions. Analyses were performed on all cells that had at least one saltation within the first 24 hrs of imaging (control conditions) and remained visible within the field of view until the end of the imaging period (up to 72 hrs). Paired analyses of number of saltations and saltation length were performed as described in the main text. To estimate the length of individual saltations, we manually tracked and identified the swelling of the soma of Dlxi1/2b::eGFP tagged cortical interneurons before and after saltation and measured the distance (in μm) from the initial position to the new position. The Z-stack Alignment present in Zen 3.1 Blue Edition (Zeiss) was used to correct for minor drifts during imaging. To assess changes in directionality of the movement, we extracted the x and y coordinates of each cell per frame and time using the Manual Tracking plugin (ImageJ). The Chemotaxis &amp; Migration Tool (Ibidi) was then used to calculate the Accumulated (A) and Euclidean (E) distances traveled per cell over time. Data is presented by calculating the E/A ratio.

<title>RNA sequencing analyses</title>
<p>mRNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and sequence libraries were prepared by Admera Health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.admerahealth.com">www.admerahealth.com</ext-link>) using the KAPA Hyper Prep Stranded RNA-Seq with RiboErase. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 400 system with paired-end 150 base pair reads. Samples averaged 40 million reads, each representing 20x genome coverage. Trimmed RNA-Seq reads were aligned to the Ensembl GRCh38 human genome reference using STAR v2.7.3 in gene annotation mode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Alignment and RNA-Seq quality control metrics were generated with Picard (v 2.21.1). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the quality control matrices did not indicate any sample outliers.</p>
<p>Gene-level counts were filtered to remove lowly expressed genes which did not have at least 1 count per million in at least 4 out of the total 24 samples; this resulted in 17,777 remaining genes. We noticed a slight GC content bias across samples, so gene counts were further normalized by GC content, gene length, and sequencing depth using the CQN R package v1.36.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. The resulting estimation parameters were provided to the negative binomial generalized linear model while performing the differential expression (DEG) analysis. This was carried out using DESeq2 v1.30.1 to identify significant genes between hypoxic conditions at each timepoint while also accounting for unwanted variation due to cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. The resulting P values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Genes were considered significant at FDR ≤ 0.05 and absolute fold change &gt; 1.5 (log2FC of 0.6). In total, we identified 734 DEX genes as a consequence of the hypoxic conditions at 12 hrs, 985 genes at 24 hrs, and only 21 genes at 72 hrs after reoxygenation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, Fig. S2b, S3). We generated the dendrogram in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref> using expression data from all 24 samples, narrowed to the union of the genes differentially expressed between hypoxic and control conditions at 12 and 24 hrs or 72 hrs after reoxygenation (<italic>n</italic> = 1,473). Hierarchical clustering, using complete linkage of Euclidean distance, determined the order of the dendrogram. Z-score normalized expression values are depicted on a continuous scale from lower values (purple) to higher values (orange). The notable reduction of DEG at 72 hrs after reoxygenation reflects what we visually see in the PCA of the normalized gene expression, in that the control and hypoxia conditions cluster together at 72 hrs post reoxygenation (not shown). Indeed, hierarchical clustering using the Ward’s criterion on the first three principal components separates hypoxic samples at 12 and 24 hrs from the control 12 and 24 hrs samples as well as the reoxygenated samples (Fig. S2b).</p>
<p>To gain insight about putatively dysregulated biological pathways, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis that was computed using the fgsea R package v1.18.0 where all genes were ranked by their absolute log<sub>2</sub> fold change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. We evaluated the Molecular Signatures Database “Hallmark” gene sets and supplemented the WU_cell migration set based on its presence in a preliminary gene ontology enrichment. The top 10 significantly enriched gene sets (padj &lt; 0.05) that occur across all timepoints are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>. Interested in discovering which genes had the largest change in response between 12 hrs and 24 hrs, we identified genes significant at both timepoints and ranked them by absolute difference in fold change.

<title>Single cell gene expression data collection and analyses</title>
<p>For single cell gene expression analyses, human forebrain assembloids (hFA) were infected with Lenti Dlx1/2b::eGFP as described above. Samples were incubated either under a normoxic environment (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 21% O<sub>2</sub>), or under the controlled hypoxic environment of the HypoxyLab (Oxford Optronix). Following the environmental exposure, hFA were dissected under a microscope to separate the hFA into hSO and hCO. To analyze only interneurons migrated within the hCO and not the ones still at the edges of the fusion, we intentionally performed the separation of hFA more toward the hCO side. For single cell gene expression analysis, organoids were dissociated as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Dissociated cells were resuspended in ice-cold PBS containing 0.02% BSA and loaded onto a Chromium Single cell 3′ chip (with an estimated recovery of 10,000 cells per channel) to generate gel beads in emulsion (GEMs). scRNA-seq libraries were prepared with the Chromium Single cell 3′ GEM, Library &amp; Gel Bead Kit v2 (10x Genomics, PN: 120237). Libraries from different samples were pooled and sequenced on a NovaSeq S4 (Illumina) using 150 × 2 chemistry. Sample demultiplexing, barcode processing and unique molecular identifiers counting was performed using the Cell Ranger software suite (v6.1.2 with default settings excluding introns). Reads were then aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38), filtered, and counted. Expression matrices for the samples were processed using the R (v4.1.2) package Seurat (v4.2). We excluded cells that express less than 2500 genes as well as those with a proportion of mitochondrial reads higher than 15%. Gene expression was then normalized using a global-scaling normalization method (normalization.method=‘LogNormalize’, scale.factor = 10,000), and the 2,000 most variable genes were then selected (selection.method=‘versust’). <italic>Harmony</italic> package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> was used to integrate control and hypoxia samples for downstream analysis. The top 7 and 6 principal components for hCO and hSO samples respectively were utilized to perform a UMAP projection, implemented with the <italic>RunUMAP</italic> function with default settings. The clusters were generated with resolutions of 0.1 and 0.3 respectively for hCO and hSO samples using the <italic>FindNeighbors</italic> and <italic>FindClusters</italic> functions. We identified clusters based on differential expression of known markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> identified using the FindAllMarkers function with default settings. In some cases, using expressions of known markers, we grouped together clusters that were originally separate based on the Seurat clustering. For visualization purposes, the color palette of UMAP plots for hSO and hCO was adjusted using “magic wand” in non-contiguous mode for selection of all cells from respective clusters, for subsequent synchronization of the color for the given cell cluster between brain regions (Adobe Photoshop CS 2018).

<p>To assess the levels of apoptotic Dlxi1/2b::mScarlet cells, FACS was conducted on NovoCyte Penteon instrument using NovoExpress 1.5.6 software (Stanford FACS Facility). To label inhibitory interneurons in hSOs at later stages of development, hiPSC lines were engineered to express mScarlet under the dlx1/2 promoter. Briefly, LV-Dlxi1/2b-mScarlet lentiviral particles were produced according to the protocol described in this manuscript. Control iPSC lines were plated sparsely and infected with the lentivirus at 1:300 dilution in E8 medium for 24 hours, following which the media was changed to E8 medium without lentivirus. The cells were dissociated using Accutase (Innovate Cell Technologies, AT-104) and plated sparsely in 6-well plates for Puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich, P8833) selection of single cell clones with successful genomic integration of the LV-Dlxi1/2b-mScarlet construct. Selected clones were used to make hSO organoids according to the previously described protocol and used for further experiment. On the day of analysis, 3 spheres per line were placed in an Eppendorf tube and dissociated in 300μL of Accutase at 37°C for 30mins. After incubation, 1200μL of neurobasal medium was added to each tube to inactivate the Accutase. The cells were then centrifuged at 200g for 4 mins and resuspended in DPBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 14190144) and strained using a 40μM cell strainer (Biologix Research Company, 15-1040).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms affected in hypoxic conditions, causing reduced cortical interneuron migration. They use human assembloids as a migratory assay of subpallial interneurons into cortical organoids and show substantially reduced migration upon 24 hours of hypoxia. Bulk and scRNA-seq show adrenomedullin (ADM) up-regulation, as well as its receptor RAMP2, confirmed atthe protein level. Adding ADM to the culture medium after hypoxic conditions rescues the migration deficits, even though the subtype of interneurons affected is not examined. However, the authors demonstrate very clearly that ineffective ADM does not rescue the phenotype, and blocking RAMP2 also interferes with the rescue. The authors are also applauded for using 4 different cell lines and using human fetal cortex slices as an independent method to explore the DLXi1/2GFP-labelled iPSC-derived interneuron migration in this substrate with and without ADM addition (after confirming that also in this system ADM is up-regulated). Finally, the authors demonstrate PKA-CREB signalling mediating the effect of ADM addition, which also leads to up-regulation of GABAreceptors. Taken together, this is a very carefully done study on an important subject - how hypoxia affects cortical interneuron migration. In my view, the study is of great interest.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the study are the novelty and the thorough work using several culture methods and 4 independent lines.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness is that other genes regulated upon hypoxia are not confirmed, such that readers will not know until which fold change/stats cut-off data are reliable.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>The manuscript by Puno and colleagues investigates the impact of hypoxia on cortical interneuron migration and downstream signaling pathways. They establish two models to test hypoxia, cortical forebrain assembloids, and primary human fetal brain tissue. Both of these models provide a robust assay for interneuron migration. In addition, they find that ADM signaling mediates the migration deficits and rescue using exogenous ADM. The findings are novel and very interesting to the neurodevelopmental field, revealing new insights into how cortical interneurons migrate and as well, establishing exciting models for future studies. The authors use sufficient iPSC line,s including both XX and XY, so the analysis is robust. In addition, the RNAseq data with re-oxygenation is a nice control to see what genes are changed specifically due to hypoxia. Further, the overall level of validation of the sequencing data and involvement of ADM signaling is convincing, including the validation of ADM at the protein level. Overall, this is a very nice manuscript. I have a few comments and suggestions for the authors.</p>
<p>Strengths and Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Can the authors comment on the possibility of inflammatory response pathways being activated by hypoxia? Has this been shown before? While not the focus of the manuscript, it could be discussed in the Discussion as an interesting finding and potential involvement of other cells in the Hypoxic response.</p>
<p>(2) Could the authors comment on the mechanism at play here with respect to ADM and binding to RAMP2 receptors - is this a potential autocrine loop, or is the source of ADM from other cell types besides inhibitory neurons? Given the scRNA-seq data, what cell-to-cell mechanisms can be at play? Since different cells express ADM, there could be different mechanisms in place in ventral vs dorsal areas.</p>
<p>(3) For data from Figure 6 - while the ELISA assays are informative to determine which pathways (PKA, AKT, ERK) are active, there is no positive control to indicate these assays are &quot;working&quot; - therefore, if possible, western blot analysis from assembloid tissue could be used (perhaps using the same lysates from Figure 3) as an alternative to validate changes at the protein level (however, this might prove difficult); further to this, is P-CREB activated at the protein level using WB?</p>
<p>(4) Could the authors comment further on the mechanism and what biological pathways and potential events are downstream of ADM binding to RAMP2 in inhibitory neurons? What functional impact would this have linked to the CREB pathway proposed? While the link to GABA receptors is proposed, CREB has many targets beyond this.</p>
<p>(5) Does hypoxia cause any changes to inhibitory neurogenesis (earlier stages than migration?) - this might always be known, but was not discussed.</p>
<p>(6) In the Discussion section, it might be worth detailing to the readers what the functional impact of delayed/reduced migration of inhibitory neurons into the cortex might result in, in terms of functional consequences for neural circuit development.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to test whether hypoxia disrupts the migration of human cortical interneurons, a process long suspected to underlie brain injury in preterm infants but previously inaccessible for direct study. Using human forebrain assembloids and ex vivo developing brain tissue, they visualized and quantified interneuron migration under hypoxic conditions, identified molecular components of the response, and explored the effect of pharmacological intervention (specifically ADM) on restoring the migration deficits.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strength of this study lies in its use of human forebrain assembloids and ex vivo prenatal brain tissue, which provide a direct system to study interneuron migration under hypoxic conditions. The authors combine multiple approaches: long-term live imaging to directly visualize interneuron migration, bulk and single-cell transcriptomics to identify hypoxia-induced molecular responses, pharmacological rescue experiments with ADM to establish therapeutic potential, and mechanistic assays implicating the cAMP/PKA/pCREB pathway and GABA receptor expression in mediating the effect. Together, this rigorous and multifaceted strategy convincingly demonstrates that hypoxia disrupts interneuron migration and that ADM can restore this defect through defined molecular mechanisms.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors achieve their stated aims, and the results strongly support their conclusions. The work has a significant impact by providing the first direct evidence of hypoxia-induced interneuron migration deficits in the human context, while also nominating a candidate therapeutic avenue. Beyond the specific findings, the methodological platform - particularly the combination of assembloids and live imaging - will be broadly useful to the community for probing neurodevelopmental processes in health and disease.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness of the study lies in the extent to which forebrain assembloids recapitulate in vivo conditions, as the migration of interneurons from hSO to hCO does not fully reflect the native environment or migratory context of these cells. Nevertheless, this limitation is tempered by the fact that the work provides the first direct observation of human interneuron migration under hypoxia, representing a major advance for the field. In addition, while the transcriptomic analyses are valuable and highlight promising candidates, more in-depth exploration will be needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing neuronal migration and maturation under hypoxic conditions.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors should examine if all cortical interneurons are affected by ADM or only subtypes (Parvalbumin/Somatostatin).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important question. In our study, we utilized the Dlx1/2b::eGFP reporter to broadly label cortical interneurons; however, this system does not distinguish specific interneuron subtypes. To address this, in the revised version of the manuscript we will use the single-cell RNA sequencing data and immunostainings to provide this information. Based on previous analyses from Birey et al (Cell Stem Cell, 2022), we expect interneurons within assembloids to express mostly calbindin (CALB2) and somatostatin (SST) at this in vitro stage of development; parvalbumin subtype appears later based on data from Birey et al (Nature, 2017) and more recently from Varela et al, (bioRxiv, 2025).</p>
<p>In parallel, we will analyze available scRNA-seq data from developing human primary brain tissue a similar age as the one used in the manuscript, and check whether these subtypes of interneurons are similar to the ones within assembloids.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors should test more candidates from their bulk RNA-seq data with different fold changes for regulation after hypoxia, to allow the reader to judge at which cut-off the DEGs may be reproducible. This would make this database much more valuable for the field of hypoxia research.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewers’ thoughtful suggestion. In addition to the bulk RNA-seq analysis, we did validate several upregulated hypoxia-responsive genes with varying fold changes by qPCR; these include PDK1, PFKP, VEGFA (Figure S1).</p>
<p>We go agree that in-depth investigation of specific cut-offs would be interesting, however, this could be the focus of a different manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Can the authors comment on the possibility of inflammatory response pathways being activated by hypoxia? Has this been shown before? While not the focus of the manuscript, it could be discussed in the Discussion as an interesting finding and potential involvement of other cells in the Hypoxic response.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer this important comment about inflammation. Indeed, hypoxia has been shown to activate the inflammatory response pathways. In various studies, it was found that HIF-1a can interact with NF-κB signaling, leading to the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α (Rius et al., Cell, 2008; Hagberg et al., Nat Rev Neurol, 2015).</p>
<p>In our transcriptomics data (Figure 2D), and to the reviewers’ point, we identified enrichment of inflammatory signaling response following the hypoxic exposure. Since hSO at the time of analyses do contain astrocytes, we think these glia contribute to the observed pro-inflammatory changes. Based on these results and because ADM is known to have strong anti-inflammatory properties, the effects of ADM on hypoxic astrocytes should be investigated in future studies focused on hypoxia-induced inflammation. In the revision, we will address this comment in the discussion section and cite the appropriate papers.</p>

<p>(2) Could the authors comment on the mechanism at play here with respect to ADM and binding to RAMP2 receptors - is this a potential autocrine loop, or is the source of ADM from other cell types besides inhibitory neurons? Given the scRNA-seq data, what cell-to-cell mechanisms can be at play? Since different cells express ADM, there could be different mechanisms in place in ventral vs dorsal areas.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based on our scRNA-seq data in hSOs showing significant upregulation of ADM expression in astrocytes and progenitors, we speculate that the primary mechanism is likely to involve paracrine interactions. However, we cannot exclude autocrine mechanisms with the included experiments. Dissecting these interactions in a cell-type specific manner could be an important focus for future ADM-related studies.</p>
<p>To address the question about the possible different mechanisms in ventral versus dorsal areas, in the revision we will plot and include in the figures the data about the cell-type expression of ADM and its receptors in hCOs.</p>

<p>(3) For data from Figure 6 - while the ELISA assays are informative to determine which pathways (PKA, AKT, ERK) are active, there is no positive control to indicate these assays are &quot;working&quot; - therefore, if possible, western blot analysis from assembloid tissue could be used (perhaps using the same lysates from Figure 3) as an alternative to validate changes at the protein level (however, this might prove difficult); further to this, is P-CREB activated at the protein level using WB?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and the observation. Although we did not include a traditional positive control in these ELISA assays, several lines of evidence indicate that the measurements are reliable. First, the standard curves behaved as expected, and all sample values fell within the assay’s dynamic range. Second, technical replicates showed low variability, and the observed changes across experimental conditions (e.g., hypoxia vs. control) were consistent with the expected biological responses based on previous literature. We agree that including western blot validation would strengthen the findings, and we will note this for our future studies focused on CREB and ADM.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Could the authors comment further on the mechanism and what biological pathways and potential events are downstream of ADM binding to RAMP2 in inhibitory neurons? What functional impact would this have linked to the CREB pathway proposed? While the link to GABA receptors is proposed, CREB has many targets beyond this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewers’ insightful question. Currently, not much is known about the molecular pathways and downstream cellular events triggered by ADM binding to RAMP2 in inhibitory neurons, and in general in brain cells. The data from our study brings the first information about the cell-type specific expression of ADM in baseline and hypoxic conditions and is one of the key novelties of our study.</p>
<p>While the signaling landscape of ADM in interneurons is largely unexplored, several studies in other (non-brain) cell types have demonstrated that ADM binding to RAMP2 can activate downstream cascades such as the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway, PI3K/AKT, and ERK/MAPK, all of which are also known to be critical regulators of neuronal development and survival. These previously published data along with our CREB-targeted findings in hypoxic interneurons, suggest ADM–RAMP2 signaling could influence multiple aspects of interneuron biology, but these remain to be evaluated in future studies.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that CREB has a wide range of transcriptional targets. We decided to focus on GABA as a target of CREB for two main reasons, including: (i) GABA signaling has been previously shown to play an important role in the migration of cortical interneurons, and (ii) a previous study by Birey et al. (Cell Stem Cell, 2022) demonstrated that CREB pathway activity is essential for regulating interneuron migration in assembloid models of Timothy Syndrom, thus further providing evidence that dysregulation of CREB activity disrupts migration dynamics.</p>
<p>While our study provides a first step toward uncovering the mechanisms of interneuron migration protection by ADM, we fully acknowledge that future work will be needed to delineate the full spectrum of ADM–RAMP2 downstream signaling events in inhibitory neurons and other brain cells.</p>

<p>(5) Does hypoxia cause any changes to inhibitory neurogenesis (earlier stages than migration?) - this might always be known, but was not discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this question from the reviewer; however, this was not something that we focused on in this manuscript due to the already large amount of data included. A separate study focusing on neurogenesis defects and the molecular mechanisms of injury for that specific developmental process would be an important next step.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In the Discussion section, it might be worth detailing to the readers what the functional impact of delayed/reduced migration of inhibitory neurons into the cortex might result in, in terms of functional consequences for neural circuit development.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion of detailing the functional impact of reduced inhibitory neuron migration. We will revise the manuscript by incorporating a paragraph about this in the Discussion section.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Most of the evidence presented is convincing in supporting the conclusions, and I have only minor suggestions for improvement:</p>
<p>(1) The bulk RNA-seq was performed in hSOs only, which may not fully capture the phenotypes of migrating or migrated interneurons. It would be valuable, if feasible, to sort migrated cells from hSO-hCO assembloids and specifically examine their molecular mediators.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. While it is likely that the cellular environment will have some influence on a subset of the molecular changes, based on all the data from the manuscript and our specific target, the RNA-sequencing on hCOs was sufficient to capture essential changes like ADM upregulation. The in-depth exploration on differential responses of migrated versus non-migrated interneurons to hypoxia could be the focus of a different project.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 3, it is striking that cell-type heterogeneity dominates over hypoxia vs. control conditions. A joint embedding of hSO and hCO cells could provide further insight into molecular differences between migrated and non-migrated interneurons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this observation and opportunity to clarify. Since we manually separated the assembloids before the analyses, we processed these samples separately. That is why they separate like this. In the revision, we will add data about ADM expression and its receptors’ expression in the hCOs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It would be helpful to expand the discussion on how closely the migration observed in hSO-hCO assembloids reflects in vivo conditions, and what environmental aspects are absent from this model. This would better frame the interpretation and translational relevance of the findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for bringing up this important point. Although the assembloid model offers the unique advantage of allowing the direct investigation of migration patterns of hypoxic interneurons, we fully agree it does not fully recapitulate the in vivo environment. While there are multiple aspects that cannot be recapitulated in vitro at this time (e.g. cellular complexity, vasculature, immune response, etc), we are encouraged by the validation of our main findings in ex vivo developing human brain tissue, which strongly supports the validity of our findings for in vivo conditions.</p>
<p>We will expand our discussion to include more details and the need to validate these findings using in vivo models, while also acknowledging that different species (e.g. rodents versus non-human primates versus humans) might have different responses to hypoxia.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors suggest that hypoxia is also associated with delayed interneuron maturation, yet the bulk RNA-seq data primarily reveal stress and hypoxia-related genes. A more detailed discussion of why genes linked to interneuron maturation and function were not strongly affected would clarify this point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for the opportunity to clarify.</p>
<p>The RNAseq data was performed during the acute stages of hypoxia/reoxygenation and we think a maturation phenotype might be difficult to capture at this point and would require analysis at later in vitro assembloid maturation stages.</p>
<p>Our speculation about a possible maturation defect is based on data from previous studies from developmental biology that showed failure of interneurons to reach their final cortical location within a specified developmental window will impair their integration within the neuronal network, and thus lead to maturation defects and possible elimination by apoptosis.</p>
<p>Since preterm infants suffer from countless hypoxic events over multiple months, we suggest these repetitive events are likely to induce cumulative delays in migration, inability of interneurons to reach their target in time, followed by abnormal integration within the excitatory network, and eventual elimination of some of these interneurons through apoptosis. However, the direct demonstration of this effect following a hypoxic insult would require prolonged in vivo experiments in rodents to follow the migration, network integration and apoptosis of interneurons; to our knowledge this experimental design is not technically feasible at this time.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Relatedly, while the focus on interneuron migration is well justified, acknowledging how hypoxia might also impact other aspects of cortical development (e.g., progenitor proliferation, neuronal maturation, or circuit integration) would place the findings in a broader developmental framework and strengthen their relevance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s suggestion to discuss the role of hypoxia on other processes during cortical development. In the revised manuscript, we will include citations about the effects of hypoxia on interneuron proliferation, maturation and circuit integration as available, and also expand to other cell types known to be affected.</p>

<p>(6) Very minor: in Figure S3C and D, it was not stated what the colors mean (grey: control, yellow: hypoxia)</p>

<p>Thank you for pointing out this error and we will correct it in our revision.</p>
