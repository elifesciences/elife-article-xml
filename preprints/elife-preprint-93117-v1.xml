<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Here we investigated how the fate (folding versus degradation) of glycoproteins is determined in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Monoglucosylated glycoproteins are recognized by lectin chaperones to facilitate their folding, whereas glycoproteins with well-trimmed mannoses are subjected to glycoprotein ER-associated degradation (gpERAD). Previously we elucidated how mannoses are trimmed by EDEM family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">George et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">2021</xref> eLife). Though reglucosylation by UGGTs (UGGT1 and UGGT2) was reported to have no effect on substrate degradation, here, we directly test this using genetically disrupted UGGTs. Strikingly, the results showed that UGGTs (mainly UGGT1) delayed the degradation of misfolded substrates and unstable glycoproteins including ATF6α. An experiment with a point mutant of UGGT1 indicated that the glucosylation activity of UGGT was required for the inhibition of early glycoprotein degradation. We further demonstrated the physiological importance of UGGT, since ATF6 cannot function properly without UGGTs. The fate of glycoproteins is determined by a tug-of-war between structure formation by UGGTs and degradation by EDEMs. Thus, our work strongly suggests that UGGTs are central factors in ER protein quality control via regulation of both glycoprotein folding and degradation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an essential role in the cell as the site of biosynthesis of approximately one third of all proteins. Membrane and secretory proteins, after being newly synthesized on ribosomes attached to the ER membrane, are translocated to the ER in a translation-coupled manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brodsky and Skach, 2011</xref>). Post-translational modifications of proteins occurring in the ER include disulfide bond formation mediated by PDI (protein disulfide isomerase) family members and <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation of Asn in the consensus sequence consisting of Asn-X-Ser/Thr (X≠Pro). <italic>N</italic>-Glycan modifying a large number of proteins that enter the ER is converted from oligomannose type to complex type in the Golgi and is deeply involved in biological phenomena inside and outside the cell.</p>
<p>The structure of <italic>N</italic>-glycans plays a key role in protein folding and degradation in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ninagawa et al., 2020a</xref>). The <italic>N</italic>-glycan added to nascent proteins is composed of three glucoses, nine mannoses, and two <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamines (GlcNAc), and termed Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> (G3M9), which is processed to GM9 by the action of glucosidase I and glucosidase II. Calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) recognize glycoproteins with GM9 to facilitate productive folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lamriben et al., 2016</xref>) and then the last glucose is removed by glucosidase II. If glycoproteins with M9 attain their tertiary structure, they move on to the next compartment of the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ninagawa et al., 2020a</xref>). If the protein portion does not form a proper structure, UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferses (UGGTs: UGGT1 and UGGT2) re-add glucose to the glycoprotein (reglucosylation) for recognition by CNX/CRT to facilitate protein folding, collectively referred to as the “CNX/CRT” cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lamriben et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sun and Brodsky, 2019</xref>). UGGT1 promotes substrate solubility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ferris et al., 2013</xref>) and prefers proteins with exposed hydrophobic regions to folded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Caramelo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sousa and Parodi, 1995</xref>). UGGT1 has a homologue, UGGT2, whose glucosyltransferase activity is weaker than that of human UGGT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ito et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Takeda et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>If glycoproteins with M9 are not folded correctly within a certain period, mannose residues are trimmed from M9 first by EDEM2-S-S-TXNDC11 complex to M8B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">George et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ninagawa et al., 2014</xref>) and then by EDEM3/1 to M7A, M6 and M5 exposing α1,6-bonded mannose on the glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">George et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hirao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ninagawa et al., 2014</xref>), which are recognized by the OS9 or XTP3B lectins for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">van der Goot et al., 2018</xref>). They are recruited to the HRD1-SEL1L complex on the ER membrane, retrotranslocated back to the cytosol, and degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The series of these processes are collectively designated glycoprotein ER-associated degradation (gpERAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ninagawa et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Smith et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>However, how the fate of glycoprotein (folding versus degradation) is determined is not clearly understood, and remains one of the biggest issues in the field of ER protein quality control. One of the key enzymes for this appeared to be UGGTs. UGGTs have been shown to contribute to glycoprotein folding through its reglucosylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Helenius and Aebi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Pearse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sousa et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Tessier et al., 2000</xref>), but did not appear to be related to ERAD, because it was previously reported that the presence of one glucose in the A branch of <italic>N</italic>-glycans was not involved in timing for substrate degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tannous et al., 2015</xref>). MI8-5 Chinese hamster ovary cells are deficient in the dolichol-P-glucose–dependent glycosyltransferase termed Alg6, and therefore produce only glycoproteins with <italic>N</italic>-glycans lacking glucoses (M9). In these cells, <italic>N</italic>-glycans with one glucose are produced only by the action of UGGTs. In the experiment, the monoglucosylated state is maintained by treatment with the glucosidase inhibitor 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ). It was found that such trapping of glycoproteins in a monoglucosylated state did not affect their rate of disposal, while trapping of UGGT1 substrates for secretion in a monoglucosylated state with DNJ delayed their efflux from the ER. The degradation selection process seemed to progress in a dominant manner that was independent of glucosylation state of A-branch on the substrate glycans.</p>
<p>We consider that it has not been directly examined whether UGGTs-mediated reglucosylation of <italic>N</italic>-glycan is involved in degradation of glycoproteins in the ER. Here, we generated UGGT1-KO, UGGT2-KO and UGGT-double KO (DKO) cell lines to investigate this involvement. Unexpectedly, it was revealed that degradation of misfolded and unstable proteins was markedly accelerated in these KO cells. Our work thus dramatically demonstrates the importance of UGGTs in ER protein quality control via involvement in protein degradation as well as protein folding in the ER.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Generation of knockout cell lines of UGGTs</title>
<p>To explore the roles of UGGT1 and UGGT2 in ERAD, UGGT1-KO, UGGT2-KO and UGGT-DKO cell lines were generated in HCT116 diploid cells derived from human colonic carcinoma using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9. Gene disruptions of UGGT1 and UGGT2 were confirmed at the genome, mRNA and protein level (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A-K</xref>). The growth rate of the KO cell population was not significantly altered (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1L</xref>).</p>
<p>Previously, the protein level of UGGT2 was estimated to be 4% relative to that of UGGT1 in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adams et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Itzhak et al., 2016</xref>). In our hands, the protein expression levels of UGGT2 in HCT116 and HeLa cells were found to be approximately 6.9% and 29.8% of that of UGGT1, respectively, as estimated by transfection of UGGT1-Myc3 and UGGT2-Myc3 (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2A</xref>). Immunoblotting showed that ER stress marker proteins BiP, XBP1(S) and ATF4 were not induced in UGGT1-KO, UGGT2-KO or UGGT-DKO cells (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2B</xref>). Both UGGT1 and UGGT2 are modified with several <italic>N</italic>-glycans, as indicated by their sensitivity to treatment with EndoH, which cleaves oligomannose-type <italic>N</italic>-glycans localized in the ER (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>In UGGT1-KO and UGGT-DKO cells but not in UGGT2-KO cells, the secretion efficiency of α1-antitrypsin (A1AT) and erythropoietin (EPO) determined by pulse-chase experiments using <sup>35</sup>S was decreased (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2DE</xref>). In UGGTs-KO cells, maturation of hemagglutinin (HA) from oligomannose type to complex type was delayed, as reported previously (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hung et al., 2022</xref>). These results confirmed the establishment of KO cells for UGGTs and show the expected phenotype being involved in the maturation of nascent polypeptides.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Effect of UGGT1/2 knockout on ERAD</title>
<p>We then examined the effect of UGGT1/2 knockout on ERAD. We previously showed that ATF6α functions as a UPR sensor/transducer but is a somewhat unfolded protein that is constitutively subjected to gpERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Haze et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Horimoto et al., 2013</xref>). Degradation of ATF6α was blocked almost completely in SEL1L-KO and EDEM-TKO HCT116 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), as was seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Horimoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ninagawa et al., 2014</xref>); note that construction and characterization of SEL1L-KO cells were described in <xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 3</xref>. Strikingly, degradation of ATF6α was markedly accelerated in UGGT1-KO and UGGT-DKO cells but not in UGGT2-KO cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). These findings revealed for the first time that UGGTs are involved in not only folding but also ERAD. The fact that ATF6α was stabilized in UGGT-DKO cells treated with a mannosidase inhibitor, kifunensine, as in WT cells treated with kifunensine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), showed that the acceleration of ATF6α degradation required mannose trimming.</p>
<p>We then examined the effect of DNJ, an inhibitor of glucosidase I and II (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Stabilization of ATF6α in SEL1L-KO and EDEM-TKO cells was not affected by treatment with DNJ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). This is because SEL1L is required for retrotranslocation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), and because gpERAD requiring mannose trimming cannot work in EDEM-TKO cells, resulting in marked accumulation of M9 (<xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 4A</xref>); note that both retrotranslocation and mannose trimming are events downstream of glucose trimming (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The result obtained with EDEM-TKO cells indicates that ATF6α is still degraded via gpERAD requiring mannose trimming under the treatment with glucosidase inhibitor.</p>
<p>In contrast, degradation of ATF6α in WT cells was slightly delayed by treatment with DNJ, and accelerated degradation of ATF6α in UGGT-DKO cells was compromised by treatment with DNJ, so that the degradation rate of ATF6α became very similar in WT or UGGT-DKO cells after treatment with DNJ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). This implies the importance of glucose trimming-mediated production rate of M9 for efficient gpERAD. Indeed, the increase in the level of GM9 and the decrease in the level of M9 were observed in WT and UGGT-DKO cells treated with DNJ (<xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 4BC</xref>). Nonetheless, ATF6α was not stabilized completely in WT or UGGT-DKO cells treated with DNJ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), unlike in EDEM-TKO and SEL1L-KO cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We consider it likely that this is because mannose trimming still occurred in the absence of glucose trimming, as evidenced by the increased detection of GM8 in cells treated with DNJ (<xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 4BCD</xref>), leading to recognition of GM7 by OS9/XTP3B for retrotranslocation (Refer to <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). These results clearly showed that UGGT1 is actively involved in gpERAD of ATF6α; UGGT1-mediated reglucosylation reduces the probability of the mannose trimming that is prerequisite for gpERAD.</p>
<p>We next examined the effect of UGGT1/2 knockout on degradation of NHK, a soluble gpERAD substrate.

<title>UGGTs are required for the proper functioning of ATF6α</title>
<p>We finally investigated the physiological significance of preventing early degradation of substrates by UGGTs. Upon ER stress, a precursor form of ATF6α, designated ATF6α(P), is cleaved to the nucleus-localized form of ATF6α, designated ATF6α(N), to upregulate the ERSE and UPRE promoters, but not the ATF4 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Mori, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yoshida et al., 1998</xref>). Degradation of ATF6α(P) was accelerated in UGGT1-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), and accordingly the endogenous protein expression level of ATF6α(P) was decreased in UGGT1-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Whereas degradation rate of ATF6α(P) was not changed in UGGT2-deficient cells, expression level of ATF6α(P) was decreased by a small amount (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> p=0.06), suggesting that UGGT2 is also slightly involved in folding of ATF6α(P). The conversion from ATF6α(P) to ATF6α(N) is a marker for its activation. The amount of ATF6α(N) was decreased in UGGTs-KO at 1 hour after the treatment of thapsigargin (Tg), an inhibitor of the ER calcium pump (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4BCD</xref>). In addition, peak of activation was shifted from 1 hour to 4 hour after the treatment of Tg in UGGT1-KO cells. This can be explained by the rigid structure of ATF6α(P) lacking structural flexibility to respond to ER stress because the remaining ATF6α(P) in UGGT1-KO cells tends to have a more rigid structure that averts degradation, which is supported by its slightly weaker sensitivity to trypsin (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Then, we examined the effects of UGGTs on the activation level of ATF6α. In WT cells, the activity of ERSE and UPRE was upregulated 4.8 and 12.1-fold by Tg, respectively, an effect that was abolished in ATF6α-KO cells. In UGGTs-KO cells, the level of induction of the ERSE and UPRE reporters decreased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4EF</xref>), but the reporter activity of ATF4 upon Tg treatment did not decrease in UGGTs-KO cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). These results clearly show that UGGT1 and UGGT2 are required for proper functioning of ATF6α.</p>

<p>Our results show that UGGTs contribute significantly to the timing of substrate degradation. Previously, in higher animals, the activity of UGGTs was thought to contribute to glycoprotein folding and secretion but not to glycoprotein degradation, based on experiments using a glucosidase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tannous et al., 2015</xref>). The reason why the degradation rate was not changed significantly by DNJ can be explained by the activity of UGGTs and the efficiency of mannose trimming. In WT cells, UGGTs prevent early degradation by adding a glucose to facilitate further folding but mannose trimming occurs normally to promote degradation. In the presence of DNJ, the glycan-dependent folding pathway cannot work well to prevent early degradation, but mannose trimming does not occur at the normal rate due to a glucose residue on the A chain. Consequently, substrates in cells with DNJ treatment are degraded at approximately the same rate as ones in cells without DNJ. This is supported by our findings that there were no marked differences between WT and WT + DNJ, and UGGT-DKO + DNJ in the degradation of ATF6α (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). In our experiments, we were able to evaluate the more direct effect of glucose reattachment by UGGTs on ERAD substrates and we found that UGGTs prevent early degradation of substrates.</p>

<caption><title>Model of behavior of glycoproteins in the ER</title><p>(A). In WT cells, glycoproteins with M9 or M8 are recognized by UGGTs to produce GM9 or GM8 to promote their folding by CNX or CRT, or by EDEMs to trim mannoses of <italic>N</italic>-glycan to expose the α1,6-bond of <italic>N</italic>-glycan in the C chain for gpERAD. Glycoproteins are caught in a tug-of-war between the fate of structure formation by UGGTs and degradation by EDEMs. (B). In WT cells with DNJ, glycoproteins are degraded by EDEMs-mediated gpERAD despite inefficiency of mannose trimming due to the presence of glucoses at A chain. (C). In UGGT-DKO cells, glycoproteins are subjected to premature degradation by EDEMs-mediated gpERAD. (D). In UGGT-DKO cells with DNJ, the almost the same situation as in (B) exists. (E–F). In EDEM-TKO cells, glycoproteins are not degraded via gpERAD.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="562958v1_fig5.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>This degradation-inhibitory effect of UGGTs, especially UGGT1, on early degradation was also observed for other model substrates in ERAD, such as NHK, CD3-δ-ΔTM, CD3-δ-ΔTM-&lt;33-7aa-34&gt;, EMC1-ΔPQQ and RI332, but not for native, stable glycoproteins, such as Ribophorin I, EMC1, Grp170 and Sil1. Glycoproteins with stable conformational states do not require UGGTs, but to unstable, unassembled, conformationally abnormal and severely misfolded proteins, UGGTs give opportunities for proper folding by CNX/CRT, inhibiting their early degradation in the ER. Therefore, we conclude that the capability of reglucosylation has a huge impact on determining the timing of substrate degradation, and UGGTs usually act to prevent early degradation. Given the delayed substrate degradation in the KO of EDEMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">George et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Leto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ninagawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ninagawa et al., 2014</xref>), it is further concluded that UGGTs play a “tug-of-war” with EDEMs regarding the fate of glycoproteins: whether to give them a chance to fold, or to degrade them (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
<p>How many glycoproteins undergo glucose re-addition by UGGTs and how many times those glycoproteins have experienced the CNX/CRT cycle is a subject for future work. Our findings strongly suggest that UGGTs are not just a CNX/CRT safety net, but should be a central component in the <italic>N</italic>-glycan-dependent folding pathway competing with the EDEMs-mediated degradation pathway.</p>

The intensity of the lower left band in each panel is set to 1.00, and relative intensities are shown below. Anti-Myc antibody was used to estimate the ratio of the amounts of UGGT1-Myc3 and UGGT2-Myc3. Anti-UGGT1 antibody was used to estimate that of endogenous UGGT1 and UGGT1-Myc3. Anti-UGGT2 antibody was used to estimate that of endogenous UGGT2 and UGGT2-Myc3. These values can be used to calculate the relative amounts of endogenous UGGT1 and UGGT2.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> manuscript demonstrates that the glycosyltransferase UGGT slows the degradation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation substrates through a mechanism involving re-glucosylation of asparagine-linked glycans following release from the calnexin/calreticulin lectins. The evidence supporting this conclusion is <bold>solid</bold> using genetically-deficient cell models and biochemical methods to monitor the degradation of trafficking-incompetent ER-associated degradation substrates, although the manuscript could be improved through additional studies directed towards defining potential functional differences between UGGT1 and UGGT2 and additional insights into the impact of UGGT on the nature of substrate glycosylation within the ER. This work will be of specific interest to those interested in mechanistic aspects of ER protein quality control and protein secretion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
UGGTs are involved in the prevention of premature degradation for misfolded glycoproteins, by utilizing UGGT-KO cells and a number of different ERAD substrates. They proposed a concept by which the fate of glycoproteins can be determined by a tug-of-war between UGGTs and EDEMs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors provided a wealth of data to indicate that UGGT1 competes with EDEMs, which promotes glycoprotein degradation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Less clear, though, is the involvement of UGGT2 in the process. Also, to this reviewer, some data do not necessarily support the conclusion.</p>
<p>Major criticisms:</p>
<p>1. One of the biggest problems I had on reading through this manuscript is that, while the authors appeared to generate UGGTs-KO cells from HCT116 and HeLa cells, it was not clearly indicated which cell line was used for each experiment. I assume that it was HCT116 cells in most cases, but I did not see that it was clearly mentioned. As the expression level of UGGT2 relative to UGGT1 is quite different between the two cell lines, it would be critical to know which cells were used for each experiment.</p>
<p>2. While most of the authors' conclusion is sound, some claims, to this reviewer, were not fully supported by the data. Especially I cannot help being puzzled by the authors' claim about the involvement of UGGT2 in the ERAD process. In most of the cases, KO of UGGT2 does not seem to affect the stability of ERAD substrates (ex. Fig. 1C, 2A, 3D). When the author suggests that UGGT2 is also involved in the ERAD, it is far from convincing (ex. Fig. 2D/E). Especially because now it has been suggested that the main role of UGGT2 may be distinct from UGGT1, playing a role in lipid quality control (Hung, et al., PNAS 2022), it is imperative to provide convincing evidence if the authors want to claim the involvement of UGGT2 in a protein quality control system.</p>
<p>In fact, it was not clear at all whether even UGGT1 is also involved in the process in Fig. 2D/E, as the difference, if any, is so subtle. How the authors can be sure that this is significant enough? While the authors claim that the difference is statistically significant (n=3), this may end up with experimental artifacts. To say the least, I would urge the authors to try rescue experiments with UGGT1 or 2, to clarify that the defect in UGGT-DKO cells can be reversed. It may also be interesting to see that the subtle difference the authors observed is indeed N-glycan-dependent by testing a non-glycosylated version of the protein (just like NHK-QQQ mutants in Fig. 2C).</p>
<p>To this reviewer, it is still possible that the involvement of UGGT1 (or 2, if any) could be totally substrate-dependent, and the substrates used in Fig 2D or E happen not to be dependent to the action of UGGTs. To the reviewer, without the data of Fig. 2D and E the authors provide enough evidence to demonstrate the involvement of UGGT1 in preventing premature degradation of glycoprotein ERAD substrates. I am just afraid that the authors may have overinterpreted the data, as if the UGGTs are involved in stabilization of all glycoproteins destined for ERAD.</p>
<p>3. I am a bit puzzled by the DNJ treatment experiments. First, I do not see the detailed conditions of the DNJ treatment (concentration? Time?). Then, I was a bit surprised to see that there were so little G3M9 glycans formed, and there was about the same amount of G2M9 also formed (Figure 1 Figure supplement 4B-D), despite the fact that glucose trimming of newly syntheized glycoproteins are expected to be completely impaired (unless the authors used DNJ concentration which does not completely impair the trimming of the first Glc). Even considering the involvement of Golgi endo-alpha-mannosidase, a similar amount of G3M9 and G2M9 may suggest that the experimental conditions used for this experiment (i.e. concentration of DNJ, duration of treatment, etc) is not properly optimized.</p>

<p>In this study, Ninagawa et al., shed light on UGGT's role in ER quality control of glycoproteins. By utilizing UGGT1/UGGT2 DKO cells, they demonstrate that several model misfolded glycoproteins undergo early degradation. One such substrate is ATF6alpha where its premature degradation hampers the cell's ability to mount an ER stress response.</p>
<p>While this study convincingly demonstrates early degradation of misfolded glycoproteins in the absence of UGGTs, my major concern is the need for additional experiments to support the &quot;tug of war&quot; model involving UGGTs and EDEMs in influencing the substrate's fate - whether misfolded glycoproteins are pulled into the folding or degradation route. Specifically, it would be valuable to investigate how overexpression of UGGTs and EDEMs in WT cells affects the choice between folding and degradation for misfolded glycoproteins. Considering previous studies indicating that monoglucosylation influences glycoprotein solubility and stability, an essential question is: what is the nature of glycoproteins in UGGTKO/EDEMKO and potentially UGGT/EDEM overexpression cells? Understanding whether these substrates become more soluble/stable when GM9 versus mannose-only translation modification accumulates would provide valuable insights.</p>
<p>The study delves into the physiological role of UGGT, but is limited in scope, focusing solely on the effect of ATF6alpha in UGGT KO cells' stress response. It is crucial for the authors to investigate the broader impact of UGGT KO, including the assessment of basal ER proteotoxicity levels, examination of the general efflux of glycoproteins from ER, and the exploration of the physiological consequences due to UGGT KO. This broader perspective would be valuable for the wider audience. Additionally, the marked increase in ATF4 activity in UGGTKO requires discussion, which the authors currently omit.</p>
<p>The discussion section is brief and could benefit from being a separate section. It is advisable for the authors to explore and suggest other model systems or disease contexts to test UGGT's role in the future. This expansion would help the broader scientific community appreciate the potential applications and implications of this work beyond its current scope.</p>

<p>This manuscript focuses on defining the importance of UGGT1/2 in the process of protein degradation within the ER. The authors prepared cells lacking UGGT1, UGGT2, or both UGGT1/UGGT2 (DKO) HCT116 cells and then monitored the degradation of specific ERAD substrates. Initially, they focused on the ER stress sensor ATF6 and showed that loss of UGGT1 increased the degradation of this protein. This degradation was stabilized by deletion of ERAD-specific factors (e.g., SEL1L, EDEM) or treatment with mannose inhibitors such as kifunesine, indicating that this is mediated through a process involving increased mannose trimming of the ATF6 N-glycan. This increased degradation of ATF6 impaired the function of this ER stress sensor, as expected, reducing the activation of downstream reporters of ER stress-induced ATF6 activation. The authors extended this analysis to monitor the degradation of other well-established ERAD substrates including A1AT-NHK and CD3d, demonstrating similar increases in the degradation of destabilized, misfolding protein substrates in cells deficient in UGGT. Importantly, they did experiments to suggest that re-overexpression of wild-type, but not catalytically deficient, UGGT rescues the increased degradation observed in UGGT1 knockout cells. Further, they demonstrated the dependence of this sensitivity to UGGT depletion on N-glycans using ERAD substrates that lack any glycans. Ultimately, these results suggest a model whereby depletion of UGGT (especially UGGT1 which is the most expressed in these cells) increases degradation of ERAD substrates through a mechanism involving impaired re-glucosylation and subsequent re-entry into the calnexin/calreticulin folding pathway.</p>
<p>I must say that I was under the impression that the main conclusions of this paper (i.e., UGGT1 functions to slow the degradation of ERAD substrates by allowing re-entry into the lectin folding pathway) were well-established in the literature. However, I was not able to find papers explicitly demonstrating this point. Because of this, I do think that this manuscript is valuable, as it supports a previously assumed assertion of the role of UGGT in ER quality control. However, there are a number of issues in the manuscript that should be addressed.</p>
<p>Notably, the focus on well-established, trafficking-deficient ERAD substrates, while a traditional approach to studying these types of processes, limits our understanding of global ER quality control of proteins that are trafficked to downstream secretory environments where proteins can be degraded through multiple mechanisms. For example, in Figure 1-Figure Supplement 2, UGGT1/2 knockout does not seem to increase the degradation of secretion-competent proteins such as A1AT or EPO, instead appearing to stabilize these proteins against degradation. They do show reductions in secretion, but it isn't clear exactly how UGGT loss is impacting ER Quality Control of these more relevant types of ER-targeted secretory proteins.</p>
<p>Lastly, I don't understand the link between UGGT, ATF6 degradation, and ATF6 activation. I understand that the idea is that increased ATF6 degradation afforded by UGGT depletion will impair activation of this ER stress sensor, but if that is the case, how does UGGT2 depletion, which only minimally impacts ATF6 degradation (Fig. 1), impact activation to levels similar to the UGGT1 knockout (Fig 4)? This suggests UGGT1/2 may serve different functions beyond just regulating the degradation of this ER stress sensor. Also, the authors should quantify the impaired ATF6 processing shown in Fig 4B-D across multiple replicates.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I do think the data support a role for UGGT (especially UGGT1) in regulating the degradation of ERAD substrates, which provides experimental support for a role long-predicted in the field. However, there are a number of ways this manuscript could be strengthened to further support this role, some of which can be done with data they have in hand (e.g., the stats) or additional new experiments.</p>
