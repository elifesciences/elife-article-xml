<title>Abstract</title><p>The slow-intrinsic-pacemaker dopaminergic (DA) neurons originating in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are implicated in various mood- and emotion-related disorders, such as anxiety, fear, stress and depression. Abnormal activity of projection-specific VTA DA neurons is the key factor in the development of these disorders. Here, we describe the crucial role for the NALCN and TRPC6, non-selective cation channels in mediating the subthreshold inward depolarizing current and driving the firing of action potentials of VTA DA neurons in physiological condition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that down-regulation of TRPC6 protein expression in the VTA DA neurons likely contributes to the reduced activity of projection-specific VTA DA neuron in chronic mild unpredictable stress (CMUS) depressive mice. In consistent with these, selective knockdown of TRPC6 channels in the VTA DA neurons conferred mice with depression-like behavior. This current study suggests down-regulation of TRPC6 expression/function is involved in reduced VTA DA neuron firing and chronic stress-induced depression-like behavior of mice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play a key role in mood, reward and emotion-related behaviors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. These DA neurons project, through mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system, to brain regions including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), and modulate these target neuronal circuits through their regulated activity (firing of action potentials)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. As such, understandably, the altered functional activity of the VTA DA neurons is found to be the key determinants in abnormal behaviors related to the diseased conditions such as depression- or anxiety-related states[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Thus, the study on the mechanism underlying the firing activity of the VTA DA neurons is crucial for understanding the function of the DA circuitry and the pathogenesis of related mental diseases[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>The VTA DA neurons are slow intrinsic pacemakers, which are further modulated by synaptic inputs from multiple excitatory and inhibitory projections[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Firing activity controls the release of DA, thus function of the VTA DA neurons. The altered activity of the VTA DA neurons in a pathological state includes altered firing frequency and switch of the firing patterns[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>The research on the mechanism for spontaneous firing of action potential (AP) is the key to understand functional regulation of the VTA DA neurons. A variety of ion channels (e.g. voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels, high-threshold-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, Kv2, large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels, A- and M-type potassium channels) are reported to be involved in regulation of the spontaneous firing activity of midbrain DA neurons (including the substantia nigra pars compacta, SNc and VTA)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. However, it is not completely clear how this spontaneous firing is initiated. AP fires when the resting membrane potential (RMP) is depolarized to the activation threshold for the voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> channels, which results in opening of Na<sup>+</sup> channels and the upstroke of AP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Therefore, a controlled depolarization of the RMP to the activation threshold of AP is the first key step in a cascade leading to firing of AP. In the VTA DA neurons, the identity of ion channels contributing to this subthreshold depolarization has not been unambiguously established.</p>
<p>The hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-modulated (HCN1-4) channel gene family, one non-selective cation channels that would be activated at a hyperpolarized membrane potential[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], represent the molecular correlates of the pacemaker current in some cells with spontaneous firing of AP, such as If in cardiomyocytes and Ih in certain neurons including a subset of midbrain SNc DA neurons[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. However, in the VTA DA neurons, results concerning the HCN channels to the spontaneous firing are controversial[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Another non-selective cation channel, NALCN, unlike HCN, is a voltage-modulated channel[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], and is reported to be among the candidates for molecular correlates of the persistent background Na<sup>+</sup> leak currents in the VTA DA neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. The NALCN-mediated background Na<sup>+</sup> leak currents are found to be involved in modulation of firing activity in a variety of neurons including DA neurons in the SNc[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. However, it has not been reported if NALCN plays a role in spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons, although the VTA DA neurons have larger Na<sup>+</sup> leak currents than SNc DA neurons do[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>
<p>TRP channels are a large class of non-selective cation channels, and are widely distributed in the peripheral and central nervous system. TRPC3, which has a high homology with TRPC6[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], is found to be involved in the regulation of cardiac and SNc DA neuronal excitability, generating depolarizing currents, triggering action potentials and participating in cellular rhythmic firing[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].The role of TRP channels, except TRPC4[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], in the regulation of VTA DA neuronal excitability has not been described.</p>
<p>In this study, we strove to find channel conductance which contribute to the subthreshold depolarization and thus the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons. And furthermore, we investigated if these channels are the molecular mechanism for the altered function activity of the VTA DA neurons related to depression-like behaviors in mouse model of depression. We started by profiling the expression of non-selective cation channels (NSCCs) of the VTA DA neurons using method of Patch-Seq from midbrain DA neurons projecting to different brain regions, and then focused on HCN, NALCN, TRPC6 and TRPV2 channels which are dominantly expressed in these DA neurons.</p>

<title>Inflow of extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> contribute to the subthreshold depolarization of the VTA DA neurons</title>
<p>One key feature of the midbrain DA neurons is that these neurons are relatively depolarized in the resting condition; the resting membrane potential (RMP) is far from the K<sup>+</sup> equilibrium potential (â¼-55 mV <italic>vs</italic> â¼-90 mV)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], which enable the spontaneous firing. Thus, there must be persistent inward depolarizing conductance counterbalancing the hyperpolarizing K<sup>+</sup> conductance which otherwise would maintain the RMP at a hyperpolarized level. The main aim of this study is to identify the subthreshold depolarizing conductances which contribute to the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons. While we initially performed our experiments using male mice, most of the electrophysiological experiments and some Western blot experiments were also repeated using female mice, results of which were reported in the following results. We first observed firing frequency and the RMP of the VTA DA neurons using patch clamp recordings. The midbrain DA neurons, marked by dopamine transporter (DAT), mainly located in the VTA and SNc (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1Ai</xref>). We also performed single-cell PCR to identify the DA neurons with established markers for DA neurons (TH, DAT, D<sub>2</sub>R (type2 dopamine receptor), and GIRK2 (G protein-gated inward rectifier K inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels)). Although the majority of cells in the VTA area are DA neurons (â¼60%), there are still about 30% GABA neurons and a small number of glutamatergic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Glutamatergic- and GABAergic neurons were also single-cell PCR typed by using markers of VGluT2 (vesicular glutamate transporter 2) and GAD1 (glutamic acid decarboxylase 1), respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1Aii</xref>).</p>

<p>To focus on the intrinsic channel conductance for spontaneous firing, potential input modulation from fast-type transmitter transmission to the VTA DA neurons, namely activation of AMPA/kainite/NMDA receptor and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor were blocked by receptor antagonists CNQX, APV and picrotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], respectively, in the following experiments.</p>
<p>We first studied whether inflow of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> contributed to initiation of spontaneous firing in the VTA DA neurons. It has been shown that, unlike the SNc DA neurons, the VTA DA neurons do not have subthreshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillatory waves[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], suggesting that subthreshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> should not be an important component of subthreshold depolarizing conductance in the VTA DA neurons. In line with this finding, we found in our study, replacing Ca<sup>2+</sup> with Mg<sup>2+</sup> from the extracellular recording solution (ACSF, artificial cerebral spinal solution) did not reduce, but rather instead, increased the firing frequency of the VTA DA neurons in male and female mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, from 1.77 Â± 0.14 Hz to 2.24 Â± 0.18 Hz, n = 32, N = 16, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, W = 526.0, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Consistent with this, the RMP of the VTA DA neurons was not hyperpolarized by replacing Ca<sup>2+</sup> with Mg<sup>2+</sup> from ACSF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, from â50.62 Â± 0.62 mV to â49.49 Â± 0.87 mV, n = 25, N = 15, Paired-sample T test, t = 2.368, df = 24, 95% CI: 0.1454 to 2.119, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0263).</p>
<p>We then, in comparison with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, observed the role of extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> in the RMP of the VTA DA neurons. For this, we followed the method of a previous study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], by replacing Na<sup>+</sup> in ACSF with NMDG (N-methyl-d-glucamine); TTX (Tetrodotoxin) was also added to block the TTX-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> currents, which is known to be the main contributor to the suprathreshold depolarization component of the action potential. Replacement of the extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> with NMDG resulted in a hyperpolarization of the RMP in male and female mice (from â48.11 Â± 0.99 mV to â59.93 Â± 1.51mV, n = 17, N = 10, Paired-sample T test, t = 7.103, df = 16, 95% CI: â15.35 to â8.293, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), indicating a persistent inflow of Na<sup>+</sup> through a TTX-insensitive conductance which caused significant depolarization of the neurons, contributing significantly to the subthreshold depolarization of the VTA DA neurons.

<title>Potential candidates of channel conductance contributing to subthreshold depolarization of the VTA DA neurons</title>
<p>The channel conductance mediating the above-described persistent Na<sup>+</sup> influx should come from a cation channel(s) permeating to Na<sup>+</sup>. We thus investigated the presence and expression level of non-selective cation channels (NSCCs) in the VTA DA neurons using a combination of patch clamp and single-cell RNA-Seq (Patch-seq) technology[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. In this part of the study, we considered the heterogeneity and projection-specificity of the VTA DA neurons, i.e. VTA DA neurons projecting to different brain regions have different electrophysiological characteristics[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Using retrograde labelling techniques by retrobeads, sixty male VTA neurons projecting to five different brain regions (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC; basal lateral amygdala, BLA; nucleus accumbens core, NAc c; nucleus accumbens lateral shell, NAc ls; nucleus accumbens medial shell, NAc ms) (<bold>sFig.1</bold>) were collected for RNA-Seq, using patch-clamp electrodes. Consistent with previous study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], the VTA DA neurons projecting to above different brain regions were anatomically congregated into subregions of the VTA (<bold>sFig.2</bold>). The high expression of biomarkers (Tyrosine hydroxylase, TH; Dopamine decarboxylase, Ddc and Dopamine transporter, DAT) in the 45 cells of 60 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) indicates that these are DA neurons. In addition, fewer than half of sequenced DA neurons (predominantly those projecting to NAc ms, BLA, and mPFC) have biomarkers (Vesicular glutamate transporter, VGluT1-3) of glutamatergic neurons, predicting a possible coexistence of neurotransmitters (DA and glutamate)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>].In contrast, fewer GABAergic neuronal markers (Glutamic acid decarboxylase, GAD1/2 and vesicular GABA transporter, VGAT) co-expressed with the DA neurons, which is consistent with previous studies that VTA DA neurons which co-release GABA, contain low and even undetectable levels of GAD1, GAD2 and VGAT mRNA or protein[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. It needs to be noted that some neurons in the VTA only expressed markers for glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons, these neurons were excluded from further analysis as we focused our study on the DA neurons. Expression levels of NSCCs in the VTA DA neurons classified by projection specificity were analyzed and shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>. Different colored strips on the top of the figure corresponded to the projection specificity coded by the same colors in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>. Multiple transient receptor potential channels (TRP) were present in the VTA DA neurons, with prominent expression level of TRPC6 and TRPV2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Bi</xref>). Other prominently expressed NSCCs included HCN2, HCN3, NALCN and pannexin 1 (Panx1) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Bii</xref>). Summarized averaged relative expression levels for eight most richly expressed NSCCs were shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Biii</xref>. Furthermore, projection-specific expression of these dominantly expressed NSCCs were analyzed and shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>; interestingly only TRPC6 seemed expressed in a projection-specific manner, namely, the VTA DA neurons projecting to the NAc have higher TRPC6 expression than the VTA DA neurons projecting to the BLA and the mPFC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). In our subsequent study, we focused our study on HCN, NALCN, TRPC6 and TRPV2, one for they are the prominently expression channels, and two for some of these channels have been indicated in modulation of excitability of different neuron types[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Panx1 was investigated in a separate study since it normally composes the semi channels which are different from these more conventional ion channels.</p>

At a depolarized RMP like these in the VTA DA neurons (â51.28 Â± 1.85 mV, n = 8, N=8; e.g. â54.50 mV, <bold>sFig. 3Ai</bold>, and â53.50mV, <bold>sFig. 3Bi</bold>), HCN are most likely not activated thus would not participate in generation of spontaneous firing. To further prove this, we tested if a more hyperpolarized RMP would involve HCN in the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons. For this, we first lowered the K<sup>+</sup> concentration in the extracellular ACSF from 3 mM to 1.5 mM to increase the gradient between inside and outside cellular K<sup>+</sup>; this maneuver indeed hyperpolarized the cell membrane from â49.45 Â± 0.93 mV to â62.95 Â± 2.56 mV (n = 7, N = 7, Paired-sample T test, t = 6.373, df = 6, 95% CI: â18.69 to â8.318, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0007) (<bold>sFig. 4C</bold>). Interestingly, under 1.5 mM extracellular K<sup>+</sup>, the spontaneous firing of the male VTA DA neurons was almost totally blocked by ZD7288 (<bold>sFig. 4D</bold>), although an initial enhancement was seen in some neurons (<bold>sFig. 4Di</bold>).</p>
<p>We tested another possible mechanism for HCNâs failure to participate in generation of VTA DA firing. It has been reported that in the midbrain SNc DA neurons, HCN is involved in the spontaneous firing in young but not in adult mice, due to a more hyperpolarization-shifted activation threshold of HCN in SNc DA neurons in adult mice. We tested if this could also be the case in the VTA DA neurons. Indeed, as shown in <bold>sFig. 4E</bold>, in contrast to what we saw in adult male mice, the spontaneous firing frequency of the VTA DA neurons in young male mice (less than 15 days postnatal) was significantly reduced by ZD7288 (from 1.86 Â± 0.29 Hz to 0.98 Â± 0.24 Hz, n = 9, N = 5, Paired-sample T test, t = 3.345, df = 8, 95% CI: â1.487 to â0.2734, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0101).</p>
<p>Taken together, above results suggest HCN is not involved in the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons in adult male mice, due to a depolarized RMP and a hyperpolarization-shifted activation property.</p>

Both blockers significantly reduced the firing frequency of the VTA DA neurons (2-APB for male mice: from 1.32 Â± 0.27 Hz to 0.06 Â± 0.02 Hz, n = 12, N = 5, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, W = â78.0, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0005; LA for male and female mice: from 1.59 Â± 0.26 Hz to 0.55 Â± 0.15Hz, n = 14, N = 8, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, W = â105.0, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, 4C</xref>). Accordingly, both blockers also significantly hyperpolarized the RMP of the male and female VTA DA neurons (2-APB: from â49.97 Â± 1.29 mV to â59.27 Â± 1.22 mV, n = 10, N = 9, Paired-sample T test, t = 8.082, df = 9, 95% CI: â11.90 to â6.693, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; LA: from â53.41 Â± 0.81 mV to â57.82 Â± 1.13 mV, n = 9, N = 7, Paired-sample T test, t = 6.431, df = 8, 95% CI: â5.993 to â2.829, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0002; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D, 4E</xref><bold>).</bold></p>
<p>We then tested a more TRPV channel-selective blocker ruthenium red (RR), to study possible role of TRPV2 (and other TRPV) in the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons. RR (60 Î¼M), on average statistically, did not affect the spontaneous firing of the male VTA DA neurons (from 2.30 Â± 0.31 Hz to 2.18 Â± 0.31 Hz, n = 9, N = 6, Paired-sample T test, t = 0.4486, df = 8, 95% CI: â0.7621 to 0.5139, <italic>P</italic> = 0.6656) (<bold>sFig. 5</bold>). However, it needs to be noted that among the nine VTA DA neurons we tested, both increase (<bold>sFig. 5B</bold>) and decrease (<bold>sFig. 5C</bold>) of firing frequency by RR were seen, thus with opposite changes of firing frequency in different populations of neurons (<bold>sFig. 5A</bold>), no overall effect of RR was obtained from the current analysis.</p>

<p>We then focused our next study on TRPC6. Consistent with both RNA-Seq (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) and single-cell PCR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) results, the mRNA level of TRPC6 in mPFC-projecting VTA single DA neuron is significantly lower than that in NAc c-projecting VTA single DA neuron (0.56 Â± 0.12, n = 25, N = 8 for mPFC-projecting TH-positive cells <italic>vs</italic> 1.09 Â± 0.10, n = 28, N = 7 for NAc c-projecting TH-positive cells, Mann-Whitney U test, U = 173, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0013, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) The immunofluorescence results also demonstrated strong expression of TRPC6 protein in the VTA DA neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, TH-positive). A AAV viral construct with shRNA against TRPC6 (AAV9-U6-shRNA(TRPC6)-CMV-GFP) was injected into the VTA of mice, to knockdown TRPC6; efficiency of this knockdown was assessed by using qPCR measuring the mRNA level of TRPC6 in the VTA tissue (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), and efficiency of viral infection into the VTA DA neurons (marked by DAT) was observed through visualization of GFP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Both qPCR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5C</xref>) and immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>) results indicated a sufficient repression of TRPC6 in the VTA DA neurons. Indicative of a significant role in the spontaneous firing and subthreshold depolarization, knockdown of TRPC6 (TRPC6-KD) resulted in a substantial reduction in the spontaneous firing frequency (0.43 Â± 0.07 Hz, n = 37, N = 12 for TRPC6-KD <italic>vs</italic> 1.88 Â± 0.16 Hz, n = 27, N = 11 for scramble-shRNA, Mann-Whitney U test, U = 48, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001,for male and female mice, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>), and hyperpolarization of the RMP (â58.32 Â± 1.77 mV, n = 10, N = 6 for TRPC6-KD <italic>vs</italic> â50.24 Â± 0.65 mV, n = 10, N = 6 scramble-shRNA, Mann-Whitney U test, U = 8, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0007, for male mice, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>) of the VTA DA neurons. In addition, the inhibitory effect of 2-APB and LA on the firing of VTA DA neurons infected with TRPC6-shRNA largely diminished, with no statistical difference in firing frequency before and after dosing (2-APB: from 0.58 Â± 0.15 Hz to 0.40 Â± 0.15 Hz, n = 7, N = 5, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, W = â18.00, <italic>P</italic> = 0.1563, for male mice, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>; LA: from 0.43 Â± 0.05 Hz to 0.43 Â± 0.06 Hz, n = 8, N = 5, Paired-sample T test, t = 0.000, df = 7, 95% CI:-0.05740 to 0.05740, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.9999, for male mice, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>).</p>
<p>Consequence of knocking down TRPC6 described above should not be a result of a secondary effect on other TRPC channels with which TRPC6 is known to interact to form heteromers, such as TRPC4 and TRPC7[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>], since in experiments using single cell PCR (<bold>sFig. 6A</bold>), it was found only a very small proportion of TRPC6-positive DA cells (TRPC6<sup>+</sup>DAT<sup>+</sup>) expressed TRPC4 (<bold>sFig. 6Bi</bold>) or TRPC7 (<bold>sFig. 6Bii</bold>), in consistent with the results of single-cell RNA-seq results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Taken together, above results indicate TRPC6 is an important contributor in subthreshold depolarization and spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons.</p>

<p>It has been shown that a reduced firing activity in the VTA DA neurons is responsible for the chronic-stress-induced depression-like behavior in the CMUS model[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. Consistent with this finding, we also found the firing frequency of the VTA DA neurons from the CMUS male and female mice was significantly reduced as compared with that from the control male and female mice (2.90 Â± 0.17 Hz, n = 53, N = 31 for control mice <italic>vs</italic> 1.24 Â± 0.08 Hz, n = 68, N = 33 for CMUS mice, Mann-Whitney U test, U = 415, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). In agreement with a role for TRPC6 in this reduced firing activity, TRPC6 protein in the VTA tissue of male and female CMUS mice was found to be down-regulated in western blot experiments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). On the other hand, NALCN protein in the VTA was not altered in the CMUS male mice model of depression (<bold>sFig. 9</bold>).</p>
<p>We also tested if this down-regulation of TRPC6 protein could also be found in a similar but different model of depression. For this, a chronic restraint stress (CRS) model was used. After 3 weeks of restraint stress stimulation, the CRS male mice developed similar depression/anxiety-like behavior in the behavior tests like these similarly performed in the CMUS model (<bold>sFig. 10A-I</bold>). Importantly, male mice with CRS-induced depression also showed a significant downregulation of TRPC6 protein in the VTA (0.38 Â± 0.06 fold, N = 10 for control and N = 14 for CRS, Two-sample T test, t = 7.369, df = 22, 95% CI: â0.8006 to â0.4489, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <bold>sFig. 10J</bold>).</p>
<p>It is known that the activity of VTA dopamine neurons that project to mPFC is decreased in CMUS mice with depressive behaviors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Assuming that the decreased firing activity of the mPFC-projecting VTA DA neurons in the CMUS mice was associated with the down-regulation of TRPC6 expression, we reasoned that the firing activity in these CMUS mice would respond less to the TRP channel inhibitors. Indeed, TRP channel inhibitor 2-APB and TRPC6 inhibitor LA decreased their inhibitory effect on the firing activity of the mPFC-projecting VTA DA neurons from the CMUS male and female mice (2-APB:1.56 Â± 0.15Hz to 1.19 Â± 0.14 Hz, n = 25, N = 15, Kruskal-Wallis test, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.9999; LA: 1.12 Â± 0.11Hz to 0.83 Â± 0.08 Hz, n = 30, N = 18, Kruskal-Wallis test, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.9999) compared with these from the control mice (2-APB: 3.35 Â± 0.29 Hz to 0.17 Â± 0.08 Hz, n = 22, N = 15, Kruskal-Wallis test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; LA: 2.97 Â± 0.16 Hz to 0.17 Â± 0.08 Hz, n = 25, N = 16, Kruskal-Wallis test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">F</xref>).</p>

<title>Down-regulation of TRPC6 in the VTA DA neurons confer the mice with depression-like behavior</title>
<p>If down-regulation of TRPC6 is crucial for the depression-like behaviors, like that indicated above in the CMUS and the CRS depression models, the down regulation of TRPC6 in non-stressfully treated mice should also develop depression-like behavior. We tested this possibility by selectively knocking down TRPC6 in the VTA DA neurons, using DAT-Cre male mice injected with a AAV viral construct (AAV9-hSyn-DIO-shRNA (TRPC6) -RFP) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>), driving the expression of shRNA against TRPC6 selectively in the VTA DA neurons. Three weeks after the AAV injection, the qPCR (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>) and the immunofluorescence results (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>) indicated an efficient down-regulation of TRPC6 in the VTA DA neurons.</p>
<p>We next compared the depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in these conditionally TRPC6-knockdown male mice (TRPC-cKD) with that in the control mice (infected with virus carrying the scrambled shRNA). As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>, in the TRPC6-cKD male mice, the sucrose preference was significantly reduced (7Di, 74.52 Â± 2.00 %, N = 10 for TRPC6-cKD, <italic>vs</italic> 85.87 Â± 1.85 %, N = 10 for control, Two-sample T test, t = 4.172, df = 18, 95% CI: â17.07 to â5.634, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0006), the immobility time in the Tail suspension test was significantly lengthened (7Dii, 142.00 Â± 4.66 s <italic>vs</italic> 121.40 Â± 3.94 s, Two-sample T test, t = 3.377, df = 18, 95% CI: 7.785 to 33.41, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0034). In the elevated plus maze test, the percentage of time spent in the open arm was significantly reduced (7Diii, 1.60 Â± 0.50 % <italic>vs</italic> 11.42 Â± 2.04 %, Mann-Whitney U test, U = 2, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and the percentage of time spent in the closed arm was also significantly increased (7Div). And the Cre-dependent TRPC6-overexpression in male VTA DAT-Cre mice (TRPC6-cOE) rescued the selective-TRPC6-knockdown-induced depression-like behaviors (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E-H</xref>). Furthermore, selectively knockdown of TRPC6 in the mPFC-projecting VTA DA neurons (virus-retro carrying DIO-TRPC6-shRNA (TRPC6-rcKD) was injected into the mPFC of DAT-Cre male mice) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A-C</xref>) also conferred the mice with the depression- and anxiety-like behaviors (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest down-regulation of TRPC6 in the VTA DA neurons promotes the phenotypes of depression/anxiety of the mice in the CMUS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we made a systematic study on the molecular mechanism for the subthreshold depolarization that drive spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons. We identified TRPC6 channels, alongside NALCN, as major contributors to this subthreshold depolarization and related spontaneous firing, and further importantly, we also demonstrated that TRPC6 contributed to the altered firing activity of the VTA DA neurons under states of chronic-stress-induced depression-like behaviors.</p>
<p>The nature of a relatively depolarized resting membrane potential in the VTA DA neurons imposes a need for a full understanding of the channel conductance underlying this depolarization. It is first clear from these current and previous studies that this conductance is mediated by a persistent Na<sup>+</sup> influx. Unlike the DA neurons in the SNc, where Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is needed for the spontaneous firing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>], the results in our and othersâ studies indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx are not necessary for the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons. Replacement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions in the extracellular fluid with Mg<sup>2+</sup> accelerates the frequency of spontaneous firing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], possibly resulting from a reduced activity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents and an increased activity of NALCN[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Consistent with this, removing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not hyperpolarize the RMP, which verifies more precisely for a role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx on the subthreshold depolarization. On the other hand, consistent the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], a TTX-insensitive Na<sup>+</sup> influx clearly contributed to the subthreshold depolarization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>A TTX-insensitive nature of this Na<sup>+</sup> conductance suggests that cation conductance permeable to Na<sup>+</sup> might be the molecular candidates. We first focused on the HCN channels because, (1) it has been suggested HCN channels are important regulators for the spontaneous firing of VTA DA neurons in adult male mice under states of depression-like behaviors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]; (2) HCN are one of the more highly expressed NSCCs in the VTA DA neurons in our single cell RNA-Seq study; (3) HCN are permeable to Na<sup>+</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. However, it is clear from our study that HCN does not contribute to the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons in the adult male mice; none of the known HCN blockers we used had any significant effects on the firing activity. Presence of HCN has long been used as a signature of DA neurons[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>], also as a differentiating factor for the projection-specificity of the VTA DA neurons[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Nonetheless, contribution of HCN to the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons has been controversial; the HCN blockers ZD7288 and CsCl have been reported as both effective[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] and non-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] on the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons. A closer inspection into our and othersâ results present a possible explanation for these different results: in the younger rodents (less than one month old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>] and less than 15 days old in our study), the HCN in the DA neurons play a more important role whereas in the adult mice (â¼ 8 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]), like the male adult ones (6â¼8 weeks) we used in this study, the HCN do not contribute to the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons. This is likely due to a shift of activation gating of HCN channels in a hyperpolarization direction with age, thus the modulation of HCN on the firing activity diminishes with age, as it is described in the SNc DA neurons[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. Consistent with this, we found hyperpolarizing the RMP rendered the VTA DA neurons of the adult male mice with sensitivity to the HCN blockers. Thus, the VTA DA neurons in adult male mice do not use HCN to depolarize the membrane to generate action potentials.</p>
<p>NALCN is widely expressed in central neurons[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>], and is a popular candidate considered for the ion mechanism of the subthreshold depolarization currents and Na<sup>+</sup> leaky currents. NALCN has been shown to be an important component of background Na<sup>+</sup> currents and to be important for neuronal excitability in the hippocampal neurons, posterior rhomboid nucleus (Retrotrapezoid nucleus/RTN) chemo-sensitive neurons (CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-sensitive neurons), GABA neurons and DA neurons in the substantia nigra, and spinal projection neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Our results with single cell RNA-Seq, single-cell PCR and immunofluorescence methods validated high level expression of NALCN in the VTA DA neurons; both the pharmacological and the NALCN-gene-knockout experiments demonstrated convincingly involvement of NALCN in subthreshold depolarization and spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons.</p>
<p>We did not detect alteration of NALCN protein expression in the depression model of CMUS in the VTA tissue. However, this does not completely exclude a possible contribution of NALCN to the altered functional activity of the VTA DA neurons which underlies the chronic-stress-induced depression-like behaviors. Future study focusing on the functional property of NALCN in the cellular level of the VTA DA neurons under a state of depression is needed to clarify this issue. NALCN is after all a potential drug target in consideration of its important contribution to the resting membrane potential and functional activity of neurons.</p>
<p>The most interesting and important finding of this study is the role of TRPC6 in regulation of the firing activity of the VTA DA neurons in both physiological and depression-state conditions, and its involvement in depression-like behaviors; the experimental evidence from pharmacological, gene silencing, electrophysiological and behavior results unambiguously support this conclusion. It is interesting to note, although with an unclear neuronal circuit mechanism of action, the TRPC6 channel opener hyperforin was previously reported to have antidepressant effects in corticosterone-depressed mice, which were reversed by prior administration of the TRPC6 blocker larixyl acetate[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. Also, in a CMUS rat model, TRPC6 expression was found to be downregulated in the hippocampus, and administration of the TRPC6 opener hyperforin was effective in alleviating depression-like behavior[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Our study provides strong and convincing evidence that TRPC6 is a key regulator of the VTA DA neurons which are known to be a key player in depression states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>].</p>
<p>The above-mentioned role for TRPC6 should come from its contribution to the subthreshold depolarization, through a persistent permeation to the influx of Na<sup>+</sup>. Although TRPC channels has been better recognized for their permeability to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and their regulation on cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, the importance of TRPC channels for the permeability of monovalent cations, especially Na<sup>+</sup>, is now gradually being appreciated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. In the substantial nigra GABA and DA neurons, TRPC3 has been reported to play an important role in maintaining depolarization membrane potential, peacemaking, and firing regularity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Otherwise, it has been reported that slow tonic firing of SNc DA neurons, depends on the basal activity of both the NALCN and TRPC3 channels, but that burst firing does not require TRPC3 channels but relies only on NALCN channels[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. TRPC6 and TRPC3 belong to the same TRPC family subclass and TRPC6 is more than 75% homologous to TRPC3[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Interestingly, our results with single-cell RNA-Seq and single-cell PCR demonstrated the rich expression of TRPC6 in the VTA DA neurons among all TRP channels but no expression of TRPC3 was found in these neurons. These results present an opportunity for selectively targeting a single TRPC channel to exert selective pharmacological results. Besides, TRPC4 expression was detected in a uniformly distributed subset of rat VTA DA neurons[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], which differs with our results with single-cell RNA-Seq and single-cell PCR, and TRPC4 KO rats showed decreased VTA DA neuron tonic firing and deficits in cocaine reward and social behaviors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>].TRPC4 is detected to be expressed with a low level in the VTA DA neurons of male mice by single-cell RNA-Seq (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>) and in TRPC6 and DAT double-positive VTA cells by single-cell PCR (s<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6</xref>).The different species used in this and our study may be one explanation, but the role of TRPC4 in the excitability of mice VTA TRPC6-negative DA neurons is worth to investigating further.</p>
<p>It has also been demonstrated in cell types other than neurons, such as rat portal vein smooth muscle cells, the activation of Î±-adrenergic receptor can open TRPC6, which leads to cell depolarization, activation of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and ultimately the contraction of smooth muscle cell[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]; it is also shown that angiotensin II and endothelin I can activate TRPC3/C6 heterodimers via vascular G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), thereby depolarizing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]. Following this line, it would be very interesting to know if TRPC6 in the VTA DA neurons, where multiple GPCR reside receiving input and auto modulation by neuronal transmitters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>], could also be a target of modulation with similar mechanism. In consideration of the important role, we described here in this study, this type of modulation will present possible explanations for some unsolved mechanism for physiological and pathophysiological functions of the VTA DA neurons.</p>
<p>The facts that down-regulation of TRPC6 proteins was correlated with reduced firing activity of the VTA DA neurons as well as the chronic-stress-induced depression-like behaviors of mice with both sexes, and that knocking down of TRPC6 in the VTA DA neurons confers the male mice with depression-like behaviors strongly suggest a crucial role for TRPC6 in the development of chronic-stress-induced depression-like behaviors under stressful conditions like CMUS. To reinforce this, down-regulation of TRPC6 was also found in another chronic-stress-induced depression model of CRS, a model with similar neuronal alteration of reduced firing activity in the VTA DA neurons to that described in the CMUS model[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. These facts with the fact that TRPC6 activator hyperforin is an effective antidepressant in multiple depression models[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>], and that hyperforin is the principal component of St. Johnâs wort, a well-known antidepressant herb[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>], present TRPC6 as a very attractive drug target for new lines of antidepressants.</p>

<title>Single cell RT-qPCR</title>
<p>Following the retrograde labelling and VTA brain slice preparation, projection-specific VTA neurons were identified by infrared-differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) video microscopy and epifluorescence (Olympus, Japan) for detection of retrobeads (red) positive neurons. mRNA was reversely transcribed to cDNA by PrimeScript<sup>TM</sup> â¡ 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara-Clontech, Kyoto, Japan). The projection-specific neuron was aspirated into a pipette and then expelled into a PCR sterile tube containing 1 Âµl oligo-dT Primer and 1 Âµl dNTP mixture. The mixture was heated to 65Â°C for 5 min to denature the nucleic acids and then cooled on ice for 2 min. Reverse transcription from mRNA into cDNA was performed at 50Â°C for 50 min and then 85Â°C for 5 min. cDNA was stored at â40Â°C. The targeted pre-amplification was done, with pairs of targeted primers for GAPDH, TH and TRPC6, to quantify multiple targets per cell. After adding the targeted primer pairs into each PCR tube, the synthesis conditions were as follows: 95 Â°C (5 min); 10 cycles of 95 Â°C (50 s), 58-62 Â°C (50 s), 72 Â°C (50 s); 72 Â°C (5 min). After targeted pre-amplification, quantitative PCR (qPCR) is the final laboratory step of the scRT-qPCR workflow with the TB GreenÂ® Premix Ex Taqâ¢ II (Tli RNaseH Plus) (TaKaRa).</p>

<title>Sucrose preference test</title>
<p>Mice were single-housed and trained to drink from two drinking bottles with 1 bottle of tap water and 1 bottle of 1.0 % sucrose water, for 48 hours, and the positions of the drinking bottles were exchanged every 12 h to exclude the interference of position preference. After the training, the mice were deprived of food and water for 12 h, and then the sucrose preference test was performed for 24 h. One bottle of tap water and one bottle of 1.0 % sucrose water were given again, and the positions of the drinking bottles were exchanged at 12 h. Finally, the consumption of tap water and sugar water at 24 h were recorded to calculate the sucrose solution preference rate. Sucrose preference rate (%) = sucrose solution consumption/(tap water consumption + sucrose solution consumption)*100%.</p>

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>Software such as GraphPad Prism6, OriginPro 8.0 (Origin Lab) and Adobe Illustrator CS6 were used for data analysis and image processing. All experimental data were expressed as mean Â± standard error (mean Â± S.E.M.). When the data were normally distributed, the difference between two groups was statistically analyzed by two-sample T-test or paired-sample T-test; when the data were not normally distributed, the difference between two groups was statistically analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. <italic>P</italic>&lt; 0.05 was considered as a statistically significant difference between two groups. For the data between multiple groups, when the data were normally distributed and there was no significant variance inhomogeneity, one-way ANOVA with Dunnettâs multiple comparisons test or two-way ANOVA with Sidakâs multiple comparisons test was used; when the data were not normally distributed, Kruslal-Wallis-H test with Dunnettâs multiple comparisons test was used.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study examined the mechanisms underlying reduced excitability of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons in mice that underwent a chronic mild unpredictable stress treatment. The authors identify NALCN and TRPC6 channels as key mechanisms that regulate spontaneous firing of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons and examined their roles in reduced firing in mice that underwent a chronic mild unpredictable stress treatment. The authors' conclusions on neurophysiological data are supported by multiple approaches and are <bold>convincing</bold>, although the relevance of the behavioral results to human depression remains unclear.</p>

<p>The authors of this study have examined which cation channels specifically confer to ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurones their autonomic (spontaneous) firing properties. Having brought evidence for the key role played by NALCN and TRPC6 channels therein, the authors aimed at measuring whether these channels play some role in so-called depression-like (but see below) behaviors triggered by chronic exposure to different stressors. Following evidence for a down-regulation of TRPC6 protein expression in ventral tegmental area dopaminergic cells of stressed animals, the authors provide evidence through viral expression protocols for a causal link between such a down-regulation and so-called depression-like behaviors. The main strength of this study lies on a comprehensive bottom-up approach ranging from patch-clamp recordings to behavioral tasks. These tasks mainly address anxiety-like behaviors and so-called depression-like behaviors (sucrose choice, forced swim test, tail suspension test). The results gathered by means of these procedures are clearcut.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Comment 1: One of the only demonstrations of the expression and physiological significance of TRPCs in VTA DA neurons was published by (Rasmus et al., 2011; Klipec et al., 2016) which are not cited in this paper. In their study, TRPC4 expression was detected in a uniformly distributed subset of VTA DA neurons, and TRPC4 KO rats showed decreased VTA DA neuron tonic firing and deficits in cocaine reward and social behaviors. Update: The authors say they have added a discussion of these papers, but I do not see it in the updated manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. The discussion for this has been added (line 557-565).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2: The authors should report the results (exact data values) of female mice in the results text, or pool the male and female data if the sex differences are not significant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with reviewer. Some experiments were further redone with female and the data of male and female mice have been reported in the results of text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 3: The selectivity of drugs should be referred as &quot;selective&quot; rather than &quot;specific&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks, âspecificâ has been changed to âselectiveâ.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 4: Line 62: typo, &quot;substantia nigra&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks, âsubstantial nigraâ has been changed to âsubstantia nigraâ in line 65.</p>
<p>Comment 5: Line 77: some new studies suggest that NALCN might have voltage dependency</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(rectification).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks, description of NALCN voltage dependence has been corrected in line 81-83.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 6: Line 175: change &quot;less&quot; to &quot;fewer&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks, âlessâ has been changed to âfewerâ.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 7: Line 299: choose one - &quot;was not ... or&quot; or &quot;was neither ... nor&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks, this error has been corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 8: In Figure 1Aii and Figure 3Bi, it was not specified in the results text or figure legend that C1-C5 represent individual cell until the legend for Figure 4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks, these description about gel have been added in the figure legends.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Comment 1: From the previous review, we mentioned that &quot; 'The HCN' as written in line 69 is a bit misleading, as HCN channels in the heart and brain are different members of a family of channels, although as written in the text, it seems that they are identical.&quot; This is still the case (now line 73).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agreed with the reviewerâs comments. The introduction about HCN has been corrected (line 74-78).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2: The authors state in line 112 that &quot;most of the experiments were also repeated in female mice&quot; - this is true in the case of most electrophysiological experiments, although not behavioral experiments. Authors should amend the statement in line 112 and clarify in the Discussion section which findings are generalizable between sexes; e.g.:</p>
<p>a.  Discussion of HCN contribution to VTA DA activity (beginning line 453) should clarify male mice.</p>
<p>b.  Similarly, any discussion of behavioral findings should clarify male mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agreed with the reviewerâs comments. The sexes of mice used have been noted in the results and discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 3: The authors' statement in lines 179-183 (&quot;In contrast, fewer GABAergic neuronal markers (Glutamic acid decarboxylase, GAD1/2 and vesicular GABA transporter, VGAT) co-expressed with the DA neurons, which is consistent with previous studies that VTA DA neurons co-expressing GABAergic neuronal markers mainly project to the lateral habenula&quot;) is a little confusing - as stated, it seems that the authors are confirming DA/GABA coexpression in VTA-LHb neurons, which is not the case.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agreed with the reviewerâs comments. We corrected this statement (line 182-186).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 4: Additional information could be included in the Methods section description of Western Blotting procedures - e.g., what thickness of tissue and what size gauge were used to dissect VTA for these experiments?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. The description of tissue in Western Blotting procedures has been added.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 5:</p>
<p>a. Grammatical errors in line 23 of Abstract (also lines 31-32)</p>
<p>b. &quot;drove&quot; should read &quot;strove&quot; in line 92</p>

<p>Comment 1: The main strength of this study lies on a comprehensive bottom-up approach ranging from patch-clamp recordings to behavioral tasks. These tasks mainly address anxiety-like behaviors and so-called depression-like behaviors (sucrose choice, forced swim test, tail suspension test). The results gathered by means of these procedures are clearcut. However, the reviewer believes that the authors should be more cautious when interpreting immobility responses to stress (forced swim, tail suspension) as &quot;depression-like&quot; responses. These stress models have been routinely used (and validated) in the past to detect the antidepressant properties of compounds under investigation, which by no means indicates that these are depression models. For readers interested by this debate, I suggest to read e.g. De Kloet and Molendijk (Biol. Pscyhiatry 2021).</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We will be more careful and rigorous in the selection of stress models in our subsequent research work.</p>

<p>Should you choose to revise your manuscript, please include full statistical reporting including exact p-values wherever possible alongside the summary statistics (test statistic and df) and 95% confidence intervals. These should be reported for all key questions and not only when the p-value is less than 0.05.</p>
