<title>Abstract</title><p>Transcription activation of genes by estrogen is driven by enhancers, which are often located within the same Topologically Associating Domain (TAD) as non-targeted promoters. We investigated how acute enhancer-driven activation affects neighbouring non-target genes within the same TAD. Using single-molecule RNA FISH (smFISH), we tracked the transcription of <italic>TFF1</italic> (enhancer-targeted) and <italic>TFF3</italic> (non-targeted) during estrogen stimulation. We observed mutually exclusive expression patterns: <italic>TFF1</italic> expression peaked at 1 hour, while <italic>TFF3</italic> reached its peak at 3 hours, after <italic>TFF1</italic>’s activation had diminished. Chromatin looping data indicated that the enhancer loops with <italic>TFF1</italic> but not <italic>TFF3</italic>, suggesting that <italic>TFF3</italic> upregulation is not due to direct enhancer-promoter interactions. CRISPR deletion of the <italic>TFF1</italic> enhancer and 1,6-hexanediol (HD) exposure revealed that the <italic>TFF1</italic> enhancer:promoter undergo Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS), which sequesters the transcriptional machinery and inhibits <italic>TFF3</italic> expression. As estrogen signalling wanes or LLPS is disrupted, <italic>TFF1</italic> expression declines while <italic>TFF3</italic> expression increases. Our findings reveal that enhancer-driven activation can indirectly influence neighbouring genes, highlighting a dynamic shift in gene expression as signalling progresses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Acute transcriptional activation of ligand-induced genes drives downstream signalling response. Similar to development-specific genes, signalling induced genes are also driven by enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Uyehara &amp; Apostolou, 2023</xref>). Upon binding with ligand-induced transcription factors (TFs), these enhancers loop with their target promoters mostly, in the same TAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Buecker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bulger &amp; Groudine, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chepelev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Furlong &amp; Levine, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Oh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Panigrahi &amp; O’Malley, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ptashne, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sanyal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). Enhancer: promoter pairing is thought to be specific and forms the basis of noise-free gene activation of a subset of genes crucial for signalling response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bojcsuk et al., 2017</xref>; H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Friedman et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Galouzis &amp; Furlong, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zabidi et al., 2015</xref>). Due to such specificity, gene transcription occurs in waves of early and late responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fowler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yamamoto &amp; Alberts, 1976</xref>). Often, the protein factors translated from early genes regulate the expression of late responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dixon et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Freter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Herschman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Williams et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Winkles, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Winston &amp; Pledger, 1993</xref>). However, it is not known if the genes that are activated early in the signalling time course are spatially related to late activating genes. Further, if the spatial proximity of any gene to an early gene is enough to cause the temporal differential transcription due to sequestration of the transcriptional machinery from late gene to early gene is poorly understood. Transcription factors (TFs), after binding to cognate DNA motifs, recruit RNA polymerase machinery and co-activators for gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Levine &amp; Tjian, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). These machinery are limited in supply, and may become sequestered from other genomic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Koşar &amp; Erbaş, 2022</xref>). Further, acute activation of genes is linked with phase-separation of TFs, polymerases, mediators and other co-factors/activators, most of which harbour low complexity regions to promote weak protein-protein interactions driving the formation of TF-condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boehning et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boija et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cai et al., 2019</xref>; L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chong et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mann &amp; Notani, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sabari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Shrinivas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Stortz et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">2024</xref>). Though the precise stoichiometry of protein molecules in these condensates is unknown, such structures involve multiple molecules of each transcriptional protein. The formation of such phase-separated compartments can potentially act as a sink for transcriptional machinery depriving neighbouring promoters and enhancers that are not part of the compartment. Such sequestration would cause indirect suppression of these spatially proximal genes in the same TAD but not the part of the same condensate.</p>
<p>In order to investigate the effect of an enhancer: promoter pair on a neighbouring gene within the same TAD, we looked at the paradigmatic model of estrogen signalling in mammary epithelial cells, namely MCF7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Levenson &amp; Jordan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Masiakowski et al., 1982</xref>). E2-signalling can be induced within minutes by treating the cells with estradiol (E2), which causes activation and repression of several genes across the genome. The peak of E2-mediated signalling occurs 40 minutes post-induction and starts to decay by 160 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hah et al., 2011</xref>). This occurs via the binding of estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) on the enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Li et al., 2013</xref>). We selected E2-induced E-P pair <italic>TFF1</italic> and its neighbouring gene <italic>TFF3</italic> on Chr21 as discussed below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chinery et al., 1996</xref>). Several studies have used single-cell methods to interrogate E2 responsive genes such as <italic>GREB1</italic>, <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>TFF1</italic> as a paradigm to understand their transcriptional response upon estrogen stimulation (Fritzsch et al., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Patange et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rodriguez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Stossi et al., 2020</xref>). These studies have implicated the cellular states as determinants of transcriptional response and that the long repressive states of TFF1 give rise to expression variability in isogenic lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rodriguez et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>TFF1</italic> is found in a topologically associated domain (TAD) along with a few other genes, including <italic>TFF2</italic>, <italic>TFF3</italic>, <italic>TMPRSS3</italic>, and <italic>UBASH3A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Oh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Quintin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> is located at 10kb and 60kb from enhancer, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), and this locus has been useful in answering the questions about promoter-enhancer interactions and multi-gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Oh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Quintin et al., 2014</xref>;).</p>

<p>We chose to answer these questions using an integrated approach consisting of single molecule RNA FISH (smFISH), genome-wide conformation capture and sequencing (4C-seq), and perturbation of cis-acting regulatory elements by CRISPR. We identified that <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> genes located within the same TAD show distinct and opposing expression profiles over the course of E2-mediated signalling. In agreement with this, the enhancer also showed increased lopping interaction with the cognate gene promoter during peak expression at 1h of signalling. We also identified the role of TF-mediated LLPS on the regulation of these two genes during signalling. Hence, we propose that ligand-dependent condensation of ERα can support the expression of the cognate gene in concert with the enhancer while negatively affecting the expression of a neighbouring gene.</p>

<title>ERα binding and ligand-induced gene expression of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> change over the course of estrogen signaling</title>
<p>In order to understand how acute activation of one gene in a TAD affects the transcription of a proximate gene, we chose to study <italic>TFF1</italic> and its neighbouring gene <italic>TFF3</italic> at a 43kb distance within same TAD. <italic>TFF1</italic> expression is linked with an enhancer located 10 kb downstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Oh et al., 2021</xref>) and the distance between <italic>TFF1</italic> enhancer and <italic>TFF3</italic> gene is 53kb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>17-β-oestradiol exposure leads to ERα binding on regulatory regions, leading to gene activation. Gene transcription of E2-regulated genes was shown to peak at 1h and significantly reduced at 3h due to the rapid degradation of ERα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hah et al., 2011</xref>). The binding of ERα in the genome also follows this temporal kinetics, where it peaks at 1h and reduces at 3h post ligand stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hah et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). At the <italic>TFF1</italic> locus, the <italic>TFF1</italic> enhancer and to some extent, its promoter, were bound by ERα even in the absence of E2 induction, while it increased in strength at these regions and also at various other regions in the locus at 1h of ligand stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, the binding at these regions substantially decreased at 3h. On the other hand, ERα did not bind on the <italic>TFF3</italic> promoter throughout the course of signalling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). A single peak of ERα was observed approx. 3 kb upstream to TFF3 gene. We have previously shown that estrogen-induced clustered binding of ERα on <italic>TFF1</italic> region is associated with its acute activation post estrogen stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>). We then tested their expression level by nascent RNA-seq (GRO-seq). We observed a dramatic transcriptional activation of <italic>TFF1</italic> at 1h, which reduced substantially at 3h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The expression level of <italic>TFF3</italic> was comparatively lower and exhibited mild induction at 1h which increased furthermore at 3h upon signalling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>). However, qRT-PCR on unspliced <italic>TFF3</italic> exhibited upregulation at 1h and down-regulation at 3h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We reasoned that these differences in <italic>TFF3</italic> could be because of its low baseline expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Clark et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Conesa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Svensson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Tarazona et al., 2011</xref>), and lower yet expression of unspliced transcripts. Therefore, in order to test the relative induction of these genes and their co-regulation, we decided to perform single-cell measurements of RNA (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>) that do not rely on PCR amplification and can provide absolute numbers of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> transcripts in a given cell. Towards this, we chose to employ smFISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Femino et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Haimovich &amp; Gerst, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kwon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Raj et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title><italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> exhibit opposite trends during the E2 signalling time-course</title>
<p>MCF7 cells are hypertriploid to hypotetraploid, and each of the three alleles within a nucleus can behave differently, and smFISH is pre-eminently suited to capturing cell- and allele-specific heterogeneity of expression even for low expressing genes, compared to bulk studies that average over cell populations. Briefly, smFISH allows to visualize single RNA molecules in fixed cells using multiple fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probes targeted to the RNA of interest and therefore, it can be used to image the transcription and the localization of multiple gene transcripts at same and different time points after signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Femino et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Raj et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>We designed the smFISH probes targeting the intronic region of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> to measure their nascent transcripts (referred to as InTFF1 and InTFF3 hereon) whereas the exonic probes were used to primarily measure mature mRNA transcripts (referred to as ExTFF1 and ExTFF3 hereon). Intronic probes are particularly suited for investigating nascent transcriptional status at the time of fixation, while probes against mature mRNA reflects on more steady-state levels of functional mRNA due to finite mRNA lifetimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Skinner et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, the intronic probes can help determine the localisation and number of alleles that are transcribing at a given time thus allowing for additional interpretations regarding the expression of multiple genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Skinner et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Representative images from the smFISH experiment probing InTFF1 and InTFF3 are depicted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The smaller foci represent individual intronic/nascent transcripts while the larger foci represent the site of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Raj et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref>). Since MCF7 cells are hypertriploid in nature, we expected to see 1-3 large foci per cell representing sites of transcription. Additionally, we observed many individual transcripts labelled by intronic probes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, D</xref>) within the same nuclei (probes against mature RNA are usually more cytoplasmic). This is suggestive of the fact that the transcripts undergo non-co-transcriptional splicing as the transcripts labelled by intronic probes are localised away from the site of transcription. This is not surprising as several reports have shown that nascent transcripts can undergo splicing well after transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Coulon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Drexler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Khodor et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<p>We quantified the number of such transcripts per nuclei as a proxy for ongoing transcription. At 1h post E2 induction, <italic>TFF1</italic> mean transcript counts increased significantly compared to uninduced, whereas, the increment was less pronounced for <italic>TFF3</italic> transcripts. In contrast, the mean transcript counts for <italic>TFF3</italic> increased significantly at 3h post induction while <italic>TFF1</italic> transcription showed a decrease at 3h compared to 1h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). We observed an increase in the number of transcribing sites per cell for both TFF1 and TFF3, as well as in the number of cells showing transcripts compared to the untreated condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A-B</xref>). Further, TFF1 transcripts spots were more spread out in the nucleus that harboured multiple transcribing sites (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C-D</xref>). To check the transcriptional status of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> in the same cell, we plotted the transcript counts from individual cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The data suggested that the transcript counts for <italic>TFF1</italic> increased at 1h and cells that showed high counts for <italic>TFF1</italic> were likely to have low counts for <italic>TFF3</italic> and vice-versa. But the RNA counts for <italic>TFF1</italic> decreased at 3h and increased for <italic>TFF3</italic>. Overall, it was evident that the transcriptional profile for these two genes located in the same TAD were negatively correlated as they peaked at different time points. To further confirm this, smFISH using probes targeting both the intronic and exonic transcripts in the same experiment was conducted. Intronic probes represent active transcription, while exonic probes show accumulated mature RNA from past transcriptional events even in the absence of active transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Skinner et al., 2016</xref>). Representative images from the smFISH experiment probing InTFF1/ExTFF1 and InTFF3/ExTFF3 are depicted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2E</xref>). InTFF1 spots overlapped with ExTFF1 in the nucleus (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2F</xref>) and InTFF1 spots were restricted to the nucleus, whereas ExTFF1 were both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm as expected, indicating the specificity of smFISH probes (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2E</xref>). We observed that the exonic transcript counts for both <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> increased at 1h compared to uninduced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E, F</xref>). Strikingly, at 3h, the exonic transcripts for <italic>TFF1</italic> continued to increase even while the intronic transcript counts reduced, though the fold increase (1.12 ±0.02) was less compared to that between uninduced and 1h (1.63 ± 0.28), indicating a plateauing of steady state levels. Exonic transcripts for <italic>TFF3</italic> at 3h remained comparable to 1h while the intronic counts increased suggesting, <italic>TFF1</italic> transcription reduces at 3h, whereas <italic>TFF3</italic> expression increases. We reasoned that the ratio of intronic transcript number (InTFF) to exonic transcripts number (ExTFF) should represent the status of transcription as an increase in the number of intronic transcript due to expression would result in a higher ratio while also taking into consideration the number of mature transcripts. As expected, the ratio of intronic transcripts to exonic transcripts also showed that transcription is active at 1h for <italic>TFF1</italic> as the ratio is higher compared to uninduced and 3h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>). Contrastingly, the ratio was highest at 3h for <italic>TFF3</italic> suggesting that active transcription takes place much after the peak of E2-mediated signalling and maximal <italic>TFF1</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>). Indeed, a very recent study has shown that such post-transcriptional splicing can occur for genes and intron dispersal can be expected more commonly for some highly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Coté et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, the observation of intronic signal away from the site of transcription as we see for <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> is not unexpected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, D, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>TFF1</italic> enhancer does not change target promoters during signalling time-course</title>
<p>In order to identify the molecular players behind the differential expression of these two genes that are in the same TAD, we asked if the ERα-bound enhancer downstream to the <italic>TFF1</italic> gene loops with <italic>TFF1</italic> at 1h, and with <italic>TFF3</italic> at 3h. This enhancer acutely activates <italic>TFF1</italic> at 1h post estrogen stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>; Ho et al., 2021). We interrogated the looping using enhancer as a viewpoint by 4C-seq in uninduced, 1h and 3h post E2 stimulation. We observed robust interactions between enhancer and <italic>TFF1</italic> promoter at 1h post induction, which reduced at 3h. On the other hand, its interaction with the <italic>TFF3</italic> promoter exhibited very low counts in uninduced as well as E2-induced conditions at both time points and in both replicates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). This suggests that the looping of enhancer potentially induces the expression of <italic>TFF1</italic> gene at 1h, and loss of interactions at 3h results in weak <italic>TFF1</italic> transcription. However, the lack of interactions between enhancer and <italic>TFF3</italic> did not explain the gain of <italic>TFF3</italic> expression at 3h post ligand stimulation.</p>

<p>This could mean that enhancer interaction is critical for <italic>TFF1</italic> expression, but is less important for <italic>TFF3</italic> expression. Thus, <italic>TFF1</italic> expression should be affected more severely upon deletion of the enhancer than <italic>TFF3</italic>. To test this, we investigated the expression of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> in MCF-7 cells where the enhancer downstream to <italic>TFF1</italic> was homozygously deleted using CRISPR-Cas9 (referred to as the Δ<italic>TFF1</italic>e from hereon) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) (Saravanan et al., 2021). Using smFISH, we quantified the intronic transcripts for <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> in the Δ<italic>TFF1</italic>e cells, compared to WT cells. We observed that the mean number of <italic>TFF1</italic> transcripts was reduced drastically in the Δ<italic>TFF1</italic>e compared to the WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The reduction was far more substantial (49.23 ±2.6 at 1hr and 40.75 ±7.8 at 3h) for <italic>TFF1</italic> than <italic>TFF3</italic> (6.03 ±1.8 at 1hr and 7.6 ±0.7 at 3h) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). The absolute transcript counts for <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> in the Δ<italic>TFF1</italic>e cells have also been shown for clearer visualization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), as these are obscured when compared to WT. To get a sense of fold changes, we took a ratio of mean transcript counts in WT cells to Δ<italic>TFF1</italic>e cells at each time point. We observed that the drop in gene transcripts between WT and Δ<italic>TFF1</italic>e were several folds higher for <italic>TFF1</italic> compared to <italic>TFF3</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). This suggests that enhancer deletion has a more robust impact on the transcription of <italic>TFF1</italic> compared to <italic>TFF3</italic>. Nonetheless, <italic>TFF3</italic> was also affected even though, it does not loop with the enhancer. This is in accordance with the 4C-seq data where we observed prominent looping between the enhancer and <italic>TFF1</italic> but less so with <italic>TFF3</italic>. These results suggest that the enhancer plays a more important role in the expression of the primary gene while it has less impact on a gene located more distally but within the same TAD during course of signalling.</p>

<title>Levels of ER<sub>α</sub> in the nucleus dictate the extent of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> inductions</title>
<p>After ruling out enhancer looping as the determinant of differential expression, we looked for other candidates that could regulate the differential gene expression. As discussed above, globally, E2-mediated gene expression is known to peak at 1h after stimulation and drop significantly by 3h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hah et al., 2011</xref>). Upon ligand stimulation, ERα translocate into the nucleus, increasing mean ERα intensity in the nucleus which is high at 1h and then decreases significantly by 3h due to degradation. These changes in intensities have been captured using immunofluorescence for ERα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>). We tested if the intensities of ERα in individual cells correlate with the expression of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> at 1h and 3h of E2 signalling. Towards this, we combined smFISH with immunofluorescence for ERα. To improve contrast for the ERα signal, we additionally performed a chromatin retention assay to get rid of any chromatin unbound ERα (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The representative images show that the cells with very high levels of nuclear ERα (blue circle) exhibited low counts of both <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic>. In contrast, the cells with medium levels of ERα (red circle) possessed higher <italic>TFF1</italic> than <italic>TFF3</italic>. Similarly, the cells with the lower levels of ERα (grey circle) showed higher <italic>TFF3</italic> expression as compared to <italic>TFF1</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Histograms depicting the ERα mean intensities across individual cells, showed that the nuclear level of ERα increases post 1h of induction and then goes down at 3h (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, C</xref>), similar to <italic>TFF1</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>To further corroborate this, we parsed the ERα population cells into 3 categories, namely low, medium, and high within the cells imaged at 1 and 3h. We plotted the mean counts of <italic>TFF1</italic> in each of these bins at different time points and observed that the mean count was higher in the mid-category (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). While for <italic>TFF3</italic>, the mean count was significantly higher in the low bin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). The transcript counts for <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> against ERα intensities on a cell-by-cell basis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>), also showed this feature where very high levels of ERα in the nucleus were not conducive to the expression of either gene (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). To test if ERα had a causal role in intensity based expression of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic>, we increased the levels of ERα by overexpression of ERα-GFP (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>). The representative images from the smFISH experiment in cells overexpressing ERα-GFP confirmed that <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> were downregulated in transfected cells while these genes were not perturbed in non-transfected cells in the neighbourhood (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A,C</xref>). Meanwhile, the cells overexpressing ERα-GFP do not show any impairment in the expression of GAPDH (housekeeping gene) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A,B</xref>). As another control, we transfected the cells with EGFP-C1 (same backbone as ERα-GFP construct) and observed no effect on <italic>TFF1</italic> or <italic>TFF3</italic> (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5D,E</xref>). The data suggest that loss of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> expression upon ERα overexpression was not a general effect of transfection stress but rather specific to ERα overexpression. These results indicate that high nuclear levels of ERα can be detrimental to the expression of genes it regulates. This could be due to the widespread condensate formation, which in turn could sequester the transcriptional protein complexes and competitively abrogate transcription across multiple loci. Thus, the global level of ERα in the nucleus can predict the transcriptional status of specific genes. The binding of ERα at 1 and 3h is proportional to its nuclear levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), suggesting, its overexpression would lead to more binding in the genome, which is detrimental to gene expression.</p>

<title>LLPS perturbation down-regulates <italic>TFF1</italic> but supports <italic>TFF3</italic> expression</title>
<p>The data obtained from combined smFISH and ERα immunofluorescence indicates that ERα could be a determining factor in controlling the differential gene expression of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic>. Existing literature indicates that ERα-mediated condensate plays a role in E2-induced gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boija et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nair et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sabari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>). It led us to hypothesize that ERα-mediated condensate at the <italic>TFF1</italic> locus could be sequestering all the factors required for active transcription thus preventing activation of the <italic>TFF3</italic> locus at the active phase of E2 signalling. To validate this, we treated the cells with 3% 1,6-Hexanediol for 5 minutes, which is known to disrupt LLPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gamliel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kroschwald et al., 2017</xref>). Following the treatment, we performed smFISH to look at the transcription of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> in the same cell and observed a dramatic reduction in <italic>TFF1</italic> transcripts, whereas a statistically significant increase in <italic>TFF3</italic> was noted (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Since ERα forms condensate only after estrogen stimulation, 1,6-Hexanediol had no effect on <italic>TFF1</italic> in the absence of E2 signalling (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the functional loss of <italic>TFF1</italic> promoter transcription due to the dissolution of ERα condensate allowed the <italic>TFF3</italic> promoter in the neighbourhood to gain access to transcriptional machinery, leading to its upregulation. In order to test the generality of this observation, beyond the <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> locus, we divided E2-responsive genes into three categories, low, moderate, and high, based on their expression upon E2-40m stimulation. We observed a significant increase at 40m and down-regulation at 160m when the binding of ERα is reduced in the genome (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Next, we tested the expression of their nearby upregulated genes at 160m compared to 40m post E2 stimulation. The nearby genes are within a distance of 1Mb from the E2-responsive genes, which is approximately the average size of a TAD. Indeed, we observed a significant upregulation of nearby genes at 160m when the expression of highly induced genes dropped. Additionally, the expression of these neighbouring genes was reduced at the peak of signalling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), showing that at 40m of signalling, the acute activation of primary genes and sequestration of transcription machinery by these genes leads to the loss of expression of nearby genes.</p>

The phase-separated condensate leads to the sequestration of transcriptional machinery. 4. This favours intra-TAD enhancer: promoter interactions to facilitate robust gene transcription.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>smFISH allowed us to simultaneously capture allele level transcription of two genes, <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3,</italic> located in the same TAD, at single cell level during the peak and fall of signalling. We were able to capture the anti-correlated expression of these two genes, revealing intricate regulatory feedback between acutely activated enhancer-dependent gene, <italic>TFF1,</italic> which caused the dysregulation of the non-enhancer targeted gene, <italic>TFF3,</italic> within the same TAD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data suggests that while condensate formation on enhancer allows robust activation of the target gene, however, it negatively impacts the expression of other neighbouring genes potentially due to the sequestration of transcriptional machinery from these genes. When the condensates dissolve, the locally enriched transcriptional machinery is available to the other loci, potentially allowing for increased transcription of these genes, that are not the direct target of enhancers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Forced dissolution of condensates allows the expression of non-enhancer target genes in the cells, although at low levels. The data also suggests that, globally, the genes next to ligand-induced genes are upregulated only at the fall of signalling as an indirect consequence of excess polymerase availability in the neighbourhood.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Non-enhancer target genes are also regulated indirectly in the same TAD</title>
<p>ERα binding strength increases at the <italic>TFF1</italic> enhancer at 1h of ligand stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>). Such estrogen-induced binding of ERα leads to robust ligand-induced activation of <italic>TFF1</italic> gene. While <italic>TFF3</italic> promoter remains unbound by ERα (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) and does not interact with the <italic>TFF1</italic> enhancer throughout the course of signalling. These data suggest that <italic>TFF3</italic> expression is both ERα and enhancer independent. Despite non-dependence, <italic>TFF3</italic> expression was mutually exclusive to <italic>TFF1</italic> expression and was negatively impacted in the absence of the enhancer. The latter could be due to the enhancer-mediated repositioning of the entire TAD that benefitted the expression of <italic>TFF3</italic> and not due to the direct interaction between the enhancer and the <italic>TFF3</italic> gene.</p>
<p>The mean expression of <italic>TFF1</italic> was manyfold higher than <italic>TFF3,</italic> thus explaining its dependence on an active upstream enhancer. The enhancer of <italic>TFF1</italic> interacts with the gene at the peak of signalling and shows some loss of interaction at 3h when signalling recedes. As stated above, the enhancer does not interact with <italic>TFF3,</italic> however, the enhancer forms loop with <italic>TFF3</italic> upon deletion of the <italic>TFF1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Oh et al., 2021</xref>). The ERα condensates are formed at the <italic>TFF1</italic> locus upon signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>), which is reduced upon enhancer deletion, suggesting its causal role in condensate formation. Corroborating with this, the enhancer of <italic>TFF1</italic> engages in the recruitment of megadalton complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Liu et al., 2014</xref>) in MCF-7 cells, which could facilitate phase-separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nair et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>). The cells that expressed <italic>TFF1</italic> did not express <italic>TFF3</italic> as efficiently, suggesting Pol2 was potentially sequestered from the <italic>TFF3</italic> promoter. However, at 3h when liganded ERα degrades leading to dissolution of condensates on enhancer, <italic>TFF3</italic> expression increased, suggesting a local redistribution of active transcription machinery to other genes within the same chromatin domain. Even at 1h, when condensates were perturbed by 1,6 HD, the expression of <italic>TFF3</italic> increased indicating, the access to Pol2 pool by <italic>TFF3</italic> promoter. The data explains the negative correlation between <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> expression at the peak of signalling and robust activation of <italic>TFF3</italic> at 3h when <italic>TFF1</italic> expression decreased at single cell level. The presence of significant numbers of <italic>TFF1</italic> nascent RNA in the nucleus in our data could also be due to a time lapse between transcription and splicing, as seen for the genes that are early responders during signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zambrano et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>High and low levels of ER<bold>α</bold> were detrimental to enhancer mediated activation of TFF1</title>
<p>We observe that <italic>TFF1</italic> expression is the highest in cells with medium levels of ERα, while it shows low expression in cells with low or high levels of ERα (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4D, F</xref>). This points to an inverted U-shaped response of <italic>TFF1</italic> to ERα, which is a nonmonotonic response to estrogen, as has been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lebedeva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Vandenberg et al., 2012</xref>). A nonmonotonic response can be described as an inverted U-shaped curve with maximal response occurring in the middle and reducing substantially at very low or very high doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Vandenberg et al., 2012</xref>). Further, we observe that for <italic>TFF3</italic>, the maximal expression occurs at low levels of ERα (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4E, F</xref>). This could be indicative of a response such that a low concentration is enough to meet the threshold for expression beyond which all other higher doses attenuate the expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lebedeva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Vandenberg et al., 2012</xref>). This could also suggest that ERα levels have a varied effect on different genes and their expression depending on the extent of reliance of the gene on ERα for its expression. This phenomenon, called the prozone effect, is characterized by the inhibition of multimeric complexes when one of the constituents of the complex are present at very high concentrations as has been shown for <italic>TFF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lebedeva et al., 2012</xref>). In the context of condensates on <italic>TFF1</italic> gene, we speculate that very low levels of TF may not reach or exceed the critical concentration required for LLPS (for <italic>TFF1</italic>), but this poor transcriptional state of <italic>TFF1</italic> could be favourable for <italic>TFF3</italic>. Alternatively, a very high concentration of the TF could result in the formation of highly dense homogenous condensates, effectively reducing transcription in a situation akin to the prozone effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lebedeva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ryu et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the levels of ERα do not determine the expression of other E2 target genes like <italic>GREB1</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Stossi et al., 2020</xref>); however, we observed that overexpression of ERα causes downregulation of TFF1 (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>) and this is in agreement with what has been observed for the expression status of <italic>TFF1</italic> in cell line with high ERα compared to cell lines with low ERα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lebedeva et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>ER is known to be expressed in nearly 70% of breast cancers, and many of these are treated using estrogen receptor modulators and degraders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arnesen et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, understanding the effect of ERα on the expression of estrogen-responsive genes depending on whether they are target genes or non-target genes is of therapeutic importance as several non-target genes have been shown to be differentially regulated in ER-mutant breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arnesen et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, our study underscores the indirect effects of ligand-induced chronic gene transcription that is dependent on enhancer activation and phase separation within a TAD.</p>

<p>A. Representative images from smFISH experiments showing In<italic>TFF1</italic> and GAPDH (top panel) and In<italic>TFF1</italic> and In<italic>TFF3</italic> (bottom panel) in cells overexpressing ERα-GFP. Yellow circles show cells that are GFP positive, and the transcripts associated with them. Note the visibly fewer <italic>TFF1</italic>, and <italic>TFF3</italic> transcripts in the ERα-GFP positive cells, while GAPDH transcripts remain indistinguishable. This shows that ERα-GFP overexpression specifically affects the transcription of E2-regulated genes like <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> and not a housekeeping gene like GAPDH. This is further quantified in B and C.</p><p>B. Scatter plots showing the distribution of ERα-GFP intensities with GAPDH or In<italic>TFF1</italic> transcript counts on a cell-by-cell basis from the experiment in the first row of A. Cells with high ERα-GFP expression can have high GAPDH expression, but such cells necessarily have low <italic>TFF1</italic> counts.</p><p>C. Scatter plots showing the distribution of ERα GFP intensities with In<italic>TFF1</italic> or In<italic>TFF3</italic> counts on a cell-by-cell basis from the experiment in the second row of A. As in B, high ERα-GFP expression leads to low expression of E2-regulated genes like <italic>TFF1</italic> or <italic>TFF3</italic>.</p><p>D. Representative images showing smFISH for In<italic>TFF1</italic> and In<italic>TFF3</italic> in cells overexpressing EGFP-C1. Yellow circles show cells that are GFP positive, and the transcripts associated with them. Just expressing EGFP in the same backbone as the ERα-GFP plasmid, does not downregulate <italic>TFF1</italic>, and <italic>TFF3</italic> expression; indicating that the downregulation effect is specific to ERα overexpression and not a generic effect of cell transfection. This is quantified in E.</p><p>E. Scatter plots showing the distribution of EGFP-C1 intensities with In<italic>TFF1</italic> or In<italic>TFF3</italic> transcript counts on a cell-by-cell basis. There is no obvious correlation between the levels of EGFP-C1 and <italic>TFF1</italic> or <italic>TFF3</italic>, and a cell with high EGFP levels may well have large <italic>TFF1</italic> or <italic>TFF3</italic> transcript counts.</p></caption>

<p>The authors use single molecule imaging and in vivo loop-capture genomic approaches to investigate estrogen mediated enhancer-target gene activation in human cancer cells. These potentially <bold>important</bold> results suggest that ER-alpha can, in a temporal delay, activate a non-target gene TFF3, which is in proximity to the main target gene TFF1, even though the estrogen responsive enhancer does not loop with the TFF3 promoter. To explain these results, the authors invoke a transcriptional condensate model. The claim of a temporal delay and effects of the target gene transcription on the non-target gene expression are supported by <bold>solid</bold> evidence but there is no direct evidence of the role of a condensate in mediating this effect. The reviewers appreciate that the authors have done a lot of work to strengthen the study. This work will be of interest to those studying transcriptional gene regulation and hormone-aggravated cancers.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Bohra et al. describes the indirect effects of ligand-dependent gene activation on neighboring non-target genes. The authors utilized single-molecule RNA-FISH (targeting both mature and intronic regions), 4C-seq, and enhancer deletions to demonstrate that the non-enhancer-targeted gene TFF3, located in the same TAD as the target gene TFF1, alters its expression when TFF1 expression declines at the end of the estrogen signaling peak. Since the enhancer does not loop with TFF3, the authors conclude that mechanisms other than estrogen receptor or enhancer-driven induction are responsible for TFF3 expression. Moreover, ERα intensity correlations show that both high and low levels of ERα are unfavorable for TFF1 expression. The ERa level correlations are further supported by overexpression of GFP-ERa. The authors conclude that transcriptional machinery used by TFF1 for its acute activation can negatively impact the TFF3 at peak of signaling but once, the condensate dissolves, TFF3 benefits from it for its low expression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings are indeed intriguing. The authors have maintained appropriate experimental controls, and their conclusions are well-supported by the data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript Bohra et al. measure the effects of estrogen responsive gene expression upon induction on nearby target genes using a TAD containing the genes TFF1 and TFF3 as a model. The authors propose that there is a sort competition for transcriptional machinery between TFF1 (estrogen responsive) and TFF3 (not responsive) such that when TFF1 is activated and machinery is recruited, TFF3 is activated after a time delay. The authors attribute this time delay to transcriptional machinery that was being sequestered at TFF1 becomes available to the proximal TFF3 locus. The authors demonstrate that this activation is not dependent on contact with the TFF1 enhancer through deletion, instead they conclude that it is dependent on a phase-separated condensate which can sequester transcriptional machinery. Although the manuscript reports an interesting observation that there is a dose dependence and time delay on the expression of TFF1 relative to TFF3, there is much room for improvement in the analysis and reporting of the data. Most importantly there is no direct test of condensate formation at the locus in the context of this study: i.e. dissolution upon the enhancer deletion, decay in a temporal manner, and dependence of TFF1 expression on condensate formation. Using 1,6' hexanediol to draw conclusion on this matter is not adequate to draw conclusions on the effect of condensates on a specific genes activity given current knowledge on its non-specificity and multitude of indirect effects. Thus, in my opinion the major claim that this effect of a time delayed expression of TFF3 being dependent on condensates in not supported by the current data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The depends of TFF1 expression on a single enhancer and the temporal delay in TFF3 is a very interesting finding.</p>
<p>The non-linear dependence of TFF1 and TTF3 expression on ER concentration is very interesting with potentially broader implications.</p>
<p>The combined use of smFISH, enhancer deletion, and 4C to build a coherent model is a good approach.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There is no direct observation of a condensate at the TFF1 and TFF3 locus and how this condensate changes over time after E2 treatment, upon enhancer deletion, whether transcriptional machinery is indeed concentrated within it, and other claims on condensate function and formation made in the manuscript. The use of 1,6' HD is not appropriate to test this idea given how broadly it acts.</p>
<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>I don't think the response to Reviewer 2's comment on LLPS condensates on TFF1 are adequate and given this point is essential to the claims of the manuscript they must be addressed. Namely, the data from Saravavanan, 2020 actually suggest that condensate formation at the locus is not very predictive and barely enriched over random spots. The claims in the manuscript on the dependence of the condensate being responsible for sequestering transcriptional machinery are quite strong and the crux of the current model. To continue to make this claim (which I don't think is necessary since there are other possible models) the authors must test if the condensate at his locus (1) shows time dependent behavior, (2) is not present or weakened at the locus in cells that show high TFF3 expression, (3) is indeed enriched for transcriptional machinery when TFF1 peaks. The use of 1,6 hexanediol is not appropriate as pointed out by reviewer 2 and is no longer considered as an appropriate experiment by many as the whole notion of LLPS forming nuclear condensates is now under question. Such condensates can form through a variety of mechanisms as reviewed for example by Mittaj and Pappu (A conceptual framework for understanding phase separation and addressing open questions and challenges, Molecular Cell, 2022). Furthermore, given the distance between TFF1 and TFF3 it is hard to imagine that if a condensate that concentrates machinery in a non-stoichiometric manner was forming how it would not boost expression on both genes and be just specific to one. There must be another mechanism in my opinion.</p>
<p>I would recommend the authors remove this aspect of their manuscript/model and simply report their interesting findings that are actually supported by data: The temporal delay of TFF3 expression, the dependence on ER concentration, and the enhancer dependence.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are some major and minor concerns that related to approach, data presentation and discussion. But I think they can be fixed with more efforts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments on the paper. We have addressed all their specific recommendations below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The deletion of enhancer reveals the absolute reliance of TFF1 on its enhancers for its expression. Authors should elaborate more on this as this is an important finding.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We have now added a more detailed discussion on the requirement of enhancer for TFF1 expression in the revised manuscript (line 368-385).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Fig. 1, TFF3 expression is shown to be induced upon E2 signaling through qRT-PCR, while smFISH does not display a similar pattern. The authors attribute this discrepancy to the overall low expression of TFF3. In my opinion, this argument could be further supported by relevant literature, if available. Additionally, does GRO-seq data reveal any changes in TFF3 expression following estrogen stimulation? The GRO-seq track shown in Fig.1 should be adjusted to TFF3 expression to appreciate its expression changes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now included a browser shot image of TFF3 region showing GRO-Seq signal at E2 time course (Fig. S1C). We observed an increased transcription towards the 3’ end of TFF3 gene body at 3h.  The increased transcription at 3h, corroborates with smFISH data. The relative changes of TFF3 expression measured by qRT-PCR and smFISH for intronic transcripts are somewhat different, we speculate that such biased measurements that are dependent on PCR amplifications could be more for genes that express at low levels and smFISH using intronic probes may be a more sensitive assay to detect such changes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Since the mutually exclusive relationship between TFF1 and TFF3 is based on snap shots in fixed cells, can authors comment on whether the same cell that expresses TFF1 at 1h, expresses TFF3 at 3h? Perhaps, the calculations taking total number of cells that express these genes at 1 and 3h would be useful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Like pointed out by the reviewer, since these are fixed cells, we cannot comment on the fate of the same cell at two time points. To further address this limitation, future work could employ cells with endogenous tags for TFF1 and TFF3 and utilize live cell imaging techniques. In a fixed cell assay, as the reviewer suggests, it can be investigated whether a similar fraction shows high TFF3 expression at 3h, as the fraction that shows high TFF1 expression at 1 h. To quantify the fractions as suggested by the reviewer, we plotted the fraction of cells showing high TFF1 and TFF3 expression at 1h and 3h. We identify truly high expressing cells by taking mean and one standard deviation (for single cell level data) at E2-1hr as the threshold for TFF1 (80 and above transcript counts) and mean and one standard deviation (for single cell level data) at E2-3hr as the threshold for TFF3 (36 and above transcript counts). The fraction with high TFF1 expression at 1h  (12.06 ± 2.1) is indeed comparable to that with high TFF3 expression at 3h (12.50 ± 2.0) (Fig. 2C and Author response image 1). We should note that if the transcript counts were normally distributed, a predetermined fraction would be expected to be above these thresholds and comparable fractions can arise just from underlying statistics. But in our experiments, this is unlikely to be the case given the many outliers that affect both the mean and the standard deviation, and the lack of normality and high dispersion in single cell distributions. Of course, despite the fractions being comparable, we cannot be certain if it is the same set of cells that go from high expression of TFF1 to high expression of TFF3, but definitely that is a possibility. We thank the reviewer for pointing out this comparison.</p>

<p>The threshold was collected by pooling in absolute RNA counts from 650 analyzed cells (as in Fig. 2C). The mean and standard deviation over single cell data were calculated. Mean plus one standard deviation was used to set the threshold for identifying high expressing cells. For TFF1, as it maximally expresses at 1h the threshold used was 80. For TFF3, as it maximally expresses at 3h the threshold used was 36. Fraction of cells expressing above 80 and 36 for TFF1 and TFF3 respectively were calculated from three different repeats. Mean of means and standard deviations from the three experiments are plotted here.</p>

<p>Authors conclude that TFF3 is not directly regulated by enhancer or estrogen receptor. Does ERa bind on TFF3 promoter?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The ERa ChIP-seq performed at 1h and 3h of signaling suggests that TFF3 promoter is not bound by ERa as shown in supplementary Fig. 1B and S1B. However, one peak upstream to TFF1 promoter is visible and that is lost at 3h.</p>

<p>Reviewer’s comment -The figures would benefit from resizing of panels. There is very little space between the panels.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The discussion section could include an extrapolation on the relationship between ERα concentration and transcriptional regulation. Given that ERα levels have been shown to play a critical role in breast cancer, exploring how varying concentrations of ERα affect gene expression, including the differential regulation of target and non-target genes, would provide valuable insights into the broader implications of this study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a very important point that was missing from the manuscript. We have included this in the discussion in the revised manuscript (line 426-430).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript by Bohra et al., the authors use the well-established estrogen response in MCF7 cells to interrogate the role of genome architecture, enhancers, and estrogen receptor concentration in transcriptional regulation. They propose there is competition between the genes TFF1 and TFF3 which is mediated by transcriptional condensates. This reviewer does not find these claims persuasive as presented. Moreover, the results are not placed in the context of current knowledge.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>High level of ERalpha expression seems to diminish the transcriptional response. Thus, the results in Fig. 4 have potential insight into ER-mediated transcription. Yet, this observation is not pursued in great depth however, for example with mutagenesis of ERalpha. However, this phenomenon - which falls under the general description of non monotonic dose response - is treated at great depth in the literature (i.e. PMID: 22419778). For example, the result the authors describe in Fig. 4 has been reported and in fact mathematically modeled in PMID 23134774. One possible avenue for improving this paper would be to dig into this result at the single-cell level using deletion mutants of ERalpha or by perturbing co-activators.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing us to the relevant literature on our observation which will enhance the manuscript. We have discussed these findings in relations to ours in the discussion section (Line 400-413). We thank the reviewer for insight on non-monotonic behavior.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are concerns with the sm-RNA FISH experiments. It is highly unusual to see so much intronic signal away from the site of transcription (Fig. 2) (PMID: 27932455, 30554876), which suggests to me the authors are carrying out incorrect thresholding or have a substantial amount of labelling background. The Cote paper cited in the manuscript is likewise inconsistent with their findings and is cited in a misleading manner: they see splicing within a very small region away from the site of transcription.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and apologize if they feel we misrepresented the argument from Cote et al. This has now been rectified in the manuscript. However, we do not agree that the intronic signals away from the site of transcription are an artefact. First, the images presented here are just representative 2D projections of 3D Z-stacks; whereas the full 3D stack is used for spot counting using a widely-used algorithm that reports spot counts that are constant over wide range of thresholds (Raj et al., 2008). The veracity of automated counts was first verified initially by comparison to manual counts. Even for the 2D representations the extragenic intronic signals show up at similar thresholds to the transcription sites.</p>
<p>The signal is <italic>not</italic> non-specific arising from background labeling, explained by following reasons:</p>
<p>• To further support the time-course smFISH data and its interpretation without depending on the dispersed intronic signal, we have analyzed the number of alleles firing/site of transcription at a given time in a cell under the three conditions. We counted the sites of transcription in a given cell and calculated the percentage of cells showing 1,2,3,4 or &gt;4 sites. We see that the percent of cells showing a single site of transcription for TFF1 is very high in uninduced cells and this decreases at 1h. At 1h, the cells showing 2, 3 and 4 sites of transcription increase which again goes down at 3h (Author response image 2A). This agrees with the interpretation made from mean intronic counts away from the site of transcription. Similarly, for TFF3, the number of cells showing 2,3 and 4 sites of transcription increase slightly at 3hr compared to uninduced and 1hr (Author response image 2B).  We can also see that several cells have no alleles firing at a given time as has been quantified in the graphs on right showing total fraction of cells with zero versus non-zero alleles firing (Author response image 2A-B). A non-specific signal would be present in all cells.</p>
<p>• There is literature on post-transcriptional splicing of RNA beyond our work, which suggests that intronic signal can be found at relatively large distances away from the site of transcription. Waks et al. showed that some fraction of unspliced RNA could be observed up to 6-10 microns away from the site of transcription suggesting that there can be a delay between transcription and (alternative) splicing (Waks et al., 2011). Pannuclear disperse intronic signals can arise as there can be more than one allele firing at a time in different nuclear locations. The spread of intronic transcripts in our images is also limited in cells in which only 1 allele is firing at E2-1 hour (Author response image 2C) or uninduced cells (Author response image 2D). Furthermore, Cote et al. discuss that “Of note, we see that increased transcription level correlates with intron dispersal, suggesting that the percentage of splicing occurring away from the transcription site is regulated by transcription level for at least some introns. This may explain why we observe posttranscriptional splicing of all genes we measured, as all were highly expressed.” This is in line with our interpretation that intron signal dispersal can occur in case of posttranscriptional splicing (Coté et al., 2023). Additionally, other studies have suggested that transcripts in cells do not necessarily undergo co-transcriptional splicing which leads us to conclude that intronic signal can be found farther away from the site of transcription. Coulon et al. showed that splicing can occur after transcript release from the site and suggested that no strict checkpoint exists to ensure intron removal before release which results in splicing and release being kinetically uncoupled from each other (Coulon et al., 2014). Similarly, using live-cell imaging, it was shown that splicing is not always coupled with transcription, and this could depend on the nature and structural features of transcript (such as blockage of polypyrimidine tract which results in delayed recognition) (Vargas et al., 2011). Drexler  et al. showed that as opposed to drosophila transcripts that are shorter, in mammalian cells, splicing of the terminal intron can occur post-transcriptionally (Drexler et al., 2020). Using RNA polymerase II ChIP-Seq time course data from ERα activation in the MCF-7 cells, Honkela et al. showed that large number of genes can show significant delays between the completion of transcription and mRNA production (Honkela et al., 2015). This was attributed to faster transcription of shorter genes which results in splicing  delays suggesting rapid completion of transcription on shorter genes can lead to splicing-associated delays (Honkela et al., 2015). More recently, comparisons of nascent and mature RNA levels suggested a time lapse between transcription and splicing for the genes that are early responders during signaling (Zambrano et al., 2020). The presence of significant numbers of TFF1 nascent RNA in the nucleus in our data corroborates with above observations.</p>
<p>• Uniform intensities across many transcripts suggests these are true signal arising from RNA molecules which would not be the case for non-specific, background signal (Author response image 2E).</p>
<p>• Splicing occurs in the nucleus and intron containing pre-transcripts should be nuclear localized. Thus, intronic signals should remain localized to the nucleus unlike the mature mRNA which translocate to the cytoplasm after processing and thus exonic signals can be found both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In keeping with this, we observe no signal in the cytoplasm for the intronic probes and it remains localized within the nucleus as expected and can be seen in Author response image 2F, while exonic signals are observed in both compartments. This suggests to us that the signal is coming from true pre-transcripts. There is no reason for non-specific background labelling to remain restricted to the nucleus.</p>
<p>• We observe that the mean intronic label counts for both the genes <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> increases upon E2-induction compared to uninduced condition (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the mean intronic count for both genes reduce drastically in the TFF1-enhancer deleted cells (Fig. 3C, D). This change in the number of intronic signal specifically on induction and enhancer deletion suggests that the signal is not an artefact and arises from true nascent transcripts that are sensitive to stimulus or enhancer deletion.</p>
<p>• We expect colocalization of intronic signal with exonic signals in the nucleus, while there can be exonic signals that do not colocalize with intronic, representing more mature mRNA. Indeed, we observe a clear colocalization between the intronic and exonic signals in the nucleus, while exonic signals can occur independent of intronic both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This clearly demonstrates that the intronic signals in our experiments are specific and not simply background labelling (Author response image 2G).</p>
<p>These studies and the arguments above lead us to conclude that the presence of intronic transcripts in the nucleus, away from the site of transcription is not an artefact. We hope the reviewer will agree with us. These analyses have now been included in the manuscript as Supplementary Figure 6 and have been added in the manuscript at line numbers 106-111, 201204,  215-217 and line 231-235. We thank the reviewer for raising this important point.</p>

<p>One substantial way to improve the manuscript is to take a careful look at previous single cell analysis of the estrogen response, which in some cases has been done on the exact same genes (PMID: 29476006, 35081348, 30554876, 31930333). In some of these cases, the authors reach different conclusions than those presented in the present manuscript. Likewise, there have been more than a few studies that have characterized these enhancers (the first one I know of is: PMID 18728018). Also, Oh et al. 2021 (cited in the manuscript) did show an interaction between TFF1e and TFF3, which seems to contradict the conclusion from Fig. 3. In summary, the results of this paper are not in dialogue with the field, which is a major shortcoming.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these important studies. The studies from Prof. Larson group are particularly very insightful (Rodriguez et al., 2019). We have now included this in the discussion (line 106-111 and line 420-424) where we suggest the differences and similarities between our, Larson’s group and also Mancini’s group (Patange et al., 2022; Stossi et al., 2020).</p>
<p>The 4C-Seq data from the manuscript Oh et al. 2021 is exactly consistent with our observation from Fig 3 as they also observed little to no interaction between TFF1e and TFF3p in WT cells, only upon TFF1p deletion, did the TFF1e become engaged with the TFF3p. In agreement with this, we also observe little to no interaction between TFF1e and TFF3p in WT cells (Fig.3A). This is also consistent with our competition model for resources between these two genes. Oh et al. shows interaction between TFF1e and TFF3 when the TFF1 promoter is deleted showing that when the primary promoter is not available the enhancer is retargeted to the next available gene (Oh et al., 2021). It does not show that in WT or at any time point of E2 signalling does TFF1e and TFF3 interact.</p>

<p>In the opinion of this reviewer, there are few - if any - experiments to interrogate the existence of LLPS for diffraction-limited spots such as those associated with transcription. This difficulty is a general problem with the field and not specific to the present manuscript. For example, transient binding will also appear as a dynamic 'spot' in the nucleus, independently of any higher-order interactions. As for Fig. 5, I don't think treating cells with 1,6 hexanediol is any longer considered a credible experiment. For example, there are profound effects on chromatin independent of changes in LLPS (PMID: 33536240).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are cognizant of and appreciate the limitations pointed out by the reviewer. We and others have previously shown that ERa forms condensates on TFF1 chromatin region using ImmunoFISH assay (Saravanan et al., 2020).  The data below shows the relative mean ERα intensity on TFF1 FISH spots and random regions clearly showing an appearance of the condensate at the TFF1 site. Further, the deletion of TFF1e causes the reduction in size of this condensate. Thus, we expect that these ERα condensates are characterized by higher-order interactions and become disrupted on treatment with 1,6-hexanediol. These condensates are the size of below micron as mentioned by the reviewer, but most TF condensates are of the similar sizes. We agree with the reviewer that 1,6- hexanediol treatment is a brute-force experiment with several irreversible changes to the chromatin. Although we have tried to use it at a low concentration for a short period of time and it has been used in several papers (Chen et al., 2023; Gamliel et al., 2022). The opposite pattern of TFF1 vs. TFF3 expression upon 1,6- hexanediol treatment suggests that there is specificity. Further, to perturb condensates, mutants of ERa can be used (N-terminus IDR truncations) however, the transcriptional response of these mutants is also altered due to perturbed recruitment of coactivators that recognize Nterminus of ER, restricting the distinction between ERa functions and condensate formation.</p>
