<title>Summary</title><p>5-Methylcytosine (5mC) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are broadly conserved in eukaryotes but are also frequently lost during evolution. The mammalian SNF2 family ATPase HELLS and its plant ortholog DDM1 are critical for the maintenance of 5mC. Mutations in HELLS, its activator subunit CDCA7, and the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, cause immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome, a genetic disorder associated with the loss of DNA methylation. We here examine the coevolution of CDCA7, HELLS and DNMTs. While DNMT3, the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1), HELLS, and CDCA7 are all highly conserved in vertebrates and green plants, they are frequently lost in other evolutionary clades. The presence-absence patterns of these genes are not random; almost all CDCA7 harboring eukaryote species also have HELLS and DNMT1 (or another maintenance methyltransferase, DNMT5), whereas species that maintain DNMT1 or HELLS without CDCA7 are identified in several clades, such as Fungi and Ecdysozoa. Coevolution of presence-absence patterns (CoPAP) analysis in Ecdysozoa further indicates coevolutionary linkages among CDCA7, HELLS, DNMT1 and its activator UHRF1. Our study suggests that a unique specialized role of CDCA7 in HELLS-dependent DNA methylation maintenance is broadly inherited from the last eukaryotic common ancestor.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>DNA methylation, particularly 5-methylcytosine (5mC) at CpG sequences, is widely conserved in eukaryotes. Along with its role in silencing transposable elements and suppressing aberrant intragenic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Choi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Deniz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Neri et al., 2017</xref>), DNA methylation plays critical roles in developmental control, genome stability and the development of diseases such as cancers and immunodeficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Greenberg and Bourc’his, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lyko, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Nishiyama and Nakanishi, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Robertson, 2005</xref>). Despite its versatility as an epigenetic control mechanism, DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are lost in multiple evolutionary lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bewick et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kyger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Zemach et al., 2010</xref>). DNMTs are largely subdivided into maintenance DNMTs and de novo DNMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lyko, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Maintenance DNMTs recognize hemimethylated CpGs and restore symmetric methylation at these sites to prevent the passive loss of 5mC upon DNA replication. Conversely, methylation by de novo DNMTs does not require methylated DNA templates. In animals, 5mC is maintained during DNA replication by DNMT1 together with UHRF1, which directly recognizes hemimethylated cytosine via the SRA domain and stimulates activity of DNMT1 in a manner dependent on its ubiquitin-ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Nishiyama and Nakanishi, 2021</xref>). De novo DNA methylation is carried out by DNMT3 in animals. Some species, such as the fungus <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, lack de novo DNA methylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Catania et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dumesic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>). In <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, DNA methylation is maintained by DNMT5, which has a SNF2-family ATPase domain that is critical for its methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dumesic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>). Although DNMT5 orthologs cannot be found in land plants and animals, their broad existence in Stramenopiles, Chlorophyta and Fungi suggests that DNMT5, perhaps together with DNMT1, coexisted in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>). While the evolutionary preservation and loss of DNMTs and other proteins involved in 5mC metabolism has been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bewick et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">de Mendoza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dumesic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Engelhardt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Iyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lewis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Mondo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mulholland et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Nai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Tirot et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Zemach et al., 2010</xref>), it remains unclear if there is any common process or event that leads to the loss of DNA methylation systems from certain evolutionary lineages.</p>
<p>The loss of DNA methylation is a hallmark of immunodeficiency–centromeric instability–facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome, a rare genetic disorder which causes severe immune defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ehrlich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ehrlich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Vukic and Daxinger, 2019</xref>). Activated lymphocytes of ICF patients display a characteristic cytogenetic abnormality at the juxtacentromeric heterochromatin of chromosome 1 and 16, where the satellite 2 repetitive element is highly enriched. In about 50 % of ICF patients, classified as ICF1, the disease is caused by mutations in the “de novo” DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hansen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Okano et al., 1999</xref>). The rarer genotypes known as ICF2, ICF3 and ICF4, are caused by mutations in ZBTB24, CDCA7, and HELLS (Helicase, Lymphoid Specific, also known as LSH, Lymphoid-Specific Helicase), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">de Greef et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Thijssen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Unoki, 2021</xref>). While the loss of DNA methylation at satellite II repeats is common to all ICF genotypes, ICF2-4 patient-derived cells, but not ICF1 patient cells, additionally exhibit hypomethylation at centromeric alpha-satellite repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Thijssen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Velasco et al., 2018</xref>). Knock out of ICF genes in human HEK293 cells reproduces the DNA methylation profile observed in patient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Unoki et al., 2019</xref>). In mice, ZBTB24, HELLS and CDCA7, but not DNMT3B, are required for methylation at centromeric minor satellite repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dennis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hardikar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Ren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Thijssen et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, although all ICF proteins promote DNA methylation, the ZBTB24-CDCA7-HELLS axis may target additional loci such as alpha satellites for DNA methylation in a DNMT3-independent manner. Indeed, the importance of HELLS/CDCA7 in DNA methylation maintenance by DNMT1 has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Han et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ming et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Unoki, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Unoki et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>HELLS belongs to one of ∼25 subclasses of the SNF2-like ATPase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Flaus et al., 2006</xref>). Among these diverse SNF2 family proteins, HELLS appears to have a specialized role in DNA methylation. Reduced genomic DNA methylation was observed in HELLS (LSH) knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dennis et al., 2001</xref>) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Myant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). In fact, this function of HELLS in DNA methylation was originally inferred from studies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, where mutations in the HELLS ortholog DDM1 (decrease in DNA methylation) cause drastic reduction of 5mC in transposable and repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Vongs et al., 1993</xref>). Like HELLS, DDM1 is a SNF2 ATPase with demonstrable <italic>in vitro</italic> nucleosome remodeling activity (Brzeski et al., 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>). Since DNA methylation defects in <italic>ddm1</italic> mutants can be rescued by the loss of histone H1, it has been proposed that DDM1-mediated remodeling of H1-bound nucleosomes is important for DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Zemach et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>CDCA7 (also known as JPO1) was originally identified as one of eight CDCA genes that exhibited cell division cycle-associated gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Walker, 2001</xref>). A putative 4CXXC zinc finger binding domain (zf-4CXXC_R1) is conserved among CDCA7 homologs, including its paralog CDCA7L (also known as JPO2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Ou et al., 2006</xref>). Multiple lines of evidence support the idea that CDCA7 functions as a direct activator of the nucleosome remodeling enzyme HELLS. First, in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, HELLS and CDCA7e (the sole CDCA7 paralog present in <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs) both preferentially interact with nucleosomes rather than nucleosome-free DNA, and binding of HELLS to chromatin depends on CDCA7e (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>). Second, HELLS alone exhibits little nucleosome sliding activity, but CDCA7e greatly stimulates it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>). Third, HELLS directly binds to CDCA7e (as well as CDCA7 and CDCA7L), even in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>). Fourth, HELLS and CDCA7 interact in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Unoki et al., 2019</xref>), where chromatin binding of HELLS also depends on CDCA7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>). ICF disease mutations located in the conserved zf-4CXXC_R1 domain (R274C, R274H and R304H in human CDCA7) inhibited chromatin binding of CDCA7 and HELLS without interfering with CDCA7-HELLS interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>), such that the zf-4CXXC_R1 domain likely serves as a chromatin binding module. Therefore, we proposed that CDCA7 and HELLS form a bipartite nucleosome remodeling complex, termed CHIRRC (CDCA7-HELLS ICF-related nucleosome remodeling complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>We previously suggested that ZBTB24, CDCA7, and HELLS form a linear pathway to support DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>). ZBTB24 is a transcription factor which binds the promoter region of CDCA7 and is required for its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). As CDCA7 binds HELLS to form the CHIRRC, we proposed that its ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding activity exposes DNA that was previously wrapped around the histone octamer and makes it accessible for DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Indeed, it has been shown that DNMT3A and DNMTB cannot methylate DNA within a nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Felle et al., 2011</xref>), and the importance of HELLS and DDM1 for DNA methylation at nucleosomal DNA has been reported in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lyons and Zilberman, 2017</xref>). Given the frequent loss of 5mC as an epigenetic mark in multiple evolutionary lineages, it is striking that the role for HELLS/DDM1 in DNA methylation appears to be conserved in evolutionarily distant mammals and plants. Importantly, this would suggest that the promotion of DNA methylation through nucleosome sliding is specific to HELLS and cannot be substituted by other SNF2 family nucleosome remodelers, such as SNF2 (SMARCA2/4), INO80, and ISWI (SMARCA1/5). If the specific function of HELLS and CDCA7 in DNA methylation is indeed derived from the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA), we hypothesize that HELLS and CDCA7 coevolved with other DNA methylation machineries. We here test this hypothesis and discuss the potential sequence of events that led to the loss of DNA methylation in some species.</p>

<title>CDCA7 is absent from the classic model organisms that lack genomic 5mC</title>
<p>CDCA7 is characterized by the unique zf-4CXXC_R1 motif (Pfam PF10497) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mistry et al., 2021</xref>). Conducting a BLAST search using human CDCA7 as a query sequence against the Genbank protein database, we realized that no zf-4CXXC_R1-containing proteins are identified in the classic model organisms <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, which are all also known to lack any DNMTs and genomic 5mC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Zemach et al., 2010</xref>). However, we identified a protein with a zf-4CXXC_R1 motif in the bumblebee <italic>Bombus terrestris</italic> and the thale cress <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, which have both maintenance and de novo DNMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bewick et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Li et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Based on the reciprocal best hits (RBH) criterion using human HELLS as a query sequence (see Methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Ward and Moreno-Hagelsieb, 2014</xref>), HELLS orthologs were identified in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (DMM1) and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Irc5), which is in line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Litwin et al., 2017</xref>), as well as a putative HELLS ortholog in <italic>B. terrestris</italic>. No clear HELLS orthologs were identified in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, or <italic>S. pombe</italic>. This pilot-scale analysis led us to hypothesize that the evolutionary maintenance of CDCA7 is linked to that of HELLS and DNMTs. In order to statistically validate this hypothesis, we set out to systematically define orthologs of CDCA7, HELLS and DNMTs in a broad range of evolutionary lineages.</p>

<title>CDCA7 family proteins in vertebrates</title>
<p>We first characterized evolutionary conservation of CDCA7 family proteins in vertebrates, where 5mC, DNMT1 and DNMT3 are highly conserved. A BLAST search against the Genbank protein database identified two zf-4CXXC_R1 motif-containing proteins, CDCA7/JPO1 and CDCA7L/R1/JPO2, throughout Gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). In frogs (such as <italic>Xenopus</italic>, but not all amphibians), and some fishes (such as <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic> and <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>), a third paralog CDCA7e exists (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>, Fig. S1). CDCA7e is the only CDCA7-like protein that can be detected in <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>), and thus likely represents a form specific to oocytes and early embryos in these species. Among twelve conserved cysteine residues originally reported in the zf-4CXXC_R1 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Ou et al., 2006</xref>), the 12<sup>th</sup> cysteine residue is not conserved in <italic>Rhincodon typus</italic> (whale shark) CDCA7 and in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> CDCA7e. In general, the 12<sup>th</sup> cysteine residue of the zf-4CXXC_R1 domain is least conserved among CDCA7 homologs within and outside of vertebrates, such that we do not consider it a key component of the zf-4CXXC_R1 motif (see below). Considering that the jawless fish <italic>Petromyzon marinus</italic> (sea lamprey) and other invertebrates commonly possess only one CDCA7 family gene (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, and see below), CDCA7L and CDCA7e may have emerged in jawed vertebrates. Overall, the zf-4CXXC_R1 sequence is highly conserved among vertebrate CDCA7 homologs, including three residues that are mutated in ICF3 patients (R274, G294 and R304 in human CDCA7) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Thijssen et al., 2015</xref>). Note that these amino acid positions of the ICF3 mutations are based on the previously reported sequence of an NP_665809 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Thijssen et al., 2015</xref>), which is annotated as isoform 2 (371 amino acids), whereas we list the isoform 1 (NP_114148) with 450 amino acids in this study (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>While the presence of four CXXC motifs in the zf-4CXXC_R1 domain is reminiscent of a classic zinc finger-CXXC domain (zf-CXXC, Pfam PF02008), their cysteine arrangement is distinctly different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Long et al., 2013</xref>). In vertebrate CDCA7 paralogs, eleven conserved cysteines are arranged as <underline>CXXC</underline>X10CX4CX7<underline>CXXC</underline>X19<underline>CXXC</underline>X3CX<underline>CXXC</underline>. In contrast, in the classic zf-CXXC motif eight cysteines are arranged as <underline>CXXCXXC</underline>X4-5<underline>CXXCXXC</underline>X8-14CX4C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Long et al., 2013</xref>). Apart from the zf-4CXXC_R1 domain, vertebrate CDCA7-like proteins often, but not always, contain one or two Lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)-binding motif(s), defined as ([E/D]XEXFXGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tesina et al., 2015</xref>). It has been reported that human CDCA7L and CDCA7 both interact with c-Myc but apparently via different regions, a leucine zipper and a less-defined adjacent segment that overlaps with a bipartite nuclear localization signal, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huang et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>This leucine zipper sequence is highly conserved among vertebrate CDCA7 family proteins.

<p>A BLAST sequence homology search identified three classes of zf-4CXXC_R1 motif-containing proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Class I proteins conserve all three ICF-associated residues (R274, G294 and R304 in human CDCA7) as well as all eleven characteristic cysteines, with the exception that the position of the fourth cysteine is shifted two residues toward the N terminus. The protein size of class I proteins is comparable to vertebrate CDCA7 (400 – 550 aa), and no other Pfam motifs can be identified. Based on the striking conservation of the eleven cysteine and three ICF-associated residues, we predict that the class I proteins are prototypical CDCA7 orthologs.</p>

<p>Class II proteins contain a zf-4CXXC_R1 domain, a DDT domain and a WHIM1 domain. These proteins were previously identified as DDR1-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dong et al., 2013</xref>). DDT and WHIM1 domains are commonly found in proteins that interact with SNF2h/ISWI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aravind and Iyer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yamada et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, it was reported that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> DDR1 and DDR3 interact with the ISWI orthologs CHR11 and CHR17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Tan et al., 2020</xref>). Among the eleven cysteine residues in the zf-4CXXC_R1 motif of these proteins, the position of the fourth residue is shifted towards the C-terminus. The ICF-associated glycine residue (G294 in human CDCA7, mutated to valine in ICF3 patients) is replaced by isoleucine.</p>
<p>Class III proteins are longer (∼1000 amino acid) and contain an N-terminal zf-4CXXC_R1 domain and a C-terminal JmjC domain (Pfam, PF02373), which is predicted to possess demethylase activity against histone H3K9me2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Saze et al., 2008</xref>). While all eleven cysteine residues can be identified, there are deletions between the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> cysteine and 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> cysteine residues. None of the ICF-associated residues are conserved in the class III. One of these class III proteins is IBM1 (increase in bonsai mutation 1), whose mutation causes the dwarf “bonsai” phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Saze et al., 2008</xref>), which is accompanied with increased H3K9me2 and DNA methylation levels at the <italic>BONSAI</italic> (<italic>APC13</italic>) locus. Double mutants of <italic>ddm1</italic> and <italic>ibm1</italic> exacerbate the bonsai phenotype, indicating that DDM1 and IBM1 act independently to regulate DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Saze et al., 2008</xref>). Another class III protein is JMJ24, which harbors a RING finger domain in addition to the 4CXXC and JmjC domains. This RING finger domain promotes ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the DNA methyltransferase CMT3, and thus opposes DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Deng et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Orthologs of these three classes of CDCA7 proteins found in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are widely identified in green plants (Viridiplantae), including Streptophyta (e.g., rice, maize, moss, fern) and Chlorophyta (green algae). Other variants of zf-4CXXC_R1 are also found in Viridiplantae. In contrast to green plants, in which the combined presence of HELLS/DDM1-, CDCA7- and DNMT-orthologs is broadly conserved, no zf-4CXXC_R1-containing proteins can be identified in red algae (Rhodophyta) (Table S1, see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>, Fig. S2).</p>

<p>(G294 in human CDCA7) is not conserved. As this zf-4CXXC_R1 signature is similar to the plant class II zf-4CXXC_R1 motif, we define this fungal protein family as class IIf CDCA7, which forms a distinct clade in our phylogenetic analysis of zf-4CXXC_R1 sequence alignment (Fig. S1).</p>
<p>Beside the class IIf CDCA7-like proteins, several fungal species encode a protein with a diverged zf-4CXXC_R1 motif, including those with a JmjC domain at the N-terminus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, Table S1), unlike the plant class III proteins for which the JmjC domain is located at the C-terminus.

<title>Systematic identification of CDCA7, HELLS and DNMT homologs in eukaryotes</title>
<p>To systematically identify CDCA7 and HELLS orthologs in the major eukaryotic supergroups, we conducted a BLAST search against the NCBI protein database using human CDCA7 and HELLS protein sequences. To omit species with a high risk of false negative identification, we selected species containing at least 6 distinct proteins with compelling homology to the SNF2 ATPase domain of HELLS, based on the assumption that each eukaryotic species is expected to have 6-20 SNF2 family ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Flaus et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, even the microsporidial pathogen <italic>Encephalitozoon cuniculi</italic>, whose genome size is a mere 2.9 Mb, contains six SNF2 family ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Flaus et al., 2006</xref>). As such, we generated a panel of 180 species encompassing all major eukaryote supergroups (5 Excavata, 18 SAR [2 Rhizaria, 6 Alveolata, 10 Stramenopiles]), 1 Haptista, 1 Cryptista, 15 Archaeplastida [3 Rhodophyta and 12 Viridiplantae], 4 Amoebozoa, 136 Opisthokonts [34 Fungi, 3 Holozoa, and 99 Metazoa])(Fig. S2, Table S1).</p>
<p>HELLS orthologs were initially identified if they satisfied the RBH criterion. To further validate the annotation of HELLS orthologs, a phylogenetic tree was constructed from a multiple sequence alignment of the putative HELLS orthologs alongside other SNF2-family proteins of <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster, S. cerevisiae</italic>, and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. If HELLS orthologs are correctly identified (i.e. without erroneously including orthologs of another SNF2-subfamily) they should cluster together in a single clade. However, the sequence alignment using the full-length protein sequence failed to cluster HELLS and DDM1 in the same clade (Fig. S3). Since HELLS and other SNF2-family proteins have variable insertions within the SNF2 ATPase domain, multiple sequence alignment of the SNF2 domains was then conducted after removing the insertion regions, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Flaus et al., 2006</xref>). By this SNF2 domain-only alignment method, all HELLS orthologs formed a clade, separated from CHD1, ISWI, SMARCA2/4, SRCAP, and INO80 (Fig. S4).</p>
<p>A BLAST search with the human CDCA7 sequence across the panel of 180 species identified a variety of proteins containing the zf-4CXXC_R1 motif, which are prevalent in all major supergroups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, Fig. S1, Table S1). Each of these identified proteins contains only one zf-4CXXC_R1 motif. The resulting list of CDCA7 BLAST hits were further classified as prototypical (Class I) CDCA7-like proteins (i.e. CDCA7 orthologs) if the first eleven cysteine residues <italic>and</italic> the three ICF-associated residues are conserved. A phylogenetic tree analysis of zf-4CXXC_R1 domains from diverse species confirmed that Class I CDCA7 proteins are clustered under the same clade (Fig. S1). These CDCA7 orthologs are broadly found in the three supergroup lineages (Archaeplastida, Amoebozoa, Opisthokonta) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>, Fig. S1, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>, Table S1). In Excavata, the amoeboflagellate <italic>Naegleria gruberi</italic> encodes a protein which is a likely ortholog of CDCA7 with an apparent C-terminal truncation (XP_002678720), possibly due to a sequencing error (Fig. S5). In SAR, Class I CDCA7 proteins are absent from all available genomes, except stramenopile <italic>Tribonema minus</italic>, which encodes a distantly related likely ortholog of CDCA7 (KAG5177154). These conservations suggest that the Class I zf-4CXXC_R1 domain in CDCA7 was inherited from the LECA.</p>

<title>Classification of DNMTs in eukaryotes</title>
<p>A simple RBH approach is not practical to classify eukaryotic DNMT proteins due to the presence of diverse lineage-specific DNMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>). Therefore, we collected proteins with a DNMT domain within the panel of 180 eukaryote species, and then the DNMT domains were extracted from each sequence (based on an NCBI conserved domains search). Generating a phylogenetic tree based on the multisequence alignment of the DNMT domains, we were able to classify the majority of all identified DNMTs as previously characterized DNMT subtypes according to their sequence similarity. These DNMT subtypes include the functionally well-characterized DNMT1 and DNMT3, the fungi-specific maintenance methyltransferase Dim-2 and de novo methyltransferase DNMT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Nai et al., 2020</xref>), the SNF2 domain-containing maintenance methyltransferase DNMT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dumesic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>), the plant-specific DNMTs (such as DRM and CMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Yaari et al., 2019</xref>), DNMT6 (a poorly characterized DNMT identified in Stramenopiles, Haptista and Chlorophyta) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>), and the tRNA methyltransferase TRDMT1 (also known as DNMT2) (Fig. S6). We also identified other DNMTs, which did not cluster into these classes. For example, although it has been reported that DNMT6 is identified in <italic>Micromonas</italic> but not in other Chlorophyta species, such as <italic>Bathycoccus</italic> and <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>), we identified Chlorophyta-specific DNMTs that form a distinct clade, which seems to be diverged from DNMT6 and DNMT3. We temporarily called this class Chlorophyta DNMT6-like (Fig. S6). Other orphan DNMTs include the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMTX in fungus <italic>Kwoniella mangroviensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Catania et al., 2020</xref>), which may be most related to CMT, and an uncharacterized DNMT in <italic>N. gruberi</italic> (XP_002682263), which seems to diverge from DNMT1 (Fig. S6).</p>

<title>Coevolution of CDCA7, HELLS and DNMTs</title>
<p>The identification of protein orthologs across the panel of 180 eukaryotic species reveals that homologs of CDCA7, HELLS and DNMTs are conserved across the major eukaryote supergroups, but they are also dynamically lost (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, Fig. S2). We found 40 species encompassing Excavata, SAR, Amoebozoa, and Opisthokonta that lack CDCA7, HELLS and DNMT1.

<p>To quantitatively assess evolutionary coselection of DNMTs, CDCA7 and HELLS, we performed CoPAP analysis on the panel of 180 eukaryote species (Fig. S7)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cohen et al., 2013</xref>). The analysis was complicated due to the presence of clade specific DNMTs (e.g., Dim2, DNMT5, DNMT6 and other plant specific DNMT variants) and diverse variants of zf-4CXXC_R1 containing proteins (class II, class III). Considering this caveat, we conducted CoPAP analysis of four DNMTs (DNMT1, Dim-2, DNMT3, DNMT5), UHRF1, CDCA7 (class I and class II), and HELLS. We included Dim-2 and DNMT5 since they play a critical role in DNA methylation in fungi lacking the prototypical DNMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Catania et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Selker et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, S2, Table S1). As a positive and negative controls for the CoPAP analysis, we also included subunits of the PRC2 complex (EZH1/2, EED and Suz12), and other SNF2 family proteins SMARCA2/SMARCA4, INO80 and RAD54L, which have no clear direct role related to DNA methylation, respectively. As expected for proteins that act in concert within the same biological pathway, the CoPAP analysis showed significant coevolution between DNMT1 and UHRF1, as well as between the PRC2 subunits EZH1 and EED. Suz12 did not show a significant linkage to other PRC2 subunits by this analysis, most likely due to a failure in identifying diverged Suz12 orthologs, such as those in <italic>Neurospora</italic> and <italic>Paramecium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jamieson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Miro-Pina et al., 2022</xref>). The class I CDCA7 exhibits significant linkage to DNMT1, UHRF1, HELLS and DNMT3. Notably, none of these proteins show an evolutionary association with the PRC2 proteins or other SNF2 family proteins, supporting the specific coevolution of CDCA7-HELLS and the DNA methylation proteins.</p>
<p>We next conducted the CoPAP analysis against a panel of 50 Ecdysozoa species, where DNA methylation system is dynamically lost in multiple lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bewick et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Engelhardt et al., 2022</xref>), yet the annotation of DNMTs, UHRF1, CDCA7 and HELLS is unambiguous.

As expected, CoPAP analysis showed a highly significant coevolutionary interaction between DNMT1 and UHRF1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6</xref>).

Strikingly, all 82 species containing CDCA7 (or type IIf CDCA7) also harbor HELLS. Almost all CDCA7 encoding species have DNMT1 with the exception of the Mamiellophyceae lineage, which lost DNMT1 but possesses DNMT5; and the fungus <italic>T. deformans</italic>, which encodes DNMT4 but not DNMT1 or DNMT5. In contrast, 20 species (e.g., <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) possess only HELLS, while 12 species (e.g. <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>) retains only DNMT1 among these proteins. These observations indicate that the function of CDCA7-like proteins is strongly linked to HELLS and DNMT1, such that their co-selection is maintained during eukaryote evolution, while CDCA7 is easier to lose than DNMT1 and HELLS.</p>

<title>Loss of CDCA7 in braconid wasps together with DNMT1 or DNMT3</title>
<p>CoPAP analysis detected the coevolutionary linkage between CDCA7 and DNMT1, rather than DNMT3, in Ecdysozoa.

<p>However, CDCA7 is lost from this gene cluster in parasitoid wasps, including Ichneumonoidea wasps (<italic>M. demolitor</italic>, <italic>Cotesia glomerata, Aphidius gifuensis</italic>, <italic>Fopius arisanus, Venturia canescen</italic>) and chalcid wasps (<italic>Copidosoma floridanum</italic>, <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, Table S1 and S2). Among Ichneumonoidea wasps, CDCA7 appears to be lost in the Braconidae clade, while CDCA7 appears to have translocated to a different chromosome in <italic>Venturia canescen</italic>. In chalcid wasps, CDCA7 translocated to a genome segment between Artemis (I) and Chromatin accessibility complex protein 1 (CHRC1, J). Together with the chromosome-level genome assembly for <italic>Cotesia glomerata</italic> and <italic>Aphidius gifuensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Feng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Pinto et al., 2021</xref>), the synteny analysis strongly indicates that CDCA7 is lost from braconid wasps. Intriguingly, among those braconid wasps that lost CDCA7, DNMT3 is co-lost in the Microgastrinae linage (<italic>M. demolitor</italic>, <italic>Cotesia glomerata</italic>, <italic>Cotesia typhae</italic>) and <italic>Chelonus insularis</italic>, while DNMT1 and UHRF1 are co-lost in the Opiinae linage (<italic>Fopius arisanus</italic>, <italic>Diachasma alloeum</italic>) and <italic>Aphidius gifuensis</italic> (Table S2). This co-loss of CDCA7 with either DNMT1-UHRF1or DNMT3 in the braconid wasp clade suggests that evolutionary preservation of CDCA7 is more sensitive to DNA methylation status <italic>per se</italic> than to the presence or absence of a particular DNMT subtype.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although DNA methylation is prevalent across eukaryotes, DNA methyltransferases are frequently lost in a variety of lineages. This study reveals that the nucleosome remodeling complex CHIRRC, composed of CDCA7 and HELLS, is frequently lost in conjunction with DNA methylation status. More specifically, evolutionary preservation of CDCA7 is tightly coupled to the preservation of HELLS and DNMT1. The conservation of CDCA7’s signature cysteine residues alongside three ICF-associated residues across diverse eukaryote lineages suggests a unique evolutionary conserved role in DNA methylation. Our co-evolution analysis suggests that DNA methylation-related functionalities of CDCA7 and HELLS are inherited from LECA.</p>
<p>The evolutionary coupling of CDCA7, HELLS and DNMT1 is consistent with a proposed role of HELLS in replication-uncoupled DNA methylation maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ming et al., 2021</xref>). Commonly, DNA methylation maintenance occurs directly behind the DNA replication fork. Replication uncoupled DNA methylation maintenance is distinct from this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Nishiyama et al., 2020</xref>), and HELLS and CDCA7 may be important for the maintenance of DNA methylation long after the completion of DNA replication, particularly at heterochromatin where chromatin has restricted accessibility (Ming et al., 2020).</p>
<p>The loss of CDCA7 is not always coupled to the loss of DNMT1 or HELLS, however. In the Hymenoptera clade, CDCA7 loss in the braconid wasps is accompanied with the loss of DNMT1/UHRF1 or the loss of DNMT3. Among these species, it was reported that 5mC DNA methylation is undetectable in <italic>M. demolitor</italic>, which harbors DNMT1, UHRF1 and HELLS but lost DNMT3 and CDCA7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bewick et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, in the Coleoptera clade, the red flour beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> possesses DNMT1 and HELLS, but lost DNMT3 and CDCA7. Since DNMT1 is essential for the embryonic development of <italic>T. castaneum</italic> and CpG DNA methylation is undetectable in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Schulz et al., 2018</xref>), it has been predicted that DNMT1 has a function independent of DNA methylation in this species. Indeed, species that preserves DNMTs and/or HELLS in the absence of CDCA7 emerge repeatedly during eukaryote evolution, whereas CDCA7 appears to be immediately dispensable in species that have a dampened requirement for DNA methylation. In other words, there is no evolutionary advantage to retain CDCA7 in the absence of DNA methylation, and CDCA7 is almost never maintained in the absence of any DNMTs. Alternatively, could the loss of CDCA7 precede the loss of DNA methylation? If CDCA7 is important to promote DNA methylation maintenance, the loss of CDCA7 may exacerbate an impaired epigenetic environment and stimulate the adaptation of the organism towards DNA methylation-independent epigenetic mechanisms, thereby decreasing the necessity to maintain the DNA methylation system. In this way, the loss of CDCA7 could trigger the subsequent loss of DNMTs (and HELLS), unless these proteins acquired important DNA methylation-independent roles. In line with this scenario, insects possess robust DNA methylation-independent mechanisms (such as piwi-RNA and H3K9me3) to silence transposons and DNA methylation is largely limited to gene bodies in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bonasio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Feng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Libbrecht et al., 2016</xref>). The loss of CDCA7 is more frequently observed in insects than plants or vertebrates, which rely heavily on DNA methylation to silence transposons. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Czech et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Onishi et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, lowering the demand of DNA methylation at transposable elements might reduce the essentiality of CDCA7 (and then perhaps that of DNMTs), though it is difficult to deduce which evolutionary change occurs first.</p>
<p>The observation that some species retain HELLS but lose CDCA7 (while the reverse is never true) suggests that HELLS can evolve a CDCA7-independent function. Indeed, it has been suggested that the sequence-specific DNA-binding protein PRDM9 recruits HELLS to meiotic chromatin to promote DNA double-strand breaks and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Imai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Spruce et al., 2020</xref>). Unlike CDCA7, PRDM proteins are found only in metazoans, and are even lost in some vertebrates such as <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> and <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Birtle and Ponting, 2006</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that HELLS acquires a species-specific CDCA7-independent role during evolution through acquiring a new interaction partner. Another example of this may be found in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, where DNA methylation and CDCA7 are absent and the HELLS homolog Irc5 interacts with cohesin to facilitate its chromatin loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Litwin et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, the role of HELLS in the deposition of the histone variant macroH2A, which compacts chromatin, has been reported in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Ni and Muegge, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Ni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, DDM1 is critical for deposition of H2A.W, which is enriched on heterochromatin, in a manner independent of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Osakabe et al., 2021</xref>). The role of CDCA7 in the deposition of these H2A variants remains to be tested. HELLS and DDM1 can directly interact with macroH2A and H2A.W, respectively, even in the absence of CDCA7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Ni and Muegge, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Osakabe et al., 2021</xref>). It is thus possible that HELLS/DDM1 family proteins have an evolutionary conserved function in H2A variant deposition independent of CDCA7 and DNA methylation. However, there is no clear indication of evolutionary co-selection of HELLS and macroH2A, as macroH2A is largely missing from insects and the chelicerata <italic>Centruroides sculpturatus</italic> has macroH2A but lost HELLS and CDCA7 (XP_023217082, XP_023212717),</p>
<p>Whereas the class I CDCA7-like proteins are evolutionary coupled to HELLS and DNMT1-UHRF1, other variants of zf-4CXXC_R1 are found in many eukaryote clades including Excavata, SAR, Viridiplantae, Amoebazoa, and Fungi. Interestingly, proteins such as IBM1 in Arabidopsis and DMM-1 in Neurospora, which contain both a variant of zf-4CXXC_R1 and the JmjC domain appeared convergently in several clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Saze et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Honda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Functional studies of IBM1 and DMM-1 suggested that they contribute to DNA methylation regulation via indirect mechanisms.</p>
<p>As IBM1 and DMM-1 do not preserve ICF-associated residues, which are critical for nucleosome binding in CDCA7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>), it is likely that these variants of zf-4CXXC_R1 are adapted to recognize different structural features of the genome and no longer preserve the DNA methylation function of CDCA7 orthologs.</p>
<p>Changes in DNA methylation patterns are highly correlated with aging in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lowe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), and may cause diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Greenberg and Bourc’his, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Nishiyama and Nakanishi, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Robertson, 2005</xref>). Mutations in CDCA7, HELLS or DNMT3B cause ICF syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Thijssen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Xu et al., 1999</xref>), which leads to poor life expectancy due to severe infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gossling et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hagleitner et al., 2008</xref>). Considering the importance of DNA methylation in the immune system in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hemmi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kondilis-Mangum and Wade, 2013</xref>), plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Deleris et al., 2016</xref>), and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Vasu and Nagaraja, 2013</xref>), the evolutionary arrival of HELLS-CDCA7 in eukaryotes might have been required to transmit the original immunity-related role of DNA methylation from prokaryotes to nucleosome-containing (eukaryotic) genomes.</p>

<title>Building a curated list of 180 species for analysis of evolutionary co-selection</title>
<p>A list of 180 eukaryote species was manually generated to encompass broad eukaryote evolutionary clades (Table S1). Species were included in this list based on two criteria: (i) the identification UBA1 and PCNA homologs, two highly conserved and essential proteins for cell proliferation; and (ii) the identification of more than 6 distinct SNF2 family sequences. Homologs of CDCA7, HELLS, UBA1 and PCNA were identified by BLAST search against the Genbank eukaryote protein database available at National Center for Biotechnology Information using the human protein sequence as a query (NCBI). Homologs of human UHRF1, ZBTB24, SMARCA2/SMARCA4, INO80, RAD54L, EZH2, EED or Suz12 were also identified based on the RBH criterion. To get a sense of genome assembly level of each genome sequence, we divided “Total Sequence Length” by “Contig N50” (“length such that sequence contigs of this length or longer include half the bases of the assembly”; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/help/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/help/</ext-link>). In the species whose genome assembly level is labeled as “complete”, this value is close to the total number of chromosomes or linkage groups. As such, as a rule of thumb, we arbitrarily defined the genome assembly “preliminary”, if this value is larger than 100. In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, these species with preliminary-level genome assembly were noted as boxes with dotted outlines.</p>

<title>CDCA7 homolog identification and annotation</title>
<p>The obtained list of CDCA7 homologs was further classified as Class I, Class II or Class III homologs based on the distinct characteristics of the zf-4CXXC_R1 motif, as described in Results, where Class I homologs are considered to be orthologs of human CDCA7. The classification of CDCA7 homologs was further validated based on their clustering in a phylogenetic tree built from the CLUSTALW alignment of the zf-4CXXC_R1 motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Higgins and Sharp, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Thompson et al., 1994</xref>) (Fig S1), using MacVector (MacVector, Inc.).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title>HELLS homolog identification and annotation</title>
<p>Putative HELLS orthologs were identified according to the RBH criterion. Briefly, a BLAST search was conducted using human HELLS as the query sequence, after which protein sequences of obtained top hits (or secondary hits, if necessary) in each search were used as a query sequence to conduct reciprocal BLAST search against the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> protein database. If the top hit in the reciprocal search returned the original input sequence (i.e. human HELLS), it was annotated as an orthologous protein. If HELLS showed up as a next best hit, it is temporally listed as a “potential HELLS ortholog”. To further validate the identified HELLS orthologs, full length amino acid sequences of these proteins were aligned using CLUSTALW in MacVector with homologs of SMARCA2/SMARCA4, CHD1, ISWI, RAD54L, ATRX, HLTF, TTF2, SHPRH, INO80, SMARCAD1, SWR1, MOT1, ERCC6, and SMARCAL1, which were also identified and temporarily annotated with a similar reciprocal BLAST search methods (Fig. S3). This alignment was used to define the conserved SNF2 domain and variable linker regions in the putative HELLS orthologs, which were then removed to conduct the secondary CLUSTALW alignment in MacVector, from which a phylogenetic tree was generated. Distinct cluster of HELLS and other SNF2 family proteins can be identified from the phylogenetic tree, hence confirming that the annotation of HELLS orthologs based on the reciprocal BLAST search method is reasonable (Fig. S4). Exceptions are <italic>Leucosporidium creatinivorum</italic> ORY88017 and ORY88018, which classified within the HELLS clade of the phylogenetic tree. However, we decided to annotate <italic>L. creatinivorum</italic> ORY88017 and ORY88018 as HELLS orthologs since among other <italic>L. creatinivorum</italic> SNF2-family proteins in this species these two proteins are most similar to human HELLS while clear orthologs of other <italic>L. creatinivorum</italic> SNF2 family proteins, CHD1(ORY55731), ISWI(ORY89162), SMARCA2/4(ORY76015), SRCAP/SWR1(ORY90750) and INO80(ORY91599), can be identified.</p>

<title>DNMT homolog identification and annotation</title>
<p>Proteins with a DNA methyltransferase domain were identified with BLAST searches using human DNMT1 and DNMT3A. If necessary, additional BLAST searches was conducted using human DNMT2, <italic>C. neoformans</italic> DNMT5, <italic>N. crassa</italic> Dim-2 and DNMT4.

<title>Co-PAP</title>
<p>The published method was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cohen et al., 2013</xref>). The curated list of orthologous proteins listed in Table S1 was first used to generate a presence-absence FASTA file. Next, a phylogenetic species tree was generated from all orthologous protein sequences listed in Table S1 using the ETE3 toolkit. For this, protein sequences were retrieved using the rentrez Bioconductor package and exported to a FASTA file alongside a COG file containing gene to orthologous group mappings. ETE3 was used with the parameters <italic>-w clustalo_default-trimal01-none-none</italic> and <italic>-m cog_all-alg_concat_default-fasttree_default</italic> and the resulting tree exported in Newark format. COPAP was run using default parameters and results visualised using Cytoscape. Code and files required for COPAP input generation as well COPAP parameters and output results can be found in our Github repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/RockefellerUniversity/Copap_Analysis">https://github.com/RockefellerUniversity/Copap_Analysis</ext-link>).</p>
<p>As negative and positive controls for the Co-PAP analysis, we identified several well-conserved protein orthologs across the panel of 180 eukaryotic species, including Snf2-like proteins SMARCA2/SMARCA4, INO80, and RAD54L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Flaus et al., 2006</xref>), as well as subunits of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which plays an evolutionary conserved role in gene repression via deposition of the H3K27me3 mark. PRC2 is conserved in species where DNMTs are absent (including in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>) but is frequently lost particularly in several lineages of SAR and Fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Sharaf et al., 2022</xref>). Among the four core subunits of PRC2, we focused on the catalytic subunit EZH1/2, EED, and SUZ12, since the fourth subunit RbAp46/48 has a PRC2-independent role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>). We are aware that the reciprocal BLAST search missed previously reported highly divergent functional orthologs of SUZ12 in <italic>Neurospora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jamieson et al., 2013</xref>), and EED and Suz12 in <italic>Paramecium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Miro-Pina et al., 2022</xref>). However, we did not attempt to use these divergent homologs of EED and SUZ12 as baits to expand our search in order to consistently apply our homology-based definition of orthologs.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> manuscript reveals signatures of co-evolution of two nucleosome remodeling factors, Lsh/HELLS and CDCA7, which are involved in the regulation of eukaryotic DNA methylation. The results suggest that the roles for the two factors in DNA methylation maintenance pathways can be traced back to the last eukaryotic common ancestor and that the CDC7A-HELLS-DNMT axis shaped the evolutionary retention of DNA methylation in eukaryotes. The evolutionary analyses are <bold>solid</bold>, although more refined phylogenetic approaches could have strengthened some of the claims. Overall, this study could be used by researchers studying DNA methylation pathways in different organisms, and it should be of general interest to colleagues in the fields of evolutionary biology, chromatin biology and genome biology.</p>

<p>Overall, I find the work performed by the authors very interesting. However, the authors have not always included literature that seems relevant to their study. For instance, I do not understand why two papers Dunican et al 2013 and Dunican et al 2015, which provide important insight into Lsh/HELLS function in mouse, frog and fish were not cited. It is also important that the authors are specific about what is known and in particular about what is not known about CDCA7 function in DNA methylation regulation. Unless I am mistaken, there is currently only one study (Velasco et al 2018) investigating the effect of CDCA7 disruption on DNA methylation levels (in ICF3 patient lymphoblastoid cell lines) on a genome-wide scale (Illumina 450K arrays). Unoki et al 2019 report that CDCA7 and HELLS gene knockout in human HEK293T cells moderately and extremely reduces DNA methylation levels at pericentromeric satellite-2 and centromeric alpha-satellite repeats, respectively. No other loci were investigated, and it is therefore not known whether a CDCA7-associated maintenance methylation phenotype extends beyond (peri)centromeric satellites. Thijssen et al performed siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (differentiated cells) and showed that lower levels of Zbtb24, Cdca7 and Hells protein correlate with reduced minor satellite repeat methylation, thereby implicating these factors in mouse minor satellite repeat DNA methylation maintenance. Furthermore, studies that demonstrate a HELLS-CDCA7 interaction are currently limited to Xenopus egg extract (Jenness et al 2018) and the human HEK293 cell line (Unoki et al 2019). Whether such an interaction exists in any other organism and is of relevance to DNA methylation mechanisms remains to be determined. Therefore, in my opinion, the conclusion that &quot;Our co-evolution analysis suggests that DNA methylation-related functionalities of CDCA7 and HELLS are inherited from LECA&quot; should be softened, as the evidence for this scenario is not very compelling and seems premature in the absence of molecular data from more species.</p>
<p>The authors used BLAST searches to characterize the evolutionary conservation of CDCA7 family proteins in vertebrates. From Figure 2A, it seems that they identify a LEDGF binding motif in CDCA7/JPO1. Is this correct and if yes, could you please elaborate and show this result? This is interesting and important to clarify because previous literature (Tesina et al 2015) reports a LEDGF binding motif only in CDCA7L/JPO2.</p>
<p>To provide evidence for a potential evolutionary co-selection of CDCA7, HELLS and the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) the authors performed CoPAP analysis. Throughout the manuscript, it is unclear to me what the authors mean when referring to &quot;DNMT3&quot;. In the Material and Methods section, the authors mention that human DNMT3A was used in BLAST searches to identify proteins with DNA methyltransferase domains. Does this mean that &quot;DNMT3&quot; should be DNMT3A? And if yes, should &quot;DNMT3&quot; be corrected to &quot;DNMT3A&quot;? Is there a reason that &quot;DNMT3A&quot; was chosen for the BLAST searches?</p>
<p>CoPAP analysis revealed that CDCA7 and HELLS are dynamically lost in the Hymenoptera clade and either co-occurs with DNMT3 or DNMT1/UHRF1 loss, which seems important. Unfortunately, the authors do not provide sufficient information in their figures or supplementary data about what is already known regarding DNA methylation levels in the different Hymenoptera species to further consider a potential impact of this observation. What is &quot;the DNA methylation status&quot; of all these organisms? This information cannot be easily retrieved from Table S2. A clearer presentation of what is actually known already would improve this paragraph.</p>
<p>Furthermore, A. thaliana DDM1, and mouse and human Lsh/Hells are known to preferably promote DNA methylation at satellite repeats, transposable elements and repetitive regions of the genome. On the other hand, DNA methylation in insects and other invertebrates occurs in genic rather than intergenic regions and transposable elements (e.g. Bewick et al 2017; Werren JH PlosGenetics 2013). It would be helpful to elaborate on these differences.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Funabiki and colleagues investigated the co-evolution of DNA methylation and nucleosome remolding in eukaryotes. This study is motivated by several observations: (1) despite being ancestrally derived, many eukaryotes lost DNA methylation and/or DNA methyltransferases; (2) over many genomic loci, the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation relies on a conserved nucleosome remodeling complex composed of CDCA7 and HELLS; (3) it remains unknown if/how this functional link influenced the evolution of DNA methylation. The authors hypothesize that if CDCA7-HELLS function was required for DNA methylation in the last eukaryote common ancestor, this should be accompanied by signatures of co-evolution during eukaryote radiation.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, they first set out to investigate the presence/absence of putative functional orthologs of CDCA7, HELLS and DNMTs across major eukaryotic clades. They succeed in identifying homologs of these genes in all clades spanning 180 species. To annotate putative functional orthologs, they use similarity over key functional domains and residues such as ICF related mutations for CDCA7 and SNF2 domains for HELLS. Using established eukaryote phylogenies, the authors conclude that the CDCA7-HELLS-DNMT axis arose in the last common ancestor to all eukaryotes. Importantly, they found recurrent loss events of CDCA7-HELLS-DNMT in at least 40 eukaryotic species, most of them lacking DNA methylation.</p>
<p>Having identified these factors, they successfully identify signatures of co-evolution between DNMTs, CDCA7 and HELLS using CoPAP analysis - a probabilistic model inferring the likelihood of interactions between genes given a set of presence/absence patterns. As a control, such interactions are not detected with other remodelers or chromatin modifying pathways also found across eukaryotes. Expanding on this analysis, the authors found that CDCA7 was more likely to be lost in species without DNA methylation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the authors suggest that the CDCA7-HELLS-DNMT axis is ancestral in eukaryotes and raise the hypothesis that CDCA7 becomes quickly dispensable upon the loss of DNA methylation and/or that CDCA7 might be the first step toward the switch from DNA methylation-based genome regulation to other modes.</p>
<p>The data and analyses reported are significant and solid. However, using more refined phylogenetic approaches could have strengthened the orthologous relationships presented. Overall, this work is a conceptual advance in our understanding of the evolutionary coupling between nucleosome remolding and DNA methylation. It also provides a useful resource to study the early origins of DNA methylation related molecular process. Finally, it brings forward the interesting hypothesis that since eukaryotes are faced with the challenge of performing DNA methylation in the context of nucleosome packed DNA, loosing factors such as CDCA7-HELLS likely led to recurrent innovations in chromatin-based genome regulation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The hypothesis linking nucleosome remodeling and the evolution of DNA methylation.</p>
<p>
- Deep mapping of DNA methylation related process in eukaryotes.</p>
<p>
- Identification and evolutionary trajectories of novel homologs/orthologs of CDCA7.</p>
<p>
- Identification of CDCA7-HELLS-DNMT co-evolution across eukaryotes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Orthology assignment based on protein similarity.</p>
<p>
- No statistical support for the topologies of gene/proteins trees (figure S1, S3, S4, S6) which could have strengthened the hypothesis of shared ancestry.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overall, I find the work performed by the authors very interesting. However, the authors have not always included literature that seems relevant to their study. For instance, I do not understand why two papers Dunican et al 2013 and Dunican et al 2015, which provide important insight into Lsh/HELLS function in mouse, frog and fish were not cited. It is also important that the authors are specific about what is known and in particular about what is not known about CDCA7 function in DNA methylation regulation. Unless I am mistaken, there is currently only one study (Velasco et al 2018) investigating the effect of CDCA7 disruption on DNA methylation levels (in ICF3 patient lymphoblastoid cell lines) on a genome-wide scale (Illumina 450K arrays). Unoki et al 2019 report that CDCA7 and HELLS gene knockout in human HEK293T cells moderately and extremely reduces DNA methylation levels at pericentromeric satellite-2 and centromeric alpha-satellite repeats, respectively. No other loci were investigated, and it is therefore not known whether a CDCA7-associated maintenance methylation phenotype extends beyond (peri)centromeric satellites. Thijssen et al performed siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (differentiated cells) and showed that lower levels of Zbtb24, Cdca7 and Hells protein correlate with reduced minor satellite repeat methylation, thereby implicating these factors in mouse minor satellite repeat DNA methylation maintenance. Furthermore, studies that demonstrate a HELLS-CDCA7 interaction are currently limited to Xenopus egg extract (Jenness et al 2018) and the human HEK293 cell line (Unoki et al 2019). Whether such an interaction exists in any other organism and is of relevance to DNA methylation mechanisms remains to be determined. Therefore, in my opinion, the conclusion that &quot;Our co-evolution analysis suggests that DNA methylation-related functionalities of CDCA7 and HELLS are inherited from LECA&quot; should be softened, as the evidence for this scenario is not very compelling and seems premature in the absence of molecular data from more species.</p>

<p>We appreciate this reviewer’s thorough reading of our manuscript.</p>
<p>Regarding the citation issues, we will cite Dunican 2013 and Dunican 2015.</p>
<p>As pointed out by the reviewer, the role of CDCA7 in genome DNA methylation was extensively studied in Velasco et al 2018. The result, together with Thijssen et al (2015), and Unoki et al. (2018), supports the idea that ZBTB24, CDCA7 and HELLS act within the same pathway to promote DNA methylation, the pattern of which is overlapping but distinct from DNMT3B-mediated methylation. This observation suggests that a ZBTB24-CDCA7-HELLS mechanism for DNA methylation may involve an alternative DNMT. Interestingly, our analysis of the gene presence-absence pattern revealed that the presence of CDCA7 coincides with DNMT1 more than DNMT3 genes. Indeed, while CDCA7 is lost from diverse branches of eukaryote species, genomes encoding CDCA7 always encode HELLS, and almost always encode DNMT1. Based on this observation, we speculate the role of CDCA7 is tightly linked to HELLS and DNA methylation throughout evolution.</p>
<p>As pointed out by Reviewer 1, the link between CDCA7, HELLS and DNA methylation has not been determined experimentally across these species. However, based on our previously published and unpublished data, we are confident about the functional interaction between CDCA7 and HELLS in Xenopus laevis and Homo sapiens. Furthermore, the importance of HELLS homologs in DNA methylation has been extensively studied in human, mouse and plants. We hope our current study will motivate the field to experimentally test the evolutionary conservation of HELLS-CDCA7 interaction, as well as their importance in DNA methylation, in other species.</p>

<p>The authors used BLAST searches to characterize the evolutionary conservation of CDCA7 family proteins in vertebrates. From Figure 2A, it seems that they identify a LEDGF binding motif in CDCA7/JPO1. Is this correct and if yes, could you please elaborate and show this result? This is interesting and important to clarify because previous literature (Tesina et al 2015) reports a LEDGF binding motif only in CDCA7L/JPO2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We searched for a LEDGF binding motif ({E/D}-X-E-X-F-X-G-F, also known as IBM described in Tesina et al 2015) in vertebrate CDCA7 proteins, and reported their position in Figure 2A. Examples of identified LEDGF-binding motifs will be presented.</p>

<p>To provide evidence for a potential evolutionary co-selection of CDCA7, HELLS and the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) the authors performed CoPAP analysis. Throughout the manuscript, it is unclear to me what the authors mean when referring to &quot;DNMT3&quot;. In the Material and Methods section, the authors mention that human DNMT3A was used in BLAST searches to identify proteins with DNA methyltransferase domains. Does this mean that &quot;DNMT3&quot; should be DNMT3A? And if yes, should &quot;DNMT3&quot; be corrected to &quot;DNMT3A&quot;? Is there a reason that &quot;DNMT3A&quot; was chosen for the BLAST searches?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described in the Methods section, both Human DNMT1 and DNMT3A were used to initially identify any proteins containing a domain homologous to the DNA methyltransferase catalytic domain. Within Metazoa, if their orthologs exist, the top hit from BLAST search using human DNMT1 and DNMT3A show E-value 0.0, and thus their orthology is robust. This is even true for DNMT1 and DNMT3 homologs in the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica, which is one of the earliest-branching metazoan species. For other DNMTs, such as DNMT2, DNMT4, DNMT6, we conducted separate BLAST searches using those proteins as baits as described in Methods. The domain was then isolated using the NCBI conserved domains search. The selected DNMT domain sequences were aligned with CLUSTALW to generate a phylogenetic tree to further classify DNMTs (Figure S6). It has been suggested that vertebrate DNMT3A and DNMT3B are derived from duplication of a DNMT3 gene of chordates ancestor (e.g., Liu et al 2020, PMID 31969623). As such many invertebrates encode only one DNMT3. As previously shown (Yaari et al., 2019, PMID 30962443), plants have two distinct DNMT3-like protein family, the ‘true DNMT3’ and DRM, the plant specific de novo DNMT that is often considered to be a DNMT3 homolog (see Reviewer 2’s comment). Our phylogenetic analysis successfully deviated the clade of DNMT3 and DRM from the rest of DNMTs (Figure S6). Yaari et al noted that PpDNMT3a and PpDNMT3b, the two DNMT3 orthologs encoded by the basal plant Physcomitrella patens, are not orthologs of mammalian DNMT3A and DNMT3B, respectively. Therefore, to minimize such nomenclature confusions, any DNMTs that belong to either the DNMT3 or DRM clades indicated in Figure S6 are collectively referred to as ‘DNMT3’ throughout the paper (see Figure S2 for overview).</p>

<p>CoPAP analysis revealed that CDCA7 and HELLS are dynamically lost in the Hymenoptera clade and either co-occurs with DNMT3 or DNMT1/UHRF1 loss, which seems important. Unfortunately, the authors do not provide sufficient information in their figures or supplementary data about what is already known regarding DNA methylation levels in the different Hymenoptera species to further consider a potential impact of this observation. What is &quot;the DNA methylation status&quot; of all these organisms? This information cannot be easily retrieved from Table S2. A clearer presentation of what is actually known already would improve this paragraph.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the DNA methylation status of the species in the Hymenoptera clade has not been comprehensively tested, this precluded us from adding this information to Figure 7. However, we have included the published reports of DNA methylation status for these species in Supplementary Table S2 (see column ‘5mC’; species for which 5mC is detected are marked with Y and the relevant PMID). As indicated, DNA methylation was detected in most tested species except for Microplitis demolitor. Many of these data are based on Bewick et al. 2017 (PMID 28025279). During the preparation of this response, we realized that the DNA methylation status reported for some species in Bewick et al. was inferred from the CpG frequency instead of the direct experimental detection of methylated cytosines. Therefore, we have amended Table S2 to indicate the presence of DNA methylation only for those species where this was experimentally tested. As such, we now consider the DNA methylation status of Fopius arisanus, which lacks DNMT1 and CDCA7, to be unknown. In addition, we realized that Bewick et al. reported that DNA methylation is absent in Aphidius ervi. We originally conducted synteny analysis on Aphidius gifuensis, which lacks DNMT1 and CDCA7, since Aphidius ervi protein data were not available in NCBI. By conducting tBLASTn search against the Aphidius ervi genome, we confirmed that the presence and absence pattern of CDCA7, HELLS, DNMT1, DNMT3 and UHRF1 in Aphidius ervi is identical to that of Aphidius gifuensis. In other words, DNA methylation is known to be absent in Aphidius ervi, which has lost DNMT1 and CDCA7. Altogether, among the 17 Hymenoptera species that we analyzed (listed in the amended Table S2), the 6 species that have detectable DNA methylation all encode CDCA7, whereas the 2 species that do not have detectable DNA methylation lack CDCA7. We will note this finding in the revised text.</p>

<p>Furthermore, A. thaliana DDM1, and mouse and human Lsh/Hells are known to preferably promote DNA methylation at satellite repeats, transposable elements and repetitive regions of the genome. On the other hand, DNA methylation in insects and other invertebrates occurs in genic rather than intergenic regions and transposable elements (e.g. Bewick et al 2017; Werren JH PlosGenetics 2013). It would be helpful to elaborate on these differences.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This point was discussed in the third paragraph of the Discussion, but we will better highlight this. It should be noted that, in the Arabidopsis ddm1 mutant, reduction of CG methylation of gene bodies is common (50% of all methylated euchromatic genes) (Zemach et al, 2013). In addition, hypomethylation is not limited to satellite repeats and transposable elements in ICF patients defective in HELLS or CDCA7 (Velasco et al., 2018).</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Funabiki and colleagues investigated the co-evolution of DNA methylation and nucleosome remolding in eukaryotes. This study is motivated by several observations: (1) despite being ancestrally derived, many eukaryotes lost DNA methylation and/or DNA methyltransferases; (2) over many genomic loci, the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation relies on a conserved nucleosome remodeling complex composed of CDCA7 and HELLS; (3) it remains unknown if/how this functional link influenced the evolution of DNA methylation. The authors hypothesize that if CDCA7-HELLS function was required for DNA methylation in the last eukaryote common ancestor, this should be accompanied by signatures of co-evolution during eukaryote radiation.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The data and analyses reported are significant and solid. However, using more refined phylogenetic approaches could have strengthened the orthologous relationships presented. Overall, this work is a conceptual advance in our understanding of the evolutionary coupling between nucleosome remolding and DNA methylation. It also provides a useful resource to study the early origins of DNA methylation related molecular process. Finally, it brings forward the interesting hypothesis that since eukaryotes are faced with the challenge of performing DNA methylation in the context of nucleosome packed DNA, loosing factors such as CDCA7-HELLS likely led to recurrent innovations in chromatin-based genome regulation.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewers’ accurate summary, nicely emphasizing the importance of the our study. We agree that better phylogenetic analysis for orthology assignment will strengthen our conclusion, and we would like to explore this. Having anticipated this weakness, we specifically conducted a CoPAP analysis exclusively for Ecdysozoa species, where orthology assignment is straightforward, which supported our major conclusion. (For example, if we conduct BLAST search the clonal raider ant Oocerea biroi using human HELLS as a query, top 1 hit is a protein sequence annotated as one of three isoforms of ‘lymphoid-specific helicase” (i.e., HELLS), with E value 0.0. Similarly, top BLAST hit from Oocerea biroi using human DNMT1 as a query also returns with isoforms of DNMT1 with E value 0.0. As such, there are little disputes in orthology assignment in Ecdysozoa. Outside of Chordata, regardless of the alternative methods employed for orthology assignment, this will never be perfect (particularly in Excavata and SAR). Our current orthology assignment for the major targets in this study (HELLS, DNMT1, DNMT3, DNMT5) is largely consistent with published results (Ponger et al., 2005 PMID 15689527; Huff et al, 2014 PMID 24630728; Yaari et al., 2019 PMID 30962443; Bewick et al., 2019 PMID 30778188). However, while we are preparing this response and re-crosschecking our assignments with these references, we realized that we erroneously missed DNMT5 orthologs of Leucosporidium creatinivorum, Postia placenta, Armillaria gallica and Saitoella complicata., and DNMT6 ortholog from Fragilariopsis cylindrus. We also had recognized that DNMT4 orthologs were identified in Fragilariopsis cylindrus and Thalassiosira pseudonana In Huff et al 2014 (PMID 24630728), but in our phylogenetic analysis, these proteins form a distinct clade between DNMT1/Dim-2 and DNMT4 (Figure S6). Due to this ambiguity, we did not count them as DNMT1 or DNMT4 in our CoPAP analysis. These minor errors and ambiguity should not affect our presence-absence pattern in our original CoPAP analysis, and thus we feel that further refinement is unlikely to significantly affect our major conclusion.</p>
