<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The PINOID (PID) protein kinase is required for flower initiation in Arabidopsis. The <italic>pid</italic> mutants fail to initiate flowers on inflorescences, a phenotype that is mimicked by disrupting either the <italic>NAKED PINS IN YUC MUTANTS</italic> (<italic>NPY)</italic> gene family or <italic>PIN FORMED 1</italic> (<italic>PIN1</italic>). Both PID and NPY1 have been reported to positively modulate PIN-mediated polar auxin transport. Here, we show that overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> (<italic>NPY1 OE</italic>) completely suppressed <italic>pid</italic> null mutants, demonstrating that <italic>NPY1</italic> functions downstream of <italic>PID</italic>. <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> triggered phosphorylation of PIN proteins at multiple sites that are mostly different from the previously characterized phosphorylation sites regardless of the presence of <italic>PID</italic>. Phosphorylation of the newly identified PIN sites in <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> plants likely leads to the inhibition of PIN functions, as we previously showed that <italic>pid</italic> is suppressed by decreasing <italic>PIN1</italic> gene dosage or decreasing PIN1 activity. Furthermore, we show that the Ser/Thr rich C-terminal motif in NPY1 is phosphorylated and is required for <italic>pid</italic> suppression by <italic>NPY1 OE.</italic> Overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> that lacked the C-terminal motif (<italic>NPY1ΔC</italic>) failed to rescue <italic>pid</italic>, but overexpression of <italic>NPY1ΔC</italic> was still able to trigger phosphorylation of PIN proteins including PIN2, which is known to cause agravitropic roots when mutated. <italic>NPY1ΔC</italic> overexpression plants displayed a complete loss of root gravitropic response, likely caused by PIN2 phosphorylation. Our results suggest a pathway for auxin mediated-flower initiation, in which PID regulates NPY1 accumulation and/or activity, and subsequently, NPY1 triggers phosphorylation of PIN proteins and inhibition of PIN functions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Auxin is required for flower initiation in Arabidopsis and other plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cheng and Zhao, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</xref>). Several Arabidopsis mutants and mutant combinations fail to initiate flowers on inflorescences, despite the fact that they can undergo the normal transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth, resulting in the formation of pin-like inflorescences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bennett et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Przemeck et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Galweiler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>). All of the known pin-like Arabidopsis mutants are caused by defects in some aspects of auxin biology. <italic>PIN-FORMED 1</italic> (<italic>PIN1</italic>) was the first characterized gene that causes the formation of pin-like inflorescences when compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Galweiler et al., 1998</xref>). PIN1 is an auxin efflux carrier that transports auxin from the cytosol into the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Plants grown on media containing the polar auxin transport inhibitor N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) phenocopy <italic>pin1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Okada et al., 1991</xref>). It has been shown that NPA can directly bind to PIN1 to inhibit auxin transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Disruption of <italic>PINOID</italic> (<italic>PID</italic>), which encodes a Ser/Thr protein kinase, also leads to the formation of pin-like inflorescences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Smyth and Alvarez, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Christensen et al., 2000</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>PID</italic> leads to phenotypes similar to the well-characterized auxin resistant mutants, linking <italic>PID</italic> functions to auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Christensen et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>NAKED PINS IN YUC MUTANTS 1</italic>(<italic>NPY1)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>), which is also called <italic>ENHANCER OF PINOID</italic> (<italic>ENP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Treml et al., 2005</xref>) and <italic>MACCHI-BOU 4</italic> (<italic>MAB4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Furutani et al., 2007</xref>), was isolated from genetic screens for <italic>pid</italic> enhancers and for enhancers of <italic>yuc1 yuc4</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>), which are defective in auxin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>). The <italic>yuc1 yuc4 npy1</italic> triple mutants produce pin-like inflorescences similar to those in <italic>pin1</italic> and <italic>pid</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>). Inactivation of <italic>NPY1</italic> and its close homologs <italic>NPY3</italic> and <italic>NPY5</italic> also causes the failure of floral initiation from inflorescences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>). The <italic>yuc1 yuc2 yuc4 yuc6</italic> quadruple mutants also develop small pin-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the aforementioned genes are known to participate in auxin-mediated flower development, the mechanisms by which the genes regulate floral development and the relationships between them are not fully understood. The predominant model regarding the relationship among <italic>PIN1</italic>, <italic>PID</italic>, and <italic>NPY</italic> genes is centered on regulating PIN polarity, localization, and activity by PID and NPY proteins. It was reported that PID directly phosphorylates the hydrophilic loop of PIN proteins, resulting in changes in PIN polarity and activation of PIN-mediated auxin export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Friml et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Michniewicz et al., 2007</xref>). NPYs were suggested to regulate PIN internalization through the endocytosis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Furutani et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, it was reported that NPY1, PID, and PIN1 form a protein complex at the plasma membrane and that the recruitment of NPYs to the plasma-membrane by PIN limits the lateral diffusion of PINs, thus maintaining PIN polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Glanc et al., 2021</xref>). Phosphorylation of PIN by PID enhances the recruitment of NPY to plasma membrane, which then promotes PIN phosphorylation by recruiting or interacting with AGC kinases, thus forming a self-reinforcing loop to maintain PIN polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Glanc et al., 2021</xref>). Other protein kinases including D6 PROTEIN KINASE are also involved in phosphorylating PIN proteins and activating PIN-mediated auxin transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Willige et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Barbosa et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, we discovered that <italic>pid</italic> null mutant phenotypes were suppressed when one copy of the <italic>PIN1</italic> gene is inactivated (heterozygous <italic>pin1</italic> mutants) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mudgett et al., 2023</xref>). The <italic>pid</italic> null mutants were also suppressed by the PIN1-GFPHDR fusion in which <italic>GFP</italic> was precisely inserted into the <italic>PIN1</italic> gene via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mudgett et al., 2023</xref>). PIN1-GFPHDR is less active than wild type (WT) PIN1, indicating that <italic>pid</italic> is suppressed by lowering either PIN1 activity or <italic>PIN1</italic> gene dosage. This new type of genetic interaction between <italic>pid</italic> and <italic>pin1,</italic> called haplo-complementation, renders <italic>PID</italic> unnecessary for flower development when expressing only 50% of <italic>PIN1</italic>, whereas the presence of 0% or 100% <italic>PIN1</italic> makes <italic>PID</italic> essential. The observed genetic interaction between <italic>pid</italic> and <italic>pin1</italic> suggests a much more complex relationship between the two genes than the current model of PIN1 phosphorylation by PID directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mudgett et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, it was known that <italic>pid</italic> mutants produce more cotyledons and true leaves than wild type plants whereas <italic>pin1</italic> mutants make fewer cotyledons and fewer true leaves compared to wild type plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bennett et al., 1995</xref>). The opposite cotyledon/true leaf phenotypes of <italic>pid</italic> and <italic>pin1</italic> cannot be accounted for by PID-mediated direct phosphorylation/activation of PIN1.</p>
<p>In this study, we analyzed the dosage effects of <italic>NPY1</italic> on <italic>pid</italic> phenotypes. We show that overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> (<italic>NPY1 OE</italic>) completely suppressed <italic>pid</italic> null mutants, demonstrating that <italic>NPY1</italic> and <italic>PIN1</italic> have opposite dosage effects on <italic>pid</italic> mutants. Furthermore, we find that <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> led to an increase of PIN phosphorylation, suggesting that <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> -triggered PIN phosphorylation actual inhibits PIN functions. Moreover, we discovered that the C-terminal motif of NPY1, which contains 30 amino acid residues with 50% Ser/Thr, is required for suppression of <italic>pid</italic> by <italic>NPY1 OE</italic>. Overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> that lacked the C-terminal motif (<italic>NPY1ΔC</italic>) did not suppress <italic>pid</italic>, but caused auxin resistance and a complete loss of gravitropism. Overexpression of <italic>NPY1ΔC</italic> also increased phosphorylation of PIN proteins including PIN2, which causes agravitropic roots when mutated, further suggesting that phosphorylation of certain residues/regions of PIN proteins inhibits PIN functions. Our results demonstrated that NPY1 functions downstream of PID during flower development. In addition, our results indicate that NPY1 affects PIN phosphorylation, which inhibits PIN function and which may account for the suppression of <italic>pid</italic> by <italic>NPY1 OE</italic>.</p>

<title>Protein null pin1 mutants further confirm haplo-complementation of pid mutants by pin1</title>
<p>We previously showed that <italic>pid</italic> null mutants were rescued by either PIN1-GFPHDR fusion or the presence of only one copy of functional <italic>PIN1</italic> gene, suggesting that a reduction of PIN1 activity or <italic>PIN1</italic> gene dosage is sufficient to restore the fertility of <italic>pid</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mudgett et al., 2023</xref>). Because the <italic>pin1</italic> mutants in our previous study had the potential to produce truncated PIN1 proteins, we could not completely rule out the possibility that the predicted truncated PIN1 proteins might have played a role in rescuing <italic>pid</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mudgett et al., 2023</xref>). To further clarify the mechanisms of rescuing <italic>pid</italic> by heterozygous <italic>pin1</italic> mutants, we used CRIPSR/Cas9 to delete the coding region of <italic>PIN1</italic> so that no truncated PIN1 proteins would be produced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We obtained two <italic>pin1</italic> mutants, which lacked almost the entire coding region of <italic>PIN1</italic> and which were unlikely to produce any truncated PIN1 proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The two <italic>pin1</italic> mutants displayed strong pin-like phenotypes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> &amp; 1C). In the heterozygous <italic>pin1</italic> mutant backgrounds, the <italic>pid</italic> null mutants no longer produced <italic>pin</italic>-like inflorescences and were able to set seeds (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> &amp; 1C). Rescuing <italic>pid</italic> by heterozygous <italic>pin1</italic> mutants was not specific to a particular <italic>pid</italic> allele. Both T-DNA insertion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) and CRISPR deletion <italic>pid</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), which were previously described as <italic>pid</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mudgett et al., 2023</xref>), were rescued by the heterozygous <italic>pin1</italic> full deletion mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), demonstrating that <italic>pid</italic> mutants were rescued by a reduction of <italic>PIN1</italic> gene dosage and that suppression of <italic>pid</italic> mutant phenotypes by heterozygous <italic>pin1</italic> mutants in our previous study was not caused by the predicted truncated PIN1 proteins.</p>

<title>NPY1 and PIN1 have different effects on pid mutants - a reduction of NPY1 gene dosage cannot rescue pid</title>
<p>Inactivation of <italic>NPY1</italic> and its close homologs <italic>NPY3</italic> and <italic>NPY5</italic> leads to the development of pin-like inflorescences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, <italic>npy1 pid</italic> double mutants fail to develop any cotyledons, a phenotype that was also observed in <italic>pin1 pid</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Furutani et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Treml et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Furutani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that a reduction of <italic>NPY1</italic> gene dosage might also be able to rescue <italic>pid</italic> mutants. We genotyped F2 plants from a cross of <italic>pid-TD1</italic> and <italic>npy1-2</italic> to identify plants with either <italic>npy1-2 pid-TD1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> or <italic>npy1-2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> <italic>pid-TD1</italic> genotype to investigate the effects of gene dosage on genetic interactions between the two mutants. It was very clear that heterozygous <italic>npy1-2</italic> did not rescue <italic>pid-TD1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, heterozygous <italic>pid-TD1</italic> further enhanced <italic>npy1-2</italic>, which is fertile and which does not produce pin-like structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). Plants with the <italic>npy1-2 pid-TD1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> genotype were essentially sterile and produced pin-like structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). Our results suggest that gene dosage effects of <italic>NPY1</italic> and <italic>PIN1</italic> on <italic>pid</italic> are different.</p>

<title>Dosage effects of NPY1 and PIN1 on pid are opposite - Increased NPY1 gene expression is sufficient to suppress pid null mutants</title>
<p>We placed <italic>NPY1</italic> gene under the control of the <italic>UBIQUITIN 10</italic> promoter to strongly express <italic>NPY1</italic> (named as <italic>NPY1 OE)</italic>. We directly transformed the construct into a <italic>pid-c1</italic> segregation population through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Among the 84 T1 plants we genotyped, we obtained 15 homozygous <italic>pid-c1</italic> mutants. Interestingly, none of the <italic>pid-c1</italic> plants produced any pin-like inflorescences and all were fully fertile, demonstrating that increases of <italic>NPY1</italic> gene expression were sufficient for the suppression of <italic>pid-c1</italic>. We genotyped T2 progenies from two <italic>pid-c1</italic> heterozygous T1 plants (#68 and # 83) for the presence of <italic>pid-c1</italic> and for <italic>pid-c1</italic> zygosity. We used mCherry signal, which was included in the <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> construct, as a proxy to determine the presence and absence of the <italic>NPY1</italic> transgene. For each line, we identified T2 plants without the <italic>NPY1</italic> transgene and without the <italic>pid-c1</italic> mutation (called WT-68 and WT-83, respectively). We also isolated T2 plants that contained the <italic>NPY1</italic> overexpression construct, but did not have the <italic>pid-c1</italic> mutation (called <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> #68 in WT, and <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> #83 in WT). Finally, we identified T2 plants that were <italic>pid-c1</italic> homozygous and that had the <italic>NPY1</italic> transgene (called <italic>NPY1 OE #68</italic> in <italic>pid-c1</italic> and <italic>NPY1 OE #83</italic> in <italic>pid-c1</italic>). These genetic materials enabled us to compare the same <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> transgenic event in different genetic backgrounds.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>, both <italic>NPY1 OE #68</italic> and <italic>#83</italic> lines rescued <italic>pid-c1,</italic> which lacks almost the entire <italic>PID</italic> coding region and which is completely sterile under our laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mudgett et al., 2023</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> in <italic>pid-c1</italic> completely eliminated the development of pin-like inflorescences and led to the production of plenty of fertile siliques (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> lines had notable developmental phenotypes: <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> plants had reduced petiole length and had shorter stature compared to WT plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). At the young adult stage, <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> in WT and in <italic>pid-c1</italic> appeared very similar, suggesting that overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> made <italic>PID</italic> unnecessary for plant development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> lines, regardless of the presence or absence of the <italic>pid-c1</italic> mutation, developed plenty of flowers with normal appearance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). Most flowers from <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> in <italic>pid-c1</italic> plants were normal, but occasionally, some flowers had minor defects such as missing a stamen, or developing fused petals with a stamen-like structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). In comparison to the suppression of <italic>pid</italic> null mutants by PIN1-GFPHDR or heterozygous <italic>pin1,</italic> suppression of <italic>pid-c1</italic> by <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> appeared to be more complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mudgett et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<p>A) The <italic>NPY1</italic> overexpression (OE) line #68 rescues the <italic>pid-c1</italic>, a null allele. Note that <italic>pid-c1</italic> makes pin-like inflorescences and is completely sterile. <italic>pid-c1</italic> no longer makes pin-like structures and is completely fertile when NPY1 protein levels are increased. A second <italic>NPY1</italic> overexpression line (#83) also restored the fertility of <italic>pid-c1</italic> (Supplemental Figure S2). B) NPY1 protein levels in the <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> lines in WT background and in <italic>pid</italic> mutants. In line #68, NPY1 protein level is 8.0-fold higher than WT while line #83 has 9.7-fold higher NPY1 protein level than WT. In the absence of <italic>PID</italic>, overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> leads to slightly lower NPY1 protein levels than the same transgenic event in WT background. C) Overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> leads to an increase of phospho-peptides. The volcano plot shows the fold changes (Log2 scale) of phospho-peptide levels in <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> lines over WT. Data above the horizonal dotted line are statistically significant. The vertical dotted line marks 2-fold change. D) Overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> leads to phosphorylation of PIN proteins. Among the phospho-peptides that displayed the most differences between <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> lines and WT are peptides from NPY1 and PIN proteins. In fact, in the right up-Quadrant in C, the only peptides were from NPY1 and PIN proteins.</p></caption>

<p>We also transformed the <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> construct into <italic>pid-TD1</italic> and <italic>pid-TD2</italic>, which are T-DNA insertional null alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mudgett et al., 2023</xref>). Both <italic>pid</italic> T-DNA mutants were rescued by overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic>, demonstrating that <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> could rescue different types of <italic>pid</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). Some of the siliques in the rescued <italic>pid-TD</italic> plants had only one valve, a phenotype that was likely caused by a partial suppression of <italic>pid-TD</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). Our results demonstrated that overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> rescued <italic>pid</italic> mutants and the suppression of <italic>pid</italic> by <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> was not caused by any background mutations, a particular T-DNA insertion site, or dependence on special <italic>pid</italic> mutations. Our results clearly showed that <italic>NPY1</italic> and <italic>PIN1</italic> had opposite dosage effects on <italic>pid</italic> mutants.</p>

<title>NPY1 protein accumulates less in the absence of PID</title>
<p>We conducted proteomic analysis to determine the expression levels of <italic>NPY1</italic> in the transgenic lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> line #68 in WT, NPY1 protein level increased 8.0-fold compared to non-transgenic WT-68 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The NPY1 protein level was slightly higher in line #83 than in line #68 (9.7-fold vs 8.0-fold) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The same <italic>NPY1</italic> transgenic events also led to elevated NPY1 protein levels in <italic>pid-c1</italic> compared to non-transgenic WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, NPY1 protein levels in the <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> in <italic>pid-c1</italic> plants were significantly lower than <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> in WT. For line #68, NPY1 level was 23% lower in <italic>pid-c1</italic> than in <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> in WT. In line #83, NPY1 protein level was 18.5% lower in <italic>pid-c1</italic> than in WT. Our results suggest that PID likely plays a role in regulating NPY1 protein accumulation.</p>

<title>NPY1 is phosphorylated and the phosphorylation of NPY1 does not require PID</title>
<p>We identified 15 phospho-peptide of NPY1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). Among the phosphorylation sites identified, most of them were located in the peptide ANHSPVASVAASSHSPVEK, which has five serine residues and which is located immediately downstream of the conserved NPH3 domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). Previous studies have identified two phosphorylation sites in NPY1: S514 and S553 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Matthes et al., 2024</xref>). We also detected that S553 was phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, we identified a couple of phospho-serine residues outside of the C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, S181 is located in a highly conserved WSYT motif and is located in the region between the BTB domain and the NPH3 domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). The S181 residue is conserved among all NPY proteins, but in NPH3, the serine residue is replaced with an alanine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>In the absence of PID, all of the 15 phospho-peptide of NPY1 were still phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). Quantitatively, all of the peptides except LHEASVK had lower phosphorylation levels in <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> in <italic>pid</italic> plants than in <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> in WT plants. But given that in <italic>pid</italic>, NPY1 protein concentrations were about 20% lower than in WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), the observed differences in phosphorylation levels could be caused by a decrease of NPY1 protein concentration in <italic>pid</italic>.</p>

<p>The phospho-peptides AGLQVDNGANEQVGKsDQGGAK from PIN7 and AGLNVFGGAPDNDQGGRsDQGAK from PIN3 were about 6-fold higher in <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> lines than in WT (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

<p>The absence of <italic>PID</italic> hardly affected PIN phosphorylation triggered by <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which was consistent with our previous analysis that phosphorylation levels of PIN proteins in <italic>pid</italic> PIN1-GFPHDR plants were not affected compared to WT plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mudgett et al., 2023</xref>). We noticed that previous studies uncovered four highly conserved phosphorylation sites in PIN proteins, which are named as S1, S2, S3, and S4 sites and which correspond to S231, S252, S290, and S271 in PIN1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barbosa et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>). Phosphorylation of S1, S2, S3, or S4 leads to activation of PIN auxin transport and changes in PIN polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lanassa Bassukas et al., 2022</xref>). Given that <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> suppressed <italic>pid</italic> mutants and that decreases in <italic>PIN1</italic> gene dosage and PIN1-GFPHDR suppressed <italic>pid</italic>, we concluded that phosphorylation at the newly identified sites in PIN proteins leads to the inhibition of PIN activities.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper, we demonstrate that <italic>PID</italic> becomes dispensable for flower initiation when <italic>NPY1</italic> is overexpressed. We further show that overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> increases phosphorylation of PIN proteins at sites mostly different from the previously characterized PIN phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation of PIN proteins at the identified sites described here leads to the inhibition of PIN functions, rather than activation of PINs by phosphorylation at the previously identified sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lanassa Bassukas et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, we show that the suppression of <italic>pid</italic> phenotypes by overexpressing <italic>NPY1</italic> requires the C-terminal motif of NPY1. Overexpression of <italic>NPY1ΔC</italic> causes a loss of gravitropism, auxin-resistance in roots, and phosphorylation of PIN proteins. Our results demonstrate that the main function of PID is not to directly phosphorylate PIN proteins and that PID affects the accumulation of NPY1 proteins.</p>
<p>Our findings that overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> completely suppressed <italic>pid</italic> mutants demonstrate that <italic>NYP1</italic> functions downstream of <italic>PID</italic> in regulating flower initiation in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Our data presented in this study are consistent with our previous hypothesis that PID/NPY1-mediated flower initiation uses a mechanism that is analogous to that of phototropism (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">2008</xref>). The hypothesis was based on the observation that three signaling components in phototropism have their homologous counterparts in the flower initiation pathway (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). In phototropism, blue light is perceived by phototropins (PHOT1 and PHOT2), which have two LOV domains in the N-terminal part and a kinase domain in the C-terminal part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huala et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Christie et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harper et al., 2003</xref>). LOV domains function as photo-receptors that regulate the kinase activities of PHOT1 and PHOT2. The kinase domain of phototropins is highly homologous to PID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>). Downstream of the phototropins is NPH3, which is homologous to NPY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Motchoulski and Liscum, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>). Phototropins are the starting point of phototropic signal transduction, and are undoubtedly upstream of NPH3. Our genetic results unambiguously demonstrated that NPY1 functions downstream of PID (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), further strengthening the hypothesis that phototropism and PID/NPY1 use analogous mechanisms (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). In dark, NPH3 is phosphorylated and forms a complex with PHOT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pedmale and Liscum, 2007</xref>). Upon receiving light, NPH3 is dephosphorylated and transiently dissociated from PHOT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Christie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sullivan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Haga and Sakai, 2023</xref>). Continuous light exposure leads to re-constitute PHOT1-NPH3 complex and phosphorylation of NPH3 by PHOT1, suggesting that NPH3 phosphorylation by PHOT1 is rather complicated. We found that NPY1 is phosphorylated regardless of the presence of PID (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). Moreover, we identified a predominant NPY1 phospho-peptide, which is located right after the NPH3 domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Table 1</xref> and Supplemental Figure4). It will be interesting to determine the biological consequences of the phosphorylation sites in NPY1 through mutagenesis. At present, we do not have evidence that PID uses NPY1 as a substrate. However, it is clear that PID has an impact on NPY1 accumulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Without PID, NPY1 accumulates significantly less (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> leads to phosphorylation of PIN proteins and likely inhibition of PIN functions. The most abundant phospho-peptides in <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> lines are from either NPY1 or PIN proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The increased NPY1 protein levels in the <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> lines can partially account for the observed enrichment of phospho-peptides of NPY1 in the overexpression lines. In contrast, overall PIN protein levels were not changed in <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> lines compared to WT, indicating that <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> triggered phosphorylation of PIN proteins. Most of the phosphorylation sites in PIN proteins are not the same as those previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lanassa Bassukas et al., 2022</xref>). We hypothesize that NPY1-triggered phosphorylation of PINs actually inhibits PIN1 functions, because <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> suppressed <italic>pid</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) and because <italic>pid</italic> is suppressed by decreasing PIN1 activity or <italic>PIN1</italic> gene dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mudgett et al., 2023</xref>). Our hypothesis is further supported by our results from overexpression of <italic>NPY1ΔC</italic>, which resulted in PIN2 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) and agravitropic roots (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), a phenotype that was observed in <italic>pin2</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 1998</xref>).

Our results suggest that the C-terminal domain of NPY1 likely interacts with an unknown protein, which is required for normal PID and PIN functions and which needs to be recruited to the NPY-PIN complexes.</p>
<p>In previous models regarding the mechanisms of PID, PIN1, and NPY1, the first step is direct phosphorylation of PINs by PID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Friml et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Michniewicz et al., 2007</xref>). Phosphorylated PINs recruit NPY1 to the plasma membrane to maintain PIN polarity by limiting lateral diffusion of the PIN complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Glanc et al., 2021</xref>). However, that overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> eliminates the need of <italic>PID</italic> in flower initiation and that overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> leads to phosphorylation of PIN proteins in the absence of PID are not consistent with the model that PIN1 needs to be directly phosphorylated by PID to be activated. The fact that <italic>pin1</italic> and <italic>pid</italic> displayed opposite cotyledon/leaf phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bennett et al., 1995</xref>) and that <italic>pid</italic> is suppressed by heterozygous <italic>pin1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and PIN1-GFPHDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mudgett et al., 2023</xref>) demonstrated that PID and PIN1 function in opposite directions. Our results firmly established the relative positions of PID and NPY1in the pathway responsible for flower initiation in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, we show that PIN1 functions downstream of NPY1, which recruits unknown kinase(s) to phosphorylate PIN1 and to inhibit PIN1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Plant Growth</title>
<p>Plants used in this study were the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Columbia-0 ecotype. Sterilized seeds were sown on a 0.7% agar-agar medium containing Murashige and Skoog basal salts at ½ concentration. Sown seeds were subjected to a two-day dark stratification period at 4°C and then moved to a growth chamber with a 16-hour day / 8-hour night cycle. After one week, seedlings were transferred to soil and maintained under the same light conditions.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Plant Transformation</title>
<p>Transgenic plants were created by performing the floral dipping procedure on adult plants with unopened flowers using published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Clough and Bent, 1998</xref>). The <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> strain GV3101 was used to perform all transformations in this study. Seeds were harvested from transformed plants and transformants were selected via the expression of the mCherry fluorescent marker present on the transformed vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gao et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Proteomics Method</title>
<p>The following tissues were collected and were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for proteomic analysis. Inflorescence heads, which include flower buds and meristems from WT (Columbia background)-68, <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> in WT-68, <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> in <italic>pid-c1</italic>-68, WT-83, <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> in WT-83, <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> in <italic>pid-c1</italic>-83 were collected. Whole seedlings of 7-day old Col-WT and <italic>NPY1ΔC</italic> #35, and #4 were used in this study.</p>
<p>About 0.5 gram of frozen tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen by a mortar/pestle for 15 minutes to fine powders, and then transferred to a 50ml conical tube. Proteins were precipitated and washed by 50 ml -20 °C acetone three times, then by 50 ml -20 °C methanol three times. Samples were centrifuged at 4,000x g, 4 °C for 10 minutes. Supernatant was removed and discarded.</p>
<p>Protein pellets were suspended in extraction buffer (8 M Urea/100mM Tris/5mM TCEP/phosphatase inhibitors, pH 7). Proteins were first digested with Lys-C (Wako Chemicals, 125-05061) at 37 °C for 15 minutes. Protein solution was diluted 8 times to 1M urea with 100mM Tris and digested with trypsin (Roche, 03708969001) for 12 hours. Cysteines were alkylated by adding 10 mM iodoacetamode and incubating at 37 °C for 30 minutes in dark.</p>
<p>Digested peptides were purified on a Waters Sep-Pak C18 cartridges, eluted with 60% acetonitrile. TMT labeling (Supplemental Table S4) was performed in 60% acetonitrile/100mM Hepes, pH 7. TMT labeling efficiency was checked by LC-MS/MS to be greater than 99%. Labeled peptides from different samples were pooled together. 150 µg of pooled peptides were analyzed by 2D-nano-LC-MS/MS for total proteome profiling and 1 mg of total peptides was used for phosphopeptide enrichment.</p>
<p>Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed using CeO2 affinity capture. 20% colloidal CeO2 (Sigma, 289744) was added to the acidified peptide solution (2% TFA/2M lactic acid/60% acetonitrile). After brief vortexing, CeO2 with captured phosphopeptides was spun down at 5,000 g for 1 minute. Supernatant was then removed and the CeO2 pellet was washed with 1 mL of 2% TFA/2M lactic acid/50% acetonitrile. Phosphopeptides were eluted by adding 200 µL eluting buffer (50mM (NH4)2HPO4, 2M NH3.H2O, 10mM EDTA, pH 9.5) and vortexed briefly. CeO2 was precipitated by adding 200 µL acetonitrile. Samples were centrifuged at 16,100 g for 1 minute. Supernatant containing phosphopeptides was removed and dried in a Speedvac. Phosphopeptides were resuspended in 100 mM citric acid and ready for mass spec analysis.</p>
<p>A Thermo Scientific Vanquish Neo UHPLC system (Buffer A: Water with 0.1% formic acid; Buffer B: 80% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) was used to deliver a flow rate of 500 nL/min to a self-packed 3-phase capillary (360 µm OD/200 µm ID) chromatography column. Column phases were a 10 cm long reverse phase (RP1, 5 µm Zorbax SB-C18, Agilent), 6 cm long strong cation exchange (SCX, 3 µm PolySulfoethyl, PolyLC), and 20 cm long reverse phase 2 (RP2, ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 µm), with the electrospray tip of the fused silica tubing pulled to a sharp tip.</p>
<p>Peptide mixtures were loaded onto RP1 using an off-line pressure chamber; and the 3 sections were joined for on-line 2D LC separation. Peptides were eluted from RP1 section to SCX section using a 0 to 80% acetonitrile gradient for 60 minutes, and then were fractionated by the SCX column section by injecting a series of ammonium acetate solutions (5 µL of 10 mM, 20 mM, 30 mM, 40 mM, 50 mM, 60 mM, 70 mM, 80 mM, 90 mM, 100 mM, and 1 M), followed by high-resolution reverse phase separation on the RP2 section of the column using an acetonitrile gradient (0–0.1 min 1% B to 5% B, 0.1–110.1 min 5% B to 35% B, 110.1–120.1 min 35% B to 60% B, 120.1–120.3 min 60% B to 95% B, 120.3–126 min 95% B).</p>
<p>Mass Spectra were acquired on a Thermo Exploris 480 mass spectrometer operated in positive ion mode with a source temperature of 300 °C and spray voltage of 2.1 kV. Automated data-dependent acquisition was employed of the top 20 ions with an isolation window of 0.7 Da and collision energy of 35. Precursor Fit was set to 70% of fit threshold and 0.7 Da fit window. The mass resolution is set at 100,000 for MS and 30,000 for MS/MS scans, respectively. TurboTMT was enabled. Dynamic exclusion of 30 seconds was used to improve the duty cycle.</p>
<p>The raw data was extracted and searched using Spectrum Mill vBI.07 (Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard). MS/MS spectra with a sequence tag length of 1 or less were considered to be poor spectra and were discarded. The remaining high-quality MS/MS spectra were searched against Arabidopsis TAIR11 protein database. A 1:1 concatenated forward-reverse database was constructed to calculate the false discovery rate (FDR). Common contaminants such as trypsin and keratin were included in the protein database. There were 96,562 protein sequences in the final protein database. Search parameters were set to Spectrum Mill’s default settings with the enzyme parameter limited to full tryptic peptides with a maximum mis-cleavage of 1. Cutoff scores were dynamically assigned to each dataset to obtain the false discovery rates (FDR) of 0.1% for peptides, and 1% for proteins. Phosphorylation sites were localized to a particular amino acid within a peptide using the variable modification localization (VML) score in Spectrum Mill software. Proteins that share common peptides were grouped using principles of parsimony to address protein database redundancy. Total TMT reporter intensities were used for relative protein quantitation. Peptides shared among different protein groups were removed before TMT quantitation. Isotope impurities of TMT reagents were corrected using correction factors provided by the manufacturer (Thermo). Median normalization was performed to normalize the protein TMT reporter intensities in which the log ratios between different TMT tags were adjusted globally such that the median log ratio was zero.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study concerns a highly interesting and biologically relevant topic, the regulation of the PIN auxin transporter, which is of broad interest to the plant biology community. The authors propose NPY1 to act downstream of PID in auxin-mediated development by modulating PIN phosphorylation, which, if experimentally solidified, would expand our understanding of PIN regulation. While the genetic evidence is <bold>solid</bold>, the mechanistic role of NPY1 and the functional relevance of phosphorylated PIN residues are still uncertain. There are also concerns regarding experimental rigor and methodological transparency.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors of this study propose a model in which NPY family regulators antagonize the activity of the pid mutation in the context of floral development and other auxin-related phenotypes. This is hypothesized to occur through regulation of or by PID and its action on the PIN1 auxin transporter.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings are intriguing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses and Major Comments:</p>
<p>(1) While the findings are indeed intriguing, the mechanism of action and interaction among these components remains poorly understood.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study is well-conducted, revealing that NPY1, with previously less-characterized molecular functions, can suppress pid mutant phenotypes with a phosphorylation-based mechanism. Overexpression of NPY1 (NPY1-OE) results in PIN phosphorylation at unique sites and bypasses the requirement for PID for this event. Conversely, a C-terminal deleted form of NPY1 (NPY1-dC) fails to rescue pid despite promoting a certain phospho-profile in PIN proteins.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The careful genetic analyses of pid suppression by NPY1-OE and the inability of NPY1dC to do the same.</p>
<p>(2) Phospho-proteomics approaches reveal that NPY1-OE induces phosphorylation of PINs at non-canonical sites, independent of PID.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The native role of NPY1 is not tested by phospho-proteomics in loss-of-function npy1 mutants. Such analysis would be crucial to demonstrate that NPY1 is required for the observed phosphorylation events.</p>
<p>(2) The functional consequences of the newly identified phosphorylation sites in PINs remain speculative. Site-directed mutagenesis (phospho-defective and phospho-mimetic) would help clarify their physiological roles.</p>
<p>(3) The kinase responsible for NPY1-mediated phosphorylation remains unidentified. Since NPY1 is a non-kinase protein, a model involving recruitment of partner kinases (e.g., PIN-phosphorylating kinases other than PID) should be considered or discussed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript from Mudgett et al. explores the relative roles of PID and NPY1 in auxin-dependent floral initiation in Arabidopsis. Micro vectorial auxin flows directed by PIN1 are essential to flower initiation, and loss of PIN1 or two of its regulators, PID and NPY1 (in a yucca-deficient background) phenocopies the pinformed phenotype. This group has previously shown that PID-PIN1 interactions and function are dosage-dependent. The authors pick up this thread by demonstrating that a heterozygote containing a CRISPR deletion of one copy of PIN1 can restore quasi-wild type floral initiation to pid.</p>
<p>The authors then show that overexpression of NPY1 is sufficient to more or less restore wild-type floral initiation to the pid mutant. The authors claim that this result demonstrates that NPY1 functions downstream of PID, as this ectopic abundance of NPY1 resulted in phosphorylation of PIN1 at sites that differ from sites of action of PID. The authors pursue evidence that PID action via NPY1 is analogous to the mode of action by which phot1/2 act on NPH3 in seedling phototropism. Such a model is supported by the evidence presented herein that the C terminus of NPY1, which has abundant Ser/Thr content, is phosphorylated, and that the deletion of this domain prevents overexpression compensation of the pinformed phenotype.</p>
<p>
While the results presented support evidence in the literature that PID acts on NPY1 to regulate PIN1 function, it is also possible that NPY1 overexpression results in limited expansion of phosphorylation targets observed with other AGC kinases. And if the phot model is any indication, there may be other PID targets that modulate PIN1-dependent floral initiation.</p>
<p>However, overexpression of the NPY1 C-terminal deletion construct resulted in phosphorylation of both PIN1 and PIN2 and agravitropic root growth similar to what is observed in pin2 mutants. This suggests that direct PID phosphorylation of PINs and action via NPY1 can be distinguished by phosphorylation sites and by growth phenotypes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A very important effort that places NPY1 downstream of PID in floral initiation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As PID has been shown to act on sites that regulate PIN protein polarity as well as PIN protein function, it would be useful if the authors consider how their results would fit/not fit with a model where combinatorial function of NPY1 and PID regulate PIN1 in a manner similar to the way that PID appears to function combinatorially with D6PK on PIN3.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors of this study propose a model in which NPY family regulators antagonize the activity of the pid mutation in the context of floral development and other auxin-related phenotypes. This is hypothesized to occur through regulation of or by PID and its action on the PIN1 auxin transporter.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings are intriguing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are pleased that the reviewer found the work interesting!</p>

<p>Weaknesses and Major Comments:</p>
<p>(1) While the findings are indeed intriguing, the mechanism of action and interaction among these components remains poorly understood. The study would benefit from significantly more thorough and focused experimental analyses to truly advance our understanding of pid phenotypes and the interplay among PID, NPYs, and PIN1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Elucidating the mechanism of action and interaction among these components will require years of additional research. As key steps toward these goals, our work clearly established that 1) NPY1 functions downstream of PID, as overexpression of NPY1 completely suppressed pid phenotypes. This is surprising because the predominant model is that PID functions by directly phosphorylating and activating PINs without the need of NPY1 involvement.  2) In the absence of PID, NPY1 protein accumulated less in the NPY1 OE lines, suggesting that PID plays a role in affecting NPY1 stability/degradation/accumulation. We are not sure what are the exact experiments this reviewer is proposing.</p>
<p>Regarding pid phenotypes, pid is completely sterile in our conditions, while the suppression by NPY1 OE is very clear and the lines are fertile.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The manuscript appears hastily assembled, with key methodological and conceptual details either missing or inconsistent. Although issues with figure formatting and clarity (e.g., lack of scale bars and inconsistent panel layout) may alone warrant revision, the content remains the central concern and must take precedence over presentation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not include scale bars in our figures because the phenotype of interest is presence/absence of flowers. Readers should compare the mutants with the rescued plants and the WT plants.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Given that fertile progeny are obtained from pid-TD pin1/PIN1 and pid NPY OE lines, it would be important to analyze whether mutations and associated phenotypes are heritable. This is especially relevant since CRISPR lines can be mosaic. Comprehensive genotyping and inheritance studies are required.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We only use stable, heritable, Cas9-free mutants in our studies.  We genotype our mutants in every generation.  More details have been added to the Materials and Methods section. We provide the genetic materials we use to the scientific community when requested to enable verification and extension of our results.</p>

<p>(4) The Materials and Methods section lacks essential information on how the lines were generated, genotyped, propagated, and scored.

These genetic experiments need to be described in detail, including the number of lines analyzed and consistency across replicates.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>More details have been added to the Materials and Methods section</p>
<p>The criticism is not fully accurate. For example, we stated in the main text: “We genotyped T2 progenies from two pid-c1 heterozygous T1 plants (#68 and # 83) for the presence of pid-c1 and for pid-c1 zygosity. We used mCherry signal, which was included in the NPY1 OE construct, as a proxy to determine the presence and absence of the NPY1 transgene. For each line, we identified T2 plants without the NPY1 transgene and without the pid-c1 mutation (called WT-68 and WT-83, respectively). We also isolated T2 plants that contained the NPY1 overexpression construct, but did not have the pid-c1 mutation (called NPY1 OE #68 in WT, and NPY1 OE #83 in WT). Finally, we identified T2 plants that were pid-c1 homozygous and that had the NPY1 transgene (called NPY1 OE #68 in pid-c1 and NPY1 OE #83 in pid-c1). These genetic materials enabled us to compare the same NPY1 OE transgenic event in different genetic backgrounds.”</p>
<p>The genetic materials used are freely available to the scientific community.  We would like to point out that we used several pin1 and pid alleles to make sure that the phenotypes are caused by the genes of interest.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The nature of the pid alleles used in the study is not described. This is essential for interpretation.</p>

<p>The mutants were described in a previous paper (M. Mudgett, Z. Shen, X. Dai, S.P. Briggs, &amp; Y.

<p>(6) The authors measure PIN1 phosphorylation in response to NPY overexpression and conclude that the newly identified phosphorylation sites are inhibitory because they do not overlap with known activating sites. This conclusion is speculative without functional validation. Functional assays are available and must be included to substantiate this claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We concluded that the phosphorylation of PINs in NPY1 OE is inhibitory on the basis of the following: 1) pid is suppressed in pin1 heterozygous backgrounds and by PIN1-GFP<sub>HDR,</sub> demonstrating that partial loss of function of PIN1 or a decrease in PIN1 gene dosage, which decreases PIN1 protein expression, caused the suppression of pid. 2) pid is completely suppressed by NPY1 OE, which caused an increase of PIN phosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylation of PINs in NPY1 OE lines is inhibitory.  It is true that we do not have biochemical data to support the conclusion. We would like to point out that the phosphorylation sites in PINs identified in this work do overlap with previously identified sites.</p>
<p>PIN activity assays are conducted in heterologous systems that do not include NPY proteins. Since NPY is important for PIN activities, we believe that these assays may provide misleading results. Moreover, PIN1 is likely part of a large protein complex.  Without knowing the composition of the complex, functional assays in heterologous systems will not be interpretable.</p>

<p>We show that overexpression of NPY1 completely suppressed the pid phenotype, and this epistatic relationship indicates that NPY1 functions downstream of PID. Moreover, we report that PID is required for NPY1 accumulation, indicating that PID is upstream of NPY1.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We are hesitating in using traditional PIN1-GFP, PIN2-GFP lines, as they are not stable in our hands. Localization of PID is still not clear. We have generated PID-GFP<sub>HDR</sub> lines, but we could not detect any fluorescent signals (unpublished results).  In addition, maize PINOID (BIF2) localizes to the nucleus, cytoplasm and cell periphery (Skirpan, A., Wu, X. and McSteen, P.

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that we do not have a complete picture of how NPY, PID, PIN work together to control flower initiation. Some aspects of our results are difficult to reconcile with the model of PIN1 and PID acting in tandem, i.e., by PID directly phosphorylating and activating PIN1. Indeed, our results suggest that PIN1 and PID have opposite effects on organogenesis. For example, heterozygous pin1 (or PIN1-GFP<sub>HDR,</sub> which is presumably less active than wild type PIN1) suppresses the pid phenotype.  Moreover, pid and pin1 have opposite effects on cotyledon number and true leaf number. Mutations in PID lead to more cotyledons and more true leaves than WT whereas pin1 mutants make fewer cotyledons and fewer true leaves than WT (Bennett SRM, Alvarez J, Bossinger G, Smyth DR (1995) Morphogenesis in pinoid mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana. The Plant Journal 8: 505-520).  We have elaborated on this point in the last paragraph of the Discussion.</p>
<p>The genetic materials we have generated may allow us to uncover additional components in the pathway from forward genetic screens, which may eventually lead to a clear picture.</p>
