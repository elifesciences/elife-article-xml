<title>Abstract</title><p>Amyloid β (Aβ) peptides accumulating in the brain are proposed to trigger Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined.</p>
<p>Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for Aβ42 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for γ-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in Aβ42, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on γ-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events.</p>
<p>We show that human Aβ42 peptides, but neither murine Aβ42 nor human Aβ17-42 (p3), inhibit γ-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75 and pan-cadherin. Moreover, Aβ42 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems.</p>
<p>Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in Aβ42 contribute to cellular toxicity via the γ-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address Aβ toxicity in the context of γ-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Γ-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></italic>). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone amyloid β (Aβ) peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>In addition, γ-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></italic>). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></italic>), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatment with γ-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></italic>), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></italic>). The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in γ-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined.</p>
<p>Γ-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B) and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). In the amyloidogenic pathway the proteolytic processing of APP by β-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (β-CTF or APP<sub>C99</sub>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></italic>). APP<sub>C99</sub> is then sequentially processed within the membrane by γ-secretase complexes <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>)</bold> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></italic>). An initial endopeptidase (ε-) cut releases APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a <italic>de novo</italic> substrate (either Aβ49 or Aβ48 peptide) that undergoes successive γ-cleavages until a shortened Aβ peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of Aβ (37-43 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></italic>). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by α- and γ-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1-16 amino acids of Aβ <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>)</bold>. Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></italic>). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></italic>), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></italic>).</p>

<caption><title>Human Aβ42 peptide inhibits γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis of APP<sub>C99</sub></title>
<p>(A) The scheme depicts the γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP, leading to the generation of Aβ and p3 peptides. The N-terminal sequence of APP<sub>C99</sub> /Aβ is shown in the lower panel. The differences in the amino acid sequence of human (hu) vs murine (mu) Aβ peptides and the positions of β’- and α-cleavages (that precede the generation of Aβ11-42 and p3 17-42 peptides, respectively) are indicated. The transmembrane domain is labelled in grey and the sequence of Aβ42 is presented within a rectangle. The initial γ-secretase endopeptidase cut may occur at one of two different positions on APP, generating two different <italic>de novo</italic> substrates that are further processed by carboxypeptidase-like cleavages as follows: Aβ49→Aβ46→Aβ43→Aβ40→Aβ37 or Aβ48 →Aβ45→Aβ42→Aβ38. Aβ38, Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides are the major products under physiological conditions. The triangles mark the sequential cleavage positions.</p><p>(B) The western blot presents AICD products generated <italic>de novo</italic> in detergent-based γ-secretase activity assays using APP<sub>C99</sub>-3xFLAG at 0.4 μM or 1.2 μM as substrate. To test the inhibitory properties of human Aβ1-42, the peptide was added to the activity assays at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10 μM. DMSO at 2.5% was used as a vehicle control. The graphs present the quantification of the western blot bands corresponding to AICDs. The pink and green lines correspond to 0.4 μM and 1.2 μM substrate concentrations, respectively. The data are normalized to the AICD levels generated in the DMSO conditions, considered as 100%. The data are presented as mean ± SEM, N=6-16.</p><p>(C) Mass spectrometry-based analysis of <italic>de novo</italic> generated AICD levels in <italic>in vitro</italic> cell-free γ-secretase activity assays containing 3 μM human Aβ1-42 or vehicle (0.6% DMSO) indicate that human Aβ1-42 inhibits both product lines.</p><p>(D) The western blot presents <italic>de novo</italic> generated AICDs in detergent-based γ-secretase activity assays using 0.4 μM APP<sub>C99</sub>-3xFLAG as substrate and wild type γ-secretases composed of different PSEN (1 or 2) and APH1 (A or B) subunits in the presence of vehicle, human Aβ1-42 at 3 μM or GSI (InhX) at 10 μM concentration.</p><p>(E) The graph presents ELISA quantification of Aβ1-38 peptides generated in detergent- or detergent resistant membranes (DRM)-based γ-secretase activity assays using either human Aβ1-42 at 10 μM or APP<sub>C99</sub>-3xFLAG at 1.5 μM as substrates. The data are presented as mean ± SEM, N=3.</p><p>(F) The western blot presents <italic>de novo</italic> generated AICDs in detergent-based γ-secretase activity assays using 0.4 μM APP<sub>C99</sub>-3xFLAG as a substrate and γ-secretase immobilized on sepharose beads. During the first round, the activity assay was supplemented with 3 μM Aβ1-42, 10 μM GSI or DMSO vehicle. After this first round, the γ-secretase-beads were washed to remove the peptide and inhibitor, respectively, fresh substrate was added, and the reaction proceeded for the second round. The analysis demonstrates the reversibility of the Aβ1-42-mediated inhibition.</p></caption>

<p>In familial AD (FAD), mutations in PSENs or in APP/Aβ (i.e. changes effecting both the enzyme and its substrate) promote the generation of longer Aβ peptides, including Aβ42, but also Aβ43 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></italic>). These peptides accumulate in the brain and are a hallmark of AD, in both familial and sporadic forms. In the latter (SAD), the accumulation of longer, aggregation prone peptides results from their inefficient clearance (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></italic>). Irrespective of the mechanism, the accumulation of Aβ in the brain begins decades before the onset of clinical symptoms and is proposed to trigger toxic cascades via poorly understood mechanisms (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Aggregation of Aβ42 into soluble toxic oligomers has been proposed as a prerequisite for its toxicity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></italic>). However, given the broad spectrum of brain-derived Aβ peptides and their assemblies, it seems plausible that Aβ contribute via a number of mechanisms to AD pathogenesis. Of note, increasing evidence suggests that in addition to Aβ (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>), its precursor, the 99 amino acid C-terminal fragment (i.e. APP<sub>C99</sub>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></italic>) also mediates pathogenic mechanisms (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Herein, we explored a novel hypothesis for Aβ42 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for γ-secretases. We hypothesized that pathological increases in Aβ levels in the AD brain lead to the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism, wherein Aβ1-42 competes with membrane-associated substrates for γ-secretase processing. This hypothesis is supported by our reported observations that Aβs with low affinity for γ-secretase, when present at relatively high concentrations, can compete with the longer, higher affinity APP<sub>C99</sub> substrate for binding and processing by the enzyme (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). This hypothetical inhibitory feedback would result in the accumulation of unprocessed γ-secretase substrates and reduced levels of their soluble intracellular domain (ICD) products, possibly disrupting downstream signaling cascades.</p>
<p>To test the hypothesis, we investigated whether Aβ peptides can exert inhibition on γ-secretase. Our kinetic analyses demonstrate that human Aβ1-42 inhibits γ-secretase-mediated processing of APP<sub>C99</sub> and other substrates. Strikingly, neither murine Aβ1-42 nor human p3 (17-42 amino acids in Aβ) peptides exerted inhibition under similar conditions. We also show that human Aβ1-42-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase activity results in the accumulation of unprocessed CTFs of APP, p75 and pan-cadherins. To evaluate the impact of the Aβ-driven inhibition on cellular signaling, we analyzed p75-dependent activation of caspase 3 in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) and PC12 cells. These analyses demonstrate that, as seen for γ-secretase inhibitors (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>), Aβ1-42 potentiates this marker of apoptosis. Our findings thus point to an entirely novel and selective role for the Aβ42 peptide, and raise the intriguing possibility that compromised γ-secretase activity against the CTFs of APP and/or other substrates contributes to the pathogenesis of AD.</p>

<p>We have shown that Aβ peptides displaying a relatively low affinity for γ-secretase, when present at high concentrations, can compete with the higher affinity APP<sub>C99</sub> substrate for binding to the enzyme (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). Based on this observation, we hypothesized that an increase in the concentration of Aβ42 may promote the establishment of an inhibitory mechanism that involves the formation of ‘non-productive’ enzyme-Aβ42 complexes. The Aβ42-mediated inhibition would result in the accumulation of unprocessed γ-secretase substrates and reduced production of their intracellular domains, both of which may contribute to dysregulated downstream signaling.</p>
<p>As a first step, we investigated the effects of human Aβ1-42 (from now on referred to as Aβ42) on the processing of APP<sub>C99</sub> in well-controlled kinetic analyses <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>)</bold> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). We incubated purified (wildtype) γ-secretase enzyme with purified APP<sub>C99</sub>-3xFLAG substrate at the K<sub>M</sub> or saturating concentrations (0.4 μM and 1.2 μM, respectively) in the presence of human Aβ42 peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.5 μM to 10 μM. We then analyzed the <italic>de novo</italic> generation of AICD-3xFLAG by quantitative western blotting <bold>(<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 1A</xref>)</bold>. Methanol:chloroform extraction was performed to remove the excess of unprocessed substrates, the high levels of which could preclude the quantitative analysis of ICDs. The analysis demonstrated that human Aβ42 inhibited γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis of APP<sub>C99</sub> in a dose dependent manner. The more pronounced peptide-driven inhibition at the lower substrate concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>=1.3 μM vs 3.6 μM for 0.4 and 1.2 μM APP<sub>C99</sub>, respectively) is consistent with a mechanism in which Aβ42 competes with the substrate for the enzyme. In addition, mass spectrometry analyses of the proteolytic reactions showed that Aβ42 partially inhibited the generation of both AICD product types (AICD<sub>50-99</sub> and AICD<sub>49-99</sub>) <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>)</bold>, indicating that Aβ42 inhibits both γ-secretase product lines. Next, we tested whether human Aβ42 exerted inhibition on all members of the γ-secretase family – i.e. irrespective of the type of PSEN (1 vs 2) and APH1 (A vs B) subunits <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>)</bold>. Quantitative western blotting analysis revealed a marked inhibition of total AICD production by all types of γ-secretases in the presence of 3 µM human Aβ42. These findings support a competitive mechanism wherein low-affinity substrates (acting also as products) are able to re-associate with the protease and inhibit the processing of transmembrane substrates when present at relatively high concentrations.</p>
<p>To gain further insights, we investigated γ-secretase mediated processing of Aβ42 to Aβ38 under the conditions used to examine APP<sub>C99</sub>, using the latter as a positive control <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>)</bold>. Despite the use of relatively high concentrations of Aβ42 (10 µM), this peptide was not converted into Aβ38. In contrast, proteolytic reactions using APP<sub>C99</sub> (1.5 μM) resulted in the generation of Aβ38 (0.5-1 nM). We also tested whether Aβ42 served as a substrate in conditions that mimic a native-like environment, i.e. detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>)</bold> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></italic>). As in the detergent conditions, Aβ42 was barely converted into Aβ38. We note that γ-secretase processes Aβ43 into Aβ40 under similar conditions, even when this peptide was added at much lower concentrations (0.5-1 µM) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). Taken together, these observations indicate that exogenous Aβ42 does interact with γ-secretases but, unlike Aβ43, does not act as a substrate (at least under these conditions), supporting the notion that Aβ42-driven inhibition of γ-secretases is mediated via the formation of non-productive enzyme-substrate (E-S) like complexes. However, a scenario wherein Aβ42 interacts with APP<sub>C99</sub> to reduce the amount of free APP<sub>C99</sub> substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data.</p>
<p>We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of Aβ42 on γ-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified γ-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 µM APP<sub>C99</sub>, in the absence or presence of 3 µM Aβ42, for 40 minutes at 37°C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>)</bold>. As a control, 10 µM γ-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer and re-incubated them with 0.4 µM APP<sub>C99</sub> for 40 minutes at 37°C. Analysis of the levels of the <italic>de novo</italic> generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected before (reaction 1) and after washes (reaction 2) indicated that Aβ42 inhibition of γ-secretase is fully reversible <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>)</bold>. Collectively, our analyses support a model wherein Aβ42 forms a non-productive E-S like complex with γ-secretase and its binding is reversible.</p>

<title>The N- and C-termini of Aβ play key roles in the inhibition of γ-secretase activity</title>
<p>We then investigated the structure-function relationships relevant to the Aβ42-driven inhibitory mechanism. The effects of mouse/rat (murine) Aβ42 and N-terminally truncated human Aβx-42 (11-42 and 17-42) peptides on γ-secretase activity were examined in cell-free assays using peptide concentrations ranging from 0.5 μM to 10 μM <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref>)</bold>. Quantification of the <italic>de novo</italic> AICD product levels showed that murine Aβ42 maximally inhibited γ-secretase activity by ∼20% <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>)</bold>. As three amino acids in the N-terminal domain (R5G, Y10F and H13R) differentiate human and murine Aβ1-42 peptides <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>)</bold>, the differences in the inhibition thus defined the N-terminal domain of Aβ as contributing to the inhibitory mechanism. It is noteworthy that similar to human Aβ1-42, murine Aβ1-42 was not processed to Aβ1-38 <bold>(<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 1B</xref>)</bold>. The analyses of other naturally occurring N-terminally truncated Aβx-42 peptides, generated by β-secretase (alternative) cleavage at the position 11 or by α-secretase cut at the position 17 in the Aβ sequence, showed that the truncated peptides exhibited reduced inhibitory potencies relative to Aβ42. The IC<sub>50</sub> values for Aβ11-42 were reduced 1.79- and 1.31-fold (K<sub>M</sub> and saturating substrate concentrations, respectively), relative to Aβ42 <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>)</bold>, while the larger N-terminal truncation (of residues 1-16) even further reduced the inhibitory effect to the level seen with murine Aβ42 <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>)</bold>. Collectively, these data assign a defining role to the N-terminal region of Aβ in the inhibition of γ-secretase activity.</p>

<p>We next tested whether longer Aβ peptides (&gt;Aβ42), which form more stable interactions with the protease (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>), also inhibit γ-secretase activity. In addition, we investigated whether shortening of the C-terminus diminishes the inhibitory properties. To this end, we evaluated a series of naturally occurring Aβ1-x peptides, ranging from 37 to 43 amino acids in length, at 1 µM final concentration for their effect on γ-secretase proteolysis of APP<sub>C99</sub> <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>)</bold>. In these experiments, the reduction in DMSO (vehicle) concentration to 0.2% was accompanied by ∼1.7 fold enhanced Aβ-mediated inhibition, relative to the conditions shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>. We speculate that increased Aβ potency under these conditions is explained by a modest but measurable reduction in the proteolysis by the higher concentration of DMSO used in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> assays (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></italic>). Relative to Aβ42, shorter Aβ species exerted progressively less or no inhibition on the <italic>de novo</italic> generation of AICD. It is noteworthy that peptides longer than Aβ42 serve as substrates for γ-secretases under these conditions, and their shortening potentially converts them into less potent inhibitory species (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). Taken together, these data strengthen the conclusion that human Aβ42 inhibits γ-secretases and indicate that both Aβ C- and N-termini modulate the inhibitory mechanism.</p>

<title>Aβ42 treatment leads to the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments in neuronal cell lines and human neurons</title>
<p>We reasoned that human Aβ42-driven inhibition of γ-secretase activity would lead to the accumulation of unprocessed γ-secretase substrates in cells (e.g. APP-CTFs in the case of APP) as well as reduced generation of products (Aβ peptides in the case of APP). To test these possibilities, we treated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y, rat pheochromocytoma PC12 and human neural progenitor cells (ReNcell VM) with recombinant human Aβ42 or p3 17-42 peptides at 1 μM or 2.5 μM final concentrations, and analyzed the levels of endogenous APP-CTFs and full-length APP (APP-FL) by western blotting <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref>)</bold>. Treatment with GSI (InhX) at 2 μM was included as a positive control. Human Aβ42 treatment increased the APP-CTF/FL ratio, a read-out of γ-secretase activity. In contrast, treatment with p3 peptide had no effect. The increments in the APP-CTF/FL ratio suggested that Aβ42 (partially) inhibits the global γ-secretase activity. To further investigate this, we measured the direct products of the γ-secretase mediated proteolysis of APP. Since the detection of the endogenous Aβ products via standard ELISA methods was precluded by the presence of exogenous human Aβ42 (treatment), we used an N-terminally tagged version of APP<sub>C99</sub> and quantified the amount of total secreted Aβ, which is a proxy for the global γ-secretase activity. Briefly, we overexpressed human APP<sub>C99</sub> N-terminally tagged with the short 11 amino acid long HiBiT tag in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, treated these cultures with human Aβ42 or p3 17-42 peptides at 1 μM, or DAPT (GSI) at 10 μM, and determined total HiBiT-Aβ levels in conditioned media (CM). DAPT fully inhibits γ-secretase at the concentration used, and hence the values measured in DAPT treated conditions were used for the background subtraction. We found a ∼50% reduction in luminescence signal, directly linked to HiBiT-Aβ levels, in CM of cells treated with human Aβ42 and no effect of p3 peptide treatment, relative to the DMSO control <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>)</bold>. The observed reduction in the total Aβ products is consistent with the partial inhibition of γ-secretase by Aβ42.</p>

<p>In addition, to controlling for overall cellular toxicity of Aβ42, we performed two cell toxicity assays that rely on different biological principles <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>)</bold>. In the first one, we quantified the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released by cells into the conditioned medium upon plasma membrane damage <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>)</bold>. In the second, we detected cellular ATP as a reporter of viability. There was no significant change in these measures in response to Aβ42 (1 μM), p3 17-42 (1 μM) or GSI (2 μM) <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>We next asked if the effects of Aβ42 would be also registered in wild type human neurons.

<p>These observations provided evidence that Aβ42 differs from other tested peptides in one or more features that are critical for γ-secretase inhibition in cells. Previous studies have shown that selective cellular uptake of human Aβ42, relative to Aβ40, leading to its concentration in the acidic endolysosomal network (ELN), promotes peptide aggregation into soluble toxic Aβ species (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></italic>). We reasoned that since this compartment is the main locus of γ-secretase activity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></italic>), the concentration of Aβ42 in ELN may not only promote its aggregation but also facilitate its inhibitory actions on γ-secretases. To investigate whether the selective accumulation of Aβ42 in ELN, relative to the other tested peptides, could explain the differential (cellular) inhibitory profiles <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>)</bold>, we treated PC12 cells with human Aβ40, Aβ42, Aβ43 or p3 17-42, or murine Aβ42 peptides at 1 µM final concentration for 24h, and examined their intracellular pools by immunostaining with an anti-Aβ/p3 antibody, 4G8 (epitope: 17-23 aa). We found that, unlike other Aβ or p3 peptides, human Aβ42 accumulated in cells. The pattern of the accumulation appeared distinct, punctate and largely perinuclear, suggestive of its presence in endolysosomal compartment. The data are consistent with a model in which intracellular accumulation of Aβ42, due to selective cellular uptake or reduced peptide degradation, distinguishes it from the other peptides studied and explains its apparently unique inhibitory properties in the cellular context.</p>

<title>Human Aβ42 inhibits endogenous γ-secretase activity in neurons</title>
<p>We next asked whether the accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells stems from direct inhibition of γ-secretases. To answer this question, we applied an established cell-based γ-secretase activity assay to test <italic>in situ</italic> the protease activity in primary mouse neurons (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></italic>) <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>)</bold>. This assay uses an APP<sub>C99</sub>-based fluorescent substrate (the C99 Y-T biosensor) to probe γ-secretase activity in living cells. This biosensor comprises APP<sub>C99</sub> fused at the C-terminus with YPet, followed by a linker, Turquoise-GL and a membrane-anchoring domain to stabilize the probe in the membrane. The cleavage of the APP<sub>C99</sub>-based probe by endogenous γ-secretases extends the distance between YPet and Turquoise-GL, and therefore results in a decrease in the efficiency of Fӧrster resonance energy transfer (FRET) for this pair. The ratiometric nature of the reporter, and its independence of α- and β-secretase activity and cellular degradation mechanisms, allow quantitative analysis of γ-secretase activity <italic>in situ</italic> in living cells.</p>
<p>We treated mouse primary neurons with human Aβ42, p3, GSI (1 μM DAPT) or vehicle (DMSO) for 24h and performed FRET analysis <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-C</xref>)</bold>. While p3 peptides did not affect the FRET signal, significant increases in FRET efficiency (i.e. increased proximity between YPet and Turquoise-GL) in cells treated with human Aβ42 or GSI, relative to vehicle treated cultures, indicated increments in the levels of the full-length (uncleaved) fluorescent substrate, and thus reduced γ-secretase activity. These results provided quantitative evidence in a cellular context for the inhibition of endogenous γ-secretases by human Aβ42, but not p3 17-42 peptides.</p>

<title>Aβ42-mediated γ-secretase inhibition is the major mechanism contributing to APP-CTF accumulation in cells</title>
<p>Our data support a direct effect of Aβ42 peptides on the activity of γ-secretase in well controlled, cell-free systems and in cell-based assays. Although the cell-free and FRET-based systems are independent of α- and β-secretase activity and cellular degradation pathways, we elected to further pursue the possibility that changes in the activity of these enzymes or degradation of CTFs could contribute to the observed increase in APP-CTFs in cellular systems. We investigated the impact of Aβ42 on α-secretase (ADAM10) and β-secretase (BACE1) levels, alterations in which could result in increased APP-CTF levels, by analyzing the expression of ADAM10 and BACE1 in total cell lysates from SH-SY5Y cells treated with Aβ40 (1 μM), Aβ42 (1 μM), p3 17-42 (1 μM), GSI (InhX, 2 μM) or vehicle DMSO control <bold>(<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 2A-B</xref>)</bold>. We found no evidence of increased either α-secretase and β-secretase levels. In addition, we explored possible differences in the activities of these secretases by examining total soluble APP (sAPP) in conditioned medium collected from SH-SY5Y cells treated under the same conditions. Our analysis showed a reduction in total sAPP levels in the conditioned medium collected from cells treated with Aβ42. This finding is inconsistent with an Aβ42-mediated effect that would increase APP-CTF levels as result of activating α-secretase or β-secretase activity. Further studies are required to define whether the decrease in total sAPP is a consequence of sheddase inhibition or relates to an effect of Aβ42 on the rate of recycling and release of sAPP fragments. We also evaluated potential γ-secretase independent changes in the degradation of APP-CTF by assessing the impact of Aβ42 peptides on γ-secretase independent APP-CTF half-life using the well-established cycloheximide (CHX)-based assay. CHX inhibits protein synthesis by blocking translation elongation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></italic>). In these experiments, we pre-treated SH-SY5Y cells with either GSI (DAPT, 10 μM) or GSI + Aβ42 (1 μM) for 24h. Importantly, the GSI treatment allowed for complete γ-secretase inhibition in both conditions, resulting in the maximum accumulation of APP-CTFs that can possibly be achieved by blocking γ-secretase processing. We then added CHX (50 μg/ml) while maintaining GSI and vehicle versus GSI plus Aβ42. In addition, we treated with bafilomycin A1 (200 nM), which de-acidifies lysosomes and compromises degradation pathways, as a positive control <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>)</bold>.

<p>Quantitative analysis of the levels of both APP-CTFs and APP-FL over the 5h time-course showed that bafilomycin A1 treatment markedly prolonged the half-life of both proteins but did not reveal significant differences in their levels between GSI versus GSI plus Aβ42-treated cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 B-C</xref>)</bold>. The lack of a significant effects of Aβ42 on the levels of APP-CTFs under these conditions (full γ-secretase inhibition) suggests that the peptide does not induce major defects in cellular degradation pathways, at least at this concentration. However, we noted an increased APP-CTF/FL ratio in GSI + Aβ42 treated cells vs GSI + DMSO treated ones at time zero <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>),</bold> suggesting that the Aβ42-induced increase in APP-CTFs is mediated by both inhibition of γ-secretase and one or more additional mechanisms. Nevertheless, the greater relative accumulation of APP-CTFs in the absence (138%) <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>)</bold> versus the presence (48%) of the GSI <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>)</bold> is evidence that Aβ42-mediated γ-secretase inhibition plays a more prominent role.</p>

<title>Aβ peptides derived from biological sources trigger APP C-terminal fragment accumulation</title>
<p>We next asked whether Aβ from disease-relevant biological sources would recapitulate the effects of recombinant Aβ42. For these studies we used culture medium conditioned by human iPSC-derived neurons expressing APP wild type or the KM670/671NL (SWE) variant. The APP SWE mutation increases total Aβ production by promoting the amyloidogenic processing of APP. ELISA-based quantification of Aβ content estimated a total concentration in the low nanomolar range (0.5-1 nM). Conditioned medium (WT or SWE) was applied to PC12 cells either directly or after Aβ depletion (delSWE) using the anti-APP 3D6 (epitope Aβ 1-5) <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>)</bold>. After a 24h incubation at 37°C, the APP-CTF/FL ratio was measured. Cells incubated in control, unconditioned media were used as a reference control. We observed significant increments in the APP-CTF/FL ratio in cells treated with SWE conditioned media, relative to control cells. Aβ immunodepletion from the SWE medium (delSWE-CM) lowered the APP-CTF/FL ratio to the levels observed in the control cells. These data provide evidence that Aβ peptides derived from biological sources induce the accumulation of APP-CTFs even when present at low nM concentrations, and thus point to this biological source of Aβ as being far more potent than recombinant Aβ42.</p>

<title>Human Aβ42 peptides inhibit proteolysis of other γ-secretase substrates, beyond APP-CTFs</title>
<p>The Aβ42-mediated inhibition of endogenous γ-secretase activity in cells raises the possibility that Aβ42 would inhibit the processing of γ-secretase substrates beyond APP-CTFs. To address this, we analyzed the effects of human Aβ42 on the processing of a purified NOTCH1-based substrate in cell-free conditions <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>)</bold>. We incubated purified γ-secretase and the NOTCH1-based substrate (at 0.4 μM or 1.2 μM concentrations) in the presence of increasing amounts of human Aβ1-42 (ranging from 0.5 μM to 10 μM). Quantification of the <italic>de novo</italic> generated NICD-3xFLAG showed a dose dependent inhibition of γ-secretase proteolysis of NOTCH1 by Aβ42. As for APP<sub>C99</sub>, the derived IC<sub>50</sub> values showed that the degree of the inhibition depended on substrate concentration, consistent with a competitive mechanism <bold>(<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>)</bold>. We extended this analysis by assessing the γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis of other substrates (ERBB4-, neurexin- and p75-based) in the presence of 3 μM human Aβ42 <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>)</bold>. Quantification of the respective <italic>de novo</italic> generated ICDs revealed that Aβ42 reduced γ-secretase proteolysis of each of these substrates.

<p>We next investigated the effects of human Aβ42 on γ-secretase-mediated processing of pan-cadherin in ReNcell VM cells. Cleavage of cadherins by α-secretase generates a membrane bound CTF, which is a direct substrate of γ-secretases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></italic>). As before, we used the PanCad-CTF/FL ratio to estimate the efficiency of the γ-secretase-mediated proteolytic processing <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>)</bold>. Treatment with human Aβ42 and InhX, but not p3, resulted in significant increases in the PanCad-CTF/FL ratio, demonstrating that Aβ42 inhibits processing of several different γ-secretase substrates. These results suggest that this peptide can inhibit the proteolysis of γ-secretases substrates in general.</p>
<p>Finally, we measured the direct N-terminal products generated by γ-secretase proteolysis from a HiBiT-tagged NOTCH1-based substrate, an estimate of the global γ-secretase activity. We quantified the Aβ-like peptides secreted by HEK 293 cells stably expressing this HiBiT-tagged substrate upon treatment with 1 µM Aβ1-42 or p3 17-42 peptide, and 10 µM DAPT (GSI) as control for background subtraction <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>)</bold>. A ∼20% significant reduction in the amount of secreted N-terminal HiBiT-tagged peptides derived from the NOTCH1-based substrates in cells treated with Aβ1-42 supports the inhibitory action of Aβ1-42 on γ-secretase mediated proteolysis.</p>
<p>By demonstrating that Aβ42 inhibits γ-secretase proteolysis of substrates that are structurally distinct from APP-CTFs, these data indicate that Aβ42 inhibits enzyme activity independent of substrate structure. This renders much less likely the mechanistic possibility that inhibition is due to an interaction with the substrate.</p>

<title>Human Aβ42 driven accumulation of p75-CTF induces markers of neuronal death</title>
<p>The p75 neurotrophin receptor plays a prominent role in neurotrophin signaling. Under certain conditions its C-terminal fragment (p75-CTF, a γ-secretase substrate) modulates cell death (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></italic>). Previous studies have shown that accumulation of p75-CTF in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), due to pharmacological inhibition of γ-secretases, triggers apoptosis in a TrkA activity dependent manner (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>). The proapoptotic action of p75-CTF is prevented by expression of the TrkA receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), which serves as a co-receptor with p75 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>). Similar observations have been made in PC12 cells, which model sympathetic neurons. In this case, γ-secretase inhibitors increased apoptosis in TrkA-deficient (PC12nnr5) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></italic>), but not in wild type, TrkA expressing cells. These findings provided an experimental system to investigate the effects of Aβ42-mediated inhibition on γ-secretase-mediated signaling in neurons and neuron-like cells.</p>
<p>We tested the impact of Aβ on p75 signaling in wild type and PC12nnr5 cells. We exposed the cells to 1 µM human Aβ42, 1 µM p3, GSI (10 µM compound E) or vehicle (DMSO) for 3 days, and measured apoptosis via immunofluorescence staining for cleaved caspase 3 <bold>(<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>)</bold>. In addition, to assess γ-secretase proteolysis of p75, we measured the p75-CTF/FL ratio in the treated cultures <bold>(<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>)</bold>. Cleaved caspase 3 staining was increased in PC12nnr5 cells treated with GSI or human Aβ42, but not in those exposed to p3 or vehicle (DMSO). Of note, and consistent with our previous findings (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>), none of the treatments elicited significant increases in cleaved caspase 3 in wild type PC12 cells that express physiological levels of TrkA. In addition, analysis of the p75-CTF/FL ratio demonstrated higher p75-CTF levels in GSI and Aβ42 treated cells. These results, together with our previous observations, strongly suggest that Aβ42-mediated accumulation of p75-CTFs results in cell death signaling in the absence or near absence of TrkA expression. Our similar studies using BFCNs recapitulated the reported increased cell death under conditions in which both γ-secretase and TrkA activities were inhibited (CE and K252α inhibitor) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>), and showed that treatment with 1 µM human Aβ42 mimics the increase in cleaved caspase 3 driven by the GSI <bold>(<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>)</bold>. In conclusion, these results are evidence of a novel role for human Aβ42 peptide in the global inhibition of γ-secretase activity and dysregulation of cellular homeostasis.</p>

<p>We next investigated the levels of Aβ42 in synaptosomes derived from frontal cortices of post-mortem AD and age-matched non-demented (ND) control individuals <bold>(<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B</xref>)</bold>. Towards this, we prepared synaptosomes from frozen brain tissues using Percoll gradient procedure (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></italic>). Intact synaptosomes were spun to obtain a pellet which was resuspended in minimum amount of PBS, allowing us to estimate the volume containing the resuspended synaptosome sample. This is likely an overestimate of the actual synaptosome volume. Finally, synaptosomes were lysed in RIPA buffer and Aβ peptide concentrations measured using ELISA (MSD). We observed that the concentration of Aβ42 in the synaptosomes from (end-stage) AD tissues was significantly higher (10.7 nM) than those isolated from non-demented tissues (0.7 nM), p&lt;0.0005***. These data provide evidence for accumulation at nM concentrations of endogenous Aβ42 in synaptosomes in end-stage AD brains. Given that we measured Aβ42 concentration in synaptosomes, we speculate that even higher concentrations of this peptide may be present in the endolysosome vesicle system, and therein inhibit the endogenous processing of APP-CTF at the synapse. Of note treatment of PC12 cells with conditioned medium containing even lower amounts of Aβ (low nanomolar range (0.5-1 nM)) resulted in the accumulation of APP-CTFs.</p>

<p>Compelling evidence supports that Aβ peptides trigger molecular and cellular cascades leading to neurodegeneration (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></italic>). Here, we discovered and extensively characterized a previously unreported role for Aβ: inhibition of the activity of γ-secretase complexes <bold>(<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10C</xref> and <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10D</xref>)</bold>. The recognition that Aβ peptides, despite lower affinities, can compete with APP-CTFs for binding to γ-secretase, when present at relatively high concentrations (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>), led us to propose a mechanism that connects increases in the Aβ42 peptide with the inhibition of γ-secretases and dysregulation of signaling cascades relevant to neuronal physiology. In this regard, we note that the inhibition of γ-secretase in the adult mouse brain leads to age-dependent neurodegenerative phenotypes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>) by poorly understood but APP-independent (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></italic>) mechanisms, whereas pharmacological inhibition of γ-secretase has been linked to cognitive worsening in AD affected individuals (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></italic>). Here, we found <italic>in vitro</italic> that human (not murine) Aβ42 can inhibit γ-secretase processing, resulting in <italic>i)</italic> the accumulation of substrates at the membrane, <italic>ii)</italic> reductions in the release of soluble intracellular fragments from substrates, and <italic>iii)</italic> dysregulation of γ-secretase dependent signaling.</p>
<p>Our analysis of the global γ-secretase (endopeptidase) activity in well-controlled cell-free assays, using purified protease and substrate, demonstrated that human Aβ42 inhibited the processing of APP<sub>C99</sub> by all members of the human γ-secretase family. Notably, despite the high homology between human and murine Aβ sequences, murine Aβ1-42 failed to inhibit the proteolysis of APP<sub>C99</sub>, implying that structural determinants in the N-terminal domain of Aβ are involved in the inhibitory mechanism. Consistent with this view, N-terminally truncated Aβ peptides (Aβ11-42 and p3 17-42) demonstrated reduced or no inhibitory properties, compared to human Aβ42. The p3 peptides lack the 16 amino acid long, hydrophilic and disordered N-terminal domain present in Aβ, but do contain the two aggregation prone regions (16–21 and 29-42) required for the assembly of oligomers (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></italic>) and fibrils (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></italic>). Despite p3 peptides’ aggregation prone behavior (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></italic>) and their accumulation in AD brain (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></italic>), the neurotoxicity of these peptides is not well defined (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></italic>). Moreover, our analyses in cell-free systems revealed that the C-terminus of Aβ also modulates its intrinsic inhibitory properties, with shorter Aβ1-x species (x= 37, 38, 40) either not acting as inhibitors or inhibiting the protease to a lesser degree than human Aβ42. The reported lower affinities of shorter Aβ peptides towards γ-secretase may, at least partially, explain their decreased inhibitory potencies (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Our analysis on cultured neurons and neuron-like cells showed that extracellularly applied human Aβ42, but not p3, resulted in the accumulation of γ-secretase substrates. This phenotype is consistent with an Aβ42-induced inhibitory effect on γ-secretase activity, but could also be a consequence of alterations in cellular mechanisms that define protein (substrate) steady-state levels. However, Aβ42 treatment did not induce significant cellular toxicity, as determined by two independent readouts, nor did it promote APP-CTF generation, as indicated by the analysis of total, soluble APP ectodomain (precursor) levels. In addition, the assessment of the APP-CTF turnover by γ-secretase and/or general degradation mechanisms defined the inhibition of endogenous γ-secretases as the most important mechanism contributing to the accumulation of APP-CTF in living neurons treated with human Aβ42.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, despite their common inhibitory effects in cell-free conditions, only human Aβ42 and no other Aβ peptides induced the accumulation of unprocessed APP-CTFs in cells. Reports showing that Aβ conformation affects both cellular internalization and neurotoxicity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></italic>) motivated us to test the possibility that Aβ42, unlike other Aβ peptides, acquires specific conformations that promote its endocytosis and/or inhibit its intracellular degradation. This would result in the intracellular concentration of this peptide at sites where γ-secretases process their substrates. Earlier reports of the selective uptake of Aβ42, relative to Aβ40 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></italic>), facilitating concentration of Aβ42 in spatially restricted endosomal compartments, would support this postulation. Our data showing marked increases in the intracellular levels of Aβ42, but neither Aβ40 nor Aβ43, add to the evidence for peptide-specific differences, and suggest that the observed increases mediate the inhibition of γ-secretases. Whether they are due to changes in Aβ42 cellular uptake, degradation rate or both requires further study.</p>
<p>Evidence that Aβ42 exerts a general inhibition on γ-secretase activity is provided by data showing that this peptide also reduced the processing of non-APP γ-secretase substrates, including NOTCH, ERBB4, neurexin, pan-cadherin and p75-based substrates. Considering the poor sequence homology between distinct γ-secretase substrates and the general Aβ-mediated inhibitory effect, we reason that the inhibitory action of Aβ42 involves its interaction with the protease, rather than with the substrate.</p>
<p>Our analysis also showed that Aβ42-induced inhibition of γ-secretases alters downstream signaling events. Treatment of BFCNs (or PC12 cells) with human Aβ42, but not with p3, compromised the processing of p75, increased p75-CTF levels and, in the absence of TrkA, induced apoptotic cell death. These observations recapitulated reported findings showing that GSI treatment of BFCNs triggers p75-driven cell death under similar conditions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>). It is noteworthy that these studies also showed that apoptosis in BFCNs subjected to GSI and TrkA signaling inhibitor treatments was rescued in p75 KO BFCNs, demonstrating that cell death is p75-dependent (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>). The finding that Aβ42 treatment mimics GSI-driven p75-dependent apoptosis in BFCNs supports the inhibitory role of Aβ42 and links it to dysregulation of downstream signaling cascades. Our findings may also provide mechanistic bases for previous observations showing that injection of Aβ42 into the hippocampus of adult mice resulted in the degeneration of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive forebrain neurons in wildtype, but not p75-NTR-deficient mice, and revealing a correlation between Aβ42-driven neuronal death and the accumulation of p75-CTFs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Aβ endocytic uptake has been shown to concentrate Aβ42 to μM levels in the endolysosomal compartments (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></italic>), where the high peptide concentration and low pH are proposed to facilitate Aβ aggregation and toxicity. We speculate that this mechanism could in addition promote the inhibition of γ-secretases. Given the reported role for APP<sub>C99</sub> in inducing dysregulation of the endolysosomal network, the potential Aβ42-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase processing of APP-CTFs could drive dysregulation of endolysosomal function leading to changes in synaptic and axonal signaling (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></italic>). Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of γ-secretase substrates by Aβ42 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></italic>) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the Aβ42-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the Aβ42 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates <bold>(<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10C</xref> and <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10D</xref>)</bold>. The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of Aβ, result in increased intracellular concentration of Aβ42, facilitating γ-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and γ-secretase substrates in general). As Aβ42 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent Aβ production. As Aβ42 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) γ-secretase inhibition, which will alter γ-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75 or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in γ-secretase activity induced by treatment with a γ-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></italic>) and that semagacestat, like Aβ42, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>The convergence of Aβ42 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></italic>), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></italic>). Our analysis adds that endogenous Aβ42 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ∼10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits γ-secretase in PC12 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></bold>). Furthermore, the restricted localization of Aβ in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to levels that inhibit γ-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of Aβ42 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of Aβ present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of γ-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in γ-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in Aβ due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis.</p>
<p>The Aβ-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></italic>). In this regard, the direct quantification of γ-secretase activity in detergent resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall γ-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wildtype (PSEN1 and PSEN2) γ-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></italic>). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></italic>) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appear to correlate with Aβ levels at the synapse. The inhibition of γ-secretase by Aβ42 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in <italic>PSEN1</italic> on the development of AD by noting that: 1) there is mutation-driven enhanced generation of Aβ42 within the endolysosomal network; 2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis Aβ42 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the γ-secretase complex; and 3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the γ-secretase releases Aβ42, thus restoring wildtype enzyme activity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></italic>). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal Aβ42 with concurrent inhibition of γ-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent γ-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes.</p>
<p>Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in Aβ42 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an Aβ-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical γ-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated Aβ42 levels with the accumulation of multiple γ-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40.</p>
<p>If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript:</p>
<p>“From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the Aβ42-mediated inhibition implies</p>
<p>that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the Aβ42 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of Aβ, result in increased intracellular concentration of Aβ42, facilitating γ-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and γ-secretase substrates in general). As Aβ42 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent Aβ production. As Aβ42 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) γsecretase inhibition, which will alter γ-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75 or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in γ-secretase activity induced by treatment with a γ-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (<italic>7</italic>) and that semagacestat, like Aβ42, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (<italic>85</italic>).</p>
<p>The convergence of Aβ42 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (<italic>86-89</italic>), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (<italic>90</italic>).  Our analysis adds that endogenous Aβ42 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits γ-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of Aβ in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit γ-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of Aβ42 in plaques may be preceded a critical increase in the levels of Aβ present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of γsecretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in γ-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in Aβ due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis.“</p>
<p>We have also added figures 10C and 10D, presented here for convenience.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We have established a novel, HiBiT tag based assay reporting on the global γ-secretase activity in cells, using as a proxy the total levels of secreted HiBiT-tagged Aβ peptides. The assay and findings are presented in the revised manuscript as follows:</p>
<p>In the result section, in the “Aβ42 treatment leads to the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments in neuronal cell lines and human neuron” subsection:</p>
<p>“The increments in the APP-CTF/FL ratio suggested that Aβ42 (partially) inhibits the global γ-</p>
<p>secretase activity. To further investigate this, we measured the direct products of the γ-secretase mediated proteolysis of APP. Since the detection of the endogenous Aβ products via standard ELISA methods was precluded by the presence of exogenous human Aβ42 (treatment), we used an N-terminally tagged version of APPC99 and quantified the amount of total secreted Aβ, which is a proxy for the global γsecretase activity. Briefly, we overexpressed human APPC99 N-terminally tagged with a short 11 amino acid long HiBiT tag in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, treated these cultures with human Aβ42 or p3 17-42 peptides at 1 μM or DAPT (GSI) at 10 µM, and determined total HiBiT-Aβ levels in conditioned media (CM). DAPT was considered to result in full γ-secretase inhibition, and hence the values recorded in DAPT treated conditions were used for the background subtraction. We found a ~50% reduction in luminescence signal, directly linked to HiBiT-Aβ levels, in CM of cells treated with human Aβ42 and no effect of p3 peptide treatment, relative to the DMSO control (Figure 3D). The observed reduction in the total Aβ products is consistent with the partial inhibition of γ -secretase by Aβ42.”</p>
<p>In Methods:</p>
<p>“Analysis of γ-secretase substrate proteolysis in cultured cells using secreted HiBiT-Aβ or -Aβ-like peptide levels as a proxy for the global γ-secretase endopeptidase activity</p>
<p>HEK293 stably expressing APP-CTF (C99) or a NOTCH1-based substrate (similar in size as</p>
<p>APP- C99) both N-terminally tagged with the HiBiT tag were plated at the density of 10000 cells per 96-well, and 24h after plating treated with Aβ or p3 peptides diluted in OPTIMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 5% FBS (Gibco). Conditioned media was collected and subjected to analysis using Nano-Glo® HiBiT Extracellular Detection System (Promega). Briefly, 50 µl of the medium was mixed with 50 µl of the reaction mixture containing LgBiT Protein (1:100) and Nano-Glo HiBiT Extracellular Substrate (1:50) in Nano-Glo HiBiT Extracellular Buffer, and the reaction was incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. Luminescence signal corresponding to the amount of the extracellular HiBiT-Aβ or -Aβ-like peptides was measured using victor plate reader with default luminescence measurement settings.”</p>
<p>As the direct substrate of γ -secretase was used in this analysis, the observed reduction (~50%) in the levels of N-terminally-tagged (HiBiT) Aβ peptides in the presence of 1 µM Aβ42, relative to control conditions, demonstrates a selective inhibition of γ-secretase by Aβ42 (not by the p3). These data complement the FRET-based findings presented in Figure 5.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Processing of APP-CTF in living cells is not only the cleavage by gamma-secretase. This reviewer thinks that the authors need at least biochemical data, such as levels of Abeta in Figures 4, 5 and 7.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We tried to measure the levels of Aβ peptides secreted by cells into the culture medium directly by ELISA (using different protocols) or MS (using established methods, as reported in Koch et al, 2023), but exogenous Aβ42 (treatment) present at relatively high levels interfered with the readout and rendered the analysis inconclusive.</p>
<p>However, we were successful in the determination of total secreted (HiBiT-tagged) Aβ peptides from the HiBiT tagged APP-C99 substrate, as indicated in the previous point. The quantification of the levels of these peptides showed that Aβ42 treatment resulted in ~50% reduction in the γ -secretase mediated processing of the tagged substrate.</p>
<p>In addition, we would like to highlight that our analysis of the contribution of other APP-CTF degradation pathways, using cycloheximide-based assays in the constant presence of γ-secretase inhibitor, failed to reveal significant differences between Aβ42 treated cells and controls (Figure 6B &amp; C). The lack of a significant impact of Aβ42 on the half-life of APP-CTFs under the conditions of γsecretase inhibition maintained by inhibitor treatment is consistent with the proposed Aβ42-mediated inhibitory mechanism.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Similar to comment #3. Processing of Pancad-CTF and p75 in living cells may be not only the cleavage by gamma-secretase. This reviewer thinks that the authors need at least biochemical data, such as levels of ICDs in Figures 6C and E.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this comment we have now performed additional experiments where we measured Nterminal Aβ-like peptides derived from NOTCH1-based substrate using the HiBiT-based assay. These experiments showed a reduction in the aforementioned peptides in the cells treated with Aβ42 relative to the vehicle control, and hence further confirmed the inhibitory action of Aβ42. These new data have been included as Figure 8D in the revised manuscript and described as follow:</p>
<p>Finally, we measured the direct N-terminal products generated by γ-secretase proteolysis from a HiBiT-tagged NOTCH1-based substrate, an estimate of the global γ-secretase activity. We quantified the Aβ-like peptides secreted by HEK 293 cells stably expressing this HiBiT-tagged substrate upon treatment with 1 µM Aβ1-42,  p3 17-42 peptide or  DAPT (GSI) (Figure 8D). DAPT treatment was considered to result in a complete γ-secretase inhibition, and hence the values recorded in the DAPT condition were used for background subtraction. A ~20% significant reduction in the amount of secreted</p>
<p>N-terminal HiBiT-tagged peptides derived from the NOTCH1-based substrates in cells treated with Aβ1-</p>
<p>42 supports the inhibitory action of Aβ1-42 on γ-secretase mediated proteolysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor concerns:</p>
<p>(1) Murine Abeta42 may be converted to murine Abeta38 easily, compared to human Abeta42. This may be a reason why murine Abeta42 exhibits no inhibitory effect on gamma-secretase activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In order to address this question, we performed additional experiments where we assessed the processing of murine Aβ42 into Aβ38. Analogous to human Aβ42, the murine Aβ42 peptide was not processed to Aβ38 in the assay conditions. These new data have been integrated in the manuscript and added as a Supplementary figure 1B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It is curious to know the levels of C99 and C83 in cells in supplementary figure 3.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The conditions used in these assays were analogous to the conditions used in the figure 3 (i.e. treatment with Aβ peptides at 1 µM concentrations). Such conditions were associated with profound and consistent APP-CTF accumulation in this model system.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In the current study, the authors show that Aβs with low affinity for γ-secretase, but when present at relatively high concentrations, can compete with the longer, higher affinity APPC99 substrate for binding and processing. They also performed kinetic analyses and demonstrate that human Aβ1-42 inhibits γ-secretase-mediated processing of APP C99 and other substrates. Interestingly, neither murine Aβ1-42 nor human p3 (17-42 amino acids in Aβ) peptides exerted inhibition under similar conditions. The authors also show that human Aβ1-42-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase activity results in the accumulation of unprocessed, which leads to p75-dependent activation of caspase 3 in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) and PC12 cells.</p>
<p>These analyses demonstrate that, as seen for γ-secretase inhibitors, Aβ1-42 potentiates this marker of apoptosis. However, these are no any in vivo data to support the physiological significance of the current finding. The author should show in APP KO mice whether gamma-secretase enzymatic activity is elevated or not, and putting back Aβ42 peptide will abolish these in vivo effects.</p>

<p>The findings presented in this manuscript form the basis for further <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> research to investigate the mechanisms of inhibition and its contribution to brain pathophysiology. Here, we used well-controlled model systems to investigate a novel mechanism of Aβ42 toxicity. Multiple mechanisms regulate the local concentration of Aβ42 <italic>in vivo</italic>, making the dissection of the biochemical mechanisms of the inhibition more complex. Nevertheless, beyond the scope of this report, we consider these very reasonable comments as a motivation for further research activities.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The experimental concentrations for Aβ42 peptide in the assay are too high, which are far beyond the physiological concentrations or pathological levels. The artificial observations are not supported by any in vivo experimental evidence.</p>

<p>It is correct that in the majority of the experiments we used low μM concentrations of Aβ42. However, we would like to note that we have also performed experiments where conditioned medium collected from human APP.Swe expressing neurons was used as a source of Aβ. In these experiments total Aβ concentration was in low nM range (0.5-1 nM) (Figure 7). Treatment with this conditioned medium  led to the increase APP-CTF levels, supporting  that low nM concentrations of Aβ are sufficient for partial inhibition of  γ-secretase.</p>
<p>In addition, we highlight that analyses of the brains of the AD affected individuals have shown that APPCTFs accumulate in both sporadic and genetic forms of the disease (Pera et al. 2013, Vaillant-Beuchot et al. 2021); and recently, Ferrer-Raventós et al. 2023 have revealed a correlation between APP-CTFs and Aβ levels at the synapse (Ferrer-Raventós et al. 2023). We therefore assessed the concentration of Aβ42 in synaptosomes derived from frontal cortices of post-mortem AD and age-matched non-demented (ND) control individuals. Our findings and conclusions are included in the revised version as follows:</p>
<p>In the results section:</p>
<p>“We next investigated the levels of Aβ42 in synaptosomes derived from frontal cortices of post-mortem AD and age-matched non-demented (ND) control individuals (Figure 10B). Towards this, we prepared synaptosomes from frozen brain tissues using Percoll gradient procedure (<italic>62, 63</italic>). Intact synaptosomes were spun to obtain a pellet which was resuspended in minimum amount of PBS, allowing us to estimate the volume containing the resuspended synaptosome sample. This is likely an overestimate of the actual synaptosome volume. Finally, synaptosomes were lysed in RIPA buffer and Aβ peptide concentrations measured using ELISA (MSD). We observed that the concentration of Aβ42 in the synaptosomes from (end-stage) AD tissues was significantly higher (10.7 nM)  than those isolated from non-demented tissues (0.7 nM), p&lt;0.0005***. These data provide evidence for accumulation at nM concentrations of endogenous Aβ42 in synaptosomes in end-stage AD brains. Given that we measured Aβ42 concentration in synaptosomes, we speculate that even higher concentrations of this peptide may be present in the endolysosome vesicle system, and therein inhibit the endogenous processing of APP-CTF at the synapse. Of note treatment of PC12 cells with conditioned medium containing even lower amounts of Aβ (low nanomolar range (0.5-1 nM)) resulted in the accumulation of APP-CTFs.”</p>
<p>In the discussion:</p>
<p>“The convergence of Aβ42 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (<italic>86-89</italic>), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (<italic>90</italic>).  Our analysis adds that endogenous Aβ42 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits γ-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of Aβ in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit γ-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of Aβ42 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of Aβ present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of γ-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in γ-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in Aβ due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. ”</p>
