<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Ubiquitin (Ub), a key player of protein turnover, can be phosphorylated by PINK1 kinase to generate S65-phosphorylated ubiquitin (pUb). Elevated pUb levels have been observed in aged human brains and human brains with Parkinson’s disease. However, how pUb is involved in neurodegeneration remains elusive. Here we show that elevation of pUb is pervasive in a multitude of neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, aging, and ischemic injury. In cultured cells, proteasomal inhibition by MG132 leads to sPINK1 accumulation, the cytosolic fragment of PINK1, thus promoting Ub phosphorylation. Elevated pUb impairs proteasomal degradation by disrupting covalent ubiquitin chain elongation and noncovalent proteasome-substrate interaction. Conversely, <italic>pink1</italic> knockout mitigates protein aggregation in both aging and ischemic mouse brains, as well as cells treated with MG132. Using AAV2/9 vector to specifically express sPINK1 in mouse hippocampus neurons, we observed cumulative pUb elevation, accompanied by protein aggregation, proteostasis disturbance, neuronal injury, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment. These sPINK1-induced impairments were reversed by co-expressing Ub/S65A phospho-null Ub mutant but exacerbated by Ub/S65E phospho-mimic mutant. As such, pUb elevation can result from declined proteasomal activity in neurodegenerative conditions, while a constant elevation of pUb actively drives neurodegeneration by further inhibiting proteasomal degradation. Our study reveals a new pathogenic pathway of neurodegeneration, highlighting the pUb-mediated feedforward loop as a promising therapeutic target for pharmaceutical intervention.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neurodegeneration, the hallmark of aging and neurodegenerative diseases, is characterized by irreversible loss of neurons, eventually leading to cognitive and motor impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Neurodegeneration is often accompanied by the accumulation of ubiquitinated, potentially neurotoxic proteins, which results from impaired protein degradation machinery, particularly the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Essential for maintaining cellular proteostasis, the UPS not only eliminates misfolded and toxic proteins but also dynamically regulates neuronal structure and function through controlled protein turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Substrate proteins are first covalently attached with K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, and the ubiquitin chains non-covalently interact with the ubiquitin-receptors in the proteasome thus targeting the substrate protein for UPS degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. The UPS activity can be compromised through a variety of mechanisms associated with neurodegeneration, such as modification and disassembly of the proteasome, reduced ATP level, direct inhibition by amyloid fibrils, as well as oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. While these factors have been extensively investigated with the goal to identify strategies preventing the decline of proteasomal activity, the dynamic changes of ubiquitin, a central player in the UPS, have been largely overlooked in the context of neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>Ubiquitin itself undergoes a multitude of post-translational modifications that can alter its structure and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. One such modification is phosphorylation at residue S65, installed by the kinase PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. An elevated level of S65-phosphorylated ubiquitin (pUb) has been observed in aged human brain and human brain with Parkinson’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Additionally, two forms of PINK1 exist in cells, including the full-length PINK1 localized to the mitochondrial membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], and sPINK1, a cytosolic fragment cleaved from PINK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Full-length PINK1 is activated upon mitochondrial damage, leading to the phosphorylation of ubiquitin and Parkin, thereby initiating mitophagy, a neuroprotective process for the selective removal of damaged mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. However, recent studies have indicated that severe and persistent mitochondrial stress can paradoxically cause a failure to induce mitophagy and at the same time, a sustained elevation of pUb levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Given the prevalence of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], pUb accumulation may result from the activation of full-length PINK1 with impaired mitophagy.</p>
<p>Alternatively, elevated pUb levels may arise from inhibited proteasomal degradation. The sPINK1, processed from the full-length PINK1 by mitochondria-residing proteases, is normally rapidly degraded by the proteasome <italic>per</italic> N-end rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. As the UPS function is often impaired under neurodegenerative conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], sPINK1 may accumulate and potentially phosphorylate ubiquitin, contributing to the elevation of pUb level.</p>
<p>While pUb elevation has been proposed as a potential biomarker of neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], its functional role remains poorly defined. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies suggest that phosphorylation alters ubiquitin’s structural dynamics and potentially its function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Moreover, PINK1 phosphorylation inhibits ubiquitin chain elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Since PINK1 can phosphorylate both monomeric ubiquitin and covalently linked polyubiquitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], pUb may also disrupt the noncovalent interaction between polyubiquitin conjugated to the substrate protein and the proteasome. In addition, it has also been reported that Ub/S65E, a phosphomimic mutant, inhibits protein turnover and reduces the cell viability of yeast when exposed to stresses, including oxidative stress and unfolded protein responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Thus, pUb may not simply be a biomarker but actively contribute to the neurodegenerative process.</p>
<p>Here we provide compelling evidences that pUb elevation is a driving force in neurodegeneration. We demonstrate that pUb levels increase in various neurodegenerative contexts, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), aging, and ischemic injury, resulting from the accumulation of sPINK1 under the conditions with proteasomal impairment. Importantly, we reveal that elevated pUb further inhibits proteasomal activity, forming a self-amplifying cycle that perpetuates protein aggregation and neuronal damage. By dissecting this mechanism from the molecular level to animal model, we uncover a general pathogenic mechanism that operates across a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

<title>Elevated pUb levels are a pervasive feature of neurodegeneration</title>
<p>Elevated pUb levels have been observed in the brains of individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. In the current study, we extend this observation to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative dementia. We found a marked elevation of both PINK1 and pUb in brain samples from AD patients compared to age- and sex-matched controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>; Figure 1—table supplementary 1). This finding was further corroborated in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, where increased PINK1 and pUb levels were also detected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, D</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Beyond specific neurodegenerative diseases, pUb elevation also appears to be associated with the aging process itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], a physiological condition often accompanied by gradual neurodegeneration. Here we observed a significant increase in neuronal pUb levels in aged wild-type mouse brains compared to young brains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E, F</xref>). On the other hand, pUb levels in <italic>pink1</italic>-knockout mice remained unchanged with age and were notably lower than in aged wild-type mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E, F</xref>).</p>
<p>We further showed that acute neurodegenerative conditions, such as cerebral ischemia, also exhibit elevated pUb levels. In a mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, we observed a marked increase in both PINK1 and pUb levels within the ischemic core (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, figure 1—figure supplementary 1). To further explore the relationship between pUb and ischemic stress, we subjected HEK293 cells to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), a model mimicking ischemic conditions. Following OGD and reperfusion, we noted a progressive increase in PINK1, sPINK1, and pUb levels, accompanied by a rise in protein aggregation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H, I</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings demonstrate that pUb elevation is a common feature across a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative conditions, both chronic and acute. While this reinforces pUb’s potential role as a biomarker, the diverse functions of ubiquitin suggest that elevated pUb levels may actively contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration.</p>

<title>Ubiquitin phosphorylation by sPINK1 impairs proteasomal function in HEK293 cells</title>
<p>The activation of the full-length PINK1 is triggered by mitochondrial damage, thereby initiating mitophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. In contrast, sPINK1 is typically degraded rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], with its accumulation inversely correlating with proteasomal activity. Indeed, we observed that mitochondrial injury by using CCCP and O/A treatment primarily elevate full-length PINK1, while MG132 predominantly increases sPINK1 in HEK293 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Further experiments showed that MG132 causes a concentration- and time-dependent increase in sPINK1 and pUb levels, with sPINK1 levels reaching a plateau after 6 hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B-E</xref>). In contrast, PINK1 and pUb levels remained low in <italic>pink1</italic>-knockout HEK293 cells treated with MG132 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B-E</xref>), paralleling observations from organismal studies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Although PINK1 activation usually involves dimerization at the mitochondrial outer membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], we investigated whether sPINK1 can also phosphorylate ubiquitin in the cytoplasm. We transiently transfected HEK293 cells with various PINK1 constructs: full-length PINK1, a stable cytoplasmic variant of sPINK1 (sPINK1*, PINK1/F101M/L102-L581), a kinase-dead version of this variant (sPINK1*-KD, with K219A/D362A/D384A mutations introduced) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], and Ub<sup>GG</sup>-sPINK1, a short-lived version of native sPINK1 with a ubiquitin appended at the N-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of PINK1 and sPINK1* post-transfection, but not of Ub<sup>GG</sup>-sPINK1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Western blot analysis also showed that transfection with both PINK1 and sPINK1* increased pUb levels, with sPINK1* inducing a greater increase than the full-length protein. However, transfection with sPINK1*-KD or Ub<sup>GG</sup>-sPINK1 did not increase pUb levels notably (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether the elevation of pUb perturbs protein degradation while minimizing its effect on mitochondria, we transiently transfect the various sPINK1 constructs to increase pUb levels. Immunofluorescence showed diffuse cytoplasmic ubiquitin staining in untransfected or eGFP-transfected control cells, whereas ubiquitin-positive puncta were evident following MG132 treatment or in sPINK1*-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Ubiquitin-positive puncta were weakly visible in Ub<sup>GG</sup>-sPINK1-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, 5th row, indicated with arrows) but absent in sPINK1*-KD-transfected cells. Western blot analysis further confirmed that MG132 treatment and sPINK1* transfection increased ubiquitin levels in the insoluble fraction, while the lack of strong signal with Ub<sup>GG</sup>-sPINK1 transfection indicates a dose-dependent effect of PINK1 activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>).</p>
<p>The activation of PINK1 can also influence autophagy, and ubiquitination is a key step for both autophagic and proteasomal degradation. Thus, the elevation of pUb may increase protein aggregation via the inhibition of both autophagic and UPS degradation. To assess the relative contribution of these two pathways on pUb-promoted protein aggregation, we treated the cells with puromycin to increase ubiquitinated protein level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>, with schematic shown in the left panel). The increase of ubiquitin signal could be markedly reduced by sPINK1* overexpression in comparison to neighboring cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). Blocking the autophagic degradation using BALA, on the other hand, we found that sPINK1*-overexpression increased ubiquitin signal in comparison to neighboring cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). Thus, sPINK1* enhances autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, possibly via p62 phosphorylation by PINK1 as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], while at the same time, inhibited proteasomal degradation.</p>
<p>To further confirm the inhibitory effect of pUb in proteasomal degradation, we assessed proteasomal activity in cells transfected with Ub-R-GFP, a model substrate for the assessment of cellular proteasomal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. GFP was rapidly degraded by functional proteasomes but accumulated upon the administration of MG132. On the other hand, transfection with sPINK1* also caused GFP accumulation, while sPINK1*-KD had no effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). This confirms that sPINK1* transfection lead to increased pUb levels, which impairs proteasomal degradation, mirroring the effect of MG132.</p>

<title>pUb impairs proteasomal activity via covalent and noncovalent mechanisms</title>
<p>To understand how ubiquitin phosphorylation affects UPS degradation, we first assessed ubiquitin chain formation <italic>in vitro</italic>. While unmodified ubiquitin efficiently formed di-, tri-, and higher-order chains with E1 and E2 enzymes, pUb predominantly produced di-Ub chains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), consistent with the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. The introduction of S65A (phospho-null) and S65E (phospho-mimetic) mutations into ubiquitin provided further insights into the effects of phosphorylation. The Ub/S65A mutation facilitated chain elongation similar to the unmodified Ub, whereas Ub/S65E mutation largely resulted in di-Ub formation but not higher-order chains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Although the Ub/S65E mutant may not completely mimic all characteristics of pUb, it effectively demonstrates the impact of S65 phosphorylation on chain formation.</p>

<p>We also investigated K48-linked ubiquitin chain formation in HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged Ub/K48-only mutant (FLAG-Ub/48K). Following proteasome inhibition with MG132, K48-linked chains accumulated in wildtype and <italic>pink1</italic>-/- cells, but not in cells overexpressing full-length PINK1 or sPINK1* (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Since PINK1 can phosphorylate both ubiquitin monomers and polyUb chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], we next investigated the impact of pUb chains on proteasomal degradation. <italic>In vitro</italic> degradation assays with purified proteasomes showed that degradation of K48-linked pUb-chain-modified GFP (pK48-polyUb-GFP) was slower compared to the unmodified counterpart (K48-polyUb-GFP) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, figure 3—figure supplementary 1, 2). The interactions between ubiquitinated substrates and immobilized proteasomes were then analyzed using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy following an established protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. The assays revealed fewer Ub-GFP puncta for pK48-polyUb-GFP compared to unphosphorylated controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D, E</xref>, figure 3—figure supplementary 3), and these puncta dissociated more rapidly from the proteasomes, suggesting a shorter dwell time of the proteasome-substrate complex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-I</xref>, figure 3—figure supplementary 4).</p>
<p>Collectively, these findings demonstrate that elevated pUb levels not only disrupt covalent ubiquitin chain elongation and subsequent substrate ubiquitination, but also hinder the non-covalent binding of ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome.

<p>Aging and neurodegenerative diseases commonly feature accumulations of protein aggregates alongside decreased proteasomal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Our findings have shown that conditions with impairing proteasomal function, such as Alzheimer’s disease, cerebral ischemia, aging, and pharmacologic treatment of proteasome inhibitor, result in increased levels of sPINK1 and pUb. As elevated pUb could in turn inhibit the UPS degradation, we hypothesized that proteasomal inhibition and pUb elevation form a positive feedback loop contributing to protein aggregation, while <italic>pink1</italic> knockout disrupts this process (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>In support of this hypothesis, we found that aged wildtype mice exhibited distinct Ub-positive puncta in neurons and increased insoluble ubiquitin levels, indicative of protein aggregation. In contrast, aged <italic>pink1-/-</italic> mice showed no such age-related changes in ubiquitin staining or insoluble ubiquitin levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B, C</xref>). Following MCAO, insoluble ubiquitin levels were significantly elevated in the ipsilateral hemisphere of wildtype mice, but not in <italic>pink1-/-</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>To directly assess the link between proteasomal inhibition, elevated pUb level, and protein aggregation, we treated wildtype and <italic>pink1-/-</italic> cells with MG132. As expected, MG132 induced an increase in insoluble ubiquitin levels in both cell types in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E, F</xref>). However, the accumulation of ubiquitin-positive aggregates occurred significantly slower in <italic>pink1-/-</italic> cells, even though they eventually reached levels comparable to those in wildtype cells at 24 hrs after MG132 administration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). This suggests that PINK1 deficiency delays the onset and progression of protein aggregation, but does not completely prevent it. Intriguingly, MG132 treatment also increased LC3-II levels, a marker of autophagy, in wildtype cells, possibly indicating either activation of autophagy or reduced LC3 degradation as a compensatory response to proteasomal inhibition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G, H</xref>). Conversely, LC3-II levels did not increase in <italic>pink1-/-</italic> cells following MG132 treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G, H</xref>). This indicates that PINK1 is required for autophagy activation under proteasome stress, aligning with our observations of enhanced autophagy upon PINK1 overexpression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, the results indicate that <italic>pink1</italic> knockout can alleviate protein aggregation associated with aging, ischemic injury, or proteasomal inhibition by disrupting the self-amplifying cycle of proteasomal impairment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

<title>sPINK1* overexpression causes cumulative proteome-wide changes</title>
<p>As illustrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, the over-expression of sPINK1 may lead to a sustained elevation of pUb and cause protein aggregation. Since protein aggregation is one of primary causes for neurodegeneration, we assessed the impact of pUb elevation on neurons. First, we confirmed the roles of sPINK1 and phosphomimetic Ub/S65E mutant on protein aggregation in SH-SY5Y cell, a neuroblast-link cell line. Ubiquitin-positive puncta was observed in cells treated with MG132 and overexpressing either sPINK1* or Ub/S65E (Figure 5—figure supplementary 1), similar to the findings in HEK293 cell (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been shown that the phospho-null mutant Ub/S65A could mitigate, while the phospho-mimic Ub/S65E could mimic, the effects produced by PINK1 through the phosphorylation of ubiquitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Thus, we specifically overexpressed sPINK1*, sPINK1* with Ub/S65A (sPINK1*+Ub/S65A), Ub/S65E, or GFP control in mouse hippocampal neurons using AAV2/9, and the specific expression was confirmed through GFP co-localization with fluorescence staining of NeuN in the CA1 region (Figure 5—figure supplementary 2). While no changes were observed at 10 days post-transfection, significant neuronal loss was evident at 30 and 70 days in mice expressing Ub/S65E, but not in other three groups (Figure 5—figure supplementary 2). Additionally, Ub/S65E induced glial responses at 30- and 70-days post transfection, as demonstrated by GFAP/Iba1 staining and GFAP/CD11b Western blots (Figure 5—figure supplementary 3, 4). In contrast, the sPINK1* and sPINK1*+Ub/S65A groups showed an increase in GFAP (indicative of astrocyte activation) at 70-days post transfection, without effects on Iba1 or CD11b (Figure 5—figure supplementary 3, 4). The existence of GFAP response may be caused by potential neuronal injury at 70-days post-transfection.</p>
<p>To investigate the molecular underpinnings of sPINK1*-induced neuronal injury, we performed proteomic analysis of mouse hippocampus at 30- and 70-days post-transfection (Figure 5—dataset supplementary 1). Despite similar number of total proteins identified between the GFP and sPINK1* groups (Figure 5—figure supplementary 5A-D), notable differences emerged. For example, the neuronal injury/neuroinflammation marker HMGB1 was elevated at both time points with sPINK1* overexpression, while the mitochondrial marker Tom20 showed a decrease only at 70 days, indicating a delayed loss of mitochondria.</p>
<p>Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) further revealed a time-dependent impact on mitochondrial function. At 30-days, changes in proteins related to mitophagy, mitochondrial organization, and respiratory electron transport suggested an initial compensatory response to mitochondrial stress (Figure 5—figure supplementary 5D). However, at 70-days, these changes expanded to include broader mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptotic processes, culminating in mitochondrial loss and neuronal injury (Figure 5—figure supplementary 5D).</p>
<p>Further GO analysis underscored the extensive proteomic dysregulation caused by sPINK1* overexpression (Figure 5—figure supplementary 5F-H). At 70-days, a large number of proteins were both upregulated and downregulated, indicative of disrupted proteostasis. This could be attributed to proteasomal inhibition or a stress response to protein aggregates. For example, we observed a significant up-regulation of RNA-binding and RNA-processing proteins. Similar proteome-wide change has been noticed in the Ub/S65E over-expressed yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Importantly, we found many affected proteins were associated with the disruption of synaptic functions and neuronal projections, while downregulated proteins were linked to myelination, synaptic maturation, and lipid metabolism (Figure 5—figure supplementary 5F-H). Note that many of these changes were insignificant at 30-days post-transfection (Figure 5—figure supplementary 5F-H). These findings collectively underscore the systemic impact of sPINK1* overexpression on neuronal structure and function, which likely drives progressive neuronal injury.</p>

<title>Elevated pUb levels drive protein aggregation in mouse hippocampal neurons</title>
<p>To assess the impact of elevated pUb on protein aggregation <italic>in vivo</italic>, we examined PINK1 and pUb levels in the mouse hippocampus following sPINK1* overexpression. At 30-days, a distinct band for sPINK1 was observed, accompanied by a significant increase in pUb levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). At 70-days, three distinct bands that could be assigned to sPINK1, full-length PINK1, and ubiquitinated PINK1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The presence of full-length PINK1 indicates mitochondrial injury, while ubiquitinated PINK1 suggests compromised proteasomal activity. Notably, co-expression of Ub/S65A yielded only a faint sPINK1 band (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating its potential to counteract the proteasomal inhibition induced by sPINK1*, thereby promoting degradation of this stable sPINK1 variant.

<p>Consistent with these behavioral findings, Western blot analysis showed decreased levels of Tom20, a mitochondrial marker, in brains overexpressing sPINK1*. This mitochondrial deficit was reversed when Ub/S65A was co-expressed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), aligning with the proteomic data (Figure 5—figure supplementary 5D). Additionally, we noted reduced levels of MAP2, a dendritic marker, and PSD95, a postsynaptic density marker, in the brains expressing sPINK1* and Ub/S65E. These reductions were restored to normal levels upon Ub/S65A co-expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F, G</xref>). Accordingly, Golgi staining revealed a decrease in dendritic spine density following sPINK1* overexpression, which was reversed upon Ub/S65A co-expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). In contrast, Ub/S65E overexpression led to more severe dendritic and spine loss, with notably slimmer dendrites and a significant reduction in spine density compared to sPINK1* (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings underscore that sPINK1*-induced neuronal damage accumulates over time and can be effectively mitigated by co-expressing the phospho-null mutant Ub/S65A. Conversely, the phospho-mimic Ub/S65E exacerbates neuronal damage rapidly.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the current study, we demonstrate that elevated pUb level is a pervasive feature in both chronic and acute neurodegenerative conditions. This observation aligns with previous reports of sustained pUb elevation in human brains with PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Our findings extend this phenomenon to AD, aging, and cerebral ischemia. While severe mitochondrial injury has been implicated as a mechanism leading to pUb elevation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], we have uncovered an additional contributing factor. We show that inhibition of proteasomal degradation stabilizes sPINK1 in the cytoplasm, where it retains its ability to phosphorylate ubiquitin.</p>
<p>Proteasomal inhibition can be caused by various pathological factors in neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Cerebral ischemia, for instance, induces ATP deficiency, while hypoxia and the secondary effect of oxidative stress would further lead to proteasomal modification and impairment of proteasomal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. On the other hand, in AD, amyloid fibrils can directly block the proteasome’s substrate channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Due to the decline of proteasomal activity in various neurodegenerative diseases, elevated sPINK1 levels would consequently result in the cumulative increase of pUb. Thus, the elevation of ubiquitin phosphorylation also constitutes a hallmark of neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>We further demonstrate that elevation of pUb level reciprocally contributes to UPS dysfunction. Our findings reveal that increasing pUb levels through sPINK1* overexpression exacerbated protein aggregation by impairing proteasomal degradation in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models. Conversely, <italic>pink1</italic> knockout reduces protein aggregation in aged mouse brains, brains subjected to MCAO, and HEK293 cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor. Mechanistically, we have found that ubiquitin phosphorylation negatively impacts both the covalent elongation of ubiquitin chains, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], and the non-covalent interaction between K48-linked polyUb chains and the proteasome, as discovered in the current study, likely resulting from the increased ubiquitin structural dynamics upon phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. This dual inhibitory mechanism hampers ubiquitination, recruitment, and ultimately, degradation of substrate proteins by the proteasome. Impaired proteasomal activity further impedes sPINK1 degradation, forming a self-amplifying cycle of elevated pUb levels and progressive proteasomal dysfunction, culminating in the accumulation of protein aggregates, the established hallmark of neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>Our findings indicate that elevated pUb levels can actively contribute to neurodegeneration. Yet, the functional role of pUb appears nuanced: while transient pUb elevation is generally neuroprotective, sustained elevation becomes neurotoxic. As a neuroprotective mechanism, PINK1 activation upon mitochondrial damage leads to transient phosphorylation of ubiquitin and Parkin, triggering mitophagy to remove damaged mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Indeed, PINK1 deficiency has been shown to cause neurodegeneration, prompting the development of small-molecule activators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. However, in the current study, overexpression of a stable sPINK1 variant led to chronic neuronal injury, resulting from the reciprocal relationship between proteasomal inhibition and cumulative pUb elevation. The progressive decline in proteasomal function would consequently disrupt cellular proteostasis and allow protein aggregates to build up. As such, pUb is not simply a biomarker for neurodegeneration — sustained elevation is a driving factor for progressive neuronal injury and neuroinflammation.</p>
<p>To confirm the neurotoxic effect of pUb, we utilized the phospho-null Ub/S65A mutant to dilute pUb and antagonize its effects. Ub/S65A restored proteasomal activity <italic>in vivo</italic> and even promoted the degradation of the stable sPINK1 variant, preventing its accumulation. Moreover, Ub/S65A co-expression allowed the formation of longer polyUb chains, further supporting its protective role. Conversely, overexpression of the phospho-mimetic Ub/S65E mutant induced even more severe neuronal damage than sPINK1* overexpression. This effect can be attributed to the 100% increase in mimicking pUb with Ub/S65E, whereas sPINK1*-induced pUb levels are low and subjected to dephosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Similar toxic effects resulting from Ub/S65E overexpression has been reported in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, it should be noted that, sPINK1* can phosphorylate both free and conjugated Ub, whereas Ub/S65E only mimics monomeric pUb, potentially further contributing to the detrimental effects of Ub/S65E mutant.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings have unveiled a novel pathogenetic mechanism of neurodegeneration, in which the self-amplifying cycle of elevated pUb level and proteasomal inhibition leads to the progressive decline of proteasomal activity and the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates. Our findings demonstrate pUb is more than a consequence of this gradual cumulative process, but also a critical contributor to disease progression. Targeting this pUb-mediated self-amplifying cycle can be a viable therapeutic strategy to ameliorate the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. On the other hand, elevated pUb levels observed in a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases may hinder the pharmacological efficacy of drugs that target the UPS.</p>

The substrate protein, either K48-polyUb-GFP or pK48-polyUb-GFP, was then added to the coverslip to a final concentration of 400 pM. The imaging was performed on a Nikon A1 TIRF microscope equipped with a 488 nm laser and an EMCCD camera (Andor DU-897). The time series were acquired at 300 ms per frame for a total duration of 2 min for each time series. The view area was 512 pixels by 512 pixels (16 by 16 µm), and the experiments were repeated four times on four different proteasome-immobilized cover slides. The puncta density was counted in iSMS software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>] with default settings. Only when the substrate protein becomes bound to the immobilized proteasome, the green puncta can be observed, and only the puncta with brightness above a certain threshold (≥ 3000 a.u.) and the dwell time of more than three consecutive frames are selected for counting the overall number of puncta. The dwell times were tabulated in 300 ms bins and fitted with single exponential decay.</p>

<title>Proteomics analysis</title>
<p>Hippocampus samples were rinsed using PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer. The samples were then denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by sonication at 4 °C (3 s on, 3 s off, with 30% amplitude). The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected as whole tissue extract. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford protein assay. Extracts from the protein sample (2 g) were trypsin digested.</p>
<p>The enriched peptides sample were precipitated in solution A (0.1% formic acid), and was centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 min. The peptides were separated on a reverse-phase nano-HPLC C18 column (Precolumn, 3 µm, 120 Å, 2×100 i.d.; analysis column, 1.9 µm 120 Å, 30 cm x150 µm, i.d.) at a flow rate of 600 nL/min with a 150 min gradient of 7-95% solution B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). For peptide ionization, 2100 V was applied, and a 320 °C capillary temperature was used. For detection with Q Exactive HF, peptides were analyzed with one full scan (350–1400 m/z, R = 120,000 at 200 m/z) with an automatic gain control target of 3×10<sup>6</sup> ions, with max injection time of 80 ms, followed by up to 30 data-dependent MS/MS scans with high-energy collision dissociation (target 5 ×10<sup>4</sup> ions, max injection time 19 ms, isolation window 1.6 m/z, normalized collision energy of 27%), detected in the Orbitrap (R = 15,000 at 200 m/z). Dynamic exclusion time was set as 30 sec.</p>
<p>Raw MS data were searched against the mouse National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Refseq protein database (updated on 2013/07/01, 29764 entries) by the software Thermo Proteome Discoverer 2.1 using Mascot 2.3. The mass tolerances were 20 ppm for precursor and 50 mmu for product ions for Q Exactive HF. The search engine set Acetyl(Protein N-term), oxidation(M), Phospho(ST), Phospho(Y) as variable modifications. Trypsin digestion of up to two missed cleavages was allowed. The peptide identifications were accepted at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. Using a label-free approach, a unique peptide was used to represent the absolute abundance of a particular peptide across the sample.</p>
<p>For the proteomic data analysis, quantile normalization was applied to eliminate batch effect, and missing values were imputed using the minimum value observed in the dataset. The differentially expressed proteins were defined with the following these criteria: an increase by more than two-fold or decrease by more than 50%. For Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was conducted by GSEApy (version 0.10.5) Python package to evaluate the enriched GO terms. The association of proteins with GO terms was derived from the DAVID database. For Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), the ranking metric used was the fold change, and significantly enriched GO terms were filtered with a cutoff <italic>P</italic>-value of 0.05.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data are presented as mean ±SD. GraphPad Prism Software (version 6.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for statistical analysis and plot graphs. The ROUT test was used to identify outliers. The Brown-Forsythe test was used to evaluate the equal variances of the data. D’Agonstino-Pearson omnibus normality test was performed to test the normality of the data. If the data pass the normality test and equal variance test, <italic>t</italic>-test, the parametric one-way ANOVA (Tukey multiple comparisons test), or two-way ANOVA (Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons test) was used. If not, nonparametric test (Dunn’s multiple comparisons test) was used. Chi-square test was also used to assess the differences in categorical data distributions. P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript discusses the role of phosphorylated ubiquitin (pUb) by PINK1 kinase in neurodegenerative diseases. It reveals that elevated levels of pUb are observed in aged human brains and those affected by Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as in Alzheimer's disease (AD), aging, and ischemic injury. The study shows that increased pUb impairs proteasomal degradation, leading to protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. The authors also demonstrate that PINK1 knockout can mitigate protein aggregation in aging and ischemic mouse brains, as well as in cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor. While this study provided some interesting data, several important points should be addressed before being further considered.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Reveals a novel pathological mechanism of neurodegeneration mediated by pUb, providing a new perspective on understanding neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>
(2) The study covers not only a single disease model but also various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, aging, and ischemic injury, enhancing the breadth and applicability of the research findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) PINK1 has been reported as a kinase capable of phosphorylating Ubiquitin, hence the expected outcome of increased p-Ub levels upon PINK1 overexpression. Figures 5E-F do not demonstrate a significant increase in Ub levels upon overexpression of PINK1 alone, whereas the evident increase in Ub expression upon overexpression of S65A is apparent. Therefore, the notion that increased Ub phosphorylation leads to protein aggregation in mouse hippocampal neurons is not yet convincingly supported.</p>
<p>
(2) The specificity of PINK1 and p-Ub antibodies requires further validation, as a series of literature indicate that the expression of the PINK1 protein is relatively low and difficult to detect under physiological conditions.</p>
<p>
(3) In Figure 6, relying solely on Western blot staining and golgi staining under high magnification is insufficient to prove the impact of PINK1 overexpression on neuronal integrity and cognitive function. The authors should supplement their findings with immunostaining results for MAP2 or NeuN to demonstrate whether neuronal cells are affected.</p>
<p>
(4) The authors should provide more detailed figure captions to facilitate the understanding of the results depicted in the figures.</p>
<p>
(5) While the study proposes that pUb promotes neurodegeneration by affecting proteasomal function, the specific molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways remain to be elucidated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript makes the claim that pUb is elevated in a number of degenerative conditions including Alzheimer's Disease and cerebral ischaemia. Some of this is based on antibody staining which is poorly controlled and difficult to accept at this point. They confirm previous results that a cytosolic form of PINK1 accumulates following proteasome inhibition and that this can be active. Accumulation of pUb is proposed to interfere with proteostasis through inhibition of the proteasome. Much of the data relies on over-expression and there is little support for this reflecting physiological mechanisms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript is poorly written. I appreciate this may be difficult in a non-native tongue, but felt that many of the problems are organisational. Less data of higher quality, better controls and incision would be preferable. Overall the referencing of past work is lamentable.</p>
<p>
Methods are also very poor and difficult to follow.</p>
<p>Until technical issues are addressed I think this would represent an unreliable contribution to the field.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study aims to explore the role of phosphorylated ubiquitin (pUb) in proteostasis and its impact on neurodegeneration. By employing a combination of molecular, cellular, and in vivo approaches, the authors demonstrate that elevated pUb levels contribute to both protective and neurotoxic effects, depending on the context. The research integrates proteasomal inhibition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and protein aggregation, providing new insights into the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The integration of proteomics, molecular biology, and animal models provides comprehensive insights.</p>
<p>
- The use of phospho-null and phospho-mimetic ubiquitin mutants elegantly demonstrates the dual effects of pUb.</p>
<p>
- Data on behavioral changes and cognitive impairments establish a clear link between cellular mechanisms and functional outcomes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- While the study discusses the reciprocal relationship between proteasomal inhibition and pUb elevation, causality remains partially inferred.</p>
<p>
- The role of alternative pathways, such as autophagy, in compensating for proteasomal dysfunction is underexplored.</p>
<p>
- The immunofluorescence images in Figure 1A-D lack clarity and transparency. It is not clear whether the images represent human brain tissue, mouse brain tissue, or cultured cells. Additionally, the DAPI staining is not well-defined, making it difficult to discern cell nuclei or staging. To address these issues, lower-magnification images that clearly show the brain region should be provided, along with improved DAPI staining for better visualization. Furthermore, the Results section and Figure legends should explicitly indicate which brain region is being presented. These concerns raise questions about the reliability of the reported pUb levels in AD, which is a critical aspect of the study's findings.</p>
<p>
- Figure 4B should also indicate which brain region is being presented.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript discusses the role of phosphorylated ubiquitin (pUb) by PINK1 kinase in neurodegenerative diseases. It reveals that elevated levels of pUb are observed in aged human brains and those affected by Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as in Alzheimer's disease (AD), aging, and ischemic injury. The study shows that increased pUb impairs proteasomal degradation, leading to protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. The authors also demonstrate that PINK1 knockout can mitigate protein aggregation in aging and ischemic mouse brains, as well as in cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor. While this study provided some interesting data, several important points should be addressed before being further considered.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Reveals a novel pathological mechanism of neurodegeneration mediated by pUb, providing a new perspective on understanding neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>(2) The study covers not only a single disease model but also various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, aging, and ischemic injury, enhancing the breadth and applicability of the research findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) PINK1 has been reported as a kinase capable of phosphorylating Ubiquitin, hence the expected outcome of increased p-Ub levels upon PINK1 overexpression. Figures 5E-F do not demonstrate a significant increase in Ub levels upon overexpression of PINK1 alone, whereas the evident increase in Ub expression upon overexpression of S65A is apparent. Therefore, the notion that increased Ub phosphorylation leads to protein aggregation in mouse hippocampal neurons is not yet convincingly supported.</p>

<p>Indeed, overexpression of sPINK1* alone caused little change in Ub levels in the soluble fraction (Figure 5E), which is expected. Ub in the soluble fraction is in a relatively stable, buffered state. However, overexpression of sPINK1* resulted in an increase in Ub levels in the insoluble fraction, indicating protein aggregation. The molecular weight of Ub in the insoluble fraction was predominantly below 70 kDa, implying that phosphorylation inhibits Ub chain elongation.</p>
<p>To further examine this, we used the Ub/S65A mutant to antagonize Ub phosphorylation, and found that the aggregation at low molecular weight was significantly reduced, indicating a partial restoration of proteasomal activity. The increase in Ub levels in both the soluble and insoluble fractions likely results from the high rate of ubiquitination driven by the elevated levels of Ub. Notably, the overexpressed Ub/S65A was detected in the Western blot using the wild-type Ub antibody, which accounts for the apparently increased Ub level.</p>
<p>When overexpressing Ub/S65E, we again saw an increase in Ub levels in the insoluble fraction (but no increase in the soluble fraction), with low molecular weight bands even more prominent than those observed with sPINK1* transfection. These findings collectively support the conclusion that sPINK1* promotes protein aggregation through Ub phosphorylation.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the challenges in achieving optimal specificity for commercially available and custom-generated antibodies targeting PINK1 and pUb, particularly given the low endogenous levels of these proteins under physiological conditions. Despite these limitations, we observed robust immunofluorescent staining for PINK1 (Figures 1A, 1C, and 1G) and pUb (Figures 1B, 1D, and 1G) in human brain samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, as well as in mouse brains from models of AD and cerebral ischemia. The significant elevation of PINK1 and pUb under these pathological conditions likely accounts for the clear visualization. To validate antibody specificity, we have included images from <italic>pink1</italic>-/- mice as negative controls in the revised manuscript (Figure 1C and 1D, third panel).</p>
<p>In addition, we detected a significant increase in pUb levels in aged mouse brains compared to young ones (Figures 1E and 1F). Notably, in <italic>pink1</italic>-/- mice, pUb levels remained unchanged between young and aged groups, despite some background signal, further supporting the conclusion that pUb accumulation during aging is PINK1-dependent.</p>
<p>In HEK293 cells, <italic>pink1</italic>-/- cells served as a negative control for PINK1 (Figure 2B and 2C) and for pUb (Figure 2D and 2E). While the Western blot using the pUb antibody displayed some nonspecific background, pUb levels in <italic>pink1</italic>-/- cells remained unchanged across all MG132 treatment conditions (Figures 2D and 2E), further attesting the reliability of our findings.</p>

<p>(3) In Figure 6, relying solely on Western blot staining and Golgi staining under high magnification is insufficient to prove the impact of PINK1 overexpression on neuronal integrity and cognitive function. The authors should supplement their findings with immunostaining results for MAP2 or NeuN to demonstrate whether neuronal cells are affected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this important point. We included NeuN immunofluorescent staining in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 of the original manuscript. The results demonstrate a significant loss of NeuN-positive cells in the hippocampus following Ub/S65E overexpression, while no apparent change in NeuN-positive cells was observed with sPINK1* transfection alone. These findings provide evidence of neuronal loss in response to Ub/S65E, further supporting the impact of pUb elevation on neuronal integrity.</p>
<p>While we did not perform MAP2 immunostaining, we included complementary analyses to assess neuronal integrity. Specifically, we performed Western blotting to determine MAP2 protein levels and used Golgi staining to study neuronal morphology and synaptic structure in greater detail. These analyses revealed that overexpression of sPINK1* or Ub/S65E decreased MAP2 levels and caused damage to synaptic structures (Figures 6F and 6H). Importantly, the deleterious effects of sPINK1* overexpression could be rescued by co-expression of Ub/S65A, further underscoring the role of pUb in mediating these changes.</p>
<p>Together, our NeuN immunostaining, MAP2 analysis, and Golgi staining provide strong evidence for the impact of PINK1 overexpression and pUb elevation on neuronal integrity and synaptic health. We believe these complementary approaches sufficiently address the reviewer’s concern and highlight the pathological consequences of elevated pUb levels.</p>

<p>(5) While the study proposes that pUb promotes neurodegeneration by affecting proteasomal function, the specific molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways remain to be elucidated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The specific molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways through which pUb promotes neurodegeneration are likely multifaceted and interconnected. Mitochondrial dysfunction appears to be a central contributor to neurodegeneration following sPINK1* overexpression. This is supported by (1) an observed increase in full-length PINK1, indicative of impaired mitochondrial quality control, and (2) proteomic data revealing enhanced mitophagy at 30 days post-transfection and substantial mitochondrial injury by 70 days post-transfection. The progressive damage to mitochondria caused by protein aggregates can cause further neuronal injury and degeneration.</p>
<p>In addition, reduced proteasomal activity may result in the accumulation of inhibitory proteins that are normally degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our proteomics analysis identified a &gt;54-fold increase in CamK2n1 (UniProt ID: Q6QWF9), an endogenous inhibitor of CaMKII activation, following sPINK1* overexpression. This is particularly significant because the accumulation of CamK2n1 could suppress CaMKII activation and, subsequently, inhibit the CREB signaling pathway (illustrated below). As CREB is essential for synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, its inhibition may further amplify neurodegenerative processes.</p>
<p>While our study identifies proteasomal dysfunction and mitochondrial damage as key initial triggers, downstream effects—such as disruptions in signaling pathways like CaMKII-CREB—likely contribute to a broader cascade of pathological events. These findings highlight the complexity of pUb-mediated neurodegeneration and suggest that further exploration of downstream mechanisms is necessary to fully elucidate the pathways involved.</p>
<p>We plan to include the proteomics data, in the revised manuscript, of mouse brain tissues at 30 days and 70 days post-transfection, to further highlight this downstream effect upon proteasomal dysfunction.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript makes the claim that pUb is elevated in a number of degenerative conditions including Alzheimer's Disease and cerebral ischemia. Some of this is based on antibody staining which is poorly controlled and difficult to accept at this point. They confirm previous results that a cytosolic form of PINK1 accumulates following proteasome inhibition and that this can be active. Accumulation of pUb is proposed to interfere with proteostasis through inhibition of the proteasome. Much of the data relies on over-expression and there is little support for this reflecting physiological mechanisms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript is poorly written. I appreciate this may be difficult in a non-native tongue, but felt that many of the problems are organisational. Less data of higher quality, better controls and incision would be preferable. Overall the referencing of past work is lamentable.</p>
<p>Methods are also very poor and difficult to follow.</p>
<p>
Until technical issues are addressed I think this would represent an unreliable contribution to the field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(1) Antibody specificity and detection under pathological conditions</p>
<p>We acknowledge the limitations of commercially available antibodies for detecting PINK1 and pUb. Despite these challenges, our findings demonstrate a significant increase in PINK1 and pUb levels under pathological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and ischemia. Additionally, we observed an increase in pUb level during brain aging, further highlighting its relevance in this particular physiological process. To ensure reliable quantification of PINK1 and pUb levels, we used <italic>pink1</italic>-/- mice and HEK293 cells as negative controls. For example, PINK1 levels were extremely low in control cells but increased dramatically after 2 hours of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and 6 hours of reperfusion (Figure 1H). Together, these controls validate that the observed elevations in PINK1 and pUb are specific and linked to pathological or certain physiological conditions.</p>
<p>(2)  Overexpression as a model for pathological conditions</p>
<p>To investigate whether the inhibitory effects of sPINK1* on the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are dependent on its kinase activity, we utilized a kinase-dead version of sPINK1* as a negative control. Since PINK1 has multiple substrates, we further explored whether its effects on UPS inhibition were mediated specifically by ubiquitin phosphorylation. For this, we used Ub/S65A (a phospho-null mutant) to antagonize Ub phosphorylation by sPINK1*, and Ub/S65E (a phospho-mimetic mutant) to mimic phosphorylated Ub. These well-defined controls ensured the robustness of our conclusions.</p>
<p>While overexpression does not perfectly replicate physiological conditions, it serves as a valuable model for studying pathological scenarios such as neurodegeneration and brain aging, where pUb levels are known to increase. For example, we observed a 30.4% increase in pUb levels in aged mouse brains compared to young brains (Figure 1F). Similarly, in our sPINK1* overexpression model, pUb levels increased by 43.8% and 59.9% at 30- and 70-days post-transfection, respectively, compared to controls (Figures 5A and 5C). Notably, co-expression of sPINK1* with Ub/S65A almost entirely prevented sPINK1* accumulation (Figure 5B), indicating that an active UPS can efficiently degrade sPINK1*. Collectively, these findings show that sPINK1* accumulation inhibits UPS activity, a defect that can be rescued by the phospho-null Ub mutant. Thus, this overexpression model closely mimics pathological conditions and offers valuable insights into pUb-mediated proteasomal dysfunction.</p>
<p>(3) Organization of the manuscript</p>
<p>We believe the structure of the manuscript is justified and systematically addresses the key aspects of the study in a logic flow:</p>
<p>(a) Evidence for the increase of PINK1 and pUb in multiple pathological and physiological conditions.</p>
<p>(b) Identification of the sources and consequences of sPINK1 and pUb elevation.</p>
<p>(c) Mechanistic insights into how pUb inhibits UPS-mediated degradation.</p>
<p>(d) Validation of these findings using <italic>pink1</italic>-/- mice and cells.</p>
<p>(e) Evidence of the reciprocal relationship between proteasomal inhibition and pUb elevation, culminating in neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>(f) Demonstration of elevated pUb levels and protein aggregation in the hippocampus following sPINK1* overexpression, supported by proteomic analyses, behavioral tests, Western blotting, and Golgi staining.</p>
<p>Thus, this organization provides a clear and cohesive narrative, culminating in the demonstration that sPINK1* overexpression induces hippocampal neuron degeneration.</p>
<p>(4) Revisions to writing, referencing, and methodology</p>
<p>We will improve the clarity and flow of the manuscript, add more references to properly acknowledge prior work, and incorporate additional details into the Methods section to enhance readability and reproducibility. These improvements should address the organizational and technical concerns raised, while strengthen the overall quality of the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study aims to explore the role of phosphorylated ubiquitin (pUb) in proteostasis and its impact on neurodegeneration. By employing a combination of molecular, cellular, and in vivo approaches, the authors demonstrate that elevated pUb levels contribute to both protective and neurotoxic effects, depending on the context. The research integrates proteasomal inhibition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and protein aggregation, providing new insights into the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The integration of proteomics, molecular biology, and animal models provides comprehensive insights.</p>
<p>- The use of phospho-null and phospho-mimetic ubiquitin mutants elegantly demonstrates the dual effects of pUb.</p>
<p>- Data on behavioral changes and cognitive impairments establish a clear link between cellular mechanisms and functional outcomes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- While the study discusses the reciprocal relationship between proteasomal inhibition and pUb elevation, causality remains partially inferred.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reciprocal cycle between proteasomal inhibition and pUb elevation can be initiated by various factors that impair proteasomal activity. These factors include Aβ accumulation, ATP depletion, reduced expression of proteasome components, and covalent modifications of proteasomal subunits—all well-established contributors to the progressive decline in proteasome function. Once initiated, this cycle would become self-perpetuating, with the accumulation of sPINK1 and pUb driving a feedback loop of deteriorating proteasomal activity.</p>
<p>In the current study, this reciprocal relationship between sPINK1/pUb elevation and proteasomal dysfunction is depicted in Figure 4A. Our results demonstrate that increased sPINK1 or PINK1 levels, such as through overexpression, can initiate this cycle. Crucially, co-expression of Ub/S65A effectively rescues the cells from this cycle, highlighting the pivotal role of pUb in driving proteasomal inhibition and establishing causality in this relationship. At the animal level, <italic>pink1</italic> knockout could prevent protein aggregation upon aging and cerebral ischemia (Figures 1E and 1G).</p>
<p>Mitochondrial injury is a likely source of elevated PINK1 and pUb levels. A recent study showed that efficient mitophagy is necessary to prevent pUb accumulation (bioRxiv 2023.02.14.528378), suggesting that mitochondrial damage can trigger this cycle. In another study (bioRxiv 2024.07.03.601901), the authors found that mitochondrial damage could enhance PINK1 transcription, further increasing cytoplasmic PINK1 levels and exacerbating the cycle.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The role of alternative pathways, such as autophagy, in compensating for proteasomal dysfunction is underexplored.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Elevated sPINK1 has been reported to enhance autophagy (<italic>Autophagy</italic> 2016, 12: 632-647), potentially compensating for the impaired UPS. One mechanism involves the phosphorylation of p62 by sPINK1, which enhances autophagy activity. In our study, we did observe increased autophagic activity upon sPINK1* overexpression, as shown in Figure 2I (middle panel, without BALA). This increased autophagy may help degrade ubiquitinated proteins induced by puromycin, partially compensating for the proteasomal dysfunction.</p>
<p>This compensation might explain why protein aggregation only increased slightly, though statistically significant, at 70 days post sPINK1* transfection (Figure 5F). Additionally, we observed a slight, though statistically insignificant, increase in LC3II levels in the hippocampus of mouse brains at 70 days post sPINK1* transfection (Figure 5—figure supplement 6), further supporting the notion of autophagy activation.</p>
<p>However, while autophagy may provide some compensation, its effect is likely limited. Autophagy and UPS differ significantly in their roles and mechanisms of degradation. Autophagy is a bulk degradation pathway that is generally non-selective, targeting long-lived proteins, damaged organelles, and intracellular pathogens. In contrast, the UPS is highly selective, primarily degrading short-lived regulatory proteins, misfolded proteins, and proteins tagged for degradation.</p>
<p>Together, we found that sPINK1* overexpression enhanced autophagy-mediated protein degradation while simultaneously impairing UPS-mediated degradation. This suggests that while autophagy may provide partial compensation for proteasomal dysfunction, it is not sufficient to fully counterbalance the selective degradation functions of the UPS.</p>

<p>- The immunofluorescence images in Figure 1A-D lack clarity and transparency. It is not clear whether the images represent human brain tissue, mouse brain tissue, or cultured cells. Additionally, the DAPI staining is not well-defined, making it difficult to discern cell nuclei or staging. To address these issues, lower-magnification images that clearly show the brain region should be provided, along with improved DAPI staining for better visualization. Furthermore, the Results section and Figure legends should explicitly indicate which brain region is being presented. These concerns raise questions about the reliability of the reported pUb levels in AD, which is a critical aspect of the study's findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will include low-magnification images in the supplementary figures of the revised manuscript to provide a broader context for the immunofluorescence data presented in Figure 1. DAPI staining at higher magnifications will also be provided to improve visualization of cell nuclei and overall tissue structure. Additionally, we will indicate the brain regions examined in the corresponding figure legends, and incorporate more details in the Results section to provide clearer descriptions of the samples and brain regions analyzed.</p>
<p>The human brain samples presented in Figure 1 are from the cingulate gyrus region of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Our analysis revealed that PINK1 is primarily localized within cell bodies, while pUb is more abundant around Aβ plaques, likely in nerve terminals. These additional clarifications and supplementary figures should provide greater transparency and improve the reliability of our findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Figure 4B should also indicate which brain region is being presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The images were taken for layer III-IV in the neocortex of mouse brains, which information will be incorporated in the figure legend of the revised manuscript.</p>
