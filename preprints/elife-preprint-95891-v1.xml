<title>Abstract</title><p>Root-synthesized secondary metabolites are critical quality-conferring compounds of foods, plant-derived medicines, and beverages. However, information at a single-cell level on root-specific secondary metabolism remains largely unexplored. L-theanine, an important quality component of tea, is primarily synthesized in roots, from which it is then transported to new tea shoots. In this study, we present a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)-derived map for the tea root, which enabled cell-type-specific analysis of glutamate and ethylamine (two precursors of theanine biosynthesis) metabolism, and theanine biosynthesis, storage, and transport. Our findings support a model in which the theanine biosynthesis pathway occurs via multicellular compartmentation and does not require high co-expression levels of transcription factors and their target genes within the same cell cluster. This study provides novel insights into theanine metabolism and regulation, at the single-cell level, and offers an example for studying root-specific secondary metabolism in other plant systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Different root cell types produce diverse and complex secondary metabolites in response to environmental and developmental clues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shaw et al., 2021</xref>); furthermore, such secondary metabolites can also participate in environmental adaptation and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Garcia-Lemos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hartman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Santelia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Schulz-Bohm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Steppuhn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). As examples, the alkaloid nicotine is synthesized, specifically, in the root and is transported to the shoot for resistance to biotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Steppuhn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Xu et al., 2017</xref>); root-synthesized flavonoids regulate root tip growth through affecting auxin transport and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Santelia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wan et al., 2018</xref>); legume roots secrete flavonoids as signaling agents to attract symbiotic bacteria, such as <italic>Rhizobium</italic> for nitrogen fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hartman et al., 2017</xref>); in <italic>Abies nordmanniana</italic>, volatile organic compounds (e.g., propanal, g-nonalactone, and dimethyl disulfide) function to recruit certain bacteria or fungi, such as <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> sp. S37, which produce high quantities of indole-3-acetic acid that can then promote plant root growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Garcia-Lemos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Schulz-Bohm et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In many medicinal and beverage plants, root-synthesized secondary metabolites are critical quality compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bailly, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Schmid et al., 2018</xref>). Lobetyolin (LBT), a <italic>Codonopsis pilosula</italic> (known as Radix codonopsis or Dangshen) root-synthesized polyacetylene glycoside, exhibits activities against various cancers, notably, gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bailly, 2021</xref>). Polysaccharides and lectins isolated from <italic>Pseudostellaria heterophylla</italic> (known as Taizishen or Haiershen) roots, have multiple pharmacological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). Root-synthesized polyphenols and triterpenoid saponins are crucial quality compounds extracted from <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> (known as Licorice) and are employed in the food and beverage industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Schmid et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to the importance of secondary metabolites, the biosynthesis, transport, and regulation of plant root-synthesized secondary metabolites have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fernie and Tohge, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>). However, in most cases, whole root materials were employed with very few assessing secondary metabolite biosynthesis and regulation, at the single-cell level.</p>
<p>Tea plant (<italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> L.), a crop with high economic value, is a member of the eudicot family, <italic>Theaceae</italic>, has diverse and active secondary metabolic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). Tea plants produce and accumulate extensive amounts of secondary metabolites, including theanine, catechins and caffeine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). These secondary metabolites confer tea with both unique flavor and multiple health benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). Theanine, a non-protein amino acid, endows the “umami” taste and relaxing effect of the tea infusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). It is the most abundant free amino acid in the tea plant, accounting for 1% - 2% dry weight of the tender shoots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). It is primarily synthesized in tea roots and is then transported to the shoots, via the vasculature system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lin et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<p>Tea roots acquire inorganic nitrogen, especially ammonium, from the soil and assimilate it into amino acids, such as glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), and alanine (Ala) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). Ala can be decarboxylated, by alanine decarboxylase (CsAlaDC), to produce ethylamine (EA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>), which can then be combined with Glu, through the action of theanine synthase (CsTSI), to produce theanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">She et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wei et al., 2018</xref>). The high level of EA availability is likely a key factor in the elevated accumulation of theanine in tea plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, in the tea plant, CsAlaDC and CsTSI are both indispensable for theanine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Theanine synthesis is tightly regulated, at multiple levels, especially at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lin et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guo et al., 2022</xref>); CsMYB6 bound to the <italic>CsTSI</italic> promoter can regulate theanine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zhang et al., 2021c</xref>). Furthermore, CsMYB40 and CsHHO3 bound to the <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> promoter can regulate theanine synthesis in “accelerator” or “brake” mode, respectively, in response to N levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guo et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Theanine transporters, including the tonoplast-localized CsCAT2 and plasma membrane-localized CsAAPs, have been proposed to mediate in theanine storage within the root and root-to-shoot transport, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, in response to N status in tea roots, theanine may affect apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation to regulate lateral root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Taken together, these studies have partially revealed the mechanisms for theanine synthesis, transport, and regulation, but information on the specific root cell types involved in these processes is lacking.</p>
<p>Recently, with the in-depth study of biological structure and function, it has become increasingly clear that differences exist in gene expression levels between cells, even if they appear to be within the same cell population. Bulk RNA-seq can be employed to investigate the average level of gene expression within whole tissues, whereas single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can capture single cells, from whole tissues, to detect the heterogeneity of cells, and obtain information on gene expression within single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shaw et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, scRNA-seq provides a powerful approach to elucidate the potential involvement of cell heterogeneity in secondary metabolism in tea plant roots.</p>
<p>Currently, scRNA-seq has been performed in several plants, including <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ryu et al., 2019</xref>), <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zhang et al., 2021b</xref>), and <italic>Zea mays</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nelms and Walbot, 2019</xref>). Importantly, algorithms are available to decode the cellular regulatory codes from scRNA-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Becht et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Haghverdi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Haghverdi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>), and these databases can provide a critical foundation for analyzing the cellular-based information on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Xu et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In plants, scRNA-seq has yet to be used for studying root-specific secondary metabolism. In this study, using high-throughput scRNA-seq, we analyzed the cell heterogeneity of theanine metabolism and regulation in the tea plant root. Our findings offer important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying theanine synthesis, transport, and regulation, and provide a basis for studies on root-specific secondary metabolism in other plant systems.</p>

<title>Tea plant root cell clusters identified by scRNA-seq</title>
<p>Tea plant roots synthesize and accumulate large amount of theanine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). The tea root cell types, including cortical (Co), xylem (Xy), phloem (Ph), cambial (Ca), pericycle (Pe), endodermal (En), epidermal (Ep) and root hair (RH), are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>. To understand the cellular characteristics of theanine biosynthesis in the tea root, protoplasts were isolated from seedling roots (from the root tip back ∼2.0 cm) of the tea plant cultivar ‘Shuchazao’ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). These protoplasts were subjected to scRNA-seq, using the commercial 10× Genomics platform (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), and the sequencing data were pre-filtered, at the cell and gene levels, resulting in a pool of 10,435 cells (Supplemental Figure 1A; Supplemental Data 1). The <italic>t</italic>-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (<italic>t</italic>-SNE) algorithm was employed to visualize local similarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Haghverdi et al., 2015</xref>), resulting in these 10,435 cells being grouped into 8 cell clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; Supplemental Figure 1B).</p>

</fig>
<p>The cell types within these 8 clusters were assessed by an analysis of homologs of cell type marker genes according to protein sequence similarity, confirmed in other scRNA-seq studies, or in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. In <italic>A. thaliana,</italic> GLABRA3 (GL3) is involved in epidermal cell fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bernhardt et al., 2003</xref>). In our scRNA-seq, <italic>CsGL3</italic> transcripts were detected in Cluster 2, indicating the presence of epidermal cells (Supplemental Figure 2A). The <italic>SCARECROW</italic> (<italic>SCR</italic>) gene is required for the asymmetric division of the cortex/endodermis initial (CEI) cells, and its expression is confined to the endodermis, CEI cell, and the quiescent center (QC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dong et al., 2021</xref>). In our tea root data, <italic>CsSCR</italic> transcripts were detected primarily in Clusters 3 and 4 (Supplemental Figure 2A), suggesting that cortical and endodermal cell division occurs in these two clusters. However, as <italic>CsAAP1</italic> transcripts were detected in Cluster 4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), and the gene encodes for AMINO ACID PERMEASE 1, which generally mediates in uptake of amino acids, into the cortex and endodermis, this cluster likely contained a population of cortical or endodermal cells.</p>
<p>The stele system in the root is comprised of the pericycle and vasculature, in which <italic>LONESOME HIGHWAY</italic> (<italic>LHW</italic>) has been established as a pericycle marker gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">De Rybel et al., 2013</xref>). As the <italic>CsLHW</italic> transcripts were detected in Cluster 8, this cell cluster likely contains a pericycle cell population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The <italic>WALLS ARE THIN LIKE 1</italic> (<italic>WAT1</italic>) and <italic>IRREGULAR XYLEM 9</italic> (<italic>IRX9</italic>) are characterized vasculature and xylem development marker genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Hence, the high level of <italic>CsWAT1</italic> transcripts detected in Clusters 1 and Cluster 3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), along with <italic>CsIRX9</italic> transcripts present in Cluster 3 (Supplemental Figure 2A) support the notion that these two clusters represent vasculature or xylem-related cells in the tea root. Finally, the <italic>PHLOEM PROTEIN 2</italic> (<italic>PP2</italic>) gene participates in phloem development and is a well-characterized phloem marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dinant et al., 2003</xref>) and the presence in Cluster 7 of abundant <italic>CsPP2</italic> transcripts is consistent with phloem cells being located within this Cluster 7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm the annotation of these cell clusters, we performed <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR analyses. These assays indicated expression of the following genes in their respective cell types: <italic>CsWAT1</italic> in the vasculature (including pericycle, xylem parenchyma and cambium); <italic>CsPP2</italic> in the protophloem; <italic>CsAAP1</italic> mainly in the cortex and endodermis; and <italic>CsLHW</italic> in the pericycle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). These findings were consistent with the above annotation of these cell clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the lack of more marker genes in tea plants, we next applied an unbiased approach, developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Denyer et al. (2019)</xref>, in which cluster-enriched genes are used as markers to define cell cluster identity. Cluster-enriched genes are defined as those being expressed, at significantly higher level, in each cluster, than in all other clusters, and expressed in ≥ 10% of cells within this specific cluster. The information on the cell-specific expression of these cluster-enriched genes was confirmed in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Therefore, we analyzed expression patterns of the top 10 cluster-enriched genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>; Supplemental Figures 2<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">-6</xref>; Supplemental data 3). Here, we could establish enrichment of <italic>LACCASE 7</italic> (<italic>CsLAC7</italic>) and <italic>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE 41</italic> (<italic>CsPME41</italic>) in Cluster 2, <italic>ASPARAGINE RICH PROTEIN1</italic> (<italic>CsNRP1</italic>) in Clusters 3 and 5, and <italic>MITOCHONDRIAL IMPORT INNER MEMBRANE TRANSLOCASE subunit TIM17</italic> (<italic>CsTIM17</italic>) in Cluster 5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Based on these scRNA-seq results from <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, and previous studies showing that <italic>AtLAC7</italic> and <italic>AtPME41</italic> are expressed mainly in epidermal cells, <italic>AtNRP1</italic> functions as a root meristem maker, including stem cell niche (SCN) and root cap (RC), and <italic>AtTIM17</italic> is expressed in the root cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Passarinho et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>; Supplemental Figure 2C), we assigned Cluster 3 and 5 as SCN and RC cells, respectively.</p>
<p>Taken together, according to the above results, Clusters 1, 2, 4 and 7 were annotated as xylem, epidermal, cortex/endodermal, and phloem cells, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, Cluster 8 was annotated as pericycle cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), whereas Cluster 6 included primarily procambium or transition cells during differentiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), and Cluster 3 was defined as the SCN, which serves as the cluster containing founder cells for differentiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>

<title>Differentiation trajectories of tea root cells supported cell cluster annotations</title>
<p>During root cell differentiation, all root cell types originate from stem cells generated by the root apical meristem (RAM). In the RAM, stem cells, including stelar initial (SI) cells, CEI cells, epidermis/lateral root cap initial (ELI) cells and columella initial (CI) cells, surround the QC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Efroni et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The QC cells are required for specification of the SCN and maintaining the undifferentiated state of the stem cell initials. Stem cells continuously undergo asymmetric division to produce daughter cells, which then begin to differentiate into outer, inner, and middle cell layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Efroni et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We noticed that Cluster 3 could probably be divided into 4 sub-cell states, C3.1, C3.2, C3.3 and C3.4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), with C3.1 expressing the QC marker gene, <italic>WUS-RELATED HOMEOBOX 5</italic> (<italic>CsWOX5,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kong et al., 2015</xref>), C3.2 expressing the xylem development gene <italic>CsIRX9</italic>, C3.3 expressing the cortex and endodermal cell fate decision gene, <italic>CsSCR,</italic> and C3.4 being close to the Cluster 2 epidermal cell population (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; Supplemental Figure 2A). Thus, these four Cluster 3 sub-cell states were defined as QC, SI, CEI, and ELI cells, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>The differentiation trajectories of these clusters were next assessed to confirm our annotation of the grouped cell clusters. To this end, we conducted pseudo-time analysis by ordering cells of these clusters along a reconstructed trajectory (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This analysis showed that Cluster 3 was primarily located at the start of the differentiation trajectories, and that the trajectories of these cells bifurcated into two major and one minor branch (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Here, the two major branches reflected differentiation trajectories of the ELI and SI cells from the SCN (Cluster 3), with the ELI cells differentiating into the outer cell layer (red branch) and Cluster 2 (epidermal cells) and Cluster 5 (root cap cells) located at the end of this divergence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The SI cells differentiated to give an inner cell layer (blue branch): Cluster 7 (phloem cells) and Cluster 1 (xylem cells) were arranged successively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The minor branch resulted in CEI cell trajectories that differentiated to give a middle cell layer (black branch); Cluster 4 (cortex and endodermal cells) were located at the end of this divergence. Importantly, Cluster 4 (cortex and endodermis), Cluster 6 (cambium) and Cluster 8 (pericycle) cells were also located within the region where cell differentiation was initiated, thus suggesting these three cell clusters can differentiate into other cell types (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Indeed, the cambium differentiates into the xylem and the phloem, especially in woody plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2021</xref>); endodermal cells assume a SCI to generate a new epidermal layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Efroni et al., 2016</xref>); the founder cells, derived from the pericycle, can form lateral roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Péret et al., 2009</xref>). The results of our pseudo-time analyses matched well with these earlier established findings.</p>
<p>We next constructed a differentiation heatmap of xylem and epidermal cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Consistently, highly expressed genes in Cluster 1 (xylem cells) were most enriched in cell wall biogenesis, lignin catabolic process and amino sugar catabolic process, etc. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and Supplemental data 4). Meanwhile, genes highly expressed in Cluster 2 (epidermal cells) were enriched in trichoblast differentiation, root hair elongation and plant epidermal cell differentiation, etc. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and Supplemental data 4). These in-depth differentiation trajectories of root cells further indicated reliability of the cell cluster annotations.</p>
<p>Finally, a differentiation map of tea root cells was constructed, based on the pseudo-time analyses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). This map was generated to assist in developing an understanding of tea root development, to provide a basis for studying secondary metabolism, in tea roots, at the single-cell level.</p>

<p>In tea roots, theanine accounts for approx. 60∼80% of the total free amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yang et al., 2020</xref>).

Our scRNA-seq assays revealed that expression of <italic>CsNR1</italic>, <italic>CsNR2</italic>, <italic>CsNiR1</italic> and <italic>CsNiR2</italic> was more active in Cluster 8 (pericycle cells) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>); <italic>CsNR1</italic> and <italic>CsNR2</italic> expression was also relatively high in Cluster 1 (xylem cells). These data supported the notion that N assimilation occurs primarily within stelar cells in tea roots.</p>
<p>Previously, we grouped amino acid metabolism into five pathways (P1-P5), based on their metabolic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yang et al., 2020</xref>): glutamate pathway (P1: Glu, Gln, arginine [Arg], proline [Pro], citrulline [Cit]); asparate (Asp) pathway (P2: Asp, isoleucine [Ile], lysine [Lys], threonine [Thr] and methionine [Met]); pyruvate pathway (P3: Ala, leucine [Leu] and valine [Val]); aromatic amino acid pathway (P4: phenylalanine [Phe], tyrosine [Tyr] and tryptophan [Trp]); and the 3-phosphoglycerate pathway (P5: serine [Ser], glycine [Gly] and cysteine [Cys]) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and Supplemental data 5). Theanine is synthesized from Glu and Ala-derived ethylamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lin et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the scRNA-seq analysis, we observed that the expression level of genes encoding for Glu biosynthetic pathway enzymes was the highest (especially in Clusters 1, 3, 4, 6 and 8) within these five pathways (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and Supplemental data 5), suggesting that biosynthetic activity for Glu synthesis is highly active in the roots. Meanwhile, the expression level of genes encoding alanine biosynthetic pathway enzymes was also high in all these clusters, especially in Clusters 3 (SCN) and 8 (pericycle cells) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and Supplemental data 5). These findings indicated that Glu and Ala metabolism represent the major amino acid metabolism in tea roots. This is the basis for N metabolism into theanine in these roots.</p>

<p>The <italic>CsTSI</italic> and <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> are the most important genes for theanine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">She et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). However, we observed that <italic>CsTSI</italic> and <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> were not enriched in the same cluster. Different from <italic>CsTSI</italic>, <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> was most highly expressed in Cluster 1 (xylem cell) and was also relatively highly expressed in Cluster 6 (cambium cell) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). The <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR assays verified the expression pattern of <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> in the vasculature and cambium, and also showed that <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> was expressed, at a low level, in the pericycle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Therefore, generally, <italic>CsTSI</italic> and <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> are co-expressed in the pericycle, where <italic>CsTSI</italic> is most highly expressed, whereas <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> is mostly highly expressed in the vasculature, where <italic>CsTSI</italic> has a lower expression level. These results suggest that the theanine biosynthesis pathway has a multicellular compartmentation characteristic, as EA would be synthesized primarily in the vasculature, whereas theanine would be more actively synthesized in the pericycle.</p>
<p>Generally, root-synthesized theanine is stored in the root cells, or transported from root to shoot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). In this regard, CsAAPs (CsAAP1, CsAAP2, CsAAP4, CsAAP5, CsAAP6 and CsAAP8) and CsCAT2 were recently identified as theanine transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). Among them, CsCAT2 probably mediates theanine storage in the vacuole, with CsAAP1 functioning in theanine loading into the xylem transpiration stream for root-to-shoot transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>CsCAT2</italic> was shown to be expressed most highly in the same cluster as <italic>CsTSI</italic>; i.e., in Cluster 8 (pericycle cells) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). <italic>CsCAT2</italic> was also relatively highly expressed in Cluster 4 (cortex and endodermal cells), suggesting that CsCAT2 may function in theanine storage in the pericycle, cortex and endodermis. In contrast, <italic>CsAAP1</italic> was expressed primarily in Cluster 4 (cortex and endodermal cells). This is consistent with its proposed role in retrieving extracellular theanine for its transport through the endodermis prior to xylem loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). The expression of other <italic>CsAAPs</italic> was also shown to be highly cell cluster-specific; for example, <italic>CsAAP2</italic> in Cluster 4 (cortex and endodermal cells), <italic>CsAAP4</italic> in Cluster 6 (cambium cells), <italic>CsAAP6</italic> in Cluster 3 (SCN) and Cluster 4 (cortex and endodermal cells), and <italic>CsAAP8</italic> in Cluster 5 (root cap cells) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting cell type-specific functions for these CsAAPs in theanine transport.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Transcriptional regulation of theanine biosynthesis</title>
<p>Theanine biosynthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level, based on recent findings that transcription factors (TFs) can control <italic>CsTSI</italic> or <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> expression to regulate theanine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guo et al., 2022</xref>). Here, Zhang et al. reported that CsMYB6, a root-specific expressed TF, promoted theanine biosynthesis through activation of <italic>CsTSI</italic> expression. Thus, we were surprised that <italic>CsMYB6</italic> was expressed in Cluster 3 (SCN), Cluster 6 (cambium cells) and Cluster 1 (xylem cells), rather than in Cluster 8 (the high <italic>CsTSI</italic> expression cell cluster), as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>.</p>
<p>A similar situation was also observed in terms of <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> transcriptional regulation. We previously identified CsMYB40 and CsHHO3 to be an activator and repressor of <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> expression, respectively, in response to N levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guo et al., 2022</xref>). Analysis of our scRNA-seq data indicated that <italic>CsMYB40</italic> and <italic>CsHHO3</italic> were not highly expressed in Cluster 1 (the high <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> expression cell cluster); <italic>CsMYB40</italic> was relatively highly expressed in Cluster 4 (cortex and endodermal cells) and Cluster 7 (phloem cells); and <italic>CsHHO3</italic> was relatively highly expressed in Clusters 3 (SCN) and 6 (cambium cells) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on these findings, we hypothesized that, for the regulation of theanine biosynthesis, TFs and target genes are not necessarily always highly expressed in the same cells. In the theanine biosynthesis pathway, CsAlaDC evolved a tea plant-specific activity in catalyzing EA biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>), which is essential for theanine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> is highly and specifically express in tea plant roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>), and its expression levels were shown to be highly correlated with theanine content in the roots of various tea plant cultivars, and further, was under TF regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, taking the transcriptional regulation of <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> as an example, we next analyzed the TFs that were co-expressed with <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> to test this notion.</p>

<p>Within these 34 root-specific genes, there were 7 genes potentially encoding for TFs LBD37, LBD38, bZIP, WRKY, AP2 and MYB18 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Among them, <italic>CsLBD37</italic> (CSS0024718) had the most positive correlation with <italic>CsAlaDC,</italic> and was induced by N (CK, EA and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) and was not expressed highly in Cluster 1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Du et al. (2021)</xref> predicted that <italic>CsLBD38</italic>, named <italic>CsLBD37</italic> in this study, is a highly credible TF that regulates theanine synthesis and is in an evolution node of theanine-associated regulatory module (TARM) in <italic>Camellia</italic> and Non-<italic>Camellia</italic> species. Therefore, CsLBD37 probably regulates <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> expression in tea plants, but its cell type expression pattern is different from that of <italic>CsAlaDC</italic>.</p>
<p>To further explore this situation, we first confirmed the root-specific expression for <italic>CsLBD37</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). Next, we performed <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR assays, which indicated that the <italic>CsLBD37</italic> expression pattern did not exactly reflect that observed for <italic>CsAlaDC</italic>. As for <italic>CsLBD37</italic>, <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> was expressed in the cambium; however, it was also expressed in the pericycle, whereas <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> was barely expressed in these cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). As expected, CsLBD37 was localized in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>), and furthermore, yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays, combined with <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> promoter-<italic>LUC</italic> assays conducted in tobacco leaves, were consistent with CsLBD37 binding directly to and repressing the activity of the <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7H</xref>). We further conducted an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with recombinant CsLBD37 protein and showed that it bound to the proximal region (-476 to -277 bp) of the <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref> and Supplemental Figure S6).</p>

<p>To test whether <italic>CsLBD37</italic> was able to inhibit <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> expression, <italic>in vivo</italic>, we developed transiently <italic>CsLBD37</italic>-silenced or over-expression tea seedlings, by antisense oligonucleotide (asODN) interference (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>) and generation of transgenic hairy roots, respectively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7K</xref>). <italic>CsLBD37</italic> expression was down-regulated and <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> was up-regulated in these asODN-treated roots (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>), whereas EA and theanine levels were increased (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>CsLBD37</italic> transgenic hairy roots, <italic>CsLBD37</italic> was up-regulated and <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> was down-regulated (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7K</xref>), whereas EA and theanine levels were decreased (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7L</xref>). These findings offered support for the hypothesis that <italic>CsLBD37</italic> regulates <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> expression to modulate EA and theanine synthesis. <italic>CsLBD37</italic> probably acts as a “brake” to maintain the expression level of <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> within a certain range, in response to high levels of N. This may be why <italic>CsLBD37</italic> is a repressor but is positively correlated with <italic>CsAlaDC</italic>.</p>
<p>Some studies have reported that the LBD family of TFs can regulate both plant secondary metabolism and root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Goh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Okushima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ye et al., 2021</xref>). Lateral root founder cells originate from the pericycle, located opposite to the xylem poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Péret et al., 2009</xref>). We noted that <italic>CsLBD37</italic> was also expressed in the tea root pericycle (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Therefore, we overexpressed <italic>CsLBD37</italic> in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (Supplemental Figure 8A <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">and 8B</xref>) and observed that the number of lateral roots, in these overexpression (OE) lines, was significantly less than in the wild-type (WT) plants (Supplemental Figure 8B <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">and 8C</xref>). We further observed that <italic>CsLBD37</italic> overexpression repressed the initial steps of lateral root development (Supplemental Figure 8D<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">-8G</xref>). These results provided support for a model in which CsLBD37 also regulates lateral root development in tea plants. Moreover, <italic>CsLBD37</italic> expression was induced by exogenous theanine treatment and this result underscores once again the importance of CsLBD37 in co-regulating theanine biosynthesis and root development (Supplemental Figure 8H).</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Multicellular compartmentation of theanine biosynthesis. The high expression of <italic>CsTSI</italic> in pericycle cells suggests theanine is mainly synthesized in pericycle cells. <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> is highly expressed in cambium and protoxylem cells, suggesting that ethylamine (EA) is mainly synthesized in these cells.

Increasing levels of nitrogen (N) promote theanine biosynthesis and accumulation. High accumulation of theanine and N induces <italic>CsLBD37</italic> expression. CsLBD37 inhibits <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> expression to reduce ethylamine synthesis, which finetunes theanine biosynthesis in feedback loop. Besides, <italic>CsLBD37</italic> is expressed in pericycle cells and also inhibits lateral root development. It is reported that apoplastic theanine can negatively regulate lateral root development, under high nitrogen levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, CsLBD37 may also be involved in theanine-regulated lateral root development.</p></caption>

<p>Collectively, our findings support a model in which transcriptional regulation of theanine biosynthesis does not require high expression of both TFs and target genes in the same cell cluster, but only requires partial co-expression.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Application of single-cell transcriptome sequencing to plant studies has afforded progress in understanding root development in model plants, such as <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ryu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zhang et al., 2021b</xref>). In this regard, important aspects of secondary and specialized metabolism occur in the plant root system and are important for plant growth and adaption to environmental challenges. These metabolic products are also essential for food and beverage quality, and pharmaceutical products. Bird et al. (2005) reported that biosynthesis of the narcotic analgesics, morphine and codeine, is localized to sieve elements in the opium poppy, which extends the function of sieve elements beyond transport, and into the realm of metabolism. However, significantly less information is currently available regarding both the cell heterogeneity of these secondary metabolic pathways and the underlying regulatory events that occur in the plant root system, especially in woody plants. The information regarding gene expression, in different type cells, is important with respect to establishing insights into both the mechanisms underlying these secondary metabolites and the regulatory events that control their syntheses. In this study, we performed a scRNA-seq-based study of tea roots, as an example, to elucidate the biosynthesis and regulatory processes for theanine, a root-specific secondary metabolite. In this process, we established the first map of tea roots comprised of 8 cell clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Cell cluster annotation is a critical step for scRNA-seq. In this regard, we employed candidate marker genes to annotate cell clusters, as in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ryu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zhang et al., 2021b</xref>). In some non-model plants, including tea, transgenic technologies are not currently available and, hence, we used <italic>in situ</italic> RNA hybridization to establish the location(s) for gene expression. In some studies, isolation of different cell types was combined with q-RT-PCR to detect cell-type marker gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). However, this approach has two limitations in that it cannot display the gene location directly and has only low resolution.</p>
<p>After numerous trials, we were able to optimize <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR assays (detailed in the Methods), which enabled a cell-specific characterization of gene expression in tea root cells, prior to establishing a genetic transformation system for tea. However, we note the challenge associated with weak calling of homologous marker genes, which may reflect the differences between tea and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, along with differences in sampling sites, but this only slightly impacted our findings, as in the annotation of cell clusters, <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR was employed to identify expression patterns for weakly expressed tea root genes, such as <italic>CsAAP1, CsLHW, CsAMT1.1, CsNRT1.1</italic>. Importantly, the results of <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR and scRNA-seq analysis were generally consistent.</p>
<p>N is one of the most critical mineral nutrients essential for crop growth and yield performance and provides precursors for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Roots acquire NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> -N and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N from the soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Xu et al., 2012</xref>), with CsNRTs (CsNRT2.5 and CsNRT3.2) and CsAMTs (CsAMT3.1) acting in N uptake and transport in tea roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zhang et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Our current findings provided further insight into the cellular locations where these transporters function. We show that many <italic>CsNRTs</italic> and <italic>CsAMTs</italic> are in the cortex, endodermal and stelar cells, whereas the N assimilation genes, <italic>CsNRs</italic> and <italic>CsNiRs</italic>, were primarily located within the stelar cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Our data support a model in which these CsNRTs and CsAMTs function in N uptake, into the cytoplasm of cortical and endodermal cells, but also play an important role in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> loading into the cells within the stele for N assimilation and amino acids synthesis.</p>
<p>The Glu pathway is the most abundant and active pathway for amino acid biosynthesis in all root cell types. However, our findings indicated that stelar cells and the SCN have a higher capacity for amino acid synthesis, compared with epidermal, cortical, and endodermal cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). For 20 amino acids, their rates of synthesis appeared to varying in different tea root cells; a similar situation was recently reported in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim et al., 2021</xref>), but has not yet been reported in the root systems of other plants. These findings deepen our understanding of N metabolism and transport in plant roots.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have established that the processes underlying plant N sensing, uptake, transport, and utilization are critical for the next novel green revolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Liu et al., 2022b</xref>). In this regard, high-throughput scRNA-seq studies should offer greater insights into the cell-type specificity of many N-associated genes, which could help to select cell-type-specific genes more efficiently for future designed breeding programs.</p>
<p>Compared with N metabolism in other plant species, theanine metabolism is a special component of N metabolism in tea plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). Tea plants prefer NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and synthesize large amounts of non-toxic theanine to decrease toxicity associated with high NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). In the theanine biosynthesis pathway, and consistent with the findings of She et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">She et al., 2022</xref>), our study established that <italic>CsTSI</italic> is expressed primarily in the pericycle cells (Cluster 8). We further clarified that <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> is generally expressed in the vasculature (Clusters 1). This differential enrichment of <italic>CsTSI</italic> and <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> expression suggests that EA and theanine are synthesized in different cell types (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), presumably reflecting multicellular compartmentation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>).</p>
<p>It is well known that theanine is the most abundant amino acid in the tea plant, and that theanine synthesis does not always occur, but is regulated to maintain growth and development in balance or adapted to environmental conditions. Indeed, the observed multicellular compartmentation may contribute to the regulation of theanine biosynthesis through precursor syntheses and transport within different cells. Thus, we propose a model in which multicellular compartmentation of theanine and its precursors functions like an innate design for regulation of secondary metabolism (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). Similar mechanisms may also have evolved in other plants. We also cannot rule out that synthesis of theanine or EA can occur in the same cell type; after all, <italic>CsTSI</italic> and <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> are two of the most highly expressed genes in tea roots and their cell type-specific expression partially overlapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yang et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, multicellular compartmentation of theanine and its precursors EA implied EA transport from its location of biosynthetic into theanine biosynthetic cells. EA is a colorless gas, and hence it may be transported by way of simple diffusion, or via a gas channel. Perhaps aquaporins (AQPs), a class of channel proteins that transport water, gas, and nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hachez and Chaumont, 2010</xref>), may be involved. At present, the mechanism of EA transport remains unknown, and the involvement of cell-type-specific AQPs would be worthy to explore in the future.</p>
<p>Previously, we identified theanine transporters acting in theanine root-to-shoot transport and theanine storage in the vacuole of tea root cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). In the current study, we elucidated the cell heterogeneity of theanine transporters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8B</xref>), and among them <italic>CsAAP1</italic> is located primarily in cortical and endodermal cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>), and <italic>CsCAT2</italic> is co-expressed with <italic>CsTSI</italic> in the same cell type. This nicely reflects that CsAAP1 and CsCAT2 mediate in the physiological function of theanine transport and storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). However, these theanine transporters are all importers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). The exporter(s) mediating in theanine transport from the xylem parenchyma for loading into the xylem transpiration stream, within the roots, along with other theanine export processes in the shoot, remain to be identified (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). Combining the cell type information, provided by scRNA-seq data, may assist in the identification of these specific-cell-located theanine exporter(s), and may also provide information for identifying amino acid exporters in other plant species. At present, all the exporters identified are bidirectional transporters, such as UMAMITs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Besnard et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, specific-cell-located transporters, with bidirectional transport functions, could be potential theanine exporters.</p>
<p>Interestingly, genes highly correlated with <italic>CsTSI</italic> or <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> were identified, including some confirmed TFs (<italic>CsMYB6</italic>, <italic>CsMYB40</italic>, <italic>CsHHO3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zhang et al., 2021c</xref>), which were not always highly co-expressed in the same cell type. The cell heterogeneity of regulatory genes for <italic>CsTSI</italic> or <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> expression may reflect the “accelerator” and “brake” regulatory patterns that might act to fine-regulate theanine biosynthesis in specific cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guo et al., 2022</xref>). Another possibility is that these theanine-associated genes are promiscuous, having many target genes and regulate multiple biological processes in tea plants. Thus, TFs that regulate the theanine biosynthesis pathway may not always be co-express highly with their target genes, in the same cell type. Indeed, this point was confirmed in a subsequent study of CsLBD37 regulation of <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> expression.</p>
<p>To date, some identified TFs have been shown to play a role in the fine-regulation of <italic>CsTSI</italic> and <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> expression; however, the TFs that impart <italic>CsTSI</italic> and <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> root-specificity and high expression remain to be identified. Recently, it was established that, in roots, hypomethylation in the promoters of <italic>CsTSI</italic> and <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> provided an epigenetic basis for their high expression. Although hypomethylation in the promoters provides accessibility for transcription, activating TFs is still required for their high expression. In this regard, the current cell-type-specific expression database offers a valuable resource to identify such unknown TF activators. For example, root-specific and Cluster 1-specific CsMYB18 could well be an activator of <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B-D</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, some TFs regulating <italic>CsTSI</italic> or <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> were identified and characterized and indicted that theanine regulates lateral root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zhang et al., 2021c</xref>); however, the molecular link between these processes was not elucidated. Previous studies have shown that several LBD family members regulate proanthocyanidin (PA) metabolism and are involved in root development in response to N in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rubin et al., 2009</xref>). In tea roots, theanine, PA metabolism and root development are also regulated by N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, <italic>CsLBD37</italic> was also N-inducible and was one of the most positively correlated TF encoding genes with <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). This information provided important insights into the roles for <italic>CsLBD37</italic> in theanine biosynthesis and root development. In this study, we identified CsLBD37 as a repressor of <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> transcription and root development (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8C</xref>; Supplemental Figure 8). CsLBD37 may act in a similar manner to CsHHO3, namely through being a repressor of <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> transcription to “brake” theanine biosynthesis under high N availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guo et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we also revealed that <italic>CsLBD37</italic> probably inhibits lateral root development, at the root initial stage (Supplemental Figure 8D<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">-8G</xref>), but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. <italic>CsLBD37</italic> expression could be induced by exogenous theanine treatment in tea seedlings (Supplemental Figure 8H). This implied that CsLBD37 may also be involved in a process by which theanine regulates lateral root development. Is <italic>CsLBD37</italic> involved in regulating root development through the auxin and ROS homeostasis pathways as well as theanine? This question is worthy of future investigation.</p>
<p>In summary, we generated a transcriptional map of tea roots, at the single cell level, which provided cell-type specific information on the expression of some 40,000 genes. Moreover, these datasets provide an important resource for future studies on secondary metabolism within tea roots, as well as other plant root systems. Recently, spatial transcriptomics and metabolomics techniques were applied for studies in both animals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">La Manno et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Liu et al., 2022a</xref>). An integration of these techniques with scRNA-seq would afford a powerful approach to further explore cell specific secondary metabolism, at higher resolution, in various crop root systems.</p>

<p>Approx. 12,593 counted cells were loaded onto a Single Cell Gchip. The libraries were constructed using 10× Genomics Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3ʹ Reagent Kits v3.1(1000268). In brief, cell suspensions in a chip were loaded on a Chromium Controller (10xGenomics, Pleasanton, CA) to generate single-cell GEMs (gel beads in emulsion). The scRNA-seq libraries were then prepared, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Qualitative analysis of the DNA library was performed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.

<title>Pre-processing of raw scRNA-seq data</title>
<p>The raw files were analyzed by Cell Ranger 5.0.0 (10x Genomics). The tea plant genome and GTF annotation files, which excluded the organelle genomes, were downloaded from the Tea plants Information Archive (TPIA) website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tpia.teaplants.cn">http://tpia.teaplants.cn</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Xia et al., 2019</xref>). Running ‘cellranger mkref’ with ‘‘–genome, –fasta and –genes’’ inputs was employed to build the reference. Then ‘cellranger count’ with ‘‘–id, – transcriptome, –fastqs, –sample” was run. Some 79.8% of the reads in all of the samples were aligned to the tea plant genome by the aligner STAR (v.2.5.1b). Mean reads per cell were 26,411. Median genes per cell was in the range of 680.</p>

<title>Data integration, clustering, and annotation</title>
<p>Downstream analyses were mainly performed with the Seurat package (v.3.1.2), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Butler et al., 2018</xref>). To remove low quality cells and likely multiplet captures, which is a major concern in microdroplet-based experiments, we applied a criteria to filter out cells with UMI/gene numbers out of the limit of the mean value +/- 2-fold of the standard deviations, assuming a Guassian distribution of the UMI/gene number for each cell. Additionally, we applied DoubletFinder package (version 2.0.2) potential doublet identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">McGinnis et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Library size normalization was performed with the “NormalizeData” function (LogNormalize method, scaling factor of 10,000). We then detected variable genes with the “FindVariableFeatures” function (vst method, 4000 features), scaled data with “ScaleData” function, performed PCA analysis with “RunPCA” function (14 principal components), determined statistical significance of PCA scores by “JackStraw” function, constructed the SNN graph, clustered cells based on Louvain (“FindNeighbors” and“FindClusters”), and visualized data with non-linear dimensional reduction algorithms (“RunTSNE”). The cluster-enriched genes were computed with the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat, using the following parameters: a bimod test; above 1 – fold difference (logfc. Threshold ≥0) between the two groups of cells; test genes that having a minimum fraction was at least 0.25.</p>

<title>In situ RT-PCR</title>
<p><italic>In situ</italic> RT-PCR was improved and performed based on previous methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Munns et al., 2012</xref>). The experimental material was the primary root of a 2-month-old ‘shuchazao’ tea cultivar. The young root tissue was soaked in fresh FAA solution, vacuum-infiltrated for 15-20 min, then put at 4℃ for 12 h. The samples were then eluted, three times, for 10 min each, in a mixture solution (63% ethanol and 5% acetic acid), and twice for 5 min each in 1× PBS. Root tissue was then embedded in 5% low-melting point agarose (agarose dissolved in 1× PBS) and the embedded blocks were sectioned using a Leica RM2255 microtome (Leica, Nussloch, Germany). The root tissue sections were separated from agarose by rinsing, twice, with Rnase-Free water, 3 μg/ml proteinase K was then added for 30 min at 25°C. A heat treatment, at 85°C for 2 min, was given to inactivate proteinase K, and samples were then washed, once, separately with 1×PBS and then Rnase-Free water for 5-10 min, followed by the addition of 1 U/μl Dnase I, at 37°C, for 20 min, or overnight. Liquid was then removed and 15 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) was added, at 75°C for 10 min, followed by 1-2 washes with Rnase-Free water to remove excess liquid. Reverse transcription reactions were performed using the PrimeScript II 1<sup>st</sup> strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TAKARA, Cat.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study used root tips from semi-hydroponic tea seedlings. The strategy followed sequential steps to draw partial conclusions.</p>
<p>Initially, protoplasts obtained from root tips were processed for scRNA-seq using the 10x Genomics platform. The sequencing data underwent pre-filtering at both the cell and gene levels, leading to 10,435 cells. These cells were then classified into eight clusters using t-SNE algorithms. The present study scrutinised cell typification through protein sequence similarity analysis of homologs of cell type marker genes. The analysis was conducted to ensure accuracy using validated genes from previous scRNA-seq studies and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The cluster cell annotation was confirmed using in situ RT-PCR analyses. This methodology provided a comprehensive insight into the cellular differentiation of the sample under study. The identified clusters, spanning 1 to 8, have been accurately classified as xylem, epidermal, stem cell niche, cortex/endodermal, root cap, cambium, phloem, and pericycle cells.</p>
<p>Then, the authors performed a pseudo-time analysis to validate the cell cluster annotation by examining the differentiation pathways of the root cells. Lastly, they created a differentiation heatmap from the xylem and epidermal cells and identified the biological functions associated with the highly expressed genes.</p>
<p>Upon thoroughly analysing the scRNA-seq data, the researchers delved into the cell heterogeneity of nitrate and ammonium uptake, transport, and nitrogen assimilation into amino acids. The scRNA-seq data was validated by in situ RT-PCR. It allows the localisation of glutamine and alanine biosynthetic enzymes along the cell clusters and confirms that both constituent the primary amino acid metabolism in the root. Such investigation was deemed necessary due to the paramount importance of these processes in theanine biosynthesis since this molecule is synthesised from glutamine and alanine-derived ethylamine.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the authors analysed the cell-specific expression patterns of the theanine biosynthesis genes, combining the same molecular tools. They concluded that theanine biosynthesis is more enriched in cluster 8 &quot;pericycle cells&quot; than glutamine biosynthesis (Lines 271-272). However, the statement made in Line 250 states that the highest expression levels of genes responsible for glutamine biosynthesis were observed in Clusters 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8, leading to an unclear conclusion.</p>
<p>The regulation of theanine biosynthesis by the MYB transcription factor family is well-established. In particular, CsMYB6, a transcription factor expressed specifically in roots, has been found to promote theanine biosynthesis by binding to the promoter of the TSI gene responsible for theanine synthesis. However, their findings indicate that CsMYB6 expression is present in Cluster 3 (SCN), Cluster 6 (cambium cells), and Cluster 1 (xylem cells) but not in Cluster 8 (pericycle cells), which is known for its high expression of CsTSI. Similarly, their scRNA-seq data indicated that CsMYB40 and CsHHO3, which activate and repress CsAlaDC expression, respectively, did not show high expression in Cluster 1 (the cell cluster with high CsAlaDC expression). Based on these findings, the authors hypothesised that transcription factors and target genes are not necessarily always highly expressed in the same cells. Nonetheless, additional evidence is essential to substantiate this presumption.</p>
<p>Lastly, the authors have discovered a novel transcription factor belonging to the Lateral Organ Boundaries Domain (LBD) family known as CsLBD37 that can co-regulate the synthesis of theanine and the development of lateral roots. The authors observed that CsLBD37 is located within the nucleus and can repress the CsAlaDC promoter's activity. To investigate this mechanism further, the authors conducted experiments to determine whether CsLBD37 can inhibit CsAlaDC expression in vivo. They achieved this by creating transiently CsLBD37-silenced or over-expression tea seedlings through antisense oligonucleotide interference and generation of transgenic hairy roots. Based on their findings, the authors hypothesise that CsLBD37 regulates CsAlaDC expression to modulate the synthesis of ethylamine and theanine.</p>
<p>Additionally, the available literature suggests that the transcription factors belonging to the Lateral Organ Boundaries Domain (LBD) family play a crucial role in regulating the development of lateral roots and secondary root growth. Considering this, they confirmed that pericycle cells exhibit a higher expression of CsLBD37. A recent experiment revealed that overexpression of CsLBD37 in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants led to fewer lateral roots than the wild type. From this observation, the researchers concluded that CsLBD37 regulates lateral root development in tea plants. I respectfully submit that the current conclusion may require additional research before it can be considered definitive.</p>
<p>Further efforts should be made to investigate the signalling mechanisms that govern CsLBD37 expression to arrive at a more comprehensive understanding of this process. In the context of Arabidopsis lateral root founder cells, the establishment of asymmetry is regulated by LBD16/ASL18 and other related LBD/ASL proteins, as well as the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs (ARF7 and ARF19). This is achieved by activating plant-specific transcriptional regulators such as LBD16/ASL18 (Go et al., 2012, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.071928">https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.071928</ext-link>). On the other hand, other downstream homologues of LBD genes regulated by cytokinin signalling play a role in secondary root growth (Ye et al., 2021, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.05.036">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.05.036</ext-link>). It is imperative to shed light on the hormonal regulation of CsLBD37 expression in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of its involvement in the morphogenic process.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>The manuscript showcases significant dedication and hard work, resulting in valuable insights that serve as a fundamental basis for generating knowledge. The authors skillfully integrated various tools available for this type of study and meticulously presented and illustrated every step involved in the survey. The overall quality of the work is exceptional, and it would be a valuable addition to any academic or professional setting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In its current form, the article presents certain weaknesses that need to be addressed to improve its overall quality. Specifically, the authors' conclusions appear to have been drawn in haste without sufficient experimental data and a comprehensive discussion of the entire plant. It is strongly advised that the authors devote additional effort to resolving the abovementioned issues to bolster the article's credibility and dependability. This will ensure that the article is of the highest quality, providing readers with reliable and trustworthy information.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript, Lin et al. present a comprehensive single-cell analysis of tea plant roots. They measured the transcriptomes of 10,435 cells from tea plant root tips, leading to the identification and annotation of 8 distinct cell clusters using marker genes. Through this dataset, they delved into the cell-type-specific expression profiles of genes crucial for the biosynthesis, transport, and storage of theanine, revealing potential multicellular compartmentalization in theanine biosynthesis pathways. Furthermore, their findings highlight CsLBD37 as a novel transcription factor with dual regulatory roles in both theanine biosynthesis and lateral root development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript provides the first single-cell dataset analysis of roots of the tea plants. It also enables detailed analysis of the specific expression patterns of the gene involved in theanine biosynthesis. Some of these gene expression patterns in roots were further validated through in-situ RT-PCR. Additionally, a novel TF gene CsLBD37's role in regulating theanine biosynthesis was identified through their analysis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Several issues need to be addressed:</p>
<p>(1) The annotation of single-cell clusters (1-8) in Figure 2 could benefit from further improvement. Currently, the authors utilize several key genes, such as CsAAP1, CsLHW, CsWAT1, CsIRX9, CsWOX5, CsGL3, and CsSCR, to annotate cell types. However, it is notable that some of these genes are expressed in only a limited number of cells within their respective clusters, such as CsAAP1, CsLHW, CsGL3, CsIRX9, and CsWOX5. It would be advisable to utilize other marker genes expressed in a higher percentage of cells or employ a combination of multiple marker genes for more accurate annotation.</p>
<p>(2) Figure 3 could enhance clarity by displaying the trajectory of cell differentiation atop the UMAP, similar to the examples demonstrated by Monocle 3.</p>
<p>(3) The identification of CsLBD37 primarily relies on bulk RNA-seq data. The manuscript could benefit from elaborating on the role of the single-cell dataset in this context.</p>
<p>(4) The manuscript's conclusions predominantly rely on the expression patterns of key genes. This reliance might stem from the inherent challenges of tea research, which often faces limitations in exploring molecular mechanisms due to the lack of suitable genetic and molecular methods. The authors may consider discussing this point further in the discussion section.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Lin et al., performed a scRNA-seq-based study of tea roots, as an example, to elucidate the biosynthesis and regulatory processes for theanine, a root-specific secondary metabolite, and established the first map of tea roots comprised of 8 cell clusters. Their findings contribute to deepening our understanding of the regulation of the synthesis of important flavor substances in tea plant roots. They have presented some innovative ideas.</p>
<p>It is notable that the authors - based on single-cell analysis results - proposed that TFs and target genes are not necessarily always highly expressed in the same cells. Many of the important TFs they previously identified, along with their target genes (CsTSI or CsAlaDC), were not found in the same cell cluster. Therefore, they proposed a model in which the theanine biosynthesis pathway occurs via multicellular compartmentation and does not require high co-expression levels of transcription factors and their target genes within the same cell cluster. Since it is not known whether the theanine content is absolutely high in the cell cluster 1 containing a high CsAlaDC expression level (due to the lack of cell cluster theanine content determination, which may be a current technical challenge), it is difficult to determine whether this non-coexpressing cell cluster 1 is a precise regulatory mechanism for inhibiting theanine content in plants. In fact, there are actually a small number of cells where TFs and CsAlaDC are simultaneously highly expressed, but the quantity is insufficient to form a separate cluster. However, these few cells may be sufficient to meet the current demands for theanine synthesis. This possibility may better align with some previous experiments and validation results in this study. Moreover, I feel that under normal conditions, plants may not mobilize a large number of cells to synthesize a particular substance. Perhaps, cell cluster 1 is actually a type of cell that inhibits the synthesis of theanine, aiming to prevent excessive theanine production? I do not oppose the model proposed by the author, but I feel there is a possibility as I mentioned. If it seems reasonable, the author may consider adding it to an appropriate position in the discussion.</p>
