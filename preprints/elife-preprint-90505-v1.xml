<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The paramount importance of mechanical forces in morphogenesis and embryogenesis is widely recognized, but understanding the mechanism at the cellular and molecular level is still challenging. Due to its simple internal organization, Caenorhabditis elegans is a worthwhile study system. As demonstrated experimentally, after a first period of steady elongation due to the acto-myosin network, muscle contractions operate a quasi-periodic sequence of bending, rotation and torsion, which leads to the final 4-fold size of the embryo before hatching. How acto-myosin and muscles contribute to embryonic elongation is herein theoretically studied. A filamentary elastic model that converts stimuli generated by biochemical signals in the tissue into driving forces, explains embryonic deformation under actin bundles and muscle activities, and dictates mechanisms of late elongation based on the effects of energy conversion and dissipation. We quantify this dynamic transformation by stretches applied to a cylindrical structure mimicking the body shape in finite elasticity, obtaining good agreement and understanding for both wild-type and mutant embryos at all stages.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mechanical stresses play a critical role during embryogenesis, affecting complex biological tissues such as the skin, the brain, and the interior of organs. There are many studies in the last decades, for example, the pattern of the intestine (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Coulombre and Coulombre (1958</xref></italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hannezo et al.

At a smaller scale, the influence of mechanical stresses superposed to cellular processes (e.g., division, migration) and tissue organization becomes more complex to be identified and quantified. For example, independently of growth, stresses may be generated by different molecular motors, among which myosin II, linked to actin filaments, is the most prevalent during epithelial cell morphogenesis (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Vicente-Manzanares et al. (2009</xref></italic></bold>)) and cell motility (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cowan and Hyman (2007</xref></italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Olson and Sahai (2009</xref></italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Palumbo et al. (2022</xref></italic></bold>)). The spatial distribution and dynamics of myosin II greatly influence the morphogenetic process (<bold><italic>Levayer and</italic></bold> Lecuit (<bold><italic>2012</italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lv et al. (2022</xref></italic></bold>)), as demonstrated for Drosophila (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bertet et al.

(2014</xref></italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shindo and Wallingford (2014</xref></italic></bold>)) and also <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Priess and Hirsh (1986</xref></italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gally et al. (2009</xref></italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben Amar et al. (2018</xref></italic></bold>)).</p>
<p>The embryonic elongation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> represents an attractive model of matter reorganization without a mass increase before hatching. It happens after the ventral enclosure and takes around 240 minutes to convert the lima-bean-shaped embryo into a final elongated worm shape: the embryo elongates along the anterior/posterior axis by four times (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">McKeown et al. (1998</xref></italic></bold>)). The short lifetime of the egg before hatching and its transparency makes this system an ideal system to study the forces that exist in the cortical epithelium or its vicinity. However, unlike the embryonic development of Drosophila and Zebrafish, there is neither cell migration, cell division nor a no-table change in embryonic volume (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sulston et al. (1983</xref></italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Priess and Hirsh (1986</xref></italic></bold>)), only a noticeable epidermal elongation drives the whole morphogenetic process of <italic>C. elegans</italic> in the period post en-closure. There are two experimentally identified driving forces for the elongation: the actomyosin contractility in seam cells of the epidermis, which seems to last during the whole elongation process, and the muscle activity beneath the epidermis that starts after the 1.7 ∼ 1.8-fold stage. The transition is well defined since the muscle participation makes the embryo rather motile impeding any physical experiments such as laser ablation, which could be conducted and achieved in the first period (<bold><italic>Vuong-Brender et al. (2017a</italic></bold>)). Consequently, the elongation process of <italic>C. elegans</italic> could be divided into two stages: the early elongation and the late elongation, depending on the muscle activation, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1(A)</xref> shows the whole elongation process (<bold><italic>Vuong-Brender et al. (2017a</italic></bold>)). Previously, the role of the actomyosin network in the seam cells during the early elongation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> was investigated (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben Amar et al. (2018</xref></italic></bold>)). Based on the geometry of a hollow cylinder composed of four parts (seam and dorso-ventral cells), a model involving the pre-stress responsible for the enclosure, the active compressive ortho-radial stress joined to the passive stress quantitatively predicts the elongation, but only up to ∼ 70% of the initial length.</p>

<p>For the late elongation phase, the acto-myosin network and muscles drive together the full elongation during this phase (<bold><italic>Vuong-Brender et al. (2017a</italic></bold>)). Muscles play an important role since mutants with muscle defects are unable to complete the elongation process, even though the actomyosin network operates normally (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lardennois et al. (2019</xref></italic></bold>)). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1(B)</xref> shows the schematic image of <italic>C. elegans</italic> body (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al. (2011</xref></italic></bold>)) with four rows of muscles, two of which are underneath the dorsal epidermis and the other two are under the ventral epidermis. As observed <italic>in vivo, C. elegans</italic> exhibits systematic rotations accompanying each contraction (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yang (2017</xref></italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yang Xinyi et al. (2023</xref></italic></bold>)), and deformations such as bending and twisting. Eventually, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo will complete an elongation from 1.8-fold to 4-fold. We can imagine that once the muscle is activated on one side, it can only contract, and then the contraction forces will be transmitted to the epidermis on this side. So one can wonder how an elongation can occur since striated muscles can only perform cycles of contraction and relaxation, their action will tend to reduce the length of the embryo. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how the embryo elongates during each contraction and how the muscle contractions couple to the acto-myosin activity. This work aims to answer this paradox within the framework of finite elasticity without invoking cell plasticity and stochasticity which cannot be considered driving forces. In addition, several important issues at this stage remain unsettled. First of all, we may also observe a torsion of the embryo but if the muscle activity suggests a bending, it cannot explain alone a substantial torsion. Secondly, a small deviation of the muscle axis (<bold><italic><xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">Moerman and Williams (2006</xref></italic></bold>)) is responsible for a series of rotations, how to relate these rotations to the muscle activation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yang (2017</xref></italic></bold>)). Since any measurement on a motile embryo at this scale is difficult, it is meaningful to explore the mechanism of late elongation theoretically. Furthermore, muscle contraction is crucial in both biological development and activities and has been studied extensively by researchers (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tan and De Vita (2015</xref></italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">De Vita et al. (2017</xref></italic></bold>)), but how it works at small scales remains a challenge.</p>
<p>Using a finite elasticity model and assuming the embryonic body shape is cylindrical, we can evaluate the geometric bending deformation and the energy released during each muscular contraction on one side since after each contraction, the muscles relax and then muscles on the opposite side undergo a new contraction. This cyclic process leads to a tiny elongation of the cylinder along its symmetry axis at each contraction. Each of them is correlated with the rotational movements of the embryo (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yang (2017</xref></italic></bold>)). By repeating these pairs of contractions more than two hundred times, a cumulative extension is achieved, but it must be reduced by friction mechanisms, also evaluated by the model. Furthermore, the mechanical model explains the existence of a torque operating at the position of the head or tail by the coupling of muscle contraction with the orthoradial acto-myosin forces. Finally, the small deviation between the muscles and the central axis experimentally detected (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Moerman and Williams (2006</xref></italic></bold>)) induces cyclic rotations and possibly torsion leading to fluid viscous flow inside the egg. Quantifying all these processes allows evaluating the physical quantities of the embryo such as the shear modulus of each component, the osmolarity of the interstitial fluid and the active forces exerted by the acto-myosin network and the muscles which are sparsely known in the embryonic stages.</p>
<p>Our mechanical model accounts for the dynamical deformations induced by the internal stimuli of a layered soft cylinder, enabling us to make accurate quantitative predictions about the active networks of the embryo. Furthermore, our model takes into consideration the dissipation that occurs in the late period just before the egg hatch. Our results are consistent with observations of acto-myosin and muscle activity (<bold><italic>Vuong-Brender et al. (2017a</italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben Amar et al. (2018</xref></italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">Lardennois et al.

<title>Results</title>
<p>It is widely recognized that <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a well-established model organism in the field of developmental biology. However, it is less widely known that its internal striated muscles share similarities with skeletal muscles found in vertebrates in terms of both function and structure (<bold><italic><xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Lesanpezeshki et al. (2021</xref></italic></bold>)). Being contractile, the role of the four axial muscles (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1</xref>) in the final shaping of the embryo is nearly contra-intuitive. In this section, we aim to highlight the action of these muscles when coupled to the acto-myosin network, using a purely mechanical approach. To achieve a quantitative understanding, our method requires a detailed description of the deformation geometry of the embryo, with the body shape represented by a fully heterogeneous cylinder.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Geometric and strain deformations of the embryo</title>
<p>The early elongation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo was previously studied, which is characterized by an inner cylinder surrounded by epithelial cells located in the cortical position (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben Amar et al. (2018</xref></italic></bold>)). The cortex is composed of three distinct cells - the seam, dorsal, and ventral cells - which exhibit unique cytoskeleton organization and actin network configurations. Among these, only the seam cells possess active myosin motors that function in the ortho-radial direction, allowing for the contraction of the circumference and thereby triggering the early elongation process. In this study, we simplify the cylindrical geometry of the body and treat the epidermis as a unified whole with effective activity localized along the circumference, supported by four muscles distributed beneath the epidermis. Muscles play no role in the early elongation stage so were not considered previously (<bold><italic>Vuong-Brender et al. (2017a</italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben Amar et al. (2018</xref></italic></bold>)). After this period of approximately a 1.8-fold increase in length, muscles parallel to the main axis and actin bundles organized along the circumference will collaborate to facilitate further elongation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table. 1</xref> provides the size parameters of <italic>C. elegans</italic> which will be introduced hereafter.</p>

<p>We focus on the overall deformation of a full cylinder or a thin rod, having a length <italic>L</italic> greater than the radius <italic>R</italic> and a central vertical axis along the <italic>Z</italic> direction. Contrary to previous works (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ciarletta et al. (2009</xref></italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben Amar et al. (2018</xref></italic></bold>)), here we decide to simplify the geometrical aspect because of the mechanical complexity. The biological activity induced by the acto-myosin network and muscles is represented by active strains, and the global shape is the result of the coupling between elastic and active strains, modulated by dissipation. Active strains are generated through non-mechanical processes (e.g., biochemical processes): myosin motors and striated muscles receive their energy from ATP hydrolysis, which is converted to mechanical contractions of fibers. Due to the significant deformation observed, the central line is distorted and becomes a curve in three-dimensional space, represented by a vector <bold>r</bold> (<bold>Z</bold>), as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.3(A)</xref>. Along this curve, perpendicular planar sections of the embryo can be defined, and the deformation in each section can be quantified since the circular geometry is lost with the contractions (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kaczmarski et al. (2022</xref></italic></bold>)). The geometric mapping is as follows:

where the <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> represents the deformation in each direction of the section with <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> (0, 0, <italic>Z</italic>) = 0 so that the <italic>Z</italic>-axis maps to the centerline <bold>r</bold> (<italic>Z</italic>). The small quantity <italic>ε</italic> is the ratio between the radius <italic>R</italic> and the length <italic>L</italic> of the cylinder. Referring to the model proposed by B. Kaczmarki <italic>et al</italic>. (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kaczmarski et al. (2022</xref></italic></bold>)), we define the initial configuration <italic>ℬ</italic><sub>0</sub> with material points (<italic>X, Y, Z</italic>), and the mapping function <italic>χ</italic> (<bold>X</bold>) links the initial configuration <italic>ℬ</italic><sub>0</sub> to the current configuration <italic>ℬ</italic><sub>0</sub>. The geometric deformation gradient is <bold>F</bold> = Grad<italic>χ</italic> = <bold>F</bold><sub><bold>e</bold></sub><bold>G</bold> (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nardinocchi and Teresi (2007</xref></italic></bold>)), where <bold>G</bold> represents the active strain generated by the actomyosin or the muscles, and <bold>F</bold><sub><bold>e</bold></sub> is the elastic strain tensor. Because of the two stages through which the <italic>C. elegans</italic> elongates, we need to evaluate the influence of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> actin network during the early elongation before studying the deformation at the late stage. So, the deformation gradient can be decomposed into: <bold>F</bold> = <bold>F</bold><sub><italic>e</italic></sub><bold>G</bold><sub>1</sub><bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub> (<bold><italic>Goriely and Ben</italic></bold> Amar (<bold><italic>2007</italic></bold>)) where <bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub> refers to the pre-strain of the early period and <bold>G</bold><sub>1</sub> is the muscle-actomyos in supplementary active strain in the late period. Actin is distributed in a circular pattern in the outer epidermis, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.3(B)</xref>, so the finite strain <bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub> is defined as <bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub> = <italic>Diag</italic> (1, <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>t</italic>), 1), where 0 &lt; <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub> &lt; 1 is the time-dependent decreasing eigenvalue, operating in the actin zone and is equal to unity in the other parts: <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub>(0) = 1. In the case without pre-strain, <bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub> = <bold>I</bold>. The deformation gradient follows the description of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq.(1)</xref> :<bold>F</bold> = <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> <bold>d</bold><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ⊗ <bold>e</bold><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>, <italic>i</italic> ∈ {1, 2, 3} and <italic>j</italic> ∈ {<italic>R</italic>, Θ, <italic>Z</italic>}.</p>

<p>To relate the deformations to the active forces induced by muscles and the acto-myosin network, we assume that the embryo can be represented by the simplest nonlinear hyperelastic model, called Neo-Hookean, with a strain-energy density given by <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="553194v1_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. In cylindrical coordinates, the total energy of the system and the auxiliary energy density is:

<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="553194v1_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>J</italic> = det <bold>F</bold><sub><italic>e</italic> ′</sub> <italic>p</italic> is a Lagrange multiplier which ensures the incompressibility of the sample, a physical property assumed in living matter. When the cylinder involves several layers with different shear modulus <italic>µ</italic> and different active strains, the integral over <italic>S</italic> covers each layer. To minimize the energy over each section for a given active force, we take advantage of the weakness of <italic>ε</italic> and expand the inner variables <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, and the potential <italic>V</italic> to obtain the auxiliary strain-energy density.

Finally, these solutions which will represent a combination of bending and torsion deformation will last the time of a muscle contraction while the acto-myosin will continue its contractile activity. The evaluation of the elastic energy under acto-myosin-muscle activity at order <italic>ε</italic><sup>4</sup> can be compared with the equivalent energy of an extensible elastic rod and each basic deformation will be identified (<bold><italic>Kirchhoff</italic></bold> and Hensel (<bold><italic>1883</italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mielke (1988</xref></italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mora and Müller (2002</xref></italic></bold>, 2004); <bold><italic>Moulton et al.

<p>Here, we need to first accurately determine <bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub> by analyzing the experimental data (<bold><italic>Vuong-Brender et al. (2017a</italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben Amar et al. (2018</xref></italic></bold>)). The cylinder can be divided into three distinct sections: the outer layer is the actin cortex, the thin ring where actin bundles concentrate and work, located within a radius range between <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub><sup>′</sup> and <italic>R</italic><sub>3</sub> (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.4(A)</xref>); the middle layer (<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> &lt; <italic>R</italic> &lt; <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub><sup>′</sup>), which is the epidermis but without actin; and the inner part (0 &lt; <italic>R</italic> &lt; <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>), where the muscle is located, along with some internal organs, tissues, and fluids. So, we treat the outer and middle layers as incompressible, but the inner part as a compressible material, except the muscles. The initial deformation gradient: <bold>F</bold><sub>0</sub> =Diag(<italic>r</italic><sup>′</sup>(<italic>R</italic>), <italic>r</italic>(<italic>R</italic>)/<italic>R, λ</italic>), and <bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub> = Diag(1, <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub>, 1) with 0 &lt; <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub> &lt; 1 in the actin layer but with <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1 in the part without actin. <bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub> represents the circumferential strain exerted by actin during the early elongation and is a slowly varying function of time. <italic>r</italic>(<italic>R</italic>) is the radius after early elongation. By applying the principles of radius continuity, radial stress continuity, and incorporating the zero traction condition on the face of the cylinder, we can determine that <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.88 when the elongation <italic>λ</italic> = 1.8, i.e., at the completion of the early elongation. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.4(B)</xref>, the results of our model and the experimental data are in good agreement, this demonstrates the consistency of the geometric and elastic modeling together with the choice of a pre-strain represented by <bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub> which gives a good prediction of the early elongation.

<p>From the first stage elongation represented by the blue dots and the blue dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.4(C)</xref> we can extract the time evolution of the contractile pre-strain <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) derived from our elastic model. To explain quantitatively <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>t</italic>), we suggest a phenomenological dynamical approach for the population of active myosin motors. This equation considers the competition between the recruitment of new myosin proteins from the epidermis cytoskeleton necessary to extend the embryo and the debonding of these myosins from the actin cables, which is damped by the compressive radial stress. It reads:

with <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> = 1 − <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>t</italic>), <italic>p</italic><sub>1</sub> is the ratio between the free available myosin population and the attached ones divided by the time of recruitment (given in minutes), while <italic>p</italic><sub>2</sub> is the inverse of the debonding time of the myosin motors from the cable: <italic>p</italic><sub>2</sub> = 6 min<sup>−1</sup>.

<title>Shape of the embryo under muscles and acto-myosin contraction</title>
<p>The regulation of the muscle contraction in <italic>C. elegans</italic> detected experimentally (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yang (2017</xref></italic></bold>)) indicates a cyclic process, where two muscles contract on one side of the embryo quite simultaneously and then stop, while on the opposite side, the two muscles start their contractions, but only after a delay. Let us consider first that only muscles are active (see the schematic <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.5(A)</xref> for the structure, then (B) and (C) for the bending). In this case, due to the geometry, only a bending deformation occurs on the left for active muscles localized on left and then on the right for the symmetric muscles on right.</p>

</fig>
<p>To be more quantitative, we assume that the left side muscles are activated during a short period with an active constant strain value <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> in the region <italic>M</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>M</italic><sub>2</sub>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.5(A)-(B)</xref>; if the muscles are perfectly vertical, <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 0 in the initial configuration. In fact, the two muscles on the same side are not always fully in phase and one may present of small delay. For simplification, we assume them are perfectly synchronous. During the full initial period where muscles are not activated, the actin fibers are distributed in a horizontal loop on the outer surface of the epidermis, but once the muscle starts to contract, the acto-myosin network will be re-orientated (<bold><italic><xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">Lardennois et al. (2019</xref></italic></bold>)). The fibers will be then distributed in a sloping pattern causing eventually the twisting of the embryo, see the schematic diagram shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.5(D)-(F)</xref>. When this region is activated with a constant strain value, <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>, the angle of the actin fibers will change following the amplitude of the bending by the muscle contraction. In this situation, the angle of the actin fibers may change from <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="553194v1_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> but <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> is not modified and <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> = 0.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire process, the muscle and acto-myosin activities are assumed to work almost simultaneously. Our modeling allows us to evaluate the bending and torsion generated independently by muscles and actin bundles, culminating in a complete deformation under coupling. Furthermore, the angle of the acto-myosin fibers varies during muscle contractions. We maintain a constant activation of the acto-myosin network and gradually increase muscle activation.</p>
<p>As a result, the bending of the model will be increased, causing a change in the angle of the actin fibers, ultimately yielding a deformation map that is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.6(A)-(C)</xref>. Upon increasing myosin activation, we observed a consistent torsional deformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.6(E)</xref>) that agrees with the patterns seen in the video (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.6(D)</xref>). However, significant torsional deformations are not always present. In fact, other sources can induce torsion as the default of symmetry of the muscle axis, which we will discuss later. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.6(F)-(G)</xref>, we demonstrate that the curvature provided by the model increases as muscle activation increases and that the torsion is not simply related to the activation amplitude since it also depends on the value of the angle <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>, reaching a maximum at approximately <italic>π</italic>/4.

<title>Energy transformation and Elongation</title>
<p>During the late elongation process, the four internal muscle bands cyclically contract in pairs (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yang (2017</xref></italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Williams and Waterston (1994</xref></italic></bold>)). Each contraction of a pair increases the energy of the system under investigation, which is then rapidly released to the body. This energy exchange causes the torsion-bending energy to convert into elongation energy, leading to a length increase during the relaxation phase, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1</xref> of the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app5">Appendix 5</xref>. With all deformations obtained, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq.(2)</xref> can be used to calculate the accumulated energy <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> produced by both the muscles and the acto-myosin activities during a contraction. Subsequently, when the muscles on one side relax, the worm body reverts to its original shape but with a tiny elongation corresponding to the transferred elastic energy. This new state involves the actin network adopting a ‘loop’ configuration with a strain of <italic>εg</italic><sub><italic>a</italic>1</sub> once relaxation is complete. If all accumulated energy from the bending-torsion deformation goes towards elongating the worm body, the accumulated energy <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> and energy <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> following muscle relaxation are equivalent. The activation of actin fibers <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>a</italic>1</sub> after muscle relaxation can be calculated and determined by our model.</p>
<p>Once the first stage is well characterized, we can quantify the total energy resulting from both muscles and acto-myosin after each contraction. Then, we used our model to predict elongation in the wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic>, unc-112(RNAi) mutant and spc-1(RNAi) pak-1(tm403) mutant and further compared the results with experimental observations. The length of the wild type elongates from approximately 90 <italic>µm</italic> to 210 <italic>µm</italic> during the muscle-activated phase (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lardennois et al. (2019</xref></italic></bold>)), the phase lasts about 140 minutes, and the average time interval between two contractions is about 40 seconds (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yang (2017</xref></italic></bold>)), so the number of contractions can be estimated to be around 210 times. Unfortunately, due to the difficulty to realize quantitative experiments on an embryo always in agitation in the egg shell between bending, torsion, and also rotations around its central axis, one can hypothesize several scenarios: at each step <italic>i</italic> between state <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,0</sub> to <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,1</sub> and then <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,2</sub>, the whole mechanical muscle-myosin energy is transferred to the elongated step <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,2</sub>, leading to a small <italic>δζ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>.</p>
<p>Considering the experimental results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.7(B)</xref>, we determine the optimal values for the activation parameters: <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = −0.15 and <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> = −0.01 assuming that all the accumulated energy during muscle activation is transferred to elongation(<italic>W</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> = <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>). The elementary elongation <italic>δζ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> will be gradually increased with time, which is shown as the black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.7(A)</xref>. At the beginning, <italic>δζ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is about 0.5<italic>µm</italic>, but at the end of this process, <italic>δζ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is about 1.5<italic>µm</italic>, indicating that the worm will elongate up to 290<italic>µm</italic>. The result is significantly higher than our actual size 210<italic>µm</italic>. When the elongation proceeds, we assume a transfer of energy between bending-torsion-contraction and elongation but it may be not fully effective, which means a significant part of the energy is lost. From the experimental data, we evaluate that the energy loss gradually increases, from full conversion at the beginning to only 40% of the accumulated energy used for elongation at the end of the process (<italic>W</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> = 0.4<italic>W</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>). It induces for <italic>δζ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> a first increase and then a decrease, which is shown as the blue line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.7(A)</xref> and is responsible for the slowdown around 200 mins. This option, which may be not the only possible one, leads to the estimated elongation having a good agreement with experimental data (see the blue-dashed curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.7(B)</xref>). Indeed it is possible that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> elongation requires other transformations which will cost energy. As the embryo gradually elongates, energy dissipation and the biomechanical energy required to reorganize the actin bundles may be two factors that contribute to the increased energy loss that underlies the hypothesis.</p>

<p>Moreover, it was reported in (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Norman and Moerman (2002</xref></italic></bold>)) that the knockdown of unc-112(RNAi), known for impairing muscle contractions, results in the arrest of elongation of embryos at the twofold stage, indicating that muscles have no activation, <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 0 in our model, and no accumulated energy can be converted into elongation. Another mutation concerning the embryos consisting of mutant cells with pak-1(tm403), known to regulate the activity of myosin motors leads to a retraction of the embryo, so the pre-stretch caused by myosin will not be maintained and will decrease.

<p>The main manifestation of the muscle activity, independently of the elongation, is probably the constant rotations of the embryo despite its confinement in the egg.

Since they cross the horizontal plane at approximately ±45<sup>◦</sup> and the deviation <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> from the anterior-posterior axis is estimated to be about 6<sup>◦</sup> each active muscle on the left (or on the right) contributes to the torque via a geometrical factor about <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> = sin(6<italic>π</italic>/180) cos(<italic>π</italic>/4). Then a simple estimation of the muscle activity in terms of torque reads Λ<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> ∼ <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub><italic>πR</italic><sup>3</sup><italic>s</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub><italic>p</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub><italic>a</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>(<italic>εg</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>) where <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> is the surface of the muscle pair on the left (or right) compared to the section of the cylinder: <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 0.025 and <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> is the distance of the muscles from the central axis of the embryo: <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 0.75 while <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 0.15 according to the analysis of the elongation. So the muscles on one side contribute to a torque Λ<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> along the axis of symmetry given by Λ<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 4.657<italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub><italic>πR</italic><sup>3</sup> · 10<sup>−5</sup>.</p>
<p>Let us consider now the dissipative torque, assuming that the dynamics of rotation is stopped by friction after one bending event. Two cases can be considered: either the dissipation comes from viscous flow or from the rubbing of the embryo when it folds. The fluid dissipation results from the rotations in the interstitial fluid inside and along the egg shell since the anterior-posterior axis remains parallel to the egg-shell (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bhatnagar et al. (2023</xref></italic></bold>)) The interstitial fluid, of viscosity <italic>η</italic> contains a significant amount of sugar and other molecules which are required for embryo survival and then is more viscous than water (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Labouesse (2023</xref></italic></bold>)). However, values for sucrose or sorbitol at the concentration of 1 mole/liter indicates a viscosity of order a few times the viscosity of water, which is 1 mPas. For example at 0.9 mole/liter and temperature of 20<sup>◦</sup>, an aqueous solution with sorbitol has a viscosity of 1.6 mPas, which can be extrapolated to <italic>η</italic> = 1.9 mPas at 1.2 mole/liter (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jiang et al. (2013</xref></italic></bold>)). The estimation given by an embryo located in the middle of the egg-shell, gives a weaker viscous torque once evaluated by <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="553194v1_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> according to a classical result reported by Landau <italic>et al</italic>. (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Landau and Lifshitz (1971</xref></italic></bold>, 2013)). It has to be mentioned that this estimation assumes that the two cylinders: the egg shell and the embryo have the same axis of symmetry and concerns the beginning of the muscle activity where the radius is about 8.2 <italic>µm</italic>, the length is 90 <italic>µm</italic>,the radius of the shell about <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>egg</italic></sub> = 15<italic>µm</italic> and the length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>egg</italic></sub> = 54<italic>µm</italic>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.6(D)</xref>. The angular velocity Ω<sub><italic>e</italic></sub> is more difficult to evaluate but it is about 90<sup>◦</sup> per two seconds deduced from videos. When the embryo approaches the egg shell, the friction increases, and two eccentric cylinders of different radii have to be considered with the two axes of symmetry separated by a distance <italic>d</italic>. The hydrodynamic study in this case is far from being trivial, and seems to have been initiated first by Zhukoski (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zhukoski (1887</xref></italic></bold>)) who suggested the use of bipolar coordinates for the mathematical treatment. Many following contributions established with different simplified assumptions have been published after and the study was fully revisited by Ballal and Rivlin (<bold><italic>Ballal</italic></bold> and Rivlin (<bold><italic>1976</italic></bold>)). Here we focus on the limit of a small gap <italic>δ</italic> between the rotating body-shape and the egg and by considering an asymptotic analysis at small <italic><underline>δ</underline></italic> of the general result derived in (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ballal and Rivlin (1976</xref></italic></bold>)). Thus, the viscous torque reads <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="553194v1_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is the zone of contact with the egg and <italic>d</italic> = <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>egg</italic></sub> − <italic>δ</italic> − <italic>R</italic>. This approach is an approximation since the embryo has more of a torus shape than a cylinder (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yang Xinyi et al. (2023</xref></italic></bold>)) but the evaluation of the dissipation is satisfactory for <italic>δ</italic> = 0.5<italic>µm</italic>, Ω<sub><italic>e</italic></sub> ∼ <italic>π</italic>/4 <italic>s</italic><sup>−1</sup> and <italic>µ</italic> = 10<sup>5</sup><italic>P a</italic>. Coming back to the first model of dissipation with the same data, the ratio between the dissipative viscous torque and the active one gives: Λ<sub><italic>υ</italic></sub>/Λ<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 0.02, which is obviously unsatisfactory. Finally, the dissipative energy ? during one bending event leading to an angle of <italic>π</italic>/2 is <italic>ξ</italic><sub><italic>diss</italic></sub> = 1/2Λ<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> ×(<italic>π</italic>/2)<sup>2</sup> which represents 4% of the muscle elastic energy during the bending so at the beginning of the muscle activity (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app5">Appendix 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn45">Eq.(45)</xref>), the dissipation exits but is negligible. At the very end of the process, this ratio becomes 60% but as yet mentioned our estimation for the dissipation becomes very approximate, increases a lot due to the embryo confinement, and does not involve the numerous biochemistry steps necessary to reorganize the active network: acto-myosin and muscles.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Since the discovery of the muscle activity before the egg hatch of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo, it has become critical to explain the role of mechanical forces generated by muscle contraction on the behavioral and functional aspects of the epidermis. We provide a mechanical model in which the <italic>C. elegans</italic> is simplified as a cylinder, and the muscle bands and actin that drive its elongation are modeled as active structures in a realistic position. We determine the fiber orientation using experimental observations and then calculate the deformation by tensorial analysis involving the strains generated by the active components. Although a special focus is made on late elongation, its quantitative treatment cannot avoid the influence of the first stage of elongation due to the acto-myosin network, which is responsible for a pre-strain of the embryo. In a finite elasticity formalism, the deformations induced by muscles in a second step are coupled to the level of strains of the initial elongation period. For that, we need to revisit the theory of the acto-myosin contraction and previous results (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ciarletta et al. (2009</xref></italic></bold>); <bold><italic>Vuong-Brender et al. (2017a</italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben Amar et al. (2018</xref></italic></bold>)) to unify the full treatment. In particular, a model for the recruitment of active myosin motors under forcing is presented which recovers the experimental results of the first elongation stage.</p>
<p>The elongation process of <italic>C. elegans</italic> during the late period is much more complex than the early elongation stage which is caused only by actin contraction. During the late elongation, the worm is distorted by the combined action of muscle and acto-myosin, resulting in an energy-accumulating process. Bending deformation is a phenomenon resulting from unilateral muscular contraction, and during the late elongation, significant torsional deformation is observed, indicating that the bending process induces a reorientation of the actin fibers. It is worth noting that the embryo is always rotating in tandem with the muscle activity making difficult any experimental measurements. However, our model can predict that if the muscles are not perfectly vertical, torque exits that causes rotation and eventually torsion. The accumulated energy is then partly turned into energy for the ongoing action of actin, allowing the embryo to elongate when the muscle relaxes. Both sides of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> muscles contract in a sequential cycle, repeating the energy conversion process, and eventually completing the elongation process. However, the energy exchange between bending and elongation is limited, among other factors, by the viscous dissipation induced by rotation, which is also evaluated in this study. Not investigated in detail here is the necessary re-organization of the active networks (acto-myosin and muscles) due to this tremendous shape transformation of the embryo. In parallel to elongation, the cuticle is built around the body (<bold><italic>Page</italic></bold> and Johnstone (<bold><italic>2007</italic></bold>)). This very thin and stiff membrane ensures protection and locomotion post-hatching. Clearly, these processes will perturb muscle activity. These two aspects which intervene in the final stage of the worm confinement play a very important role at the frontier across scales between genetics, biochemistry and mechanics.</p>
<p>Finally, the framework presented here not only provides a theoretical explanation for embryonic elongation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, it can also be used to model other biological behaviors, such as plant tropism (<bold><italic>Moulton et al. (2020b</italic></bold>)) and elephant trunk elongated (<bold><italic>Schulz et al. (2022b</italic></bold>,a)) and bending. Our ideas could potentially be used in the emerging field of soft robotics, like octopus legs-inspired robots (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kang et al. (2012</xref></italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nakajima et al. (2013</xref></italic></bold>); <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Calisti et al. (2015</xref></italic></bold>)), which is soft and its deformation induced by muscles activation. We can reliably predict deformation by knowing the position of activation and the magnitude of forces in the model. Furthermore, residual stresses can be incorporated into our model to fulfill design objectives.</p>

As one imagines, it is far from triviality and most of the literature on this subject concerns either full cylinders or cylindrical shells in torsion around the axis of symmetry, the case of bending is more overlooked.

<title>Time-scale for myosin detachment</title>
<p>The time required for non-muscle myosin detachment is estimated to be <italic>τ</italic><sub>0</sub> = 10<italic>s</italic> for free acto-myosin filaments. If the actin filament is submitted to external loading perpendicular to its axis, the detachment can be helped or on the contrary inhibited, see (<bold><italic>Howard and</italic></bold> Clark (<bold><italic>2002</italic></bold>)), page 169-170. In the present case, the stresses acting in the radial direction of an actin bundle are compressive and thus will delay the detachment. This energy has to be compared to the energy of detachment of all myosin motors from the bundle. The corresponding elastic energy associated with the radial deformation for an actin cable of length <italic>l</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> of radius <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> = 0.05<italic>µm</italic> estimated from (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lardennois et al.

This result must be compared to the individual energy of detachment times the number of myosin motors on a cable. This number is uneasy to fix but estimation is given by the length of the cable <italic>l</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> divided by the distance between 2 anchoring sites of myosin which is about 5<italic>nm</italic> while the attachment energy per motor is about 6<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub><italic>T</italic>. These indications are for skeletal muscle myosins (<bold><italic>Howard and</italic></bold> Clark (<bold><italic>2002</italic></bold>)) and have to be taken with caution. Nevertheless, the order of magnitude of the debonding energy for a collection of myosin heads from actin cable can be estimated to 4.8<italic>l</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>10<sup>−12</sup><italic>J</italic>. Then the ratio between both quantities is of order 4(1 −<italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>t</italic>)) which explains that the time-scale of debonding for a cable in compressive stress in the orthogonal direction of its axis is then:

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors have made a novel and important effort to distinguish and include different sources of active deformations for fitting C elegans embryo development: cyclic muscle contractions and actomyosion circumferential stresses. The combination and synchronisation of both contributions are, according to the model, responsible for different elongation rates, and can induce bending and torsion deformations, which are a priori not expected from purely contractile forces. The model can be applied to other growth processes in initially cylindrical shapes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The model allows us to fit and deduce specific growth patterns, frequencies, and locations of contractions that yield the observed axial elongation during the 240 min of the studied process.</p>
<p>The deformation gradient is decomposed according to muscle and actomyosin activity, which can be distinguished and quantified. An energy-transferring process allows for the retrieval of the necessary permanent deformations that embryo development requires.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Despite the completeness of the model, the explanation of the methodology needs to be improved. Parameters and quantities are not always explained in the main text and are introduced on some occasions in an ordered manner. This makes the comprehension and deduction of methodology difficult. There are some minor comments that are listed below. The most important points are:</p>
<p>-How are the authors sure that there is a torsional deformation? Without tracking the muscle fibers, bending with respect to different angles for different Zs may yield a shape similar to the one in Figure 6E. Furthermore, it is unclear why the model yields torsion deformation. If material points of actomyosin rings do not change in reference configuration, no helicoidal growth should be happening.</p>
<p>-The triple decomposition F=F_e*G_i*G_0 seems to complicate the expressions of growth and requires the use of angles alpha and beta due to the initial deformation G_0. Why not use a simpler decomposition F=F_e*G, where G contains all contributions from actomyosin and muscle contractions in a material frame? This would avoid considering angles alpha and beta.</p>
<p>The section &quot;Energy transformation and Elongation&quot; is unclear. Indeed, stresses need to relax, otherwise, the removal of muscle and actin activity would send the embryo back to its initial state. However, the rationale behind the energy transfer is not explained. Authors seem to impose W_c=W_r, and from this deduce the necessary actin contraction after muscle relaxation. Why should energy be maintained when muscle relaxes? Which mechanism physically imposes this energy transfer? Muscle contraction could indeed induce elongation if traction forces at the opposite side of the contracting muscle relax. In fact, an alternative approach for obtaining stress relaxation and axial elongation would be converting part of the elastic deformation F_e to a permanent deformation F_p.</p>
<p>-Self contact is ignored. This may well be a shape generator and responsible for bending deformations. The convoluted shape of the embryo in the confined space deserves at least commenting on this limitation of the model.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
During C. elegans development, embryos undergo elongation of their body axis in the absence of cell proliferation or growth. This process relies in an essential way on periodic contractions of two pairs of muscles that extend along the embryo's main axis. How contraction can lead to extension along the same direction is unknown.</p>
<p>To address this question, the authors use a continuum description of a multicomponent elastic solid. The various components are the interior of the animal, the muscles, and the epidermis. The different components form separate compartments and are described as hyperelastic solids with different shear moduli. For simplicity, a cylindrical geometry is adopted. The authors consider first the early elongation phase, which is driven by contraction of the epidermis, and then late elongation, where contraction of the muscles injects elastic energy into the system, which is then released by elongation. The authors get elongation that can be successfully fitted to the elongation dynamics of wild-type worms and two mutant strains.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The work proposes a physical mechanism underlying a puzzling biological phenomenon. The framework developed by the authors could be used to explain phenomena in other organisms and could be exploited in the design of soft robots.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. This reviewer considers that the quality of the writing is poor. Because of this the main result of this work, how elongation is achieved by contraction, remains unclear to me. In the opinion of this reviewer, the work is not accessible to a biologist. This is a real pity because the findings are potentially of great interest to developmental biologists and engineers alike.</p>
<p>2. The authors assume that the embryo is elastic throughout all stages of development. Is this assumption appropriate? In my opinion, the authors need to critically discuss this assumption and provide justification. Would this still be true for the adult? If so could the adult relax back to the state prior to elongation? The embryo should be able to do that, if the contractility of the epidermis were sufficiently reduced, right?</p>
<p>3. The authors impose strains rather than stress. Since they want to understand the final deformation, I find this surprising. Maybe imposing strain or stress is equivalent, but then you should discuss this.</p>
<p>4. Does your mechanism need 4 muscle strands or would 2 be sufficient?</p>
<p>5. It is sometimes hard to understand, whether the authors are talking about the model or the worm.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Our torsional deformations were obtained computationally, and the results are plotted in Figure 6 according to our formalism. In our approach, the torsional deformation results from the interaction between the vertical muscles and the circumferential actin network: the muscles bend the cylinder and the bending modiﬁes the direction of the actin ﬁbers, as demonstrated in the experiment.</p>

<p>-The triple decomposition 𝐹 = 𝐹𝑒 ⋅ 𝐺𝑖 ⋅ 𝐺0 seems to complicate the expressions of growth and requires the use of angles alpha and beta due to the initial deformation 𝐺0.

</disp-quote>
<p>𝐺0 represents the active strain during the early elongation stage and 𝐺𝑖 during the late elongation stage respectively. Such a decomposition which is not mandatory, allows a better un- derstanding. In addition, due to the late elongation stage, both muscle and actin networks must be considered, and their orientation changes with deformation. Therefore, it is clearer and simpler to express the active strain in terms of alpha and beta angles.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>In this section, we do assume that all the energy accumulated by the muscle contrac- tions will be converted into the energy necessary for elongation, and as our estimate in the article shows, 𝑊𝑐 is indeed greater than 𝑊𝑟, indicating that a signiﬁcant fraction of 𝑊𝑐 is converted into dissipation and friction, but also into the reorganization of the actin cables. Indeed, elongation of the cylinder induces a signiﬁcant reduction in the experimentally observed and also in the actin cable density. However, this reduction in cable density is not observed experimentally. Thus, elon- gation requires a reorganization of the actin network, which is part of the energy consumption and which explains the existence of a permanent deformation 𝐹𝑝.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have considered the effect of contact between C. elegans and the eggshell in the energy dissipation section but we also agree that the self-contact of the worm in conﬁnement will be important. Here, we focus mainly on active ﬁlaments: actomyosin and muscle, and we restrict ourselves to a cylindrical shell that is far from the embryo.</p>

<p>We regret that, despite a general introduction and a number of ﬁgures, the work does not seem accessible to biologists.</p>

<p>1. The authors assume that the embryo is elastic throughout all stages of development. Is this assumption appropriate? In my opinion, the authors need to critically discuss this assumption and provide justiﬁcation. Would this still be true for the adult? If so could the adult relax back to the state prior to elongation? The embryo should be able to do that, if the contractility of the epidermis were suﬃciently reduced, right?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Soft tissues are elastic, the modeling of soft tissues, even with large deformations, is now well established. The difference between a worm embryo and an adult is ﬁrst of all the quality of the tissues, their low degree of heterogeneity, the weakness of the muscles and the absence of bones. As for the question of complete relaxation of the stresses, the fact that different components are attached to each other limits complete relaxation. We keep our ﬁngerprints and cortical undula- tions, although they originate from an elastic instability that occurs in fetal life. It never disappears.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors impose strains rather than stress. Since they want to understand the ﬁnal deformation, I ﬁnd this surprising. Maybe imposing strain or stress is equivalent, but then you should discuss this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Perhaps, the referee has in mind the question of active strain versus active stress and is concerned about the representation of biological forces such as those produced by actomyosin or muscle. In fact, both exist in morphoelasticity and are, of course, related. Usually, the choice is dictated by the simplicity of deriving quantitative results for comparison with experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Does your mechanism need 4 muscle strands or would 2 be suﬃcient?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>First, the 4 muscle strands are consistent with real C. elegans structures, and second, although we assume that two muscles on the same side contract simultaneously, their size and position affect the deformation results. Also, the time period we consider is just before the worm hatches. After that, the worm has to slide on the ground. So eﬃcient muscles are needed.</p>
