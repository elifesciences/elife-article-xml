<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Trabid/ZRANB1</italic> missense mutations have been identified in children diagnosed with a range of congenital disorders including reduced brain size, but how Trabid regulates neurodevelopment is not understood. We have characterised these patient mutations in cells and mice to identify a key role for Trabid in the regulation of neurite growth. One of the patient mutations flanked the catalytic cysteine of Trabid and its deubiquitylating (DUB) activity was abrogated. The second variant retained DUB activity, but failed to bind STRIPAK, a large multiprotein assembly implicated in cytoskeleton organisation and neural development. <italic>Trabid/ZRANB1</italic> knock-in mice harbouring either of these patient mutations exhibited reduced neuronal and glial cell densities in the brain and a motor deficit consistent with fewer dopaminergic neurons and projections. Mechanistically, both DUB-impaired and STRIPAK-binding-deficient Trabid variants impeded the trafficking of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) to microtubule plus-ends. Consequently, the formation of neuronal growth cones and the trajectory of neurite outgrowth from mutant midbrain progenitors were severely compromised. We propose that STRIPAK recruits Trabid to deubiquitylate APC, and that in cells with mutant Trabid, APC becomes hyperubiquitylated and mislocalised causing impaired organisation of the cytoskeleton that underlie the neuronal and developmental phenotypes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) are integral components of the ubiquitin system that control protein functions essential for healthy development and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Clague et al. 2019</xref>). DUBs catalyze the removal of ubiquitin from protein substrates to regulate protein stability, activity, interaction, or localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Komander et al. 2009</xref>). Ubiquitin can be assembled into polymers linked through one of eight internal ubiquitin residues – Met1, Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48 and Lys63 – and impairment of DUB function can lead to the accumulation of one or more of these ubiquitin chain linkages on a protein substrate with deleterious consequences. For example, LINKage-specific deubiquitylation deficiency-induced Embryonic Defects (LINKED), a human syndrome caused by loss-of-function mutations in the DUB OTUD5, is associated with increased Lys48-linked ubiquitylation and turnover of chromatin remodeling and transcription factors that are critical for normal embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beck et al. 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Consequently, LINKED syndrome patients manifest severe congenital malformations and die in early infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beck et al. 2021</xref>). OTUD5 belongs to a 17-member family of human DUBs that possess an OTU (<italic>o</italic>varian <italic>tu</italic>mour) catalytic domain and include the closely related OTU DUBs A20, Cezanne and Trabid. Trabid missense mutations have been identified in children diagnosed with a range of developmental disorders including microcephaly (Deciphering Developmental Disorders 2015).</p>
<p>Trabid has two defining biochemical features. First, it exhibits strong DUB specificity for Lys29- and Lys33-linked ubiquitin chains, cleaving these chain types 40-fold more efficiently than Lys63-linked chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Licchesi et al. 2012</xref>). Lys29-linked polyubiquitin exists mainly as heterotypic chains containing Lys48 linkages that target substrates for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kristariyanto et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Leto et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harris et al. 2021</xref>). Trabid is thought to modulate the levels of Lys29/Lys48 mixed chains to regulate proteostasis, autophagy and cell division (Chen et al. 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yu et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Vaughan et al. 2022</xref>). Lys33-linked ubiquitin polymers have been implicated in post-Golgi protein trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yuan et al. 2014</xref>), and Lys63-linked chains are abundant cellular adducts with established roles in the sorting of endosomal/lysosomal cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Erpapazoglou et al. 2014</xref>) and mediating the formation of protein assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tran and Polakis 2012</xref>). The second defining feature of Trabid is that it binds the Striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sowa et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tran et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harris et al. 2021</xref>), a large multiprotein assembly implicated in cytoskeleton organisation, cell migration and neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hwang and Pallas 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sakuma et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Madsen et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bazzi et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kuck et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>We have previously identified the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein as a candidate Trabid substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tran et al. 2008</xref>). Trabid knockdown in HEK293 cells caused APC to become modified with polyubiquitin and aggregate in the cytoplasm, whereas high Trabid levels correlated with <italic>hypo</italic>ubiquitylated APC that accumulated in the membrane protrusions of long cell processes. These observations led us to propose that Trabid regulates the ubiquitylation and subcellular localisation of APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tran et al. 2013</xref>). In neurons, APC organises the cortical cytoskeleton to promote the formation of growth cones and the steering of growing axons that are essential for embryonic brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yokota et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Preitner et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dogterom and Koenderink 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Efimova et al. 2020</xref>). High expression of Trabid, APC and STRIPAK proteins in neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Castets et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Blanpain et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yokota et al. 2009</xref>) indicate that Trabid’s association with STRIPAK and its ability to regulate APC polyubiquitylation may be important for neurogenesis. We now show that two Trabid mutants found in children with developmental deficits are impaired in two distinct biochemical activities that culminate in the perturbed trafficking of APC to neurite tips. We propose that the neuronal and developmental phenotypes associated with these Trabid loss-of-function mutations are primarily caused by the mislocalisation of APC that leads to defective cytoskeleton organisation and aberrant cell locomotion.</p>

<title>Trabid patient variants are impaired in DUB activity and STRIPAK binding</title>
<p><italic>Trabid/ZRANB1</italic> patient missense mutations, R438W and A451V, are linked to developmental microcephaly (Deciphering Developmental Disorders 2015). Mapping these residues onto the domain structure of Trabid show that they flank either side of Trabid’s catalytic cysteine C443 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Residue R438 projects prominently into the catalytic cleft formed by the ankyrin repeats and the OTU core of Trabid’s catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Licchesi et al. 2012</xref>), whereas residue A451 resides at the back of the active site, opposite to C443 on alpha helix 4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). To determine if patient mutations R438W and A451V influence substrate catalysis, we purified the mutant AnkOTU domains and tested their ability to hydrolyse synthetic ubiquitin chains <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Licchesi et al. 2012</xref>). Wild-type Trabid AnkOTU generated appreciable amounts of mono-ubiquitin within 15 min incubation with either Lys29- or Lys63-linked di-ubiquitin chains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). In contrast, Trabid R438W showed near total loss of DUB activity and cleaved ubiquitin product was only readily detected after a prolonged 120 min incubation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). A catalytically inactive C443S mutant AnkOTU domain failed to hydrolyse ubiquitin chains even after 2 h incubation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Interestingly, the Trabid A451V AnkOTU domain cleaved Lys29- or Lys63-linked di-ubiquitin with comparable efficiency to wild type Trabid, despite it being slightly less stable as a recombinant protein based on thermal stability assay (Supplementary Fig. 1A). A ubiquitin suicide probe assay revealed that R438W and A451V Trabid AnkOTU proteins retained a functional catalytic interaction with ubiquitin (Supplementary Fig. 1B).</p>

FLAG-Trabid A451V failed to efficiently co-precipitate Striatin3 and STRIP1, indicating loss of binding to the STRIPAK complex.

<p>In cells, the inability of the DUB-inactive Trabid C443S to cleave polyubiquitin led to stable interaction of this mutant with polyubiquitylated substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tran et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Licchesi et al. 2012</xref>). We therefore asked whether the DUB-impaired R438W Trabid likewise exhibited increased binding to polyubiquitin in cells. Polyubiquitin chains readily co-precipitated with both FLAG-tagged Trabid R438W and FLAG-Trabid C443S expressed in HEK293T cells, consistent with the compromised DUB activity of these mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). The Trabid A451V variant did not co-precipitate abundant polyubiquitylated substrates, consistent with it retaining full DUB activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>We have previously identified an interaction between Trabid and STRIPAK that is important for the deubiquitylation of substrate APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tran et al. 2013</xref>). Whilst A451V retained full DUB activity, strikingly, in contrast to FLAG-Trabid wild-type, R438W and C443S, the FLAG-Trabid A451V mutant failed to efficiently co-precipitate several STRIPAK components, including Striatin3 and STRIP1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). All FLAG-Trabid proteins co-precipitated similar levels of the substrate E3 ubiquitin ligase HECTD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tran et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harris et al. 2021</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the Trabid patient mutations produce hypomorphic variants impaired in two distinct biochemical activities: polyubiquitin hydrolysis and STRIPAK-binding.</p>

<title>Decreased cell density in the brains of mice harbouring Trabid patient mutations</title>
<p>Given the microcephaly observed in children with Trabid mutations, and to understand the consequence of Trabid hypomorphic variants <italic>in vivo</italic>, we examined knock-in mice carrying Trabid patient mutations for evidence of brain development abnormalities (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Mice heterozygous or homozygous for the R438W or A451V mutation were viable, fertile, and born at expected Mendelian ratios (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Given that germline Trabid knockout or C443S homozygous knock-in mice exhibit perinatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dickinson et al. 2016</xref>) (our unpublished data), these new R438W and A451V mutant mouse strains allow us to interrogate Trabid function <italic>in vivo</italic>. Homozygous mutant mice from the R438W colony weighed on average ∼15% less than wild-type littermates, while R438W hemizygous and A451V mutant mice did not exhibit significant weight loss (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis of brain sections from weaned littermate mice of both mutant strains revealed normal structure and laminar organisation of the cerebral cortex, but intriguingly a reduction in cell number was apparent in different brain regions of R438W and A451V homozygous mice compared to similar wild-type littermate controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Ctip2+ neurons in the striatum of R438W and A451V mutant mice were also reduced compared with wild-type littermates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Homozygous mice showed a greater cell number loss than hemizygous mice, suggesting a gene dosage effect. Moreover, R438W and A451V mutant mice had reduced number of Olig2+ oligodendrocytes in the forebrain and midbrain compared to wild-type littermate mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Olig2+ oligodendrocytes in homozygous brain sections were consistently strongly reduced (&gt;30%) compared to wild-type mice, independent of age or sex. Of a combined 16 sets of littermate mice from both R438W and A451V colonies, reduced neuronal or glial cell numbers were conspicuous in homozygous brain sections of 12 littermate sets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, F; see also <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), indicating incomplete penetrance of the mutant phenotype. Collectively, these results suggest that Trabid’s DUB and STRIPAK-binding activities are required to produce the correct numbers of neuronal and glial cells in the developing brain.</p>

<title>Trabid mutant mice exhibit a motor deficit consistent with reduced numbers of dopaminergic neurons and projections</title>
<p>Given the cell number deficits in the midbrain of Trabid mutant mice and the reported midbrain neurodegeneration and locomotor defects in Trabid mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kounatidis et al. 2017</xref>), we asked if the numbers of dopaminergic neurons that control motor function might be affected in Trabid R438W and A451V mutant mice. Midbrain and striatal coronal sections were immunostained for Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis and a marker of dopaminergic neurons. A reduction in the numbers of TH+ neurons was observed in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of Trabid mutant mice from both R438W and A451V colonies, independent of age or sex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). SNc neurons project axons to the striatum to produce an extensive network of axonal terminals that communicate with striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Matsuda et al. 2009</xref>). Consistent with the lack of prominent TH+ neuronal processes emanating from the SNc neurons that remain in the mutant midbrain, TH immunoreactivity was reduced in the striatum of homozygous R438W and A451V mutant mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, C</xref>). Also in mutant brain sections, the reduced abundance and intensity of TH+ neuronal processes were readily apparent in cortical regions including the motor cortex and claustrum that regulate motor responses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, C</xref>). Differences in TH staining in the mutant striatum compared to wild type were modest or not observed in all littermates examined (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), indicating incomplete penetrance of the mutant Trabid alleles.</p>
<p>Given the altered abundance of TH+ cells and projections in motor-related brain regions of Trabid mutant mice, we evaluated the motor function of these mice using a rotarod assay. Homozygous R438W mice showed a significantly reduced latency to fall at 20, 25, 30 and 35 RPM, compared to controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), as did homozygous A451V animals at 30 and 35 RPM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). This indicates that Trabid patient mutations impair motor coordination, consistent with a deficiency in dopaminergic neurons. The smaller size of R438W homozygous mice compared to wild-type littermates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) could be a contributing factor to the compromised rotarod performance of these mutants. However, given that A451V homozygous mice on average are not smaller than wild-type littermates, the motor deficit exhibited by both R438W and A451V homozygous mice is likely caused by the abnormal cell numbers and reduced dopaminergic neurons in their brains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that Trabid regulates the brain cellular architecture and circuitry required for normal motor function.</p>

<title>Trabid patient mutants fail to efficiently limit APC ubiquitylation in cells</title>
<p>To understand the molecular basis for the neuronal and behavioral phenotypes of Trabid mutant mice, we focused on APC— an established regulator of mammalian brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yokota et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Preitner et al. 2014</xref>) and a protein that we have shown becomes strongly ubiquitylated upon loss of Trabid or Striatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tran et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tran et al. 2013</xref>). Moreover, given that Striatin binds directly to APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Breitman et al. 2008</xref>), we hypothesized that the Trabid patient mutants impaired in DUB activity or Striatin-binding would impact APC ubiquitylation and function in cells. To test this, we generated cells with doxycycline (dox)-inducible expression of FLAG-Trabid and examined the ubiquitylation status of endogenous APC in dox-treated cells. The levels of ubiquitin-modified APC were strongly suppressed in cells expressing wild-type FLAG-Trabid (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). In contrast, induction of the FLAG-Trabid R438W mutant, like the catalytically dead FLAG-Trabid C443S, did not repress APC ubiquitylation, and induction of FLAG-Trabid A451V expression only partially reduced APC ubiquitylation compared to control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). These results suggest that both DUB and STRIPAK-binding activities of Trabid are required for efficient deubiquitylation of APC in cells.</p>

<title>Trabid patient mutants impede EGFP-APC transport to the leading edge of migrating cells</title>
<p>APC decorates the membrane protrusions at the leading edge of migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nathke et al. 1996</xref>) and we have shown that Trabid is a key regulator of APC localisation to these cortical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tran et al. 2013</xref>). Consistent with this insight, FLAG-Trabid localised prominently with EGFP-APC in the tips of long cell processes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Analysis of several of these tip clusters by super resolution microscopy revealed ∼30% overlap between the FLAG-Trabid and EGFP-APC signals, indicating that a significant fraction of these proteins co-localise in cortical cell protrusions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). In sub-confluent cultures, EGFP-APC localised strongly to the lamellipodial leading-edge of the majority of cells co-transfected wild-type FLAG-Trabid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C, D</xref>). By contrast, in cells transfected with the FLAG-Trabid mutants R438W and A451V, EGFP-APC formed irregular puncta at sub-cortical regions close to the leading edge and EGFP-APC aggregates are often sequestered to puncta formed by the R438W FLAG-Trabid mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C, D</xref>). Such sites may contain ubiquitylated substrates bound to DUB-defective Trabid mutants, as we have previously demonstrated with Trabid C443S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tran et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Licchesi et al. 2012</xref>). Consistently, FLAG-Trabid C443S formed puncta that contained EGFP-APC near the tips of long cell processes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Intriguingly, the Trabid substrate HECTD1 was sequestered to C443S puncta in the cytosol, but not to puncta residing near the leading-edge membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). In confluent cultures following prolonged co-transfection of FLAG-Trabid mutants and EGFP-APC, we observed the striking phenomena of strong EGFP-APC aggregation on or near the plasma membrane and nanotube-like processes extending between neighbouring cells decorated with abundant EGFP-APC puncta/aggregates of various sizes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that Trabid’s DUB and STRIPAK-binding activities are required for the efficient localisation of APC to plasma membrane sites involved in polarised cell migration.</p>

We then performed live cell imaging to analyse the trafficking of APC-tdTomato in neurites extending from progenitors undergoing differentiation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Endogenous Trabid protein levels were comparable in neural progenitor cultures derived from embryos bearing wild-type or R438W and A451V mutant Trabid alleles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).

In neurons with hemizygous Trabid R438W or A451V mutation, APC-tdTomato exhibited broad distribution along the length of the neurite and the formation of growth cones were severely compromised (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, <italic>Zranb1</italic><sup>R438W/+</sup>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We describe a novel function for the deubiquitylating enzyme Trabid as a key regulator of axonal growth and guidance that likely underpins the neurodevelopmental defects observed in children with Trabid mutation. Our data suggests that Trabid’s mechanism of action is to suppress the ubiquitylation of APC to regulate its intracellular trafficking. A <italic>hypo</italic>ubiquitylated APC pool is efficiently localised to the cortical cytoskeleton where it directs neuronal growth cone formation and polarised axon elongation. The identification of human Trabid variants that disrupt the distribution of APC to the leading edge of migrating cells provides a plausible explanation for the associated patient neuro-developmental disorders. Our work identifies Trabid’s DUB- and STRIPAK-binding activities, and the control of APC localisation, as crucial events during embryonic and neural development.</p>
<p>The two patients carrying Trabid missense mutations R438W and A451V were diagnosed with a range of distinct congenital disorders including craniofacial abnormalities, seizures, developmental delay, autism—and both patients presented with microcephaly and constipation (Deciphering Developmental Disorders 2015). We propose that the underlying cause of these seemingly unrelated conditions, broadly classified as neurocristopathies, is the abnormal specification or migration of neural crest cells in the developing embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Vega-Lopez et al. 2018</xref>). Discrete neural crest populations contribute to the development of craniofacial structures, the forebrain and midbrain, and the enteric nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Creuzet et al. 2006</xref>). Therefore, errors in the formation or polarised migration of neural crest cells could account for all the patient phenotypes, including the reduction in brain volume (microcephaly). Presently, we can only speculate that the irregular cellular architecture and reduced cell numbers in the brains of mice harbouring Trabid patient mutations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) reflect the errant migration of neural crest or neural progenitor cell populations in early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Silva et al. 2019</xref>). While Trabid mutant mice did not exhibit microcephaly, they showed a motor deficit (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) consistent with the locomotor defects reported for Trabid loss-of-function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kounatidis et al. 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, the fly Striatin homolog CKA is involved in axonal transport and motor coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Neisch et al. 2017</xref>), and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Strip1 regulates endosomal trafficking and axon elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sakuma et al. 2014</xref>). Endosomal trafficking defects have been linked to reduced proliferation of neural progenitors and microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Carpentieri et al. 2022</xref>). Three independent groups have identified Trabid’s association with STRIPAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sowa et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tran et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harris et al. 2021</xref>). We have now established the functional significance of this interaction. The requirement of Trabid binding to STRIPAK for efficient protein trafficking, polarised axon growth, and motor coordination (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), supports the view that Trabid-STRIPAK regulates an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of cell movement required for normal brain development and establishment of the correct neuronal circuitry in the motor system.</p>
<p>The impairment of two distinct Trabid functions—polyubiquitin hydrolysis and STRIPAK-binding—led to common cellular, developmental, and behavioral phenotypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) (Deciphering Developmental Disorders 2015), strongly suggesting that these activities act in the same pathway. We propose that APC is the primary molecular target of Trabid action in cytoskeleton organisation and polarised axon growth (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). APC is an established regulator of cell adhesion and migration, and it governs the cortical actin and microtubule cytoskeleton dynamics required to form and steer axonal growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dogterom and Koenderink 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Efimova et al. 2020</xref>). In a yeast two hybrid screen, we have found that Trabid and Striatin interacted with the armadillo repeat domain (ARD) of APC, but not to an APC ARD mutant that caused cell-cell adhesion defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hamada and Bienz 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tran et al. 2008</xref>). This implies that a functional interaction between Trabid, Striatin and APC promotes the fidelity of cell-cell or cell-substratum contacts. Our model of Trabid action in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> integrates published data showing that (1) Trabid complexes with Striatin/STRIPAK in human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sowa et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tran et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harris et al. 2021</xref>), and (2) Striatin binds directly to the ARD domain of APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Breitman et al. 2008</xref>). We propose that STRIPAK recruits Trabid to deubiquitylate APC. This allows APC to accumulate at the leading edge of migrating cells to promote efficient, polarised locomotion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). The Trabid R438W mutant still binds STRIPAK and is recruited to APC, but it is impaired in its ability to cleave ubiquitin chains from APC. And although the Trabid A451V mutant retains full DUB activity, it cannot be recruited to APC via STRIPAK. Both mutant scenarios cause APC to become persistently modified with ubiquitin chains that lead to APC delocalisation from cell tips and defective cell movement (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Consistent with this model, Trabid or Striatin deficiency caused APC hyperubiquitylation and aggregation, perturbed actin assembly and microtubule stability, and inhibited the migration of mouse and human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bai et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tran et al. 2013</xref>) (our unpublished data). Optimal cell adhesion and migration requires stable, acetylated microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aguilar et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bance et al. 2019</xref>). Of note, loss of APC and the STRIPAK proteins STRIP1 and CTTNBP2 strongly reduced the acetylated microtubule network in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yokota et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shih et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sakuma et al. 2015</xref>). Furthermore, Striatin depletion perturbed cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Breitman et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lahav-Ariel et al. 2019</xref>) and axon elongation defects caused by STRIP1 mutation are linked to the dysregulation of neuronal adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sakuma et al. 2014</xref>). It would be interesting to investigate if chronic APC ubiquitylation and dysfunction underlie all Trabid and STRIPAK mutant phenotypes.</p>

<caption><title>Model of Trabid’s mechanism of action in axon growth and guidance.</title>
<p><bold>A.</bold> STRIPAK recruits Trabid to deubiquitylate APC (and possibly other substrates). This promotes efficient APC accumulation at microtubule plus ends to coordinate the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton dynamics that drive directional cell migration and polarised axon growth.</p><p><bold>B.</bold> In cells expressing Trabid mutants that are DUB-impaired (R438W) or STRIPAK-binding-deficient (A451V), APC becomes persistently modified with ubiquitin chains that retard its transport to cell tips. This impairs cytoskeleton organisation which leads to defective axon elongation and cell migration. Future studies will aim to identify the mechanism of Trabid recruitment to STRIPAK, the ubiquitin-modified residue(s) on APC (and possibly other substrates), and the composition of polyubiquitin linkages on substrates including the Lys29- and Lys33-linked atypical chain types preferentially targeted by Trabid.</p><p><bold>C.</bold> Live cell imaging of APC-tdTomato in neurites extending from E11.5 midbrain neural progenitors of a <italic>Zranb1<sup>R438W/+</sup></italic>;<italic>Apc<sup>tdTom/+</sup></italic> outcross.

APC tdTomato fluorescence synchronised with the movement of a membrane dye during neurite extension/retraction (data not shown) and was therefore used as a proxy for neurite growth along an arbitrary X and Y plane. Neurite tracking data were compiled from the imaging of neurite outgrowth in 3 independent neurosphere cultures established from E11.5 embryos of 3 independent <italic>Zranb1<sup>R438W/+</sup></italic>;<italic>Apc<sup>tdTom/+</sup></italic> or <italic>Zranb1<sup>A451V/+</sup></italic>;<italic>Apc<sup>tdTom/+</sup></italic> outcrosses.

<title>Mice</title>
<p>All mouse studies complied with relevant ethical regulations and were approved by the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute Animal Ethics Committee. The <italic>Zranb1<sup>R438W</sup></italic>, <italic>Zranb1<sup>A451V</sup></italic>, and <italic>Apc<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic>knock-in mice were generated on a C57BL/6J background using CRISPR–Cas9-mediated gene editing by the Melbourne Advanced Genome Editing Centre (MAGEC) at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. To generate a R438W mutation within the <italic>Zranb1</italic> gene on mouse chromosome 7, a single guide (sg) RNA of the sequence GAC TAT ATG CAC TTT GGA AC was used to create double stranded breaks within the Zranb1 locus to stimulate homologous recombination and an oligo donor of the sequence TAT AAA CTG GTC TTT GGA GTT GGC TAC ACG TCT GGA CAG TAG ACT ATA TGC ACT TTG GAA CTG GAC TGC CGG AGA TTG TTT ACT TGA CTC AGT ACT ACA AGC TAC ATG GGG CAT TTA TGA CAA A was used to introduce the R438W mutation. The sgRNA and donor sequence along with Cas9 mRNA were injected into the cytoplasm of fertilized one-cell stage embryos generated from wild-type C57BL/6J breeders. To generate the A451V mutation, a sgRNA of the sequence ACT CAG TAC TAC AAG CTA CA and an oligo donor of the sequence ACA GTA GAC TAT ATG CAC TTT GGA ACC GGA CTG CCG GAG ATT GTT TAC TTG ACT CAG TAC TAC AAG TCA CAT GGG GCA TTT ATG ACA AAG ACT CGG TGC TTC GGA AAG CCC TGC ATG ACA GCC TG CAT was used. Twenty-four hours later, two-cell stage embryos were transferred into the uteri of pseudo-pregnant female mice. Viable offspring were genotyped by next-generation sequencing. Targeted animals were backcrossed twice to wild-type C57BL/6J to eliminate off-target mutations. Generation of C57BL/6J mice expressing the APC-tdTomato fusion protein under the control of the endogenous <italic>Apc</italic> promoter (B6J.<italic>Apc</italic><sup>tdTom</sup>) were based on methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ng et al. 2020</xref>). Briefly, a sgRNA of the sequence AGA CGT CAC GAG GTA AGA CC was used to create double stranded breaks within the <italic>Apc</italic> locus to stimulate homologous recombination. A targeting vector containing homology arms of ∼1.4 kilobases was used to introduce the tdTomato coding sequence after the last <italic>Apc</italic> coding exon. Forward (ACC TGT TCC TGT ACG GCA TG) and reverse (GCC TCC CAA AAT GAC CAG TG) primers to detect the tdTomato sequence were used to screen viable pups for integration of the targeting vector by PCR.</p>

<title>Neurite outgrowth from cultured neural progenitors</title>
<p>To generate mouse embryos expressing Apc-tdTomato with wild-type or mutant Trabid, mice heterozygous for the Apc-tdTomato allele (<italic>Apc</italic><sup>tdTom/+</sup>) were outcrossed with mice heterozygous for the Trabid R438W or A451V mutant allele (<italic>Zranb1</italic><sup>R438W/+</sup> or <italic>Zranb1</italic><sup>A451V/+</sup>). Embryos at E11.5 were harvested from pregnant females and ventral midbrains were dissected as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Thompson and Parish 2013</xref>). The isolated midbrain tissue was enzymatically dissociated in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.1% DNase I for 12 minutes at 37°C. Cells in the tissue were separated by mechanical dissociation, counted, then plated in serum-free N2 medium consisting of a 1:1 mixture of Ham’s F12 and Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 15 mM HEPES buffer, 1 mM glutamine, 6 mg/ml glucose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and N2 100X supplement. Cells were seeded at a density of 250,000 cells per well in a 24-well plate at 37°C, 3% CO<sub>2</sub>. An aliquot of the resultant neurosphere cultures were sequenced to ascertain genotypes. To differentiate midbrain progenitors towards the dopaminergic lineage, neurospheres were resuspended in N2 medium containing BDNF and GDNF (30 ng/ml each) then seeded in tissue culture dishes or glass bottom ibidi chamber slides pre-coated with poly-D-lysine and laminin (10 μg/ml each).</p>

<title>Histology and IHC analysis</title>
<p>Mice were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation and intracardial perfusion was performed to fix the tissues. Perfusion was initiated with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline followed by 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF). After perfusion, brain and tissues were dissected and post-fixed in 10% NBF for 24h before paraffin-embedding with the Tissue-Tek VIP 6 automated tissue processor (Sakura Finetek USA). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned into 7 µm slices using a microtome and mounted on positively charged slides. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed with the Omnis Auto-immunostaining platform using Agilent EnVision Target retrieval solution and the optimal dilution of the primary antibody against the target protein. Secondary antibody detection was performed with the Dako EnVision+ Single Reagents HRP and FLEX DAB+ Substrate Chromogen System. Slides were counterstained with haematoxylin. Sections from wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous littermate mice were mounted and stained on the same slide to ensure IHC signals can be directly compared. Cell counts and IHC signal intensities were quantified using Fiji software (NIH). The workflow for counting cells from IHC images is described in Supplementary Figure 2. IHC signal intensities were measured as the optical density proportional to the concentration of the stain. Briefly, the colour spectra of DAB- and haematoxylin-stained image was separated by colour deconvolution, converted to greyscale, thresholding was applied, and the mean pixel intensity of the region of interest was measured.</p>

<title>Rotarod performance test</title>
<p>The motor coordination of 3-to 4-month-old littermate mice from Trabid R438W and A451V colonies were measured using a rotating rod (Rotamex-5, Columbus Instruments). Mice were lowered onto a 3 cm diameter rod rotating at 12, 16, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 or 45 revolutions per min (RPM) for 2 min or until they fell. Animals were given a 5 min rest between RPM sessions. Two trials were performed with a 1 h break between trials. The latency to fall was recorded for each RPM. A 1 sec penalty was added if an animal failed to walk in time with the rod but rather gripped the rod and rotated with it (cartwheel). Animals underwent 2 trials per day across 3 days.</p>

<title>Microscopy and image analysis</title>
<p><italic>Confocal microscopy</italic> – Cells grown in MatTek chamber slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X100 and blocked with 5% normal goat serum (NGS). Cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 5% NGS overnight at 4°C, followed by Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1h at room temperature. ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI was used to mount coverslips to microscope slides. Confocal images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 880 Airyscan microscope using a 63x/1.4 N.A. oil objective, and 405, 488 and 594nm lasers. Maximum intensity projections of raw images comprising 10-15 <italic>z</italic> sections were created using Fiji.</p>
<p><italic>3D structured illumination microscopy</italic> – Super-resolution three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) was performed on the DeltaVision OMX-SR system using a 60x/1.42 N.A. PlanApo oil immersion objective, sCMOS cameras, and 488, 568 and 640 nm lasers. 3D-SIM images consisted of 15 raw images per focal plane per colour channel with 125 nm between each z-step. Images were reconstructed and the colour channels aligned using the reconstruction and alignment algorithms in softWoRx 7.0. Fraction of overlap between FLAG-Trabid and EGFP-APC were measured in Imaris 9.2.</p>
<p><italic>Lattice lightsheet time-lapse imaging and analysis</italic> – Live cell time-lapse imaging of APC-tdTomato fluorescence in growing neurites was acquired using the Zeiss Lattice Light Sheet 7 microscope. A 561 nm laser formed a light sheet of length 30 µm with a thickness of 1 μm at the sample plane via a 13.3 x, 0.44 NA objective. tdTomato fluorescence was collected via a 44.83 X, 1 NA detection objective lens. Data was collected with a frame rate of 60 ms and a z-step of 300 nm. Each region was imaged at 15-min intervals for 4-6 hours. Fluorescence was collected via a multi-band stop, LBF 405/488/561/633, filter. Images were subsequently deskewed using Zeiss’s Zen 3.4 software. Samples were measured at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Maximum intensity projections were created from the deskewed data in Fiji. Neurite tips were tracked using Trackmate (v6.0.3) and LoG detector with 12 μm diameter, 0.08 threshold, no filters, and subpixel localisation turned on. A minimum of 5 frames were set for track inclusion. Turn angles were calculated using Matlab R2019b. Three points were used to calculate the turn. The first two points determine the direction of neurite growth. The angle between this direction to the third point determines the turn angle of the neurite. The turn angle was normalized such that 0° constitutes a step straight forward with no turn and 180° is a turn backwards.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, Frank, Bergamasco, Mlodzianoski et al study two microcephaly-associated patient variants in TRABID to identify and characterize a previously unrecognized role of this deubiquitylation enzyme during neurodevelopment. The authors generate TRABID p.R438W and p.A451V knock in mice, which exhibit smaller neuronal and glial cell densities as well as motor deficits, phenotypes that are consistent with the congenital defects observed in the patients. Through in vitro and cellular immunoprecipitation assays, the authors demonstrate that the p.R438W variant impairs the K29- and K63-chain cleavage activity of TRABID, while the p.A451V variant reduces binding to the STRIPAK complex, a previously identified TRABID interactor with established functions in cytoskeletal organization and neural development. Ubiquitylation assays performed in HEK293T cells further reveal that the hypomorphic patient variants are deficient in deubiquitylating APC, a previously identified substrate of TRABID that has been shown to control the neuronal cortical cytoskeleton during neurite outgrowth. Ex vivo experiments provide evidence that axonal APC trafficking and neurite outgrowth is disturbed in differentiating neural progenitors isolated from mouse embryos carrying Trabid patient alleles. From these experiments the authors propose a model in which TRABID- and STRIPAK-dependent APC deubiquitylation regulates its axonal trafficking to ensure faithful neurite outgrowth and misregulation of this function leads to neurodevelopmental phenotypes in TRABID/ZRANB1 patients.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study describes a previously unrecognized function of TRABID in neurodevelopment and establishes knock in mice as model to study congenital defects of TRABID/ZRANB1 patients. In addition, the authors identify control of axonal trafficking of APC by deubiquitylation as a potential mechanism through which TRABID regulates neurite outgrowth and whose dysregulation could be the molecular basis of the neurodevelopmental phenotypes observed in TRABID/ZRANB1 patients.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the proposed underlying mechanism of how hypomorphic TRABID mutations lead to the patient phenotypes is conceivable and supported by the author's data, there is no functional evidence provided that the mouse phenotypes (reduced neuron/glia densities or motor deficits) are indeed due to aberrant APC deubiquitylation and trafficking. In addition, some aspects of the proposed mechanism, i.e. the claim that APC deubiquitylation is STRIPAK-dependent, should be strengthened by orthogonal approaches.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Although Trabid missense mutations are identified across a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, its role in neurodevelopment is not understood. Here the authors study two different patient mutations and implicate defects in its deubiquitylating activity and interactions with STRIPAK. Knockin mice for these mutations impaired trafficking of APC to microtubule plus ends, with consequent defects in neuronal growth cone and neurite outgrowth.</p>
<p>The authors focus on R438W and A451V, two missense mutations seen in patients. Recombinant fragments showed R438W is nearly completely DUB-dead whereas A451V showed normal activity but failed to efficiently precipitate STRIPAK. Knockin of these mutations showed a partially penetrant reduced cortical neuronal and glial cell numbers and reduced TH+ neurons and their neuronal processes. Cell culture demonstrated that both DUB and STRIPAK-binding activities of Trabid are required for efficient deubiquitylation of APC in cells, and alter APC transport along neurites. APC-tdTomato fluorescent reporter mice crossed with the Trabid mutants confirmed these results. The results suggest that Trabid's mechanism of action is to suppress APC ubiquitylation to regulate its intracellular trafficking and neurite formation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Solid manuscript with in vivo and in vitro demonstration of mechanism of action</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Much of the work relies on prior discoveries of Trabid's role in STRIPAK and APC related functions, so the novelty is somewhat reduced.</p>
