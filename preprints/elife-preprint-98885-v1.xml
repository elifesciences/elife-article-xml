<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) are biotin-dependent carboxylases (BDCs) that catalyze the metabolism of odd-chain fatty acids, cholesterol, and specific amino acids. For human PCC and MCC, only a low-resolution (15 Å) three-dimensional structure of human PCC has been reported. Here, we report high-resolution (2.29–3.28 Å) cryo-EM structures of human PCC and MCC holoenzymes in their apo and acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA-bound states. Propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA bind to PCC with almost identical binding modes, indicating that the acyl-CoA specificity of PCC is largely attributed to minor differences in interactions mediated by the acyl groups. In MCC, biotin is relocated from an exo-site to an endo-site upon acetyl-CoA binding, suggesting coordination between biotin binding and acyl-CoA binding. Our work provides insights into the substrate specificity and catalytic process of BDCs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Biotin-dependent carboxylases (BDCs) catalyze the carboxylation of several key metabolites using covalently linked biotin as a cofactor(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). In humans, there are four types of BDCs: acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC), and pyruvate carboxylase (PYC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). All BDCs contain a biotin carboxylase (BC) domain, a carboxyltransferase (CT) domain, and a biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). The carboxylation reaction involves a two-step process(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Firstly, the biotin covalently linked to the BCCP domain is carboxylated in the BC domain, using bicarbonate as the donor of the carboxyl group(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Secondly, the carboxylated biotin is carried to the CT domain by the BCCP domain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). In the CT domain, the carboxyl group is transferred from the biotin to acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA, or pyruvate(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Among the four human BDCs, ACC and PYC each consist of a single chain that incorporates the BC, CT, and BCCP domains(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). In contrast, PCC and MCC have their BC, CT, and BCCP domains divided into two chains: the α subunits contain the BC and BCCP domains, with an intermediate BC-CT interaction (BT) domain between them, while the β subunits solely consist of the CT domain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>In humans, PCC and MCC catalyze the carboxylation of propionyl-CoA and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA (MC-CoA), respectively(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Propionyl-CoA is an intermediate in the metabolism of odd-chain fatty acids, cholesterol, and amino acids including valine, isoleucine, methionine, and threonine; its carboxylated product (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA is then converted into succinyl-CoA and subsequently metabolized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). MC-CoA is an intermediate in the metabolism of leucine; following carboxylation, the resulting product 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA (MG-CoA) is further converted into 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) and then involved in the synthesis of cholesterol(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Therefore, both PCC and MCC play important roles in metabolic processes. Loss-of-function mutations in MCC and PCC lead to severe metabolic disorders(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>).</p>
<p>The protein sequences and functions of PCC and MCC are conserved from bacteria to humans. A crystal structure of a chimeric bacteria PCC holoenzyme, obtained by co-expressing the α subunit of <italic>Ruegeria pomeroyi</italic> PCC (RpPCC) with the β subunit of <italic>Roseobacter denitrificans</italic> PCC (RdPCC) in <italic>E. coli</italic>, was determined at a resolution of 3.2 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). The PCC holoenzyme is a dodecamer formed by six α subunits and six β subunits, thereby referred to as the α<sub>6</sub>β<sub>6</sub> holoenzyme(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Crystal structures of a bacteria MCC (<italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> MCC, PaMCC) holoenzyme reveal that the MCC holoenzyme is also a α<sub>6</sub>β<sub>6</sub> dodecamer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). The structures of bacteria PCC and MCC holoenzymes reveal how the α subunits and β subunits assemble to form the holoenzymes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). However, our understanding of human PCC and MCC is constrained by the limited availability of high-resolution three-dimensional structures. Thus far, only a low-resolution cryo-EM structure of human PCC holoenzyme (15 Å) has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), highlighting the need for high-resolution structural information of human PCC and MCC.</p>
<p>In this study, we purified the endogenous PCC and MCC from human cells and determined the cryo-EM structures of human PCC and MCC holoenzymes in the apo (PCC or MCC holoenzyme alone), acetyl-CoA-bound, and propionyl-CoA-bound states, at resolutions ranging from 2.29 to 3.28 Å. Structural analysis reveals that human PCC and MCC holoenzymes have overall structures similar to their bacterial homologs. For human PCC holoenzyme, the structure in the acetyl-CoA-bound state closely resembles the structures in the apo and the propionyl-CoA-bound state. In these structures, the covalently linked biotin binds to a site that is distant from the catalytic residues in the CT domain, rendering it catalytically incompetent. In contrast, for human MCC holoenzyme, acetyl-CoA binding, but not propionyl-CoA binding, induces conformational changes in the acyl-CoA binding pocket, thus relocating the covalently linked biotin from an exo-site to an endo-site that is closer to the catalytic residues in the CT domain.</p>

<title>Overall structures of human PCC and MCC holoenzymes</title>
<p>The BDCs endogenously expressed in Expi 293F cells were purified using streptavidin beads (the Strep-Tactin<sup>®</sup>XT resin) since streptavidin can specifically bind to the covalently linked biotin in the BDCs. The purified BDCs were further purified using size exclusion chromatography. Mass spectrometry analysis identified all four types of human BDCs in the purified samples (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">fig. S1</xref>). The samples were subjected to cryo-EM sample preparation (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">fig. S1</xref>, A to C).</p>
<p>The cryo-EM structures of the PCC and MCC holoenzymes alone, referred to as PCC-apo and MCC-apo, were determined at resolutions of 3.02 Å and 2.29 Å, respectively (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">figs. S2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3, A</xref> to D and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4, A</xref> to D, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">tables S1</xref> and <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">S2</xref>). The cryo-EM maps have good quality to support model building (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">figs. S5</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>).</p>
<p>Both the PCC and MCC holoenzymes consist of six α subunits and six β subunits. The cryo-EM densities of one PCCα subunit in the PCC-ACO structure and three MCCα subunits in the MCC-apo, MCC-ACO, and MCC-PCO structures are partially missing. Therefore, in order to demonstrate the complete structures of the holoenzymes, these subunits were built into the structures based on the density of the BT domain in each α subunit (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">fig. S8</xref>). The α<sub>6</sub>β<sub>6</sub> dodecamer can be divided into four layers. The six β subunits are stacked into two layers to form the core of the holoenzymes, with three β subunits laid head to end in each layer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, A and B). The six α subunits are separated into two layers and situated at the top and bottom sides of the β subunit core, with each layer contains three α subunits. A major difference between the PCC and MCC holoenzymes is that the three α subunits in each layer have no contact in the PCC holoenzyme but interact with each other in the MCC holoenzyme (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, A and B).</p>

<p>The overall structures of human PCC and MCC holoenzymes are similar to the reported crystal structures of bacteria PCC and MCC holoenzymes, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, C and D). Specifically, alignment of the β subunits in the PCC-apo structure with those in the structure of a chimeric bacteria PCC holoenzyme (PDB code: 3N6R) shows that the β subunit cores in the two structures are very similar(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Each α subunit in human PCC holoenzyme has a minor rotation relative to the corresponding α subunit in the bacteria PCC holoenzyme (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Similarly, the β subunit core in the MCC-apo structure aligns well with that in the crystal structure of a bacteria MCC holoenzyme (PDB code: 3U9T), with each α subunit slightly rotated in comparison to the corresponding α subunit in the bacteria MCC holoenzyme(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). The structures of the BC, BT, and BCCP domains in the α subunits of human PCC and MCC resemble the corresponding domains in bacteria PCC and MCC(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), except that the BT domain of human MCC has one more β strand in comparison to that of the PaMCC (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">fig.

<title>Organization of the catalytic domains in human PCC and MCC holoenzymes</title>
<p>We incubated the purified human BDCs with propionyl-CoA (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">fig. S1</xref>, D to G), which is the substrate of PCC, and determined the cryo-EM structures of the propionyl-CoA-bound PCC and MCC holoenzymes (referred to as PCC-PCO and MCC-PCO), at resolutions of 2.80 Å and 2.36 Å, respectively (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">figs. S2B</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3, E</xref> to H, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4, E</xref> to H, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">tables S1</xref> and <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">S2</xref>). The two structures are almost identical to the structures of PCC-apo and MCC-apo, respectively. Although bicarbonate, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and ATP were added to the purified BDC samples to facilitate the carboxylation reaction, the cryo-EM density of the biotin region does not provide conclusive evidence as to whether the covalently linked biotin in the PCC holoenzyme structures was indeed carboxylated. Thus, the cryo-EM structures only contain the uncarboxylated biotin.</p>
<p>The two-step carboxylation reactions catalyzed by PCC and MCC require the coordination of the BC, BCCP domains in the α subunit and the CT domain in the β subunit (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In human PCC holoenzyme, each α subunit binds to one β subunit containing the CT domain that can be divided into CT-N and CT-C subdomains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The BC domain in the α subunit is situated on the CT-C subdomain, while the BCCP domain also attaches to the CT-C subdomain and positions the covalently linked biotin to a pocket adjacent to the propionyl-CoA binding pocket. The BT domain tightly interacts with both the CT-N and CT-C subdomains and functions as a hub to hold the BC and BCCP domains together with the CT domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of the domain organization of human PCC (top) and MCC (bottom). Both PCC and MCC consist of α and β subunits. From the N-terminal to the C-terminal, each α subunit contains a BC (red), a BT (orange), and a BCCP (pink) domain. Each β subunit contains a CT domain, which can be divided into the CT-N (blue) and CT-C (yellow) subdomains.

<graphic xlink:href="591959v1_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>In contrast, in human MCC holoenzyme, each α subunit binds to two β subunits (referred to as β1 and β2) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The CT-N subdomain of β1 interacts with the CT-C subdomain of β2. The BT domain of the α subunit associates with both the CT-N and CT-C subdomains of β1, while the BCCP domain attaches to the CT-C subdomain of β2. The propionyl-CoA binds to a pocket formed by the CT-C of β2 and the CT-N of a third β subunit (β3) from the other β subunit layer. The BC domain has no contact with the β subunits.</p>
<p>The variances in the organization of the catalytic domains in the PCC holoenzyme and the MCC holoenzyme are partly attributed to the distinct arrangement of their CT domains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Alignment of the CT-N subdomains shows that the CT-C subdomains in PCC and MCC have distinct orientations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). The CT domain in PCC can perfectly align with a combination including the CT-N of β1 and the CT-C of β2 of MCC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>

<title>Propionyl-CoA binding in human PCC holoenzyme</title>
<p>In each PCC holoenzyme, six propionyl-CoA molecules are observed binding to the six active sites of CT domains. Each binding site for propionyl-CoA is formed by the CT-C subdomain of one β subunit and the CT-N subdomain of another β subunit in the other layer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The conformation of the propionyl-CoA binding pocket in the PCC-PCO structure is only slightly different from that in the PCC-apo structure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The AMKM motif in the BCCP domain and the biotin covalently linked to it also show only minor conformational differences in the PCC-PCO structure compared to the PCC-apo structure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The distances between the ureido ring carbonyl oxygen of the biotin and the main chain amide of the catalytic residues G437 and A438 in the corresponding CT domain in the PCC-PCO structure are more than 7 Å, which is too far for an efficient catalytic process (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). This finding suggests that the biotin may need to relocate to a site that is closer to the catalytic residues to facilitate the carboxylation reaction.</p>

<p>In an unpublished manuscript (Zhou <italic>et al</italic>, 2024), we incubated the purified human BDCs with acetyl-CoA, which is a substrate of ACC, and determined the cryo-EM structure of the acetyl-CoA-bound ACC. Using the same batch of purified BDCs (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">fig. S1</xref>, H to K), we also determined the cryo-EM structures of human PCC and MCC holoenzymes in the acetyl-CoA-bound state (referred to as PCC-ACO and MCC-ACO) at resolutions of 3.38 Å and 2.85 Å, respectively (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">figs. S2C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3, I</xref> to L, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4, I</xref> to L, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">tables S1</xref> and <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">S2</xref>).</p>
<p>The PCC-ACO structure closely resembles the PCC-apo and the PCC-PCO structures. The acetyl-CoA in the PCC-ACO structure has a binding mode similar to the propionyl-CoA in the PCC-PCO structure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). The conformation of the acyl-CoA binding pocket in both structures is also highly similar (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). It was reported that D422 in the β subunit of a bacteria PCC (ScPCC) is crucial for the substrate specificity of ScPCC, and the D422I mutation significantly increased the catalytic activity of ScPCC towards acetyl-CoA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). But the PCC-PCO structure shows that D440, which corresponds to D422 in the β subunit of ScPCC, is not directly involved in the interaction with propionyl-CoA or acetyl-CoA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>The overall structure of MCC-ACO is also similar to that of MCC-apo, but alignment of the CT-N subdomains shows that the position of the BCCP domain and the conformation of the acyl-CoA binding pocket in the MCC-ACO structure are significantly different from those in the MCC-apo structure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Specifically, the BCCP domain moves towards the CT-C subdomain in the MCC-ACO structure compared to that in the MCC-apo structure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Consequently, the covalently linked biotin moves from an exo-site to an endo-site that is deeper in the pocket formed by the CT-N and CT-C subdomains from two β subunits (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). At the exo-site, the ureido ring carbonyl oxygen of the biotin is about 8 Å away from the main chain amide of the catalytic residues G437 and A438 (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">fig. S10A</xref>). In contrast, at the endo-site, the distance is shortened to about 3.5 Å (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">fig. S10B</xref>). The acyl-CoA binding pocket, also formed by the CT-N and CT-C subdomains from two β subunits, switches from an open conformation in the MCC-apo structure to a closed conformation in the MCC-ACO structure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, C to E), with the major conformational change occurring at two helices (residues 474 to 517) in the CT-C subdomain and one helix (residues 243 to 252) in the CT-N subdomain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>We aligned the MCC-ACO structure with the crystal structure of a bacteria MCC (PaMCC) holoenzyme in complex with CoA (PDB code: 3U9S) and observed a high similarity between them(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Both the BCCP domain and the CT domain in the MCC-ACO structure align well with those in the PaMCC structure. The AMKM motif and biotin in the two structures also show a high similarity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Interestingly, alignment of the CoA-bound PaMCC holoenzyme structure with the structure of the PaMCC holoenzyme alone shows a change in the conformation of two helices in the CT-C subdomain of PaMCC(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), similar to that observed in the alignment of the MCC-ACO structure with the MCC-apo structure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). These findings suggest that conformational changes in the acyl-CoA binding pocket, combined with the change in the position of the BCCP domain, may be necessary for the catalytic process of MCC.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several three-dimensional structures of PCCs and MCCs have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), however, most of them are from bacteria and expressed in <italic>E. coli(12-16)</italic>. In our study, we extracted the endogenous PCC and MCC from human cells by one-step affinity purification (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">fig. S1</xref>) and determined their cryo-EM structures in the apo and substrate-bound states. The overall structures of human PCC and MCC holoenzymes resemble those of their bacterial homologs. This similarity aligns with the conserved functions of PCCs and MCCs across species, ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.</p>
<p>A previous study showed that PCC purified from human liver also catalyzed the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA, but the rate was only about 1.5% of that observed for propionyl-CoA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, which have highly similar structures, undergo carboxylation at analogous positions—the α carbon of the propionyl or the acetyl group. A key question is, what determines the substrate specificity of the PCC holoenzyme? The PCC-PCO and PCC-ACO structures determined in our study demonstrate that both propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA can bind to human PCC holoenzyme, with a similar binding mode (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Thus, the selectivity of PCC towards propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA is largely determined by the interactions between the acyl group and PCC. The longer acyl group in propionyl-CoA, in comparison to that in acetyl-CoA, may mediate a stronger hydrophobic interaction that stabilizes the α carbon of the acyl group at a proper position to react with the carboxylated biotin.</p>
<p>The cryo-EM structures of MCC-apo and MCC-ACO reveal that there are two distinct binding sites in the CT domains of human MCC holoenzyme for the covalently linked biotin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In the MCC-apo structure, the biotin binds to a site that is distant from the catalytic residues A447 and G448, thus referred to as the exo-site; while in the MCC-ACO structure, the biotin binds to a site that is closer to A447 and G448 and is therefore referred to as the endo-site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">fig. S10</xref>). Binding of acetyl-CoA to the acyl-CoA binding pocket of the CT domains induces conformational changes in these domains, leading to the relocation of the biotin molecule from the exo-site to the endo-site. Conformational changes in the CT domains upon CoA binding were also observed in the crystal structures of PaMCC(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). These findings indicate a coordination between biotin binding and acetyl-CoA binding for the MCC holoenzymes. It should be noted that acetyl-CoA is not a substrate for MCC. Next, we will try to determine the cryo-EM structure of human MCC in complex with its substrate MC-CoA to see whether the binding of MC-CoA to MCC has similar effects to the binding of acetyl-CoA.</p>
<p>Similarly, in an unpublished manuscript (Zhou <italic>et al</italic>., 2024), it was also observed that the covalently linked biotin in the ACC-citrate filament, which is the active form of human ACC, binds to an exo-site that is distant from the acetyl-CoA binding site in the absence of acetyl-CoA. In contrast, in the crystal structure of CoA-bound yeast ACC, the biotin occupies an endo-site that is closer to the acetyl-CoA binding site(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>).</p>
<p>In the crystal structure of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> PYC (SaPYC), two distinct binding sites for the covalently linked biotin were also observed, one is about 20 Å from the active site of the CT domain and is called the exo site, and the other is in the active site of the CT domain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our studies, combined with previous research, suggest that the presence of an exo-site and an endo-site for the binding of covalently linked biotin is a common feature shared by many BDCs. The transfer of biotin from the exo-site to the endo-site may be promoted by the coordinated binding of acyl-CoA or pyruvate to the CT domains. Conversely, relocation of biotin from the endo-site to the exo-site might facilitate the release of the products after the second step carboxylation reaction.</p>
<p>However, we did not observe the relocation of biotin to an endo-site upon acyl-CoA binding in human PCC holoenzyme (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Additionally, while we did observe relocation of biotin and conformational changes in the CT domains of human MCC holoenzyme upon binding with acetyl-CoA, similar changes were not observed with propionyl-CoA binding. Further studies focusing on capturing the structures of human PCC and MCC holoenzymes in various states during their catalytic processes would contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the underlying catalytic mechanisms.</p>

Different batches of proteins were purified for the preparation of the samples at different substrate binding states. For the substrate-free sample (the apo sample), fractions eluted within 12.5–15 mL were combined and concentrated to 2.85 mg/mL.

<p>Holey grids (Holey carbon filmed 300 mesh gold grids, R1.2/1.3, Quantifoil) were glow discharged with a medium RF power for 30 s using a plasma cleaner PDC-32G-2 (Harrick Plasma) prior use.

<p>The cryo-EM grids were transferred to a Titan Krios TEM (FEI) operating at 300 kV equipped with a K3 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan) and a GIF Quantum energy filter (Gatan). Zero-loss movie stacks were automatically collected using EPU software (FEI) with a slit width of 20 eV on the energy filter and a defocus range from −1.2 to −2.2 µm in super-resolution mode at an 81,000× nominal magnification. Each movie stack, which contained 32 frames, was exposed for 2.56 s with a total electron dose of ∼50 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>. The stacks were motion corrected using MotionCor2 with a binning factor of 2, resulting in the pixel size of 1.0773 Å(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).

<title>Data processing</title>
<p>For the apo sample, 11,481 micrographs were captured and imported to cryoSPARC for processing. Particles were automatically picked according to the templates generated from an initial 2D classification of the manually picked particles and extracted with a box size of 488 pixels for <italic>ab-initio</italic> reconstruction and heterogeneous refinement jobs, yielding the maps of PCC (11.5%) and MCC (37.6%) holoenzymes. To get the high-resolution map of PCC holoenzyme, a non-uniform refinement with the corresponding group of particles was carried out, yielding a detailed map, yet the density for one of the α subunits was lacking. To solve this problem, distinct reference volumes with (Ref-A) or without (Ref-B) the corresponding PCCα were generated by UCSF Chimera (v1.16)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). After a refinement based on multiple references, 61,567 particles were subjected to the homogenous refinement, yielding the complete map of PCC (PCC-apo) at 3.02 Å resolution. For the case of MCC holoenzyme, a round of non-uniform refinement was carried out. After that, the volume chirality was flipped, and the map was further polished by a series of refinement jobs, resulting in the map of MCC (MCC-apo) at 2.29 Å resolution.</p>
<p>For the PCO sample, 10,898 micrographs were imported for data processing. After particle picking, extraction (box size = 488 pixels), <italic>ab-initio</italic> reconstruction and heterogeneous refinement, the PCC (8.7%) and MCC (39.7%) representing volumes were further processed by non-uniform refinement, yielding the maps generated from 105,293 and 476,773 particles, respectively. The PCC map was subjected to local CTF refinement and subsequent local refinement, yielding the final map of propionyl-CoA bound PCC holoenzyme (PCC-PCO) at 2.80 Å. The MCC map was further polished by heterogenous refinement and non-uniform refinement after flipping chirality, producing the final map of propionyl-CoA bound MCC holoenzyme (MCC-PCO) at 2.36 Å.</p>
<p>For the ACO sample, 4,036 micrographs were collected and imported. Particle picking, extraction (box size = 488 pixels), initial 2D classification and particle clustering jobs were carried out accordingly. 31,622 PCC-like particles were enriched in cluster-A and subsequently subjected to <italic>ab-initio</italic> reconstruction and non-uniform refinement. After flipping the volume chirality, the refined map was further polished by another round of non-uniform refinement, yielding the 3.38 Å map of acetyl-CoA bound PCC holoenzyme (PCC-ACO). In cluster-B, 273,428 MCC-like particles were enriched. These particles were <italic>ab-initio</italic> reconstructed and classified to 4 volumes, of which one, composed of 39.9% of particles, exhibited clear secondary structure features of MCC. This map was further processed by heterogeneous refinement and non-uniform refinement jobs, yielding the final map of acetyl-CoA bound MCC holoenzyme (MCC-ACO) at 2.85 Å resolution.</p>
<p>The resolutions mentioned above were determined according to the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation 0.143 criterion and with a high-resolution noise substitution method(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). All the reconstructed maps were subjected to further model building.</p>

<p>This study presents the cryo-EM structures of two human biotin-dependent mitochondria carboxylases involved in various biological pathways, including the metabolism of certain amino acids, cholesterol, and odd chain fatty acids. The cryo-EM structures offer a <bold>valuable</bold> addition to the structural description of biotin-dependent carboxylases and provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence to support the major conclusions of this study.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Zhou et al offers new high-resolution Cryo-EM structures of two human biotin-dependent enzymes: propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) and methycrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC). While X-ray crystal structures and Cryo-EM structures have previously been reported for bacterial and trypanosomal versions of MCC and for bacterial versions of PCC, this marks one of the first high resolution Cryo-EM structures of the human version of these enzymes. Using the biotin cofactor as an affinity tag, this team purified a group of four different human biotin-dependent carboxylases from cultured human Expi 293F (kidney) cells (PCC, MCC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and pyruvate carboxylase). Following further enrichment by size-exclusion chromatography, they were able to vitrify the sample and pick enough particles of MCC and PCC to separately refine the structures of both enzymes to relatively high average resolutions (the Cryo-EM structure of ACC also appears to have been determined from these same micrographs, though this is the subject of a separate publication). To determine the impact of substrate binding on the structure of these enzymes and to gain insights into substrate selectivity, they also separately incubated with propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA and vitrified the samples under active turnover conditions, yielding a set of cryo-EM structures for both MCC and PCC in the presence and absence of substrates and substrate analogues.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript has several strengths. It is clearly written, the figures are clear and the sample preparation methods appear to be well described. This study demonstrates that Cryo-EM is an ideal structural method to investigate the structure of these heterogeneous samples of large biotin-dependent enzymes. As a consequence, many new Cryo-EM structures of biotin-dependent enzymes are emerging, thanks to the natural inclusion of a built-in biotin affinity tag. While the authors report no major differences between the human and bacterial forms of these enzymes, it remains an important finding that they demonstrate how/if the structure of the human enzymes are or are not distinct from the bacterial enzymes. The MCC structures also provide evidence for a transition for BCCP-biotin from an exo-binding site to an endo-binding site in response to acetyl-CoA binding. This contributes to a growing number of biotin-dependent carboxylase structures that reveal BCCP-biotin binding at locations both inside (endo-) and outside (exo-) of the active site.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are some minor weaknesses. Notably, there are not a lot of new insights coming from this paper. The structural comparisons between MCC and PCC have already been described in the literature and there were not a lot of significant changes (outside of the exo- to endo- transition) in the presence vs. absence of substrate analogues. There is not a great deal of depth of analysis in the discussion. For example, no new insights were gained with respect to the factors contributing to substrate selectivity (the factors contributing to selectivity for propionyl-CoA vs. acetyl-CoA in PCC). The authors state that the longer acyl group in propionyl-CoA may mediate stronger hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the alpha carbon of the acyl group at the proper position. This is not a particularly deep analysis and doesn't really require a cryo-EM structure to invoke. The authors did not take the opportunity to describe the specific interactions that may be responsible for the stronger hydrophobic interaction nor do they offer any plausible explanation for how these might account for an astounding difference in the selectivity for propionyl-CoA vs. acetyl-CoA. This suggests, perhaps, that these structures do not yet fully capture the proper conformational states. The authors also need to be careful with their over-interpretation of structure to invoke mechanisms of conformational change. A snapshot of the starting state (apo) and final state (ligand-bound) is insufficient to conclude *how* the enzyme transitioned between conformational states. I am constantly frustrated by structural reports in the biotin-dependent enzymes that invoke &quot;induced conformational changes&quot; with absolutely no experimental evidence to support such statements. Conformational changes that accompany ligand binding may occur through an induced conformational change or through conformational selection and structural snapshots of the starting point and the end point cannot offer any valid insight into which of these mechanisms is at play.</p>
<p>Some of these minor deficiencies aside, the overall aim of contributing new cryo-EM structures of the human MCC and PCC has been achieved. While I am not a cryo-EM expert, I see no flaws in the methodology or approach. While the contributions from these structures are somewhat incremental, it is nevertheless important to have these representative examples of the human enzymes and it is noteworthy to see a new example of the exo-binding site in a biotin-dependent enzyme.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper reports the structures of two human biotin-dependent carboxylases. The authors used endogenously purified proteins and solved the structures in high resolutions. Based on the structures, they defined the binding site for acyl-CoA and biotin and reported the potential conformational changes in biotin position.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors effectively utilized the biotin of the two proteins and obtained homogeneous proteins from human cells. They determined the high-resolution structures of the two enzymes in apo and substrate-bound states.</p>
<p>Comments and questions to the manuscripts:</p>
<p>(1) I'm quite impressed with the protein purification and structure determination, but I think some functional characterization of the purified proteins should be included in the manuscript. The activity of enzymes should be the foundation of all structures and other speculations based on structures.</p>
<p>(2) In Figure 1B, the structure of MCC is shown as two layers of beta units and two layers of alpha units, while there is only one layer of alpha units resolved in the density maps. I suggest the authors show the structures resolved based on the density maps and show the complete structure with the docked layer in the supplementary figure.</p>
<p>(3) In the introduction, I suggest the author provide more information about the previous studies about the structure and reaction mechanisms of BDCs, what is the knowledge gap, and what problem you will resolve with a higher resolution structure. For example, you mentioned in line 52 that G437 and A438 are catalytic residues, are these residues reported as catalytic residues or this is based on your structures? Has the catalytic mechanism been reported before? Has the role of biotin in catalytic reactions revealed in previous studies?</p>
<p>(4) In the discussion, the authors indicate that the movement of biotin could be related to the recognition of acyl-CoA in BDCs, however, they didn't observe a change in the propionyl-CoA bound MCC structure, which is contradictory to their speculation. What could be the explanation for the exception in the MCC structure?</p>
<p>(5) In the discussion, the authors indicate that the selectivity of PCC to different acyl-CoA is determined by the recognition of the acyl chain. However, there are no figures or descriptions about the recognition of the acyl chain by PCC and MCC. It will be more informative if they can show more details about substrate recognition in Figures 3 and 4.</p>
<p>(6) How are the solved structures compared with the latest Alphafold3 prediction?</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the structures of the human MCC and PCC holoenzymes are similar to their bacterial homologs. That is due to the conserved sequences and functions of MCC and PCC across different species.</p>

<p>We appreciate this comment. Unfortunately, in the cryo-EM maps of the PCC holoenzymes, the acyl groups were not resolved (fig. S6), so we were unable to analyze the specific interactions between the acyl-CoAs and PCC. We will discuss this limitation in our revised manuscript.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment. However, since we purified the endogenous BDCs and the sample we obtained was a mixture of four BDCs, the enzymatic activity of this mixture cannot accurately reflect the catalytic activity of PCC or MCC holoenzyme. We will acknowledge this limitation in the discussion section of our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 1B, the structure of MCC is shown as two layers of beta units and two layers of alpha units, while there is only one layer of alpha units resolved in the density maps. I suggest the authors show the structures resolved based on the density maps and show the complete structure with the docked layer in the supplementary figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment. We have shown the cryo-EM maps of the PCC and MCC holoenzymes in fig. S8 to indicate the unresolved regions in these structures. The BC domains in one layer of MCCα in the MCC-apo structure were not resolved. However, we think it would be better to show a complete structure in Fig. 1 to provide an overall view of the MCC holoenzyme. We will revise Fig. 1B and the figure legend to clearly point out which domains were not resolved in the cryo-EM map and were built in the structure through docking.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Point accepted. It was reported that G419 and A420 in S. coelicolor PCC, corresponding to G437 and A438 in human PCC, were the catalytic residues (PMID: 15518551). The same study also reported the catalytic mechanism of the carboxyl transfer reaction. The role of biotin in the BDC-catalyzed carboxylation reactions has been extensively studied (PMIDs: 22869039, 28683917). We will include these information in the introduction section of our revised manuscript.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment. We do not have a good explanation for why we did not observe a change in the propionyl-CoA bound MCC structure. It is noteworthy that neither acetyl-CoA nor propionyl-CoA is the natural substrate of MCC. Recently, a cryo-EM structure of the human MCC holoenzyme in complex with its natural substrate, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA, has been resolved (PDB code: 8J4Z). In this structure, the binding site of biotin and the conformation of the CT domain closely resemble that in our acetyl-CoA-bound MCC structure. Therefore, the movement of biotin induced by acetyl-CoA binding mimics that induced by the binding of MCC's natural substrate, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA, indicating that in comparison with propionylCoA, acetyl-CoA is closer to 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA regarding its ability to bind to MCC. We will discuss this possibility in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the discussion, the authors indicate that the selectivity of PCC to different acyl-CoA is determined by the recognition of the acyl chain. However, there are no figures or descriptions about the recognition of the acyl chain by PCC and MCC.

<p>How are the solved structures compared with the latest Alphafold3 prediction?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since AlphaFold3 was not released when our manuscript was submitted, we did not compare the solved structures with the AlphaFold3 predictions. We have now carried out the predictions using Alphafold3. Due to the token limitation of the AlphaFold3 server, we can only include two α and six β subunits of human PCC or MCC in the prediction. The overall assembly patterns of the Alphafold3-predicted structures are similar to that of the cryo-EM structures. The RMSDs between PCCα, PCCβ, MCCα, and MCCβ in the apo cryo-EM structures and those in the AlphaFold3-predicted structures are 7.490 Å, 0.857 Å, 7.869 Å, and 1.845 Å, respectively. The PCCα and MCCα subunits adopt an open conformation in the cryo-EM structures but adopt a closed conformation in the AlphaFold-3 predicted structures, resulting in large RMSDs.</p>
