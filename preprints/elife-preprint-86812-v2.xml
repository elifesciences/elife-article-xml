<title>Abstract</title><p>Human fetal development has been associated with brain health at later stages. It is unknown whether growth in utero, as indexed by birth weight (BW), relates consistently to lifespan brain characteristics and changes, and to what extent these influences are of a genetic or environmental nature. Here we show remarkably stable and life-long positive associations between BW and cortical surface area and volume across and within developmental, aging and lifespan longitudinal samples (N = 5794, 4-82 years of age, w/ 386 monozygotic twins, followed for up to 8.3 years w/12,088 brain MRIs). In contrast, no consistent effect of BW on brain changes was observed. Partly environmental effects were indicated by analysis of twin BW discordance. In conclusion, the influence of prenatal growth on cortical topography is stable and reliable through the lifespan. This early life factor appears to influence the brain by association of brain reserve, rather than brain maintenance. Thus, fetal influences appear omnipresent in the spacetime of the human brain throughout the human lifespan. Optimizing fetal growth may increase brain reserve for life, also in aging.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is established that a substantial portion of functional variation through the lifespan, including in older age, is of neurodevelopmental origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Evidence converges on early life factors being important for normal individual differences in brain, mental health and cognition across the lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, as well as risk of psychiatric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and neurodegenerative disease in older age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Obtaining reliable indicators of individual early life factors is a major challenge. In this regard, birth weight (BW) stands out as a solid available measure. BW reflects fetal and maternal genetic, but also other in utero environmental factors affecting fetal growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, including brain growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. By now, a series of studies have established that BW relates positively to mental health, cognitive function and brain characteristics, including neuroanatomical volumes and cortical surface area as measured in different age groups <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, it is unknown whether and how BW relates to brain characteristics through the lifespan, how consistent effects are within and across samples, whether BW is associated with lifespan brain changes, and to what extent lifespan effects of BW on the brain are of an environmental, rather than genetic nature. These questions, which are critical to understand how and when the human brain can be influenced through the lifespan, we address in the present study. On an overarching level, this study also addresses current debates in the field of lifespan cognitive neuroscience, namely: 1) whether consistent, reproducible relationships between phenotypes relevant for mental health and function and inter-individual differences in brain characteristics can be found <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, and 2) to what extent effects found in and ascribed to brain aging may actually reflect early life influences, rather than longitudinal changes in older age <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>There are at least two different ways by which the effects of fetal growth, as indexed by birth weight, could work to produce the brain effects so far observed. 1) In line with a brain reserve model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, higher birth weight could be associated with greater brain growth before birth. This seems likely, given that the effects are seen also in young populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. However, from the so far largely cross-sectional, or mixed models, several questions remain unanswered: Is this a fixed effect at the time of birth? Does higher birth weight also have carry-over effects to greater development in childhood and adolescence? In line with a brain maintenance model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, is higher birth weight associated with better maintenance of brain volumes in the face of age-related changes in older adulthood? While effects are found in young populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, reduced atrophy in aging is a possible additional effect of higher BW that should be investigated, given the known relationships between birth size and brain volumes also in older age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The possible effects of BW on later brain development and brain maintenance in adulthood can only be investigated by longitudinal brain imaging spanning all stages of human life. Furthermore, as BW normally reflects both genetic and prenatal environmental factors, and an environmental BW contribution to brain differences has been shown in young monozygotic (MZ) twins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, we need to study brain effects of birth weight discordance in MZ twins in this context to disentangle possible non-genetic contributions of BW through the lifespan.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that there are persistent effects of BW on brain characteristics through the lifespan, and hence, that these would be consistent within and across samples of varying age and origin. We test this in a Norwegian sample covering the lifespan (LCBC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, the US developmental sample ABCD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, and the older adult UK biobank (UKB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> sample. The associations of BW and cortical surface, thickness, volume and their change were investigated vertex-wise in a total of 5794 persons (of whom 5718 with repeated scans, and 386 monozygotic twins) with 12088 longitudinal observations, 4-82 years of age at baseline, followed for up to ∼ 8.3 years. Based on previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, we hypothesized such effects to be driven primarily by positive associations between birth weight and cortical area, with lesser, if any, effects on cortical thickness. We expected positive effects on cortical volume corresponding to positive effects on cortical area. We hypothesized that effects would be stable, so that BW mainly affects the brain “intercept” and does not relate much to brain changes. That is, we hypothesize a threshold model, whereby higher BW yields greater cortical area, and hence cortical volume, to begin with, rather than a maintenance model, whereby higher BW serves to protect against atrophy in aging. Moreover, we hypothesized that effects could not be explained solely by genetics, so that birth weight discordance in a subsample of MZ twins would also result in differences in brain characteristics through the lifespan.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Cortical surfaces were reconstructed from T1-weighted anatomical MRIs by use of FreeSurfer v6.0 (LCBC and UKB), and 7.1. (ABCD) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, yielding maps of cortical area, thickness and volume. Vertex-wise analyses were run with spatiotemporal linear mixed effects modeling (FreeSurfer v6.0.0 ST-MLE package), to assess regional variation in the relationships between birth weight and cortical structure and its change. All analyses were run with baseline age, sex, scanner site, and time (scan interval) as covariates. For ABCD specifically, ethnicity was also included as a covariate. For consistency of multiple comparison corrections across analyses, the results were thresholded at a cluster-forming threshold of 2.0, p &lt; .01, with a cluster-wise probability of p &lt; .0.25 (p &lt;.05/2 hemispheres).</p>

<title>The lifespan relationship of BW and cortical volume, surface area and thickness</title>
<p>Associations of birth weight and cortical characteristics are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> (for the right hemisphere, and in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> for both hemispheres). Across all cohorts, widespread positive associations were observed between BW and cortical area. These were highly consistent across lifespan (LCBC), developmental (ABCD) and aging (UKB) cohorts, and there were bilateral overlapping effects across most of the cortical mantle. As expected, BW had in general lesser effects on cortical thickness, and no significant effects on thickness were observed in the UKB. There were however some lateral positive and medial negative effects in the LCBC and ABCD cohorts. We note that corresponding effects with increased medial frontal and occipital cortical thickness have been found associated with white matter alterations (reduced FA) in young adults born preterm with very low BW compared to term-born controls <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. BW was significantly positively associated with cortical volume across much of the cortical mantle. In sum, broad, bilateral, positive associations were observed across cohorts for cortical area and volume.</p>

</fig>
<p>Additionally controlling for education level had little effect on results (see <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Information on gestational length (i.e. whether there was premature birth) was not available for all participants. Importantly, this information was lacking for the older participants, i.e. this information is not available for UKB, and since this information for the LCBC was drawn from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN), only established in 1967, this was not available for the older part of the LCBC sample either. The majority of the LCBC sample and the ABCD sample, had information on gestational length, however (LCBC: n = 514; gestational length in weeks: M = 40.0 weeks, SD = 1.9, range = 25-44; ABCD: n = 3306; weeks premature: M = 1.0 weeks premature, SD = 2.1, range = 0.0-13.0). Controlling for gestational age in these subsamples had relatively little effect on results (see <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). However, as expected with reduced power in the LCBC sample, the effects in this analysis were somewhat narrower. Effects in ABCD, where almost all participants were retained for analysis, showed no sign of decrease with control for gestational length. When restricting all samples to participants with BW between 2.5 and 5.0 kg, results were also very similar (see <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). As expected from the widespread effects on cortical area and volume, effects were partly generic, with analyses controlling for ICV showing more restricted effects (see <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). However, consistent significant positive effects of BW on cortical area also when controlling for ICV were observed across all three cohorts in lateral temporal and frontal areas (see <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Birth weight effects on cortical change</title>
<p>To test the effect of birth weight on cortical change we reran the analyses with BW x time and age x time interactions. Note BW x time (i.e., within-subject follow-up time) represents the contrasts of interest while age – and age interactions – are used to account for differences in age across individuals. Significant BW x time interactions on cortical characteristics were observed in restricted and non-overlapping regions across samples, see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> (depicting right hemisphere results, for visualization of effects in both hemispheres, see <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Per direction of effect, the effect of BW differences was apparently reduced over time for area in LCBC and ABCD, whereas no interaction effects on area were significant in UKB. A mixture of positive (ABCD) and negative (LCBC, UKB) interaction effects were significant for thickness and volume.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="514196v3_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Visualization of the interaction effects as seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>, by splitting the sample in two based on BW, did not yield convincing evidence for these interactions, as shown in Supplementary Figures 7-9. In plots of LCBC data, where number of follow-ups varied, and a select portion had longer follow-up, it appeared that the effect of BW was reduced over time in these restricted regions. However, virtually parallel trajectories for the ABCD and UKB subsamples with lower and higher BW, suggested the effect size even within the areas of significant interactions of BW and time was negligible. Since UKB and ABCD samples here consisted of samples having two time points only, whereas LCBC consisted of a mix of number of follow-ups over a longer time period, there might be sample-specific selection effects also regarding other characteristics than BW that can influence these effects in LCBC. For instance, participants who do not drop out tend to have better health, cognitive ability and education, which again may relate positively to the brain measures studied here <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Thus, caution is advised in interpreting effects seen only with longer follow-up in the LCBC sample.</p>
<p>Both birth weight effects on cortical characteristics and cortical change were rerun (ROI-wise) using spline models that accounted for possible non-linear effects of age on cortical structure. The results were comparable to those reported above in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.

<title>Consistency of spatial relationships across and within samples</title>
<p>Next, we assessed whether the cortical correlates of BW (βeta-maps) showed a similar topographic pattern across the three independent datasets (UKB, ABCD and LCBC). The results showed that all the spatial comparisons were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05, FDR-corrected). That is, the topography of the effects of BW on cortical structure was comparable across datasets – the pairwise spatial correlation of a given cortical correlate of BW (e.g. BW effects on cortical area) was similar when estimated from two different datasets. The spatial correlations were highest for the volume measures (r = .64 -.79), and overall also high (r = .51-.71) for area measures, whereas for cortical thickness, they were more moderate (r = .24 -.45).</p>

<p>In contrast, the spatial correlation of the maps capturing BW-associated cortical <italic>change</italic> (i.e., BW x time contrast) were either unrelated (n = 7) or showed negative associations between cohorts (n = 2). The spatial correlations of birth weight on cortical change were r = -35- xs-.05 for area, r = -.35 -.08 for volume, and r = -.20, - - .04 for thickness.

<p>In sum, the spatial correlation analyses imply that the different datasets show a comparable topography of BW effects across the cortical mantle – i.e. the areas more and less affected by BW were common across datasets. Thus, the BW effects on cortical structure are robust and replicable across very different datasets. In contrast, the effects of BW on cortical change are not robust across datasets, showing dissimilar topographies.</p>
<p>Additionally, we performed replicability analyses both across and within samples to further investigate the robustness of the effects of birth weight on cortical characteristics and cortical change. Split-half analyses within datasets were performed, to investigate the replicability of significant effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> of BW on cortical characteristics within samples (refer to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). These analyses further confirmed that the significant effects were largely replicable for volume and area, but not for thickness (see <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>). Split-half analyses of BW on cortical change (refer to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) showed, in general, a very low degree of replicability on the three different cortical measures. See <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 3</xref>. Replicability across datasets showed a similar pattern, that is, replicability was high for the effect of brain weight on cortical characteristics but very low for the effects of cortical change. See <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 4</xref> for stats. See Supplementary statistical methods for a full description of the analyses.

<title>Effects of BW discordance on brain characteristics and changes in monozygotic twins</title>
<p>BW discordance analyses on twins specifically were run as described for the main analyses above, with the exception that twin scans were reconstructed using FS v6.0.1. for ABCD and the addition of the twin’s mean birth weight as a covariate. BW discordance was associated with cortical area, where the heavier twins had greater area in some frontal, temporal and occipitotemporal regions, with effects in the right hemisphere only surviving corrections for multiple comparisons. We note that these regions mostly overlap with regions where positive effects of BW were also seen in the bigger sample. Strikingly, the effect of BW discordance, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, appeared similar in size to the effect of BW itself in the MZ twin sample. However, note that this plot is merely for illustrating effects, the effect size is inflated for the BW discordance plot, since the values are derived from areas already identified as significantly related to BW. There was no association of BW discordance and cortical area changes over time.</p>

<p>BW discordance also had a significant negative effect on cortical thickness in restricted right frontotemporal regions, where being the lighter twin yielded greater thickness.

BW had little effect on cortical thickness in the significant region, and the effect of BW discordance in the identified regions, as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, appeared greater than the effect of BW itself here in the MZ twin sample.

<p>In a very small area of the right hemisphere, there was a significant association of BW discordance and cortical thickness change, meaning the lighter twin had greater cortical thickness over time, but this effect was both regionally and quantitatively minor, as shown in <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>. There were no significant effects of BW discordance on cortical volume or volume change over time.</p>
<p>Finally, to formally assess whether the cortical correlates (βeta-maps) of BW discordance in the twin subsample corresponded to cortical correlates of BW in the bigger samples, we did a meta-analysis of these estimates for area, thickness and volume in the UKB, ABCD and LCBC, and then assessed whether the cortical correlates of BW and BW discordance (βeta-maps) showed a similar topographic pattern across the datasets. The results of this meta-analysis-twin comparison showed only positive relationships, for area, r = .23, thickness r= .19, and volume r =.22. However, the respective uncorrected p-values were .08, .12, and .04, so the spatial comparisons would not be statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05, FDR-corrected). However, the positive correlations are suggestive that the topography of the effects of BW discordance in genetically identical twins on cortical structure was to some extent comparable to effects of individual differences in BW in the bigger sample.</p>

<title>Effects of BW differences relative to other estimated effects in aging</title>
<p>We calculated the effect of 1 SD difference in BW (on average 600 g, see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) on cortical and brain volume across cohorts, to illustrate what variance is captured here by the early life effects, relative to the estimates of later aging changes. The effect of 1SD lower BW on cortical volume was 6708 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, 8466 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, and 5980 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> in LCBC, UKB and ABCD, respectively. This was equal to 1.2%, 1.6% and 1.1% lesser cortex with 600-700 grams lower BW for each sample, respectively. In the context of brain aging, this would be a substantial effect, higher than most risk/protective factors for dementia outlined by the Lancet Commission on dementia prevention <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> which include smoking, education, obesity, and alcohol amongst others (see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> for a summary of the different effect sizes). The estimated yearly cortical volume reduction from 50 to 60 years is 895 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> in the LCBC and 1402 mm3 in the UKB samples, respectively. Hence, the effect of 600 grams difference in BW could, if only cross-sectional data were available, be quantitatively equal to that of 7.5 and 6 years of estimated age differences in LCBC and UKB, respectively. Many factors that influence cortical volume have nothing to do with either age or differences in general brain function, including e.g. sex, so this analogy we only include to illustrate what might happen if such variance were to be ascribed to age, e.g. as in modeling “brain-age”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, see further discussion below.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present results indicate that BW, the earliest widely and easily obtainable congenital metric, show robust, persistent, and chiefly stable associations with brain characteristics through life. Especially, BW was associated with cortical area and volume in an age and time-invariant fashion. The robustness of this effect is quite remarkable, given the wealth of different influences individuals meet after birth, which are repeatedly assumed and reported to have major impact on the brain through the protracted human lifespan <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. It is also in quantitative terms outstanding, compared to consistency of cortical topographies reported for other phenotypical factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. This is also special for a phenotype known to be environmentally influenced, unlike biologically hardcoded phenotypes such as sex or age, for which there are known brain-wide association studies (BWAS) patterns <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Typically, other factors relating to later socioeconomic status, lifestyle, and health, get the most attention in adult and aging brain research <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Such factors, which are then targeted for prevention and intervention at different stages of the life-course, often do not show consistent relationships to brain characteristics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, may not actually be causal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, and may themselves be related to prenatal growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Another phenotype which obviously, like BW, reflects both genetic and environmental influences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, is body mass index (BMI) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Consistent BWAS patterns have been reported for BMI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. BW stands out as the single chronological earliest phenotype, and besides BMI, BW appears to have the most replicable and consistent relations to cortical morphology, as shown here both across and within samples. It has been claimed that smaller than expected brain–phenotype associations and variability across population subsamples can explain widespread replication failures for brain-wide association studies (BWAS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, this is necessarily a question of which phenotypes are the most relevant to relate to brain characteristics. Also, the temporal order of factors needs to be considered if causal interpretations are to be made. Chronologically later factors necessarily do not cause earlier ones. While we cannot claim that BW itself causes the cortical characteristics observed in aging, the cortical variance explained by BW after one decade, and seven or eight decades of life alike, is unlikely to be explained by influences only present at some point in adulthood or aging. BW, as further discussed below, depends on genetic, as well as prenatal environmental influences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, which likely have causal effects on early brain morphological features. Here we find that these effects are substantial also in the aging brain.</p>
<p>We calculated that a BW difference of one SD (about 600 g) equaled a difference in cortical volume on the order of 1.1-1.6 percent in these cohorts. This is a quite big effect, of a magnitude relevant for explaining a substantial portion of the differences typically seen between patients with neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases and healthy controls. As noted, BW differences have been reported for neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, and also other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia or more general psychopathology, with the cortical effects detected not invariably being very large in absolute terms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. There is a limit to the range of variation that can apply to human cortical volumes, in general, (e.g. virtually none have cortical volumes below 0.45 or above 0.65 l). In terms of sample representativity, one may assume that there can be a restriction relative to the actual range of human cortical volume variation, as the present samples specifically are largely healthy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Much of the differences within this limited range of variation are explained by factors we controlled for, such as age and sex. With the present effect, on the restricted range of variation, combined with big samples, it is obvious that BW differences of much less than our example magnitude (600 g) may be detectable in the cortical morphology of patients versus controls. In the context of aging and neurodegenerative change, the estimated cortical effect of ≈600 g difference in BW is of a magnitude many times the annual cortical reduction estimated to take place from e.g. 50 to 60 years in the adult cohorts. This is a substantial effect in brain imaging and may illuminate why metrics such as “brain age”, assumed to index aging-related processes, may rather largely capture variance already determined at birth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Neglecting this especially consistent and early factor is likely to lead to a substantial portion of human brain variance being either erroneously ascribed to factors only present at later life stages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> or left unaccounted for.</p>
<p>The solidity, replicability, and universality of effects as shown here for a partly environmentally influenced metric <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, appear exceptional in human brain imaging. The within-sample replicability results are not fully comparable to other studies assessing the replicability of brain-phenotype associations due to analytical differences (e.g. sample size, multiple-comparison correction method) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Still, these results too clearly show that the rate of replicability of BW associations with cortical area and volume are comparable to benchmark brain-phenotype associations such as age and BMI with brain structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. The BW-cortical volume and area associations may be among the topographically broadest and most consistent effects so far seen as stable across the lifespan of the human brain. The three cohorts studies differ on a range features known to be highly and reliably related to cortical characteristics, first and foremost age <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, but also country of origin and representativity of the populations from which they are drawn <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Yet there is a comparable topography of BW effects across the samples. This is so despite the samples collectively spanning the entire human age range, within which there are always substantial age-related changes in cortical structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. The present results thus indicate that fetal growth influences an offset of brain reserve <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and that this brain reserve effect is persistent and stable through the lifespan.</p>
<p>In contrast, the cortical maps capturing <italic>change</italic> in cortical structure associated with BW were not robust across datasets; i.e. the most positive and negative association with BW on cortical change did not overlap at all between the different cohorts. While there was evidence from ABCD that BW affected regional cortical development in the narrow age range covered, there were limited and no consistent effects of BW on cortical change across cohorts. Importantly, there was no indication whatsoever that BW could be associated with better brain maintenance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> in the face of age-related changes in older adulthood. Thus, the data seem to indicate that any effect of BW on cortical <italic>change</italic> may be of relatively more temporary nature. The “offset effect” of BW, on the other hand, appears persistent and consistent, especially in terms of stable and widespread effects on cortical area and volume across the lifespan.</p>
<p>The sensitivity analyses indicate that the associations between BW and cortical characteristics are seen irrespective of not only sex and age, but also education, head size (ICV), and cases of abnormal BW. Such patterns could point to an underlying genetic pleiotropy of BW and brain characteristics. Interestingly, however, recent findings indicate that effects of exposure to environmental adversity on epigenetic programing in aging may be localized to the in-utero period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. The effects of BW discordance in MZ twins in this context, align with other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> pointing to also non-genetic, that is environmental, influences in the womb, associated with the pattern observed for cortical area effects. These analyses also account for multiple possibly confounding variables that could represent a mix of genetic-environmental effects, such as parental socioeconomic status, parity, or prenatal exposures shared between twins in the same womb such as maternal smoking or use of alcohol.</p>
<p>The neural basis for the observed association cannot readily be ascertained from human imaging studies tracking change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. While the “fetal origins hypothesis”, proposing that cardiovascular disease in adulthood is related to undernourishment in utero<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> is well-known, there has been focus on “brain-sparing” adaptations under such conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, our finding that early human development in utero appears to be associated with a persistent and stable brain reserve effect, is largely in correspondence with what is known of human nervous system development and change through the lifespan: While synaptogenesis, synaptic remodeling and myelination are known to be protracted processes long after infancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, numerous processes in brain development appear to be exclusively, or almost exclusively happening before birth. For instance, neurogenesis takes place almost only in fetal development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Even if controversies remain, evidence suggests that any adult human neurogenesis must be severely restricted in location and amount<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Thus, human beings appear to be born with almost all cortical neurons they will have through life, and neuronal migration and differentiation are also defined early, by the place and time the neuron is born during fetal life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Factors that affect placental function and uterine and/or umbilical blood flow on a chronic basis may lead to restricted fetal growth, including brain growth, and given the timing of brain development, it may not be surprising that effects would be stable across years. Animal studies of chronic placental insufficiency have shown effects on brain development which persist with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Hence, the relationship between BW and cortical characteristics in the normal population could likely have a twofold etiology: it is likely to in part be based on normal variation in genetically determined body and brain size, but it also may be based on variations in environmental prenatal conditions, yielding differences in optimality of early brain development persisting through the lifespan.</p>
<p>These results indicate that there is potential to increase brain reserve throughout the lifespan, also in aging, by combating factors affecting fetal growth negatively. While it is unknown to what extent results from these specific US and European samples can be generalized to other populations, the current potential to improve prenatal factors may be especially high in low and middle-income countries, where the demographic changes will also be more marked in terms of the aging population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. About 200 million children in developing countries are not meeting their growth potential, and improving the prenatal environment is likely important to help children reach their full potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> – and ultimately also to help them stay above a functional threshold into older age. Also in industrialized countries, including the US, environmental factors are associated with birth weight. The opioid epidemic is increasingly affecting pregnant women, and in-utero opioid exposure is associated with higher risk of fetal growth restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Among highly common exposures, air pollution may for instance be of relevance. Recently, local traffic congestion-pollution exposure during pregnancy, independently of a series of maternal sociodemographic characteristics, was associated with reductions in term BW in a large US sample<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Programs and policies to limit such environmental factors reducing fetal growth may thus enhance brain reserve and ultimately prevent more people from falling below a functional threshold even in advanced age.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Some limitations should be noted. First, for most of the participants, only self-reported or parent-reported BW was available. While there was a very high correlation between registry and self-reported BW in LCBC, this is a possible source of noise. Second, pregnancy-related information of possible relevance, such as gestational age at birth, complications, method of delivery, maternal disorders, smoking, alcohol and drug intake, was not available across all participants of the different samples, and was thus not analyzed here, or, as for gestational age at birth, could only in part be controlled for. Some of these factors may be systematically related to BW, and may thus represent confounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. There were some premature, and very low BW participants in the samples, and these conditions are associated with known reductions in cortical volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. However, the analyses controlling for gestational age, as well as on the restricted range of BW – excluding very preterm and very/extremely low BW children – and the analysis controlling for education, which may again relate to some of these factors, showed very similar results. It is unknown to what extent the BW of participants reflect their individual fetal growth potential, as a fetus with normal BW can be growth restricted and a fetus with low BW can have appropriate growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. We believe, however, that possible differences in such factors would likely serve to decrease consistency of results, and not lead to inflated estimates of consistency.</p>
<p>Finally, it is beyond the scope of the present study to relate BW and cortical characteristics through the lifespan with cognitive functional differences. While all the cohorts included here also have some measures of cognitive function, they vary across samples. Furthermore, tests of cognitive function are, relative to brain imaging metrics, much more prone to test-specific test-retest effects. Thus, assessing the stability of effects across cohorts would be challenging. We note that, e.g. in twins, even though there are data to suggest a relationship between BW differences and neuroanatomical features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, and BW differences and differences in cognitive function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>, twins discordant for BW and neuroanatomical features may not show significant differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. There are many factors that influence cortical volume that have nothing to do with either age or differences in general brain function, including e.g. sex or overall differences in height. We cannot from the present data draw conclusions about effects on individual differences in cognitive function or its change across the lifespan. Indeed, part of birth weight effects on brain structure can be explained by overall somatic growth. This study does not provide one specific mechanism by which BW is associated with brain structure. Indeed variance explained by different mechanisms may vary across samples. Further studies are needed to illuminate such questions, the present study is primarily designed to answer the question of whether associations of BW and cortical structure are consistently found throughout the lifespan.</p>

<p>The current results show that a simple congenital marker of early developmental growth, BW, is consistently associated with lifespan brain characteristics. While some significant effects of BW on cortical change patterns were also observed, these were regionally smaller and showed no consistency across cohorts. In conclusion, while greater early human developmental growth does not appear to promote brain maintenance in aging, it does, in terms of greater cortical volume and area, relate positively to brain reserve through the lifespan. Thus, there appears to be an omnipresence of fetal factors in the spacetime of the human brain through the lifespan. This indicates a potential to increase brain reserve at all ages, including in aging, by combating factors affecting fetal growth negatively. Given the exceptional consistency and broadness of this cortical topographical effect, it should be taken into account in studies of brain research on individual differences, whether the brains studied are those of eight- or eighty-year-olds.</p>

<title>Samples</title>
<p>In total, longitudinal data for 5718 persons with 12088 MRI scans from the LCBC, ABCD and UKB studies were included in the analyses. For UKB the dataset released February 2020 was used. For ABCD, the Data Release 3.0 was used (s<underline>ee</underline> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.15154/1528313">http://dx.doi.org/10.15154/1528313</ext-link> for this NDA study). Only persons with longitudinal MRI scans were included in the main analyses, to limit the possibility that estimates of change were biased by immediate sample selection effects (i.e. those that remain for follow-up are known to have other characteristics than those who have only one time-point assessment in longitudinal studies, and this can bias effects). However, for the separate MZ twin-analyses, we also included participants with only one time-point MRI, to obtain an age-varying sample for assessment of whether non-genetic effects were found throughout the lifespan, including in adulthood and older age. Of the 386 MZ twins included, 310 had longitudinal imaging data. The twins were mostly (n = 310) from the developmental ABCD sample (age 10-11), whereas 64 adults were from LCBC (age 18-79 years), and 12 were from UKB (age 50-80 years). All samples consisted of community-dwelling participants. For the most part, these were recruited by means of some type of population registry information (see Supplementary Materials, SM), but part of the LCBC cohort consisted of convenience samples, i.e. the studies were advertised broadly. Part of the LCBC sample was recruited through the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, and the Norwegian Twin Registry (NTR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Thus, this study includes data from MoBa and NTR, and both studies are conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. LCBC participants were part of observational studies, but subsamples were part of studies including cognitive training (n = 168). As BW was not a criterion for assigning participants to cognitive training, these were included here. For the majority of participants, and all in UKB and ABCD, BW was collected as self-report or, for children, parent report, at the time of scan. For LCBC, BW was for the majority (n = 526 collected from the Medical Birth Registry (MBRN), available for those recruited through MoBa, or NTR, or if collected by consent for participants born 1967 and later, and in part by self-report in connection with scanning, or earlier self-report to the Norwegian Twin Registry (for twins recruited through this registry). MBRN is a national health registry containing information about all births in Norway. Comparative analyses in the LCBC sample for 354 persons who had available both MBRN records and self-report/parent-report of BW, showed a very high correlation of BW as obtained from the different sources (r =.99). A high reliability of self-reported BW over time has also been found in broader NTR samples <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> Demographics of the samples in the main analyses are given in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, see SM for details.</p>

<title>Cortical Vertex-wise Analyses</title>
<p>Reconstructed cortical surfaces were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 15 mm full-width at half-maximum. We ran vertex-wise analyses to assess regional variation in the relationships between birth weight and cortical structure; area, thickness and volume at baseline and longitudinally. In all models we included 1) baseline age, sex and scanner site, as well as time (scan interval) as covariates. For ABCD specifically, ethnicity was also included as a covariate, as this sample is recruited to have and has, ethnic variation (see Supplemental Methods for details), whereas the other samples entered in the present analyses had little ethnic variation (i.e. in UKB, &gt;98% of participants included in the present sample defined themselves as British/Irish/Any other white background. In LCBC, this information was unfortunately not encoded for all, but the sample was mainly of white background). In further models, we additionally included education as a covariate. General linear models were run in turn using as predictors: birth weight, the interaction term birthweight x scan interval, and the interaction term of baseline age x time (scan interval) x birth weight. When analyses were run with baseline age x scan interval x birth weight as predictor, the interaction terms of baseline age x scan interval, scan interval x birth weight, and birth weight x baseline age were included as additional covariates. Standardized values were used in analyses for age, scan interval, BW, BW discordance, and education. For consistency of multiple comparison corrections across analyses, the results were thresholded at a cluster-forming threshold of 2.0, p &lt; .01, with a cluster-wise probability of p &lt; .0.25 (p &lt;.05/2 hemispheres). Finally, models were rerun only including participants with birth weights between 2.5 and 5.0 kg, to assess whether relationships were upheld also when excluding low and high birthweights. Given previous findings of broad effects of BW on cortical area and volume <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, we did not expect effects to be localized. Rather, we expected BW to affect gross head and brain size irrespective of sex, but we also performed supplementary analyses controlling for intracranial volume (ICV) in order to check for possible specificity of effects. Spatial correlation analyses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> were run on the cortical maps (for more information see SI) for analyses results using BW as predictor, from LCBC, ABCD, and UKB, to assess the overlap of BW-cortical characteristics associations in terms of topography and effect sizes. In a separate set of analyses, we restricted the sample to only monozygotic twins, and studied effects of BW discordance (number of grams BW above or below MZ twin). In these models, we included time, baseline age, sex and site as covariates.</p>

<title>Population, Recruitment and General Description of Study/ Procedures</title>
<p>Cognitively healthy, community dwelling participants across the lifespan were drawn from studies coordinated by the Research Group for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition (LCBC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oslobrains.no">www.oslobrains.no</ext-link>), approved by a Norwegian Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK South-East). Written informed consent was obtained from all adult participants and from parents or other legal guardians for participants below age of majority. The samples were recruited in part by newspaper and web page adds, and in part by population registry-based research studies. Part of the developmental sample was recruited through the population registry-based study MoBa, the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study at The Norwegian Institute of Public Health <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fhi.no/en/studies/moba/">https://www.fhi.no/en/studies/moba/</ext-link> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. The Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) is a population-based pregnancy cohort study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Participants were recruited from all over Norway from 1999-2008. The establishment of MoBa and initial data collection was based on a license from the Norwegian Data Protection Agency and approval from The Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics. The MoBa cohort is currently regulated by the Norwegian Health Registry Act. The current study was approved by The Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK sør-øst C 2010/2359). Part of the adult sample was recruited through the Norwegian Twin Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fhi.no/en/more/health-studies/norwegian-twin-registry/">https://www.fhi.no/en/more/health-studies/norwegian-twin-registry/</ext-link> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. The current NTR sub-study was approved by The Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK South-East C 2018/94). Both MoBa and NTR are linked to The Medical Birth Registry (MBRN), which is a national health registry containing information about all births in Norway. By individual consent, information on BW was also obtained from the MBRN also for some LCBC participants not being part of MoBa or NTR. Approval for these studies was given by The Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK Sør-Øst B 2017/653). Most participants, including all children, were recruited for observational studies, while some adults were recruited to enter into cognitive training studies after baseline assessment.</p>

<title>Variables Used for Birth weight and Education</title>
<p>When possible, by participant consent, birth weight was obtained from the records of the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN, for participants born 1967 when the Registry was started, or after). MBRN records of birth weight was obtained for at total 526 of the participants. For 15 participants, birth weight records based on historical self-report to the Norwegian Twin Registry were obtained. Otherwise, self-report, or for children, parental report, of birth weight in connection with participation in the MRI scanning studies were used. For analyses controlling for gestational length, only information from the MBRN was used. For education, if multiple values were reported across timepoints, the highest was chosen. Education was recorded as total years of education to the highest obtained degree, for adults, and for participants &lt; 20 years of age, average of parental education was used. However, for some participants in the age range up to 21.3 years at baseline scan, parental education was used, if no report of own education existed. Age was recorded in years and months at the time of the baseline MRI scan.</p>

<title>Assessment of consistency of effects across and within samples</title>
<p>We assessed the spatial relationship between birth weight cortical correlates (βeta-maps) for cortical area, volume, and thickness across the different datasets (LCBC, UKB, ABCD) using Pearson’s correlations. Permutation-based significance testing (n = 10.000, p &lt; 0.05, two-tailed, FDR-corrected) was performed using non-parametric spatial permutation models, i.e. spin tests as implemented by <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. Briefly, spin-tests generate spatially-constrained null distributions by applying random rotations to spherical projections of the brain. For each permutation, the original values at each coordinate are replaced with those of the closest rotated coordinate. Rotations are generated in one hemisphere and mirrored in the other.</p>
<p>Within-sample replicability was assessed in two different ways, an exploratory and a confirmatory analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In the exploratory analysis, we assessed within-sample replicability by conducting the same vertex-wise cortical analysis in different subsamples. For each dataset and cortical measure, we assessed the effects of birth weight on cortical structure and cortical change |N| = 500 times using 50% of the original sample (participants’ split half). Beyond sample selection, all parameters remained identical as described in the <italic>main</italic> analysis (refer to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Replicability – of a given vertex – was determined by the proportion of multiple comparison-corrected results across the different subsamples. In the confirmatory analysis, we assessed the proportion of significant vertices obtained in each <italic>exploratory</italic> (train) analysis that was also deemed significant – and in the same direction – in the remaining (test; 50%) subsample (p &lt; 0.05 uncorrected). Subsamples without significant results were not considered (no results only in cortical thickness analyses). This is a criterion often followed for determining replicability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Replicability analyses were performed on <italic>fsaverage4</italic> for computational reasons. Across samples replicability was performed as described in the within-sample replicability analysis (i.e., we assessed the exploratory and confirmatory replicability) except that split-half was not performed - the three datasets were compared with each other - and the analyses were performed in the original <italic>fsaverage</italic> space.</p>

<p>The degree of within-sample replicability was high for both area and volume but not for cortical thickness (see <bold><xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 11</xref></bold>) in the three datasets (LCBC, ABCD, and UKB). For area and volume, some vertices were fully replicable, i.e., significant results were found in this vertex regardless of sample variability. <italic>Exploratory</italic> replicability [median (interquartile range); LCBC, ABCD, UKB] was .46 (.56), .85 (.47), .89 (.43) for area, .36 (.47), .50 (.65), .79 (.68) for volume, and .008 (.04), .00 (.00), .002 (.02) for thickness. <italic>Exploratory</italic> replicability indexes for each voxel the proportion of significant results found using different |N| = 500 subsamples. The confirmatory replicability analyses also showed good replicability for area and volume but not for cortical thickness. Confirmatory replicability indexes the proportion of voxels (per analysis) that was significant both in the exploratory subsample (p &lt; 0.01, FWE-corrected) and in the test subsample (p &lt; 0.05). The proportion of vertices that were significant both in the <italic>exploratory</italic> and <italic>test</italic> subsamples was .74 (.17), .91 (.08), .93 (.08) for area, .68 (.19), .84 (.12), .92 (.09) for volume, and .28 (.28), .00 (.00), .58 (.18) for thickness.</p>
<p>The <italic>exploratory</italic> replicability of birth weight on cortical change was negligible across datasets and measures [.00 (.00), .00 (.00), .00 (.00) for area, .02 (.09), .00 (.02), .01 (.03) for volume, and .01 (.05), .01 (.14), .00 (.01) for thickness] while confirmatory replicability was generally poor, with the exception of the ABCD dataset [.02 (.05), .68 (.35), .00 (.00) for area, .08 (.14), .56 (.25), .00 (.02) for volume, and .37 (.26), .60 (.27), .01 (.03) for thickness] (see <bold><xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 3</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>These results are not fully comparable to other studies assessing the replicability of brain-phenotype associations due to analytical differences (e.g. sample size, multiple-comparison correction method)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, yet clearly show that the rate of replicability of BW associations with cortical area and volume are comparable to benchmark brain-phenotype associations such as body-mass index and age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Lower levels of replicability in the LCBC subsample are likely attributable to higher sample variability (e.g. increased age span). Kinship may lead to inflated patterns of replicability within the ABCD cohort. Confirmatory replicability is, also, to some degree, affected by sample size, and thus the estimates of confirmatory replicability may be somewhat inflated in the ABCD dataset.</p>
<p>Finally, the degree of across-sample replicability was high for the effects of birth weight on cortical area and volume (average confirmatory replicability = .96 and .93), low for thickness (.27), and negligible for the effects of birth weight on cortical change (.03, .06, and .06).

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study uses multiple large neuroimaging data sets acquired at different points through the lifespan to provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence that birthweight (BW) is associated with robust and persistent variations in cortical anatomy, but less-substantial influences on cortical change over time. These findings, supported by robust statistical methods, illustrate the long temporal reach of early developmental influences and carry relevance for how we conceptualize, study, and potentially modify such influences more generally. The paper will be of interest to people interested in brain development and aging.</p>

<p>This manuscript uses 3 large neuroimaging datasets - which together span childhood to late adulthood - to model the relationship between birthweight (BW) and cortical anatomy over time. The authors separately consider BW associations with the &quot;height&quot; of cortical anatomy trajectories (intercept effects) vs. BW associations with trajectory shape. They authors also distinguish between BW associations with cortical surface area (SA) and cortical thickness (CT), which together determine cortical volume (CV). Prior studies have firmly established robust positive associations between BW and cortical SA, but this study adds evidence for the protracted lifespan persistence of these associations, and the degree to which BW associations with cortical change over time are much weaker.</p>
<p>The study has several strengths including: clearly motivation of this work in the Introduction and contextualization of the results in Discussion; use of three large neuroimaging datasets; inclusion of sensible sensitivity analyses; disambiguation of SA and CT findings; and use of formal spatial analysis to quantify the reproducibility of effects across cohorts.</p>
<p>The primary way in which this work seeks to extend beyond established findings is to determine if BW is associated with differences in cortical change over time. The results presented clearly establish that such BW-change associations are much more localized and less consistent across cohorts that BW-intercept associations. The authors use multiple complementary approaches to verify the robustness of this inference to dataset subsampling and variation in statistical methods.</p>
<p>Overall, this work provides a valuable new data point in our understanding of the profound and protracted influences that prenatal developmental features can have on postnatal outcomes.</p>

<p>This study focuses on the association between weight at birth and area, volume and thickness of the cerebral cortex measured at timepoints throughout the lifespan. Overall, the study is well designed, supported by evidence from a large sample drawn from three geographically distinct cohorts with robust analytical and statistical methods.</p>
<p>The authors test the hypotheses: that higher birth weight is associated with greater cortical area in later life; that associations are robust across samples and age; and that associations are stable across the lifespan. Analyses are performed separately in three cohorts: ABCD, UKBB and LCBC and the pattern of associations compared by means of spatial correlations. They find that BW is positively associated with cortical area (and, as a consequence, cortical volume) across most of the cortex, with effect sizes greatest in frontal and temporal regions. These associations remain largely unchanged when accounting for age, sex, length of gestation and (in one cohort) ethnicity. Variations due to MRI scanner and site are accounted for statistically. Measures are taken to determine within sample replicability through split-half analyses.</p>
<p>The authors conclude that BW, as a marker of early development, is associated with brain characteristics throughout the lifespan.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reviewer #1’s main concerns revolved around the evidential strength of the study’s conclusion that age-specific effects of birth weight on brain structure are more localized and less consistent across cohorts than age-uniform, stable effects. Specifically, the reviewer points out the evidence (or lack of such) for age-specific effects. We have rearticulated as a “bullet-point summarization” the reviewer’s concerns for a better response (please, see the original reviewer’s response in the annexed document). We thank the reviewer for his/her comment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Concern #1: No direct statistical comparisons are conducted between samples (beyond the spin-tests).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the initial version of the manuscript, the spin-tests represented a key test since they compared the spatial distribution of birth weight effects across samples. In the revised manuscript, we additionally perform a replicability analysis across samples both for birth weight effects on brain characteristics and on brain change in a similar fashion as described for the within-sample analysis. The results of these analyses provide complementary evidence of robust associations of birth weight effects on cortical characteristics (for area and volume, less so for thickness) and of unreliable associations of birth weight on cortical change. These analyses are briefly mentioned in the main document and fully described as supplementary information. Briefly, the effects of birth weight on cortical area and cortical volume showed high (exploratory and confirmatory) replicability while replicability was almost nonexistent for the effects of birth weight on cortical change. See below, under Reviewer #1, concern #2, for a description of the changes in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Concern #2: The differential composition of samples in terms of age distribution leads to the possibility that lack of results is explained by methodological differences.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The revised version of the manuscript provides now a within-sample replicability analysis of the birth weight effects on cortical change. This analysis addresses the reviewer’s concern as the lack of replicability in this analysis cannot be attributed to sample or methodological differences. We thank the reviewer for suggesting this analysis which provides further quantification of the (lack of) robustness of the birth weight effects on cortical change. See below for changes in the revised version of the manuscript concerning additional replicability analyses which were carried out as a response to reviewer #1 concerns #1 and #2.</p>
<p>pp. 12-3. “Additionally, we performed replicability analyses both across and within samples to further investigate the robustness of the effects of birth weight on cortical characteristics and cortical change. Split-half analyses within datasets were performed, to investigate the replicability of significant effects 36,37 of BW on cortical characteristics within samples (refer to Figure 1). These analyses further confirmed that the significant effects were largely replicable for volume and area, but not for thickness (see Supplementary Figure 11). Split-half analyses of BW on cortical change (refer to Figure 2) showed, in general, a very low degree of replicability on the three different cortical measures. See Supplementary Table 3. Replicability across datasets showed a similar pattern, that is, replicability was high for the effect of brain weight on cortical characteristics but very low for the effects of cortical change. See Supplementary Table 4 for stats. See Supplementary statistical methods for a full description of the analyses. These analyses provide complementary evidence of robust associations of BW with cortical area and volume – but not cortical change - across and within samples.”</p>
<p>p. 41. “For each dataset and cortical measure, we assessed the effects of birth weight on cortical structure and cortical change (…)”</p>
<p>p. 42. “Across samples replicability was performed as described in the within-sample replicability analysis (i.e., we assessed the exploratory and confirmatory replicability) except that split-half was not performed - the three datasets were compared with each other - and the analyses were performed in the original fsaverage space.”</p>
<p>pp. 54-55. “The exploratory replicability of birth weight on cortical change was negligible across datasets and measures [.00 (.00), .00 (.00), .00 (.00) for area, .02 (.09), .00 (.02), .01 (.03) for volume, and .01 (.05), .01 (.14), .00 (.01) for thickness] while confirmatory replicability was generally poor, except for the ABCD dataset [.02 (.05), .68 (.35), .00 (.00) for area, .08 (.14), .56 (.25), .00 (.02) for volume, and .37 (.26), .60 (.27), .01 (.03) for thickness] (see Supplementary Table 3).</p>
<p>These results are not fully comparable to other studies assessing the replicability of brain phenotype associations due to analytical differences (e.g. sample size, multiple-comparison correction method)20,36, yet clearly show that the rate of replicability of BW associations with cortical area and volume are comparable to benchmark brain-phenotype associations such as body-mass index and age68. Lower levels of replicability in the LCBC subsample are likely attributable to higher sample variability (e.g. increased age span). Kinship may lead to inflated patterns of replicability within the ABCD cohort. Confirmatory replicability is, also, to some degree, affected by sample size, and thus the estimates of confirmatory replicability may be somewhat inflated in the ABCD dataset.</p>
<p>Finally, the degree of across-sample replicability was high for the effects of birth weight on cortical area and volume (average confirmatory replicability = .96 and .93), low for thickness (.27), and negligible for the effects of birth weight on cortical change (.03, .06, and .06). See further information in Supplementary Table 4.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Concern #3: Some datasets have a narrow age range precluding the detection of age-related effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not believe concern #3 is a major problem since time<italic>birth weight refers to a within subject contrast, e.g., longitudinal-only-based contrast. Birth weight, even when self reported, is a highly reliable measure and the sample sizes are relatively large (n = 635, 1759, and 3324 unique individuals). Note that the smaller dataset does have longer follow-up times and more observations per participant, increasing the reliability of estimations in individual change. Structural MRI measures have very high reliability. Clearly, longitudinal brain change is less reliable, yet the present sample size and the high reliability of birth weight should provide enough statistical power to capture even small time-varying effects of birth weight on brain structure. Note as well that in each model age is treated as a covariate. Rather, the consistency of time</italic>birth weight (that is, the effects of birth weight on cortical change) is assessed with split-half replications within and across samples. In this methodological pipeline, a narrow age range for a given dataset, if anything, may constitute an advantage. We have clarified the statistical model (see changes in the revised manuscript, referred to in response to reviewer #1, concern #5).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Concern #4 The modeling strategy does not allow for non-linear interaction between age and BW suggesting the use of spline models instead in a mega-analytical fashion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, we agree that some - if not most - brain structures follow non-linear trajectories throughout life. In the present study, age regressors are used only for accounting for variance in the data rather than capturing any effect of interest. Rather, it is the time*birth weight regressor that captures age-varying changes in brain structure. Time reflects within-subject follow-up time. We believe non-linear modeling of age will only account for additional variance (compared to linear models) in the LCBC dataset given the dataset’s wider age range, while it will not have any consequential effect in the ABCD and UKB datasets (as predicted in the provisional response). In any case, we recognize it as a valid concern. Consequently, we have rerun the main models in an ROI-based fashion using or not using spline models to fit age. Specifically, we have fitted the models in each of Desikan-Killiany’s ROIs using generalized additive mixed models (GAMM with age as a smooth term) or linear mixed models (LME with age as a linear regressor). The results are shown in Supplementary Figures 13 and 14. The Beta regressors are nearly identical. As expected, the differences are noticeable in the LCBC dataset while the effect of using - or not using- splines to fit age is almost null in the other two datasets. See also FDR-corrected maps below for both birth weight effects on brain structure and brain change (we opted to show Beta-maps as supplementary material as the multiple-comparisons correction in the ROI-based analysis is not fully comparable with the one used in the vertex-wise approach).</p>
<p>p. 9: “Both birth weight effects on cortical characteristics and cortical change were rerun (ROIwise) using spline models that accounted for possible non-linear effects of age on cortical structure. The results were comparable to those reported above in Figures 1 and 2. See Supplementary Figures 13 and 14 for birth weight effects on cortical characteristics and cortical change, respectively.”</p>
<p>Caption to Supplementary Figure 13. “Comparison between spline (GAMM) and linear (LME) models on the effect of birth weight on cortical characteristics. Age was fitted either as a smoothing spline using generalized additive mixed models (GAMM, mgcv r-package) or a linear regressor with a linear mixed models (LME, lmer r-package) framework. The analyses were performed ROI-wise using the Desikan-Killiany atlas. Significance was considered at a FDR corrected threshold of p &lt; 0.04. All the remaining parameters were comparable to the main analyses shown in Figure 1. The viridis-yellow scale represents the lower-higher Beta regressors. Red contour displays regions showing significant effects of birth weight. Note the high correspondence with both fitting models. Differences are only noticeable in the LCBC sample due to the datasets’ wider age range (i.e., lifespan dataset).”

The figures below show the birth weight effects on brain characteristics (above) and change (below) using a GAMM or an LME approach; that is, using age as a smooth term or as a regressor. FDR-corrected p &lt; 0.05 values are shown in a signed logarithmic scale. Red-yellow values represent positive associations between birth weight and brain while blue-lightblue values represent negative associations. The results are qualitatively comparable and quantitative differences exist only in the LCBC dataset. Please see Supplementary Figures 13 and 14 in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Concern #5: Greater clarity regarding the statistical models and the provision of effect-size maps.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The revised manuscript provides additional information regarding the statistical model, especially in the results section, to avoid misunderstanding (see below examples of clarifications in the revised manuscript). We now provide Beta-maps, F-maps, unthresholded p-values maps, and degrees of freedom for the main univariate analyses. That is, we provide this information for both the whole sample and the twin analyses which correspond to Figures 1, 2, 4, and 5. We opted not to compute effect-size estimates (e.g. partial eta-squared, cohen’s d) due to the ambiguous interpretation of these maps in the context of linear mixed models.</p>
<p>p.8. “To test the effect of birth weight on cortical change we rerun the analyses with BW x time and age x time interactions. Note BW x time (i.e., within-subject follow-up time) represents the contrasts of interest while age – and age interactions – are used to account for differences in age across individuals.”</p>
<p>p.11. “In contrast, the spatial correlation of the maps capturing BW-associated cortical change (i.e., BW x time contrast) …”</p>
<p>p. 12. “Additionally, we performed replicability analysis both across and within samples to further investigate the robustness of the effects of birth weight on cortical characteristics and cortical change.”</p>
<p>p. 14: “BW discordance analyses on twins specifically were run as described for the main analyses above, with the exception that twin scans were reconstructed using FS v6.0.1. for ABCD and the addition of the twin’s mean birth weight as a covariate.”</p>
<p>p .31. “Group-level unthresholded p-maps, F-maps, Beta-maps, and degrees of freedom for the univariate analyses accompany this manuscript as additional material.”</p>
