<title>Abstract</title><p>PARP-1 is central to transcriptional regulation under both normal and stress conditions, with the governing mechanisms yet to be fully understood. Our biochemical and ChIP-seq-based analyses showed that PARP-1 binds specifically to active histone marks, particularly H4K20me1. We found that H4K20me1 plays a critical role in facilitating PARP-1 binding and the regulation of PARP-1-depenednt loci during both development and heat shock stress. Here we report that the sole H4K20 mono-methylase, <italic>pr-set7</italic>, and <italic>parp-1 Drosophila</italic> mutants undergo developmental arrest. RNA-seq analysis showed an absolute correlation between PR-SET7- and PARP-1-dependent loci expression, confirming co-regulation during developmental phases. PARP-1 and PR-SET7 are both essential for activating <italic>hsp70</italic> and other heat shock genes during heat stress, with a notable increase of H4K20me1 at their gene body. Mutating <italic>pr-set7</italic> disrupts monometylation of H4K20 along heat shock loci and abolish PARP-1 binding there. These data strongly suggest that H4 monometylation is a key triggering point in PARP-1 dependent processes in chromatin.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The chromosomes of eukaryotes are made up of chromatin, which is a complex of DNA tightly wound around nucleosomes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></italic>). Nucleosomes are the basic unit of chromatin, and they are made up of about 147bp of DNA wrapped around an octamer of four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></italic>). Eukaryotic DNA is packed into nucleosomes to maintain higher order chromatin structure. As a consequence, DNA sequences are inaccessible to a plethora of protein effectors for biological processes such as DNA damage repair, replication and transcription (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>). To overcome the nucleosome barrier, eukaryotes have developed several mechanisms that ensure the successful removal of nucleosomes. One of the key effectors involved in chromatin remodeling is Poly(ADP)-ribose Polymerase 1 (PARP-1), a chromatin-associated nuclear enzyme implicated in a host of biological processes including, transcriptional regulation and DNA repair (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></italic>). PARP-1 catalyzes the addition of poly(ADP)-ribose (pADPr) moieties onto acceptor proteins by utilizing donor NAD<sup>+</sup> as substrate. Upon PARP-1 activation due to developmental and environmental cues or stress, PARP-1 is automodified, and it attaches negatively charged poly(ADP)-ribose polymers onto histones and other chromatin-associated proteins, thereby decondensing DNA via electro-repulsion and facilitating PARP-1 mediated biological processes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></italic>). Besides PARP-1, histone modifications are essential for remodeling chromatin structure. Histones are subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, sumoylation, ubiquitylation and ADP-ribosylation on their amino-terminal tails protruding from the nucleosome core (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></italic>). Modifications of these histone tails can alter chromatin structure by modifying inter-nucleosome interactions or by serving as docking sites for effectors to facilitate diverse biological outcomes depending on the histone(s) so modified (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>The binding of PARP-1 to post-translationally modified histones may be necessary for PARP-1-mediated biological processes and PARP-1 targeting to chromatin. In our previous study, we showed that the phosphorylation of the histone variant H2Av directly impacts the localization, activation, and enzymatic activity of PARP-1 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>). Also, we previously showed that the N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 are needed for the enzymatic activation of PARP-1 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></italic>). Taken together, there is strong evidence that histone modifications can regulate PARP-1 activity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that PARP-1’s transcriptional regulatory role under regular and heat stress conditions may be intricately tied to its interaction with specific mono-methylated active histone marks, notably H4K20me1, H3K4me1, H3K36me1, H3K27me1 and H3K9me1 that it is inhibited by repressive H3K9me2/3 marks. Through transcriptomic analysis of <italic>pr-set7</italic> and <italic>parp-1</italic> mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic> third-instar larvae, we uncover a high correlation in differentially expressed genes and co-enrichment of PARP-1 and H4K20me1 at a subset of these genes, underscoring the role of PR-SET7/H4K20me1 in facilitating PARP-1-mediated transcriptional regulation. Importantly, we show that PARP-1 and PR-SET7 are essential for the activation of specific heat shock genes including <italic>hsp70</italic>, and the dynamic regulation of H4K20me1 during this process, further validates our hypothesis of H4K20me1 being crucial for PARP-1 binding and gene regulation under developmental and heat stress conditions.</p>

<title>PARP-1 binds to H4K20me1, H3K4me1, H3K36me1, H3K9me1 and H3K27me1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>In this study, we investigated the interaction between full-length recombinant PARP-1 and various histone modifications using a histone peptide array containing modified histone peptides individually and in combination with other peptides (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>). Our previous work established that PARP-1 binds to core histones (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></italic>). Here, we aimed to determine the specific histone marks that modulate PARP-1’s affinity for chromatin. We found that PARP-1 binds specifically to spots containing H4K20me1, H3K4me1, H3K36me1, H3K9me1 or H3K27me1 peptides (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B, C, D</xref> and data file S1). Specificity analysis showed that PARP-1 binding was highly specific for H3K4me1, H3K36me1, H3K9me1 and H3K27me1 containing peptides with the highest specificity observed for H4K20me1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1E</xref> and data file S1). Additionally, we explored the inhibitory effects of different histone modifications on PARP-1 binding. Our findings showed that H3K9me2/3 hindered PARP-1 binding to spots containing H3K4me1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1F</xref>, Supplemental Fig.S1 and S2). Conversely, H3K4me1 enhanced PARP-1 binding to spots with H3K9me2/3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1F</xref> and Supplemental Fig.S1). In parallel, our data shows that the phosphorylation of H3S10 or H3T11, two residues nearby H3K9 diminish PARP-1 binding to H3K9me1 (Supplemental Fig.S1 and S2). Similarly, the phosphorylation of H3K28 affects PARP-1 binding to H3K27me1 (Supplemental Fig.S1 and S2).</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of the MODified histone peptide assay (Active Motif) used to determine PARP-1 binding to histone modifications. The histone peptide array (Top, left), comprising 19mer peptides with single or up to four concurrent histone modifications, was employed to investigate PARP-1’s binding affinity for histone modifications and to assess the impact of adjacent modified peptides on PARP-1 binding. This array was first blocked, then incubated with PARP-1 protein (Top, right). Subsequently, it was stained with a PARP-1 antibody and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (Bottom, right). Visualization of PARP-1 binding was done through enhanced chemiluminescence detection and captured on X-ray film (Bottom, left). See Methods for a full description.

</fig>
<p>Next, we examined the association of PARP-1 with H4K20me1, H3K4me1, H3K36me1, H3K9me1, H3K9me2/3 and H3K27me1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> third-instar larvae using ChIP-seq data. PARP-1 peaks were highly correlated with H4K20me1, H3K4me1, H3K36me1, H3K9me1 and H3K27me1 but significantly less correlated with H3K9me2/3 peaks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1G</xref>). Consistently, at gene clusters, H4K20me1 and H3K4me1 were highly enriched at gene bodies in cluster I which also had the highest PARP-1 enrichment at promoters. H3K36me1, H3K9me1 and H3K27me1 were also enriched in cluster I albeit to a lesser degree than H4K20me1 and H3K4me1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1H</xref>). In contrast, H3K9me2/3 were more enriched at clusters II and III but depleted in cluster I (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1H</xref>). Additionally, PARP-1 associates with H4K20me1 and H3K4me1 on <italic>Drosophila</italic> polytene chromosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>). Notably, H4K20me1, H3K4me1, H3K36me1, H3K9me1 and H3K27me1 are associated with active genes while H3K9me2/3 is associated with low-expression or silent genes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). Thus, our data shows that PARP-1 predominantly binds to active mono-methylated histone marks, specifically H4K20me1, H3K4me1, H3K36me1, H3K9me1 and H3K27me1 while also suggesting that the binding of PARP-1 may be hindered by repressive histone marks such as H3K9me2/3.</p>

<title>PARP-1 and PR-SET7 co-regulate developmental gene expression programs</title>
<p>Next, we examined the relationship between H4K20me1 and PARP-1 during transcriptional regulation. Given that flies that lack PR-SET7, the sole methylase of H4K20, and PARP-1 undergo developmental arrest during the larval-to-pupal transition (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></italic>), we hypothesized that PR-SET7/H4K20me1 and PARP-1 may regulate similar gene expression programs during development. To validate our hypothesis, we initially confirmed that the <italic>pr-set7<sup>20</sup></italic>mutant not only eliminated PR-SET7 RNA and protein but also abrogated H4K20me1 modification (Supplemental Fig.S3). Interestingly, in the absence of PARP-1, neither PR-SET7 RNA nor protein levels were affected (Supplemental Fig.S4-5), indicating that PARP-1 is not directly implicated in the regulation of <italic>pr-set7</italic>. This finding contrasts with recent evidence demonstrating PARP1-induced degradation of PR-SET7/SET8 in human cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></italic>). Subsequently, we integrated PARP-1 and H4K20me1 ChIP-seq data in third-instar larvae and RNA-seq of <italic>pr-set7<sup>20</sup></italic> and <italic>parp-1<sup>C03256</sup></italic> mutant third-instar larvae. Our data showed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in <italic>pr-set7<sup>20</sup></italic> and <italic>parp-1<sup>C03256</sup></italic>transcriptome were highly correlated (Pearson, r = 0.79) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). However, despite the global reduction of H4K20me1, and PARP-1 RNA in <italic>pr-set7<sup>20</sup></italic>and <italic>parp-1<sup>C03256</sup></italic> mutants, respectively (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></italic>), there was a limited alteration in gene expression at genes where PARP-1 was co-localized with H4K20me1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Differentially expressed genes in both <italic>pr-set7<sup>20</sup></italic> and <italic>parp-1<sup>C03256</sup></italic>mutants and co-enriched with PARP-1 and H4K20me1 were mainly upregulated (n = 101, 72%) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3E</xref>). Intriguingly, under wild-type conditions, these genes displayed expression levels approximately 40% higher than the average and demonstrated increased of RNA-Polymerase II occupancy both at their promoter regions and gene bodies compared to other genes (Supplemental Fig.S6), indicating their high activity in wild type context. Interestingly, among the genes co-enriched with PARP-1 and H4K20me1, those only differentially expressed in <italic>parp-1<sup>C03256</sup></italic> mutants were mostly upregulated (n = 94, 85%), while those only differentially expressed in <italic>pr-set7<sup>20</sup></italic> mutants were mainly downregulated (n = 191, 67%), indicating that PARP-1 and H4K20me1 also have distinct functions in gene regulation at co-enriched genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3E</xref>). Gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes bound by PARP-1 and H4K20me1 showed that metabolic genes were upregulated while genes involved in neuron development and morphogenesis were downregulated in both <italic>pr-set7<sup>20</sup></italic>and <italic>parp-1<sup>C03256</sup></italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3F</xref>). Finally, to extend the generalizability of our observations beyond <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we compared the distribution of PARP1 and H4K20me1 in Human K562 cells. Strikingly, we observed a correlation in their distribution, suggesting that the interplay between PARP-1 and H4K20me1 is not limited to fruit flies (Supplemental Fig.S7). Overall, our results indicate H4K20me1 may be required for PARP-1 binding to preferentially repress metabolic genes and activate genes involved in neuron development at co-enriched genes.</p>

<title>PARP-1 and PR-SET7/H4K20me1 are required for the optimal expression of heat shock genes during heat stress</title>
<p>Next, we examined PARP-1 and H4K20me1 controlled gene expression programs during dynamic transcriptional changes. During heat shock, PARP-1 spreading from the promoter to the gene bodies of <italic>hsp70</italic> facilitates nucleosomal loss which leads to transcriptional activation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>). Since H4K20me1 is mostly enriched in gene bodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1H</xref>), we hypothesized that H4K20me1 may be required for PARP-1 spread at <italic>hsp70</italic> during heat shock. First, we examined the expression of heat shock genes before and after 30 minutes heat shock in WT, <italic>parp-1<sup>C03256</sup> and pr-set7<sup>20</sup></italic>third-instar larvae. The expression of heat shock genes (<italic>hsp22, hsp23, hsp68, hsp83</italic>) including <italic>hsp70</italic> were significantly reduced in <italic>parp-1<sup>C03256</sup> and pr-set7<sup>20</sup></italic> animals after heat shock (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A</xref>). ChIP-seq results revealed that PARP-1 highly occupied the promoters of <italic>hsp23</italic>, <italic>hsp68</italic>, <italic>hsp70</italic>, and <italic>hsp83</italic>, as well as in the gene body of <italic>hsp22</italic>, prior to heat shock (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B and C</xref>). Analysis of H4K20me1 enrichment showed low levels across the gene bodies of <italic>hsp22, hsp68</italic>, and <italic>hsp70</italic> (group A) but high levels at gene bodies of <italic>hsp23</italic> and <italic>hsp83</italic> (group B) before heat shock (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that an increase in H4K20me1 enrichment in the gene bodies of group A genes would facilitate PARP-1 binding after heat shock, while H4K20me1 enrichment remains unchanged in group B genes thereby facilitating PARP-1 binding and spreading. To our surprise, H4K20me1 levels increased at the gene bodies of group A genes (low H4K20me1 before heat shock) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4D</xref>) but decreased significantly at group B genes (high H4K20me1 before heat shock) after heat shock (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4E</xref>). These findings suggest that dynamic changes in H4K20me1 enrichment may regulate the expression of heat shock genes during heat shock and indicate that H4K20me1 may not be necessary for PARP-1 binding and PARP-1-mediated activation of group B genes during heat shock.</p>

<title>Mutating PR-SET7 methyl transferase disrupts PARP-1 binding to chromatin and diminishes poly(ADP)-ribosylation levels during heat shock stress</title>
<p>Our results showed that prior to heat shock, there was no effect on PARP-1 binding in both WT and <italic>pr-set7<sup>20</sup></italic> background animals to chromatin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5A</xref>).

These findings suggest that PR-SET7/H4K20me1 plays a crucial role in mediating PARP1 binding to chromatin during heat stress, thus, controls PARP1-dependent processes in chromatin. Previous studies showed that heat shock results in pADPr accumulation at the heat shock-induced puffs during PARP-1-dependent transcriptional activation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></italic>). Therefore, we tested if heat-shock treatment alters pADPr accumulation in <italic>pr-set7<sup>20</sup></italic>animals.

(<bold>C</bold>) <bold>Model of PARP-1 regulation by histone modifications.</bold> PARP-1 binds to a nucleosome that carries the H2A variant (H2Av) at the promoter region. Upon developmental triggers or heat shock-induced phosphorylation of H2Av, PARP-1 is activated (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>). Activated PARP-1 fosters a transcription start site (TSS) that is more accessible, thereby enabling the binding of RNA-Polymerase II (Pol II) and initiation of transcription (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></italic>). Following this, the distribution of PARP-1 is further enhanced by active mono-methylated forms of H4K20, H3K4, H3K36, or H3K9. Each of these histone modifications can interchangeably facilitate this function. The spreading of PARP-1 to the gene body contributes to the loosening of chromatin in this region (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></italic>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study illuminates the intricate interactions between PARP-1 and diverse histone modifications, with a particular emphasis on the influence of histone marks on the chromatin binding propensity of PARP-1. We discovered an elevated binding affinity of PARP-1 towards specific mono-methylated active histone modifications such as H4K20me1, H3K4me1, H3K36me1, H3K9me1 and H3K27me1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Intriguingly, our results also suggest that the repressive histone modifications, H3K9me2/3 may potentially hinder PARP-1 binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1F</xref>). The association between PARP-1 peaks and distinct histone marks in <italic>Drosophila</italic> third-instar larvae, as revealed through ChIP-seq data, corroborates the significance of these histone marks in PARP-1 binding. This is predominantly apparent for H4K20me1, H3K4me1, H3K36me1, H3K9me1 and H3K27me1, while H3K9me2/3 demonstrated a lesser correlation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1G</xref>), further validating the repressive role of these marks.</p>
<p>We additionally examined the potential functional consequences of PARP-1’s interaction with these histone marks, particularly H4K20me1. Mono-methylation of histone H4 on lysine 20 (H4K20me1), catalyzed by PR-SET7, is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></italic>). H4K20me1, similar to PARP-1, is enriched at highly active genes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></italic>). Also, H4K20me1 is critical for transcriptional regulation, maintenance of genome integrity, cell cycle regulation and double-strand break (DSB) DNA damage repair, all biological processes in which PARP-1 plays a role (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></italic>). Hence, histone modifications such as H4K20me1 may act to regulate the activity of key chromatin remodelers such as PARP-1.</p>
<p>A recent study demonstrated that in human cells overexpressing PARP-1, PR-SET7/SET8 is degraded, whereas depletion of PARP-1 leads to an increase in PR-SET7/SET8 levels (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></italic>). However, in our study involving <italic>parp-1</italic> mutant in <italic>Drosophila</italic> third-instar larvae revealed a nuanced scenario: we detected a minor but not significant reduction in both PR-SET7 RNA and protein levels (Supplemental Fig.S4 and S5). This outcome stands in stark contrast to the previous study’s findings. The discrepancy could be due to the distinct experimental approaches used: the previous research focused on mammalian cells and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, whereas our study examined the functions of PARP-1 in whole <italic>Drosophila</italic> third-instar larvae during development. Consequently, while PARP-1 may cooperate with PR-SET7 in the context of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, it could exhibit antagonistic roles against PR-SET7 in specific cell lines and under certain biological or developmental conditions.</p>
<p>Our transcriptomic analysis from <italic>pr-set7<sup>20</sup></italic> and <italic>parp-1<sup>C03256</sup></italic> mutant third-instar larvae implies that PR-SET7/H4K20me1 might be crucial for PARP-1’s role in transcriptional regulation. Remarkably, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in <italic>pr-set7<sup>20</sup></italic>and <italic>parp-1<sup>C03256</sup></italic> mutants exhibited a high degree of correlation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3A</xref>), although we noticed minimal alteration in gene expression where PARP-1 was co-localized with H4K20me1 across the genome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). This suggests that H4K20me1 might only be essential for PARP-1-mediated binding and gene regulation at a select group of genes, specifically during metabolic gene repression and developmental gene activation. Our results also propose that PARP-1 and PR-SET7/H4K20me1 might have separate roles in gene regulation at co-enriched genes.</p>
<p>Notably, genes co-enriched with PARP-1 and H4K20me1, and are upregulated in both <italic>parp-1<sup>C03256</sup></italic> and <italic>pr-set7<sup>20</sup></italic>mutants, are predominantly metabolic genes exhibiting high expression levels under wild-type conditions and a high occupancy of RNA-polymerase II both at their promoter region and gene body (Supplemental Fig.S6). In our previous studies, we discovered that PARP-1 plays a crucial role in repressing highly active metabolic genes during the development of <italic>Drosophila</italic> by binding directly to their loci (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></italic>). Also, PARP-1 is required for maintaining optimum glucose and ATP levels at the third-instar larval stage (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></italic>). During <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, repression of metabolic genes is crucial for larval to pupal transition (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></italic>). This repression is linked to the reduced energy requirements as the organism prepares for its sedentary pupal stage (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></italic>). Remarkably, our observations indicate a notable affinity of PARP-1 for binding to the gene bodies of these metabolic genes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></italic>), suggesting a direct involvement of PARP1 in their regulation. Nonetheless, it remains plausible that certain genes may be indirectly regulated by PARP1 through intermediary transcription factors.</p>
<p>Our data indicates that in both <italic>parp-1</italic> and <italic>pr-set7</italic> mutant animals, there was a preferential repression of metabolic genes at sites where PARP-1 and H4K20me1 are co-bound (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3E</xref>), while these metabolic genes are highly active during third-instar larval stage (Supplemental Fig.S6). Thus, we propose that the presence of H4K20me1 may be essential for the binding of PARP-1 at these gene bodies, contributing to their repression. Importantly, this mechanism of gene repression has broader developmental implications. As earlier stated, mutant animals lacking functional PARP-1 and PR-SET7 undergo developmental arrest during larval to pupal transition. This arrest could be directly linked to the disruption of the normal metabolic gene repression during development. Without the repressive action of PARP-1 and PR-SET7, key metabolic processes might remain unchecked, leading to metabolic imbalances that are incompatible with the normal progression to the pupal stage.</p>
<p>In this study, we have demonstrated that PARP-1 is essential for the activation of <italic>hsp22, hsp23,</italic> and <italic>hsp83</italic> during heat shock (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A</xref>). Importantly, the expression of these heat shock genes significantly decreased in <italic>pr-set7<sup>20</sup></italic> mutants following heat shock (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A</xref>), which shows a role for PR-SET7/H4K20me1 in the heat shock response. We have also observed that H4K20me1 regulation is dynamic in the gene bodies of PARP-1- and PR-SET7-dependent heat shock genes. Specifically, at genes that show low or no H4K20me1 enrichment prior to heat shock, H4K20me1 levels increase post-heat shock (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Conversely, at genes with high levels of H4K20me1, the level of H4K20me1 decreases following heat shock (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Previous studies have shown that H4K20me1 occupancy can either inhibit or facilitate transcriptional elongation, depending on the biological context (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>). As such, we propose that for group A genes, which show a significant increase in H4K20me1 enrichment after heat shock, H4K20me1 may facilitate the spread of PARP-1 in their gene bodies, thus enhancing transcriptional activation. In contrast, the removal of H4K20me1 at group B genes, which exhibit a significant reduction of H4K20me1 at their gene bodies, may enable transcriptional elongation. Thus, an unidentified H4K20me1 demethylase and PR-SET7’s non-catalytic functions may be required to facilitate transcriptional activation of group B heat shock genes during heat stress.</p>
<p>Another plausible explanation could be that the recruitment of PARP-1 to group B genes loci promotes H4 dissociation and then leads to a reduction of H4K20me1. However, our findings suggest an alternative interpretation: the decrease in H4K20me1 at group B genes during heat shock does not seem to impede PARP-1’s role in transcriptional activation, (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A, C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Rather than disrupting PARP-1 function, we propose that this reduction in H4K20me1 may signify a regulatory shift in chromatin structure, priming these genes for transcriptional activation during heat shock, with PARP-1 playing an independent facilitating role. Moreover, existing studies have highlighted the dual role of H4K20me1, acting as a promoter of transcription elongation in certain contexts and as a repressor in others (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></italic>). The elevated enrichment of H4K20me1 in group B genes under normal conditions may indicate a repressive state that requires alleviation for transcriptional activation. Additionally, we cannot discount the possibility of unique regulatory functions associated with PR-SET7, extending beyond its recognized role as a histone methylase. Non-catalytic activities and potential interactions with non-histone substrates might contribute to the nuanced control exerted by PR-SET7 on group B genes during heat stress (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></italic>). Furthermore, our exploration of <italic>pr-set7<sup>20</sup></italic>and <italic>parp-1<sup>C03256</sup></italic> mutants reveals distinct roles for PARP-1 and H4K20me1 in modulating gene expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). This reinforces the notion that the interplay between PR-SET7 and PARP-1 involves a multifaceted regulatory mechanism. Understanding the intricate relationship between these molecular players is crucial for elucidating the complexities of gene expression modulation under heat stress conditions.</p>
<p>Notably, <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo expressing an unmodifiable H4K20 (H4K20A) and a catalytically-inactive <italic>trr</italic> mutant (monomethylase of H3K4) were still able to mature into adult flies (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></italic>), demonstrating that H3K4me1 and H4K20me1 are dispensable for transcription during development. This finding contrasts our hypothesis that H4K20me1 or H3K4me1 might modulate PARP-1 binding at PARP-1-dependent genes during development. Importantly, our data also revealed that PARP-1 binds to H3K36me1 and H3K9me1. Consequently, we suggest that H3K36me1 and H3K9me1 could potentially substitute the role of H3K4me1 and H4K20me1 in controlling PARP-1 binding at PARP-1 dependent genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Finaly, highly transcribed genes have been reported to present a high turnover of mono-methylated modifications, maintaining a state of low methylation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></italic>). Moreover, our previous study revealed that PARP1 preferentially binds to highly active genes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></italic>). Consequently, our findings suggest an active involvement of PARP-1 in the turnover process to maintain an active chromatin environment. This proposed mechanism unfolds in the following steps: 1) PARP-1 selectively binds to mono-methylated active histone marks associated with highly transcribed genes. 2) Upon activation, PARP-1 undergoes automodification and subsequently disengages from chromatin, facilitating the reassembly of nucleosomes carrying the mono-methylated marks. 3) The enzymatic action of Poly(ADP)-ribose glycohydrolase (PARG) cleaves pADPr, restoring PARP-1’s binding affinity to mono-methylated active histone marks. This proposed hypothesis is consistent with existing research conducted across various model organisms, including mice, Drosophila, and Humans (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></italic>). Notably, previous studies have consistently demonstrated that PARP-1 predominantly associates with highly expressed genes and plays a crucial role in mediating nucleosome dynamics and assembly. Thus, our proposed model provides a molecular framework that may contribute to understanding the relationship between PARP-1 and the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.</p>

<p>The quality of FASTQ files (raw reads) were checked using FastQC (version. 0.11.9) and adapters were removed with fastp (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></italic>). Trimmed FASTQ files were aligned to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome (dm6) using Bowtie2 to generate bam files (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></italic>). Unmapped and low-quality reads were discarded from bam files (&lt;=20 mapQuality) using BamTools (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></italic>). Duplicate reads were identified and removed from mapped reads using Picard MarkDuplicates (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>). Deeptools MultiBamSummary was used to determine reproducibility of ChIP-seq reads. MACS2 was used to call peaks against pooled Input/control using default settings except narrowPeaks were called for PARP-1 and broadPeaks were called for H3K4me1 (gapped), H3K9me1, H4K20me1, H3K36me1, H3K9me2, H3K9me3. Peaks were annotated to genomic features with ChIPseeker (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></italic>). Pairwise correlation of peaks was determined using Intervene (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></italic>). MACS2 bedGraph pileups were used to generate normalized coverage of ChIP-seq signals using Deeptools bigWigCompare by computing the ratio of the signals (IP vs Control/Input) using a 50bp bin size. Deeptools multiBigwigSummary was used to determine genome-wide signal correlation using a 10kb bin size. Deeptools plotHeatmap was used to create gene-centric enrichment profiles using scaled region mode. Gene clusters were determined via K means function (n=3) using Deeptools suite (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>To compare H4K20me1 and PARP-1 occupancy in Human K562 cells (Supplemental Fig.S7), CrossMap was used to convert H4K20me1 bigwig from Hg19 to Hg38 to match PARP-1 bigwig. Deeptools were used to generate and plot enrichment of PARP-1 and H4K20me1 at PARP-1 gene clusters.</p>

<title>Mononucleosome chromatin immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>We collected 60 WT wandering <italic>Drosophila</italic> third-instar larvae and rinsed them in 1X PBS twice. For heat shock experiments, larvae were heat-shocked in a 1.5ml DNA LoBind tube for 15mins and 30mins in a water bath at 37°C. Larvae were then homogenized using a pellet pestle homogenizer in 500ul ice-cold buffer A1 (60 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 15 mM 4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (pH 7.6), 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM DTT, 1×EDTA (Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid)-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche 04693132001). The larvae were then crosslinked by adding formaldehyde to a 1.8% concentration and incubating for 5mins at RT on a rotator. Crosslinking was stopped by adding glycine (final concentration was 0.125 M) at room temperature for 5 min on a rotator. The mixture was centrifuged at 2000g for 5 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed as follows: once with 500μl A1 buffer, and once with 500μl A2 buffer (140 mM NaCl, 15 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mM DTT, 1×EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche 04693132001)). For each wash, the tube was shaken for 1 min and centrifuged as before, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 500μl A2 buffer + 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and incubated on a rotating wheel at 4°C for 10 min. Then the mixture was centrifuged at 16 000g for 5 min at 4°C and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed with 500μl MNase digestion buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 15 mM NaCl, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1×EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail) and centrifuged at 16 000g for 10 min at 4°C. The nuclei were resuspended in 500μl MNase digestion buffer and 400 U MNase (Worthington, LS004797) was added and incubated at 37°C for 20 min. The MNase digestion was terminated on ice by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mM and kept on ice for 10 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 16 000g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 500μl A3 buffer (140 mM NaCl, 15 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1×EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail) and incubated for 30 min on a rotator at 4°C. The mixture was then centrifuged at 16 000g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant containing mononucleosomal fragments was transferred to a new DNA LoBind tube, then 20ul of mixture was used to check fragment size prior to immunoprecipitation. The mixture was then made up to 2ml with IP buffer (0.5% SDS, 20mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2mM EDTA, 0.5mM EGTA, 0.5mM PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktail). The mononucleosomal chromatin was pre-cleared and 800ul was incubated with 5ul anti-H4K20me1 antibody (abcam, 9051) or 5ul Rabbit IgG control at 4°C overnight and 80ul was kept as input. The immunoprecipitated chromatin was then collected with pre-washed Protein A agarose beads for 2 hours. The beads were sequentially washed with the following buffers: 1 low salt buffer wash (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2mM EDTA, 20mM Tris-HCL pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl), 3 high salt buffer washes (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2mM EDTA, 20mM Tris-HCL pH 8.0, 500mM NaCl), 1 LiCL wash (2mM EDTA, 20mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.25M LiCl, 1% NP-40) and 2 TE buffer washers before elution. Bound chromatin on beads was eluted twice at room temperature using 250ul of freshly prepared ChIP elution buffer (1% SDS, 100mM NaHCO3) for 15 minutes and reverse-crosslinked overnight. The eluates were then treated with RNase A and proteinase K prior to DNA extraction via phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<p>We extend our sincere gratitude for the invaluable comments provided by the reviewers and yourself, along with the constructive suggestions to enhance the quality of our manuscript. In response to this invaluable feedback, we have diligently revised and resubmitted our paper as an article, introducing five primary figures, seven supplementary figures, and two supplementary data files. Importantly, this work represents a significant contribution to the field, presenting novel findings for the first time without any prior publication.</p>
<p>Within the enclosed document, we have provided a comprehensive response to the editor and reviewer comments, addressing each point meticulously and specifically. We extend our heartfelt thanks to the reviewers and yourself for your diligent examination of our manuscript and for offering insightful recommendations.</p>
<p>In our latest revision, we have taken great care to address every comment, ensuring that we clarify the manuscript and provide robust evidence where required. We have meticulously highlighted the modifications within the manuscript in yellow for your convenience, while also including the modifications made in response to each specific comment. The primary focus of these revisions was to provide additional context regarding the relationship between PARP-1 and mono-methylated histones. Substantial modifications were made to our discussion section to address this point.</p>
<p>Another concern raised was regarding the discrepancy in the relationship of PR-SET7 and PARP-1 between our study and the recent study by Estève et al. (PMID: 36434141). We have revised the results and discussion sections to discuss this concern.</p>
<p>Addressing Reviewer 2’s concern about the potential indirect role of PARP1 in the regulation of some metabolic genes despite its direct binding to loci coding for metabolic genes we revised the discussion section to highlight this possibility.</p>
<p>Enclosed, you will find a detailed, point-by-point response to each of the editor’s and reviewers' comments, showcasing our commitment to addressing their concerns with precision.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that our revisions successfully resolve all the concerns raised by the editor and the reviewers, and we are confident that this improved version of our manuscript contributes significantly to the scientific discourse. Once again, we thank you for considering our work, and please feel free to contact me if you require any additional information.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the revised manuscript, most of the concerns raised by the reviewers have been addressed satisfactorily. However, as suggested by reviewer#2, it would have been more significant, if the PARP1-mediated reading of global mono-methylation of histone could be addressed. At least the mechanisms of selectivity of PARP1 need further convincing discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the editor for their valuable comments. We have extended our discussion section to discuss in more detail the relationship between PARP1 and mono-methylated histones. In our refined Discussion section, we have endeavored to articulate more clearly how PARP-1 may be selectively recruited to active chromatin domains through its interaction with mono-methylated histone marks. We propose a model wherein PARP-1 actively participates in the turnover process, contributing to the maintenance of an active chromatin environment. This mechanism entails PARP-1 selectively binding to mono-methylated active histone marks associated with highly transcribed genes. Upon activation, PARP-1 undergoes automodification, leading to its release from chromatin and facilitating the reassembly of nucleosomes carrying the mono-methylated marks. Subsequently, the enzymatic action of Poly(ADP)-ribose glycohydrolase (PARG) cleaves pADPr, enabling the restoration of PARP-1's binding affinity to mono-methylated active histone marks. This proposed hypothesis is consistent with existing research across various model organisms and aligns with the known association of PARP-1 with highly expressed genes, as well as its role in mediating nucleosome dynamics and assembly.</p>
<p>Our modified Discussion section unfolds as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Finally, highly transcribed genes have been reported to present a high turnover of mono-methylated modifications, maintaining a state of low methylation (50). Moreover, our previous study revealed that PARP1 preferentially binds to highly active genes (34).  Consequently, our findings suggest an active involvement of PARP-1 in the turnover process to maintain an active chromatin environment. This proposed mechanism unfolds in the following steps: 1) PARP-1 selectively binds to mono-methylated active histone marks associated with highly transcribed genes. 2) Upon activation, PARP-1 undergoes automodification and subsequently disengages from chromatin, facilitating the reassembly of nucleosomes carrying the mono-methylated marks. 3) The enzymatic action of Poly(ADP)-ribose glycohydrolase (PARG) cleaves pADPr, restoring PARP-1's binding affinity to mono-methylated active histone marks. This proposed hypothesis is consistent with existing research conducted across various model organisms, including mice, Drosophila, and Humans (7, 24, 30, 51-53). Notably, previous studies have consistently demonstrated that PARP-1 predominantly associates with highly expressed genes and plays a crucial role in mediating nucleosome dynamics and assembly. Thus, our proposed model provides a molecular framework that may contribute to understanding the relationship between PARP-1 and the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.&quot;</p>
<p>We trust that these revisions effectively address the editor’s comment and enhance the overall strength and clarity of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, recent developments in the area are omitted, as an important publication hasn't been discussed anywhere in the work (PMID: 36434141).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the editor's thorough review of our revised manuscript and the responses to the previous reviewer's comments. To address this important concern, we have carefully investigated the levels of PR-SET7 in <italic>parp1</italic> hypomorphic conditions.</p>
<p>Supplemental Fig. S4 and S5 demonstrate that in the absence of Parp1, there were no significant changes observed in PR-SET7 RNA or protein levels, respectively. This finding supports the conclusion that Parp1 is not directly involved in the regulation of PR-SET7 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> contrasting with the findings of Estève et al.'s study (PMID: 36434141). This discrepancy may arise from differing relationships between PARP-1 and PR-SET7, which could cooperate in the context of Drosophila development while playing antagonistic roles in specific cell lines or under particular conditions.</p>
<p>We have updated the Results section to explicitly mention this observation:</p>
<p>&quot;Interestingly, in the absence of PARP-1, neither PR-SET7 RNA nor protein levels were affected (Supplemental Fig.S4-5), indicating that PARP-1 is not directly implicated in the regulation of pr-set7. This finding contrasts with recent evidence demonstrating PARP1-induced degradation of PR-SET7/SET8 in human cells (16).&quot;</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have modified the discussion section to address this discrepancy:</p>
<p>&quot;A recent study demonstrated that in human cells overexpressing PARP-1, PR-SET7/SET8 is degraded, whereas depletion of PARP-1 leads to an increase in PR-SET7/SET8 levels (16). However, in our study involving parp-1 mutant in Drosophila third-instar larvae revealed a nuanced scenario: we detected a minor but not significant reduction in both PR-SET7 RNA and protein levels (Supplemental Fig.S4 and S5). This outcome stands in stark contrast to the previous study's findings. The discrepancy could be due to the distinct experimental approaches used: the previous research focused on mammalian cells and in vitro experiments, whereas our study examined the functions of PARP-1 in whole Drosophila third-instar larvae during development. Consequently, while PARP-1 may cooperate with PR-SET7 in the context of Drosophila development, it could exhibit antagonistic roles against PR-SET7 in specific cell lines and under certain biological or developmental conditions.&quot;</p>
<p>We believe that these modifications effectively address the raised concern and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between PARP1 and PR-SET7 in our study. We hope these clarifications enhance the overall robustness and clarity of our findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study from Bamgbose et al. identifies a new and important interaction between H4K20me and Parp1 that regulates inducible genes during development and heat stress. The authors present convincing experiments that form a mostly complete manuscript that significantly contributes to our understanding of how Parp1 associates with target genes to regulate their expression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors present 3 compelling experiments to support the interaction between Parp1 and H4K20me, including:</p>
<p>(1) PR-Set7 mutants remove all K4K20me and phenocopy Parp mutant developmental arrest and defective heat shock protein induction.</p>
<p>(2) PR-Set7 mutants have dramatically reduced Parp1 association with chromatin and reduced poly-ADP ribosylation.</p>
<p>(3) Parp1 directly binds H4K20me in vitro.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The RNAseq analysis of Parp1/PR-Set7 mutants is reasonable, but there is a caveat to the author's conclusion (Line 251): &quot;our results indicate H4K20me1 may be required for PARP-1 binding to preferentially repress metabolic genes and activate genes involved in neuron development at co-enriched genes.&quot; An alternative possibility is that many of the gene expression changes are indirect consequences of altered development induced by Parp1 or PR-Set7 mutants. For example, Parp1 could activate a transcription factor that represses metabolic genes. The authors counter this model by stating that Parp1 directly binds to &quot;repressed&quot; metabolic genes. While this argument supports their model, it does not rule out the competing indirect transcription factor model. Therefore, they should still mention the competing model as a possibility.</p>

<p>We appreciate Reviewer 2's insightful comments during both rounds of revision, which have significantly enriched the quality of our manuscript. The binding of PARP1 to loci encoding metabolic genes indeed suggests a direct role of PARP1 in their regulation. However, we acknowledge Reviewer 2's point that some of these targets might be regulated indirectly, with PARP1 potentially modulating the expression of intermediary transcription factors.</p>
<p>To address this possibility, we have revised the discussion section of our manuscript accordingly:</p>
<p>&quot;Remarkably, our observations indicate a notable affinity of PARP-1 for binding to the gene bodies of these metabolic genes (34), suggesting a direct involvement of PARP1 in their regulation. Nonetheless, it remains plausible that certain genes may be indirectly regulated by PARP1 through intermediary transcription factors.&quot;</p>
<p>We trust that this modification adequately addresses Reviewer 2's concern.</p>

<p>(2) The section on inducibility of heat shock genes is interesting but missing an important control that might significantly alter the author's conclusions. Hsp23 and Hsp83 (group B genes) are transcribed without heat shock, which likely explains why they have H4K20me without heat shock. The authors made the reasonable hypothesis that this H4K20me would recruit Parp-1 upon heat shock (line 270). However, they observed a decrease of H4K20me upon heat shock, which led them to conclude that &quot;H4K20me may not be necessary for Parp1 binding/activation&quot; (line 275). However, their RNA expression data (Fig4A) argues that both Parp1 and H40K20me are important for activation. An alternative possibility is that group B genes indeed recruit Parp1 (through H4K20me) upon heat shock, but then Parp1 promotes H3/H4 dissociation from group B genes. If Parp1 depletes H4, it will also deplete H4K20me1. To address this possibility, the authors should also do a ChIP for total H4 and plot both the raw signal of H4K20me1 and total H4 as well as the ratio of these signals. The authors could also note that Group A genes may similarly recruit Parp1 and deplete H3/H4 but with different kinetics than Group B genes because their basal state lacks H4K20me/Parp1. To test this possibility, the authors could measure Parp association, H4K20methylation, and H4 depletion at more time points after heat shock at both classes of genes.</p>

<p>We sincerely appreciate Reviewer 2 for their insightful comment on our manuscript. Your hypothesis regarding the potential induction of H3/H4 dissociation from group B genes by PARP-1, leading to a reduction in H4K20me1, offers a thought-provoking perspective. However, our findings suggest an alternative interpretation.</p>
<p>Our data indicate that while H4K20me1 is indeed present under normal conditions at group B genes, its reduction following heat shock does not seem to impede PARP-1's role in transcriptional activation (Fig. 4A, C, and E). Instead, we propose that this decrease in H4K20me1 might signify a regulatory shift in chromatin structure, facilitating transcriptional activation during heat shock, with PARP-1 playing an independent facilitating role. Moreover, existing studies have highlighted the dual role of H4K20me1, acting as a promoter of transcription elongation in certain contexts and as a repressor in others.</p>
<p>The elevated enrichment of H4K20me1 in group B genes under normal conditions may indeed indicate a repressive state that requires alleviation for transcriptional activation. Additionally, we cannot discount the possibility of unique regulatory functions associated with PR-SET7, extending beyond its recognized role as a histone methylase. Non-catalytic activities and potential interactions with non-histone substrates might contribute to the nuanced control exerted by PR-SET7 on group B genes during heat stress.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our exploration of <italic>pr-set720</italic> and <italic>ParpC03256</italic> mutants reveals distinct roles for PARP-1 and H4K20me1 in modulating gene expression (Fig 3E). This reinforces the notion that the interplay between PR-SET7 and PARP-1 involves a multifaceted regulatory mechanism.</p>
<p>To address these points, we have revised the discussion section of our manuscript accordingly:</p>
<p>&quot;Another plausible explanation could be that the recruitment of PARP-1 to group B genes loci promotes H4 dissociation and then leads to a reduction of H4K20me1. However, our findings suggest an alternative interpretation: the decrease in H4K20me1 at group B genes during heat shock does not seem to impede PARP-1's role in transcriptional activation, (Fig.4A, C and E). Rather than disrupting PARP-1 function, we propose that this reduction in H4K20me1 may signify a regulatory shift in chromatin structure, priming these genes for transcriptional activation during heat shock, with PARP-1 playing an independent facilitating role. Moreover, existing studies have highlighted the dual role of H4K20me1, acting as a promoter of transcription elongation in certain contexts and as a repressor in others (13, 26, 39, 40, 42-46). The elevated enrichment of H4K20me1 in group B genes under normal conditions may indicate a repressive state that requires alleviation for transcriptional activation. Additionally, we cannot discount the possibility of unique regulatory functions associated with PR-SET7, extending beyond its recognized role as a histone methylase. Non-catalytic activities and potential interactions with non-histone substrates might contribute to the nuanced control exerted by PR-SET7 on group B genes during heat stress (47, 48). Furthermore, our exploration of <italic>pr-set720</italic> and <italic>parp-1C03256</italic> mutants reveals distinct roles for PARP-1 and H4K20me1 in modulating gene expression (Fig 3E). This reinforces the notion that the interplay between PR-SET7 and PARP-1 involves a multifaceted regulatory mechanism. Understanding the intricate relationship between these molecular players is crucial for elucidating the complexities of gene expression modulation under heat stress conditions.&quot;</p>
<p>We believe that this modification enhances the clarity of our conclusions and adequately addresses Reviewer 2's concerns regarding the intricate relationship between PARP-1, H4K20me1, and PR-SET7 in transcriptional regulation under heat stress conditions.</p>
