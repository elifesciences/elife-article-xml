<abstract>
<p>During clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a patch of flat plasma membrane is internalized to form a vesicle. In mammalian cells, how the clathrin coat deforms the membrane into a vesicle remains unclear and two main hypotheses have been debated. The “constant area” hypothesis assumes that clathrin molecules initially form a flat lattice on the membrane and deform the membrane by changing its intrinsic curvature while keeping the coating area constant. The alternative “constant curvature” hypothesis assumes that the intrinsic curvature of the clathrin lattice remains constant during the formation of a vesicle while the surface area it covers increases. Previous experimental studies were unable to unambiguously determine which hypothesis is correct. In this paper, we show that these two hypotheses are only two extreme cases of a continuum spectrum if we account for the free energies associated with clathrin assembly and curvature generation. By tracing the negative gradient of the free energy, we define vesiculation pathways in the phase space of the coating area and the intrinsic curvature of clathrin coat. Our results show that, overall, the differences in measurable membrane morphology between the different models are not as big as expected, and the main differences are most salient at the early stage of endocytosis. Furthermore, the best fitting pathway to experimental data is not compatible with the constant-curvature model and resembles a constant-area-like pathway where the coating area initially expands with minor changes in the intrinsic curvature, later followed by a dramatic increase in the intrinsic curvature and minor change in the coating area. Our results also suggest that experimental measurement of the tip radius and the projected area of the clathrin coat will be the key to distinguish between models.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>1.We have clarified that the term *constant area model* refers to the assumption that the clathrin-coated area remains fixed, while the total membrane surface area is allowed to vary (line 136).
2.We have added Appendix 6 and a supplementary figure to show the contribution to the membrane energy from bending and tension respectively (line 916).
3.We have added a discussion on the strengths and limitations of our model. In particular, we address the issue of excessive curvature and propose a remedy by introducing a saturation-like term, as described in Equation (7).
4.We have emphasized that the schematic representation of the constant-curvature model does not align with the exact calculations, and that the deviation becomes more pronounced at larger intrinsic curvature. (line 181).
5.We have added a discussion comparing our model with particle wrapping and added two relevant references (Gozdz, 2007; Bahrami et al., 2016) (line 475).
6.We have added the rationale for treating the clathrin assembly as in mechanical equilibrium (line 141).
7.We have explained why the value of dimensionless membrane tension equals to 1/2 (line 151).

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a fundamental cellular process to transport lipids, membrane proteins and extracellular cargo molecules into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">McMahon and Boucrot, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sorkin and Puthenveedu, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lacy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mettlen et al., 2018</xref>). In mammalian cells, a small patch of flat plasma membrane is shaped into a spherical vesicle when CME occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Avinoam et al., 2015</xref>). Clathrin molecules are essential for the membrane remodelling process. They are made of three subunits that form a triskelion, which further assemble into a cage-like structure <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Musacchio et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shraiman, 1997</xref>). The minimum cages contain 16 polygons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fotin et al., 2004</xref>) and the most commonly observed ones are semi-regular icosahedral cages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dannhauser and Ungewickell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Heuser, 1980</xref>). Two main hypotheses are under debate regarding how the clathrin coat scaffolds the flat membrane into a spherical vesicle <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Avinoam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen and Schmid, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Frey and Schwarz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Scott et al., 2018</xref>). The constant area model asserts that the clathrin molecules initially polymerize into a flat lattice with a regularly arranged hexagonal structure, and later reorganization of the bonds between adjacent clathrins results in the formation of pentagons in the hexagonal lattice, which in turn leads to curvature generation of the clahtrin coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fotin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Heuser and Anderson, 1989</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). Adhesion of clathrin molecules with the substrate has been suggested to contribute a flattening force that prevents curvature generation. Release of the flattening force therefore could induce curvature of the clathrin coat with preloaded pentagons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sochacki et al., 2021</xref>). The alternative constant curvature model asserts that the intrinsic curvature of the elements of the lattice is kept constant during the assembly and expansion of the lattice, therefore curvature generation occurs from the very beginning of clathrin assembly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to distinguish between the two models, the dynamics of clathrin assembly and the geometry of membrane shapes are needed. Fluorescence microscopy, including light sheet and MINFLUX, has revealed the assembly dynamics of the clathrin coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aguet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ferguson et al., 2016</xref>), as well as other proteins that participate in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sirotkin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kukulski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kaksonen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Balzarotti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gwosch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Schmidt et al., 2021</xref>), while electron tomography has been able to resolve membrane shapes during endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Avinoam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>). However, neither of the methods can capture both spatial and temporal information at the same time. Under conventional fluorescence microscopy, the clathrin-coated pits appear as diffraction-limited spots due to their small size, which is typically ~ 30 − 150nm in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">McMahon and Boucrot, 2011</xref>) and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>), and shape information of the membrane is completely lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cocucci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Loerke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Picco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sirotkin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kural and Kirchhausen, 2012</xref>). On the other hand, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy has been able to reveal the protein organization at the endocytic pit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mund et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cocucci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arasada et al., 2018</xref>) and to reconstruct the shape of the clathrin coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sochacki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Scott et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mund et al., 2023</xref>) from averaging over ensembles of endocytic sites. Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) method has exploited the fluorescence of fiducial markers to locate endocytic sites while resolving membrane shapes using electron tomography. However, both super-resolution and CLEM requires sample fixation, therefore, one can identify multiple endocytic sites at the same time and perform the average, yet unable to trace a single endocytic site over time. The temporal information is nevertheless lost.</p>
<p>As a result of the incomplete information obtained by existing experimental methods, both hypotheses have experimental support. Experiments that apply electron microscopy to resolve the membrane shapes of endocytic pits favor the constant area model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Avinoam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bucher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sochacki and Taraska, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sochacki et al., 2021</xref>). However, super-resolution imaging combined with analysis of the fluorescence intensity of the clathrin coat is inclined towards the constant curvature model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Willy et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, it was argued that the energetic cost of bond reorganization in a regular hexagonal lattice in the constant area model may be too large to be fulfilled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Frey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Frey and Schwarz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kirchhausen et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Extensive theoretical efforts have been dedicated to model membrane morphology during endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fu and Johnson, 2023</xref>), of which molecular dynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Varga et al., 2020</xref>) and continuum mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hassinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ma and Berro, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Walani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agrawal and Steigmann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rangamani et al., 2013</xref>) are two common approaches. Hybrid models were also broadly applied to gain higher resolution than continuum mechanics and lower computing expense than molecular dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fu et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">2021</xref>). However, most theoretical investigations have focused on how mechanical properties, such as membrane tension and bending rigidity of the clathrin coat, influence the membrane morphology. The process of curvature generation is either neglected or taken for granted. Only few of them have addressed the difference between the constant area model and the constant curvature model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mund et al. (2023</xref>).</p>
<p>In fact, the constant curvature and constant area models are only two extreme models for clathrin assembly during endocytosis and any change in area or curvature are possible at any time point during endocytosis. In this paper, we extend the classic Helfrich theory for membrane deformation to incorporate energy terms associated with clathrin assembly and curvature generation, and compare geometric features calculated by theory with those extracted from experimental data. The negative gradient of the total free energy defines a pathway that neither fits the constant area model nor the constant curvature model. We find that a pathway that is close to the constant area model fits electron tomograms of the endocytic pits the best. Our study also offers experimental suggestions to distinguish between the two main hypotheses.</p>

<title>Models and methods</title>
<p>We model the membrane patch of the CCP (clathrin-coated pit) as a surface which is rotationally symmetric with respect to the <italic>z</italic>-axis. The shape of the membrane is parameterized with the meridional curve {<italic>r</italic>(<italic>s</italic>), <italic>z</italic>(<italic>s</italic>)}, where <italic>s</italic> denotes the arc length along the curve. The bending energy of the membrane (together with the clathrin coat) assumes the Helfrich model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Helfrich, 1973</xref>)
<disp-formula id="eqn1">

</disp-formula>
where <italic>κ</italic> denotes the bending rigidity of the CCP, <italic>C</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>2</sub> denote the principal curvatures of the surface, <italic>C</italic><sub>0</sub> denotes the intrinsic curvature of the membrane induced by the clathrin coat. To model a finite area of the clathrin coat, we assume the intrinsic curvature <italic>C</italic><sub>0</sub> spatially varies as
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>a</italic> denotes positions on the membrane. Here, we choose <italic>a</italic> to be the surface area calculated from the tip of the membrane, and <italic>C</italic><sub>0</sub> equals <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> for area <italic>a</italic> &lt; <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub>, and rapidly drops to zero when <italic>a</italic> &gt; <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub>. The parameter α controls the sharpness of the drop. In the constant area model, we vary the intrinsic curvature <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> but keep the coating area <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> constant, while in the constant curvature model, we vary the coating area <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> but keep the intrinsic curvature <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> constant. As a result of the clathrin coat, the bending rigidity <italic>κ</italic> also varies as
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>κ</italic><sub>coat</sub> and <italic>κ</italic><sub>bare</sub> denote the bending rigidity of the clathrin-coated membrane and bare membrane, respectively. Besides the bending energy, the membrane tension contributes to the free energy in the form of
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>σ</italic><sub>e</sub> denotes the membrane tension at the base and <italic>A</italic> denotes the surface area of the membrane patch within a fixed radius of <italic>R</italic><sub>b</sub>. The membrane tension <italic>σ</italic><sub>e</sub> and bending rigidity <italic>κ</italic> define a characteristic length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="607731v3_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Derényi et al., 2002</xref>). The total free energy <italic>E</italic><sub>tot</sub> = <italic>E</italic><sub>b</sub> + <italic>E</italic><sub>t</sub> is a functional of the membrane shape. We emphasize that the <italic>constant area model</italic> refers to the assumption that the clathrin-coated area <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> remains fixed. Meanwhile, the membrane tension <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> at the base is held constant, allowing the total membrane area <italic>A</italic> to vary in response to deformations induced by the clathrin coat. Given a coating area <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> and an intrinsic curvature <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>, we numerically solve the variational equations of the energy functional to obtain membrane shapes that minimizes <italic>E</italic><sub>tot</sub>. This approach is based on the assumption that the membrane remains in mechanical equilibrium throughout the process of clathrin assembly, which is justified by the disparity between the timescales of membrane relaxation and clathrin assembly. The characteristic relaxation time of a lipid membrane is given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="607731v3_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>µ</italic> ≈ 5 × 10<sup>−9</sup> N ⋅ s ⋅ m<sup>−1</sup> is the membrane viscosity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arroyo and DeSimone (2009)</xref>, <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> ≈ 50 nm is the vesicle size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Avinoam et al. (2015</xref>), and <italic>κ</italic> ≈ 20 <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic> is the bending rigidity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yuan et al. (2021</xref>). Substituting these values yields a relaxation time of <italic>τ</italic> ≈ 1.5 × 10<sup>−4</sup> s, which is several orders of magnitude shorter than the clathrin assembly timescale which is approximately one minute. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the membrane rapidly equilibrates and remains in mechanical equilibrium during the assembly process.

<title>Difference between the constant area model and the constant curvature model in terms of membrane morphology</title>
<p>Vesiculation requires assembly of a clathrin coat on the membrane, as well as curvature generation from the clathrin coat. A vesiculation process defines a pathway in the phase space (<italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>) of the clathrin coat area <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> and the intrinsic curvature <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> of the coat. The constant area model and the constant curvature model are pathways that are made of a vertical line and a horizontal line. Besides these two extreme cases, there is a continuum spectrum of pathways with simultaneously increasing coating area <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> and intrinsic curvature <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> that could lead to vesiculation. Along the pathway, the membrane evolves from a flat shape to a dimple shape, and finally to an Ω-shape, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. Hereafter we use the maximal tangential angle <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> of the membrane as an indicator of the progression of vesiculation - when the membrane is flat, <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> = 0<sup>°</sup>, and when the membrane becomes spherical, <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> = 180<sup>°</sup>. In our simulation, the neck becomes extremely narrow before <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> = 180<sup>°</sup>. Therefore, we consider vesiculation occurs when <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> reaches 150<sup>°</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>).</p>

<p>First, we analyze the difference between the two models in terms of membrane morphology evolution along their pathways. We fit a circle around the membrane tip and use the radius <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> of the circle to characterize the curvature of the membrane at the tip. When <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> is plotted against the maximal angle <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub>, both models show that <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> decreases with increasing <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">c</xref>). We stress that even though the intrinsic curvature <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> is fixed in the constant curvature model, it does not imply the tip radius along the vesiculation pathway is a constant. When the coating area is small, the geometric curvature at the membrane tip remains small and differs from the intrinsic curvature. Tip radius in the constant curvature model decays more steeply with <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> than in the constant area model. This difference becomes obvious when one plots the ratio of the tip radius at <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> = 150<sup>°</sup> and <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> = 30<sup>°</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">c</xref> insets). For the constant area model, the ratio approximately equals to a constant 0.268 regardless of the coating area <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub>, which agrees well with the analytical result (See <xref ref-type="app" rid="app5">Appendix 5</xref>). For the constant-curvature model, the ratio remains close to 1 only at small values of <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>, as expected from the schematic representation of the model in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. However, as <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> increases, the deviation from this idealized picture becomes increasingly pronounced.</p>
<p>Another difference between the two models is the evolution of the projected area of the clathrin coat on the substrate. We use the maximal radius <italic>R</italic><sub>coat</sub> of the membrane within the clathrin-coated area as the indicator of the projected area (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). In the constant area model, <italic>R</italic><sub>coat</sub> decreases with increasing <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub>, while in the constant curvature model, <italic>R</italic><sub>coat</sub> increases with <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> and reaches a plateau (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">e</xref>). The ratio <italic>R</italic><sub>coat</sub> (150<sup>°</sup>)/<italic>R</italic><sub>coat</sub> (90°) is about 0.732 in the constant area model and around 1 in the constant curvature model (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">e</xref>, insets). The analytical curves of <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>coat</sub> against <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> also fit perfectly with numerical solutions in the constant area model (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">d</xref>, compare dotted and solid curves). Our calculations therefore demonstrate that the two models exhibit clear differences in the evolution of <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>coat</sub> at the beginning of endocytosis (i.e. when <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> is small) which can be determined from shapes of endocytic pits obtained experimentally.</p>
<p>To demonstrate how the coating area <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> and the intrinsic curvature <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> of the clathrin coat influence the membrane morphology, for each pair of (<italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>), we calculate the corresponding membrane shapes and plot the contour lines for <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> which indicate the stage of endocytosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>). The contour line with <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> = 150<sup>°</sup> represents the critical line where vesiculation occurs. The line can be well fitted by the analytical expression <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="607731v3_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>, thick black line, see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4">Appendix 4</xref>). It implies that a small intrinsic curvature of the clathrin coat is able to induce vesiculation of the membrane with a large clathrin coat. We find that the distances between contour lines for higher values of <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> is smaller than those for lower values of <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub>. It means that at the late stage of endocytosis, a small change in <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> could result in a more dramatic change in the membrane shape than that at the early stage. This trend is demonstrated clearly from the orange dots in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>, which correspond to shapes in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>.</p>
<p>Note that in order to produce the phase diagram (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>), it requires that the bending rigidity of the clathrin coated area <italic>κ</italic><sub>coat</sub> is significantly larger than <italic>κ</italic><sub>bare</sub> in the uncoated area. If <italic>κ</italic><sub>coat</sub> is comparable with <italic>κ</italic><sub>bare</sub>, there exists a region in the phase diagram in which a single (<italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>) corresponds to three possible membrane shapes (See <xref rid="figA2_1" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—Figure 1a-d</xref>). Physically, it implies a discontinuous transition in the membrane shape along a path that passes through this region, and a gap in the maximal angle <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> would appear. Because in experiments, a wide spectrum of <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> are observed and no gap in <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> is found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Avinoam et al., 2015</xref>), we keep <italic>κ</italic><sub>coat</sub> much greater than <italic>κ</italic><sub>bare</sub> for the rest of the paper. In this regime, the membrane shapes evolve continuously along any pathway that connects the origin (0, 0) with a point on the critical vesiculation curve.</p>

<title>Vesiculation needs free energy sources to drive clathrin assembly and curvature generation</title>
<p>In the previous section, we take curvature generation in the constant area model and clathrin assembly in the constant curvature model for granted, so that the coating area <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> and the intrinsic curvature <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> are imposed, such that the physical forces behind clathrin assembly and curvature generation are ignored. However, the bending energy <italic>E</italic><sub>b</sub> and the tension energy <italic>E</italic><sub>t</sub> typically increase with <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> along a vesiculation pathway. Therefore, vesiculation will be energetically unfavorable if no additional free energy sources are provided. In this section, we extend the model to include free energy terms for the assembly of the clathrin coat and its reorganization for curvature generation.</p>
<p>To describe the assembly of the clathrin coat in the constant curvature model, we introduce
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>µ</italic> denotes the effective surface binding energy density of clathrin molecules with the membrane. This term reduces the free energy with increasing <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub>, therefore, driving the assembly of clathrin. We can identify three types of free energy curves for different assembly strength <italic>µ</italic>: (1) When <italic>µ</italic> is small, the total free energy <italic>E</italic><sub>tot</sub> = <italic>E</italic><sub>b</sub> + <italic>E</italic><sub>t</sub> + <italic>E</italic><sub>a</sub> as a function of the coating area <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> has two local minima, with the lowest one at a small <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> and the other one at the maximum <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> where vesiculation occurs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, red curve). The minima are separated by an energy barrier that is significantly higher than the thermal energy <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> and the clathrin coat would assemble to a small area and halt. (2) With increasing <italic>µ</italic>, the lowest free energy minimum is shifted to the vesiculation point, but the energy barrier still exists and the clathrin coat remains small (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, orange curve). (3) Vesiculation could happen for large enough <italic>µ</italic> such that the energy barrier vanishes and the free energy <italic>E</italic><sub>tot</sub> monotonically decreases with <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, green). Based on the above analysis of the energy landscape we construct the phase diagram of the constant curvature model with clathrin assembly in the phase space of (<italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>µ</italic>) and classify the points into four types. Besides the three types mentioned above, when the intrinsic curvature <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> is small, increasing <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> to its maximum value (10<sub>5</sub>nm<sub>2</sub>) cannot produce vesiculation. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>, gray region). The critical assembly energy density <italic>µ</italic> at which the energy barrier vanishes is found to increase with the intrinsic curvature <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>, interface between the green region and the orange region), which implies that a larger assembly strength of clathrin coat <italic>µ</italic> is needed to complete vesiculation if the clathrin coat has a higher intrinsic curvature <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>. When comparing the contour lines of the energy barrier Δ<italic>E</italic><sub>tot</sub> = 1<italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> and Δ<italic>E</italic><sub>tot</sub> = 10<italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>, dotted curve and dash-dotted curve), the gap between them increases with <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>, which means that the energy efficiency is reduced with <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> in the sense that, for larger <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>, a larger increase in <italic>µ</italic> is needed to reduce the same amount of free energy.</p>

<p>We next consider curvature generation in the constant area model. As the molecular mechanisms of curvature generation of the clathrin coat remains debated, we introduce a phenomenological model in which the free energy has the general form,
<disp-formula id="eqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>ν</italic> denotes the strength of curvature generation, <italic>m</italic> and <italic>n</italic> are two positive numbers that are associated with the molecular mechanisms of curvature generation. The free energy <italic>E</italic><sub>c</sub> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn6">Equation 6</xref> decreases with increasing <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>, therefore, driving curvature generation. We set <italic>m</italic> = 1 such that <italic>E</italic><sub>c</sub> is proportional to the coating area. Note that <italic>m</italic> cannot be zero, otherwise, <italic>E</italic><sub>c</sub> only depends on the intrinsic curvature <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> and can be nonzero even when the coating area is zero. As for the power <italic>n</italic> of the intrinsic curvature <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>, we set <italic>n</italic> = 1 or 2 (called Model(1,1) and Model(1,2), respectively). Physically, Model(1,2) implies cooperativity in the curvature generation such that the reduction of free energy per increase of unit curvature is proportional to the current curvature, i.e., Δ<italic>E</italic><sub>c</sub> ∝ −<italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>Δ<italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>, while in Model(1,1), the reduction of free energy per increase of unit curvature is independent of current curvature. For Model(1,1), when <italic>ν</italic> is small, the total free energy <italic>E</italic><sub>tot</sub> = <italic>E</italic><sub>b</sub> + <italic>E</italic><sub>t</sub> + <italic>E</italic><sub>c</sub> as a function of the intrinsic curvature <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> has two minima, the lowest one at a small positive <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> and the other one at the maximum <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> where vesiculation occurs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>, red curve). Further curvature generation is strictly limited by the high energy barrier (sometimes more than 100<italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic>) between the two minima. With increasing <italic>ν</italic>, the lowest minimum shifts to the vesiculation point, but the energy barrier still prevents curvature generation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>, orange line). For a large enough <italic>ν</italic>, the free energy monotonically decreases with <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> and the curvature generation proceeds until vesiculation occurs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>, green curve). When the coating area <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> is very small, vesiculation fails to occur even when the intrinsic curvature is increased to its maximum value (0.125nm<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>, gray region). In the phase space of (<italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>ν</italic>), the critical value of <italic>ν</italic> where the energy barrier vanishes increases with the coating area <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>, interface between the orange region and the green region), which implies that a larger clathrin coat needs a stronger strength of curvature generation to complete vesiculation.</p>
<p>Model(1,2) has similar free energy landscape as Model(1,1) (Compare <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">e, d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">f</xref>). However, in Model(1,2), for very small <italic>ν</italic>, the lowest free energy minimum is strictly pinned at <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0, which implies no spontaneous curvature generation. In contrast, the minimum is at a small positive <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> in Model(1,1), which indicates slight curvature generation.</p>

<title>Comparison between different models with the experimental data</title>
<p>The constant area model and the constant curvature model represent two extreme pathways of membrane vesiculation.

For Model(1,2), the best fits are obtained for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="607731v3_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub> = 30nm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). The resulting path moves horizontally at first and then bents up vertically (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>), which resembles the behavior of the constant area model. For Model(1,1), the best fitting parameters are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="607731v3_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub> = 40nm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). The fitting path is almost a straight line towards the vesiculation line (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). The optimum fitting error of Model(1,2) (<italic>ϵ</italic> = 0.14) is slightly better than that of Model(1,1) (<italic>ϵ</italic> = 0.17).</p>
<p>We also perform the fitting procedure to the constant area model and find the optimum parameters are <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1.69 × 10<sup>4</sup>nm<sup>2</sup> and <italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub> = 30nm. For the constant curvature model, the best fitting parameters are <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.043nm<sup>−1</sup> and <italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub> = 50nm. The minimum fitting error of the constant curvature model (<italic>ϵ</italic> = 0.28) is exactly twice as large as that of the constant area model (<italic>ϵ</italic> = 0.14) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">b</xref>). So considering the fitting error and the pathway in (<italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>) phase diagram, we raise the conclusion that the experimental vesiculation process probably favors constant-area-like pathways.</p>
<p>When comparing the model-predicted geometric features with the rolling median of the experimental data, we find that the four models fit almost equally well the experimental data for the neck width(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref> left). Model(1,2) and the constant area model predict very similar results such that the curves almost overlap with each other (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>, red curve and orange curve). The predictions of these two models match the rolling median of the experimental data best. The constant curvature model strongly deviates from the rolling median of the experimental tip radius, particularly in the early stage of vesiculation when <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> &lt; 90<sup>°</sup>.</p>
<p>To facilitate comparison between the axisymmetric membrane shapes predicted by the model and the non-axisymmetric profiles obtained from electron microscopy, we apply a symmetrization procedure to the experimental data, which consist of one-dimensional membrane profiles extracted from cross-sectional views, as detailed in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3">Appendix 3</xref> (see also <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Then, we average the symmetrized profile within an interval of <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> ∈ [<italic>ψ</italic><sub>0</sub> −10<sup>°</sup>, <italic>ψ</italic><sub>0</sub> +10<sup>°</sup>] and overlay the averaged profile with model-predicted shapes for <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> = <italic>ψ</italic><sub>0</sub> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>). At the early stage when the membrane exhibits a dimple shape (0<sup>°</sup> &lt; <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> &lt; 60<sup>°</sup>), the membrane morphology predicted by the constant curvature model is distinguishable from the other three models, particularly when looking at the tip radius. At the late stage when the membrane exhibits an Ω-shape, i.e., <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> &gt; 90<sup>°</sup>, the difference in shape between models is mainly manifested in the invagination depth. The constant curvature model and Model(1,1) mainly predict a deeper invagination depth than the symmetrized experimental profile, while the constant area model and Model(1,2) usually give much better fitting.</p>

<title>Three types of clathrin coats</title>
<p>In this paper, we have constructed a physical model to describe how curvature generation and clathrin assembly are interrelated during the vesiculation process in CME. Previous experiments have reported three groups of clathrin coated pits, which are plaques, abortive pits, and pits that lead to vesiculation, according to their structural and dynamic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Maupin and Pollard, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ehrlich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Loerke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Saffarian and Kirchhausen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kirchhausen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lampe et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, we show that depending on the clathrin assembly strength <italic>µ</italic> and its reorganization strength <italic>ν</italic>, the pathway might end up with three possible final shapes: (i) a flat membrane with no curvature generation, (ii) a nearly flat membrane with small curvature generation, (iii) a spherical cap that leads to vesiculation. They essentially correspond to the three types of clathrin-coated pits found in experiments. Based on the phase diagram of Model(1,2) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>), the difference between the three groups comes from the difference in the assembly and reorganization strengths of clathrin molecules. Furthermore, Model(1, 2) predicts that at the boundary between the type (iii) region and the type (ii) region, the reorganization strength <italic>ν</italic> increases with the assembly strength. This result has important implications to explain why large plaques are commonly observed in experiments. The large area of the plaques are due to the strong assembly strength <italic>µ</italic>. However, for these plaques to go to vesiculation, a strong reorganization energy <italic>ν</italic> is also needed. Therefore, the combination of a strong <italic>µ</italic> and weak <italic>ν</italic> leads to the formation of large plaques. Model(1,2) predicts that a plaque or an abortive pit can be transformed into a vesicle by either increasing the reorganization strength or reducing the assembly strength (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The former ends up with a large vesicle and the latter ends up with a small vesicle. This can be used as a test of our theory with experiments to modify the binding affinity of clathrin molecules with adaptor proteins on the membrane. Weakening the affinity might increase the portion of vesicles and reduce the portion of plaques, though the vesicles would become smaller.</p>

<title>Cooperativity in the curvature generation process</title>
<p>In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, we show the best fitting results for all the four models and find that Model(1,2) produces better fits than Model(1,1), which suggests the existence of cooperativity in the curvature generation process. In particular, if curvature generation is driven by breaking bonds in the hexagonal lattice, cooperativity implies that the number of newly broken bonds is proportional to the number of already broken bonds. Because of this cooperativity, at the early stage of endocytosis bonds are broken slowly and clathrin assembly dominates over curvature generation. At the late stage of endocytosis, an increasing number of bonds are broken and curvature generation could happen rapidly and dominate over clathrin assembly. Altogether, this cooperativity leads to a constant-area-like behavior. Similar effect have been reported in Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mund et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, although our model is purely energetic and does not explicitly incorporate dynamics, we observe in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(a)</xref> that along the green curve—representing the trajectory predicted by model (1,2)—the total free energy <italic>E</italic><sub>tot</sub> exhibits a much sharper decrease at the late stage (near the vesiculation line) compared to the early stage (near the origin). This suggests a transition from slow to fast dynamics during endocytosis. Such a transition is consistent with experimental observations, where significantly fewer number of images with large <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> are captured compared to those with small <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mund et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<title>Saturation effect at high membrane curvatures</title>
<p>Note that our model involves two distinct concepts of curvature growth. The first is the growth of <italic>imposed</italic> curvature—referred to here as <italic>intrinsic curvature</italic> and denoted by the parameter <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>—which is driven by the reorganization of bonds between clathrin molecules within the coat. The second is the growth of the actual <italic>membrane curvature</italic>, reflected by the increasing value of <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub>. The latter process is driven by the former.</p>
<p>Models (1,1) and (1,2) incorporate energy terms (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn6">Equation 6</xref>) that promote the increase of intrinsic curvature <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>, which in turn drives the membrane to adopt a more curved shape (increasing <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub>). In the absence of these energy contributions, the system faces an energy barrier separating a weakly curved membrane state (low <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub>) from a highly curved state (high <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub>). This barrier can be observed, for example, in the red curves of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(a–c)</xref> and in <xref rid="figA6_1" ref-type="fig">Appendix 6–Figure 1</xref>. As a result, membrane bending cannot proceed spontaneously and requires additional energy input from clathrin assembly.</p>
<p>The energy terms described in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn6">Equation 6</xref> serve to eliminate this energy barrier by lowering the energy difference between the uphill and downhill regions of the energy landscape. However, these same terms also steepen the downhill slope, which may lead to overly aggressive curvature growth. To mitigate this effect, one could introduce a saturation-like energy term of the form
<disp-formula id="eqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> represents a saturation curvature. Importantly, adding such a term would not alter the conclusions of our study, since the energy landscape already favors high membrane curvature (i.e., it is downward sloping) even without the additional energy terms.</p>

<title>The difference in membrane morphology between the different models is most salient at the early stage of endocytosis</title>
<p>When we compare the model predictions, we find that the difference in membrane morphology between models is not as big as expected, which might explain why it has been difficult to distinguish between the constant area and the constant curvature models for so long. For instance, the neck width vs. <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> and the invagination depth vs. <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> are similar for all the four models (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>, left and right). The best fitting error of the four models calculated from the geometric features are relatively close, except for the constant curvature model, which gives the worst fit (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). The models are mainly distinguishable from the tip radius vs. <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> plot at the early stage of endocytosis when the membrane is nearly flat (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>, middle), i.e. for shapes with small <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub>. However, published experimental shape at early stages of endocytosis are sparse. Our result hints that in order to distinguish between the models, collecting membrane shapes at the early stage is necessary and the relation of tip radius vs. <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> is the key geometric feature to tell the models apart.</p>

<title>The projected area of clathrin coat in the plane of the plasma membrane could distinguish between the two models</title>
<p>In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">e</xref> we have shown that the coat radius <italic>R</italic><sub>coat</sub>, which represents the projected area of the clathrin coat in the plane of the plasma membrane, as a function of <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> exhibit opposite trends for the constant curvature model and the constant area model. The results suggest that in experiments the projected area for the constant area model would first increase and then decrease over time, finally reaching a plateau. However, for the constant curvature model, the projected area would increase over time and finally reach a plateau without a decreasing phase. This result suggests another method to distinguish between the two models via the projected area measurement. The idea has been used in a study where the clathrin-coated pit was imaged with platinum replica and cryoelectron microscopy and tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sochacki et al., 2021</xref>). The results support a constant-area-like model, consistent with the prediction of our Model(1,2), in which the dome structures have a slightly larger coating area than flat structures. On the other hand, another study has used the super-resolved live cell fluorescence imaging with TIRF to measure the growth of the clathrin coat over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Willy et al., 2021</xref>). The authors found a smooth drop in the projected area of clathrin coat over time. However, based on a computer simulation of clathrin assembly, they concluded that the smooth drop of the projected area was the result of a constant-curvature-like model because a constant-area-like model would produce a sharp drop. We attribute the difference between their model and our model to the fact that they model the clathrin coat as a discrete lattice while we use a continuum mechanics method. More importantly, in their model, the moment at which curvature generation occurs was arbitrarily imposed at 80% of clathrin triskelions. If the transition were chosen to occur with fewer triskelions, e.g. 40%, the sharp drop in the project area might not happen in the constant-area-like model. Furthermore, the authors used the number of triskelions to monitor the progress of endocytosis which terminates when the triskelions reach the maximum number. This choice might bias towards the constant-curvature-like model because the vesiculation may not happen at all when the clathrin numbers reaches its maximum.</p>

<title>The bending rigidity of the coated area should be much larger than the uncoated area</title>
<p>Comparison of our model to experimental data demonstrates that the relative bending rigidities of the coat and the membrane are constrained. Indeed, if <italic>κ</italic><sub>coat</sub> /<italic>κ</italic><sub>bare</sub> &lt; 50, the model predicts an abrupt change (or a gap) in <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> at the end of vesiculation (See <xref rid="figA2_1" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—Figure 1</xref>), i.e., a snap-through transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hassinger et al., 2017</xref>).

<title>Comparison with particle wrapping</title>
<p>The purpose of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis studied in our work is the recycling of membrane and membrane-protein, and the cellular uptake of small molecules from the environment — molecules that are sufficiently small to bind to the membrane or be encapsulated within a vesicle. In contrast, the uptake of larger particles typically involves membrane wrapping driven by adhesion between the membrane and the particle, a process that has also been studied previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Góźdź, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bahrami et al., 2016</xref>). In our model, membrane bending is driven by clathrin assembly, which induces curvature. In particle wrapping, by comparison, the driving force is the adhesion between the membrane and a rigid particle. In the absence of adhesion, wrapping increases both bending and tension energies, creating an energy barrier that separates the flat membrane state from the fully wrapped state. This barrier can hinder complete wrapping, resulting in partial or no engulfment of the particle. Only when the adhesion energy is sufficiently strong can the process proceed to full wrapping. In this context, adhesion plays a role analogous to curvature generation in our model, as both serve to overcome the energy barrier. If the particle is spherical, it imposes a constant-curvature pathway during wrapping. However, the role of clathrin molecules in this process remains unclear and will be the subject of future investigation.</p>

<title>Detailed formula derivation</title>
<p>We assume the membrane shape is axisymmetric and is parameterized with its meridional curve {<italic>r</italic>(<italic>u</italic>), <italic>z</italic>(<italic>u</italic>)}, with <italic>u</italic> = 0 corresponding to the membrane tip and <italic>u</italic> = 1 corresponding to the membrane edge. Our aim is to derive the shape equations via minimizing the bending energy of the membrane under certain geometric constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jülicher and Seifert, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Seifert et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhong-Can and Helfrich, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Hereafter we use <italic>f</italic><sup>′</sup> ≡ d<italic>f</italic>/d<italic>u</italic> to denote the derivative of an arbitrary function <italic>f</italic> with respect to the rescaled arclength <italic>u</italic>. It should be noticed that if {<italic>r</italic>(<italic>u</italic>), <italic>z</italic>(<italic>u</italic>)} describes a membrane shape, {<italic>r</italic>[<italic>g</italic>(<italic>u</italic>)], <italic>z</italic>[<italic>g</italic>(<italic>u</italic>)]} describes the same membrane shape if the function <italic>g</italic> maps the interval [0, 1] to [0, 1], e.g., <italic>g</italic>(<italic>u</italic>) = <italic>u</italic><sup>2</sup>. In order to fix the issue, we introduce <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="607731v3_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and impose that <italic>h</italic> is a constant. By this definition, we essentially let <italic>u</italic> = <italic>s</italic>/<italic>S</italic>, where <italic>s</italic> is the arclength calculated from the membrane tip and <italic>S</italic> is the total arclength. The constant <italic>h</italic> = <italic>S</italic> is an unknown parameter to be determined via solving the shape equations. In order to simplify the form of the bending energy, we introduce the tangent angle <italic>ψ</italic>(<italic>u</italic>) which satisfies the geometric relation:
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
and
<disp-formula id="eqn9">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The two principal curvatures can be expressed as
<disp-formula id="eqn10">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The bending energy of the membrane then reads
<disp-formula id="eqn11">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Note that the bending rigidity <italic>κ</italic>[<italic>a</italic>(<italic>u</italic>)] and the intrinsic curvature <italic>C</italic><sub>0</sub>[<italic>a</italic>(<italic>u</italic>)] are functions of the area <italic>a</italic>(<italic>u</italic>), which fullfils the equation
<disp-formula id="eqn12">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>This relationship means that we study an inhomogeneous membrane which is locally in-compressible in its area. In order to impose the geometric relation Eqs. (8),(9) and (12), we introduce three Lagrangian multipliers <italic>γ</italic>(<italic>u</italic>), <italic>η</italic>(<italic>u</italic>) and <italic>σ</italic>(<italic>u</italic>) to the integral
<disp-formula id="eqn13">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The total free energy to be minimized under the geometric constraints reads
<disp-formula id="eqn14">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
in which ℰ reads
<disp-formula id="eqn15">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The variation of the functional <italic>E</italic><sub>tot</sub> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn14">Equation 14</xref> reads
<disp-formula id="eqn16">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
which contains both the bulk terms (first line) and the boundary terms (second line). The Euler-Lagrange equations can be obtained by the vanishing of the former 7 bulk terms, which are reduced to
<disp-formula id="eqn17">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn18">

</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn19">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn19.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
and
<disp-formula id="eqn20">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn20.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
as well as Eqs. (8), (9) and (12). Note that the vanishing bulk term of <italic>δh</italic> gives us
<disp-formula id="eqn21">
<graphic xlink:href="607731v3_eqn21.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
which is a boundary condition (not one of the differential equations).</p>
<p>Next, we need 9 boundary conditions (BCs) to numerically solve 6 first-order differential equations, 1 second-order differential equation together with 1 unknown parameter. At the membrane tip <italic>u</italic> = 0, we can easily obtain <italic>r</italic>(0) = 0, <italic>ψ</italic>(0) = 0, <italic>a</italic>(0) = 0 by geometric relations. Then, <italic>∂</italic> ℰ /<italic>∂h</italic> = 0 given by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn21">Equation 21</xref> is satisfied at <italic>u</italic> = 0. At the membrane base <italic>u</italic> = 1, we can also easily get <italic>r</italic>(1) = <italic>R</italic><sub>b</sub>, <italic>z</italic>(1) = 0 by geometric relations, where <italic>R</italic><sub>b</sub> is the distance from the boundary <italic>u</italic> = 1 to the axisymmetric axis. All boundary terms in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Equation 16</xref> vanish simultaneously because geometric relations lead to <italic>δf</italic> = 0, except <italic>δz</italic> at <italic>u</italic> = 0 and <italic>δψ</italic> at <italic>u</italic> = 1. This forces <italic>∂</italic> ℰ /<italic>∂z</italic><sup>′</sup> = 0, which is, <italic>η</italic>(0) = 0, and <italic>∂</italic> ℰ /<italic>∂ψ</italic><sup>′</sup> = 0, and leads to

<title>Gap of maximum angle</title>
<p>All of our results in the main text were computed under the assumption of a very large ratio <italic>κ</italic><sub>coat</sub> /<italic>κ</italic><sub>bare</sub> = 50 to prevent a discontinuous jump of <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub>. When <italic>κ</italic><sub>coat</sub> /<italic>κ</italic><sub>bare</sub> = 5, the gap of <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> is observable in some (<italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>) sets (<xref rid="figA2_1" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—Figure 1</xref>). For the constant area model, the gap is observed around <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> = 125<sup>°</sup> when <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> is above a limit value and increases slightly with increasing <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> (<xref rid="figA2_1" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—Figure 1a</xref>). The solid and dotted lines deviate further with an increasing <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub>. The dotted free energy curve with larger <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> generates a Gibbs triangle (<xref rid="figA2_1" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—Figure 1c</xref>). The bottom point of the Gibbs triangle is the phase change point and corresponds to the <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> value where the gap of <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> is situated on. When <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> is less than the limit value, the free energy curve is smooth and has no obvious phase change point. Result in the constant curvature model is qualitatively similar to the constant area model (<xref rid="figA2_1" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA2_1">d</xref>). If <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> gap exists, the dotted line and solid line intersect at three multiple-solution points with the same <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p>The (<italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>) phase diagram shows how both arguments effect on <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> gap (<xref rid="figA2_1" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—Figure 1e</xref>). The orange lines shows the deviation and variation trend between the dotted lines and the solid lines in <xref rid="figA2_1" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—Figure 1a</xref> and b. Note that the deviation of any path that starts from the origin and terminates on the vesiculation boundary can be described by orange lines, rather than just constant curvature paths or constant area paths. A physical vesiculation pathway just goes across three orange lines directly and terminates at the vesiculation boundary while a numerical one turns back at the upper line, then turns back at the lower line, and finally completes vesiculation. Note that some section of the upper dotted curve overlaps with the numerical vesiculation boundary, because the system reaches vesiculation boundary before passing through the phase change point. Finally, the introduction of the assembly energy and the reorganization energy have no effect on <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> gap, and just change the shape of the Gibbs triangle.</p>

<title>Boundary radius value</title>
<p>We set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="607731v3_inline16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> throughout our study. Values of tip radius and neck radius appear almost identical for different <italic>R</italic><sub>b</sub> in both models (<xref rid="figA2_2" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2—Figure 2</xref>). However, membrane heights have distinct differences for different <italic>R</italic><sub>b</sub> when <italic>ψ</italic><sub>max</sub> is in the middle range. This difference is likely due to fact the uncoated area contains a smaller region able to generate curvature and does not contribute in lifting the membrane center at this stage. From <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="607731v3_inline17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="607731v3_inline18.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, the curves are virtually identical, even for membrane height. Since a larger <italic>R</italic><sub>b</sub> requires a larger number of mesh points in the simulations, we chose <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="607731v3_inline19.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> to balance computation time and numerical accuracy.</p>

The undeformed shape of the coating area is a spherical cap with curvature <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> and the uncoated area is flat.

This result is confirmed by numerical analyses and can be used to differentiate the two models from experimental data. The area of a spherical cap is

<p>Therefore, we calculate the ratios <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> (150<sup>°</sup>)/<italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> (30<sup>°</sup>) ≈ 0.268 and <italic>R</italic><sub>coat</sub> (150<sup>°</sup>)/<italic>R</italic><sub>coat</sub> (90<sup>°</sup>) ≈ 0.732, which both are close to the results from the numerical simulations.

which holds true for any <italic>θ</italic>.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study proposes a theoretical model of clathrin coat formation based on membrane elasticity that seeks to determine whether this process occurs by increasing the area of a protein-coated patch with constant curvature, or by increasing the curvature of a protein-coated patch that forms in an initially flat conformation (so called constant curvature or constant area models). Identifying energetically favorable pathways and comparing the obtained shapes with experiments provides <bold>solid</bold> support to the constant-area pathway. This work will be of interest for biologists and biophysicists interested in membrane remodelling and endocytosis. It provides an innovative approach to tackle the question of constant curvature vs. constant area coat protein formation, although some of the model's assumption are only partially supported by experimental evidence.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors employ theoretical analysis of an elastic membrane model to explore membrane vesiculation pathways in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. A complete understanding of clathrin-mediated endocytosis requires detailed insight into the process of membrane remodeling, as the underlying mechanisms of membrane shape transformation remain controversial, particularly regarding membrane curvature generation. The authors compare constant area and constant membrane curvature as key scenarios by which clathrins induce membrane wrapping around the cargo to accomplish endocytosis. First, they characterize the geometrical aspects of the two scenarios and highlight their differences by imposing coating area and membrane spontaneous curvature. They then examine the energetics of the process to understand the driving mechanisms behind membrane shape transformations in each model. In the latter part, they introduce two energy terms: clathrin assembly or binding energy, and curvature generation energy, with two distinct approaches for the latter. Finally, they identify the energetically favorable pathway in the combined scenario and compare their results with experiments, showing that the constant-area pathway better fits the experimental data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well-written, well-organized, and presents the details of the theoretical analysis with sufficient clarity.</p>
<p>
The calculations are valid, and the elastic membrane model is an appropriate choice for addressing the differences between the constant curvature and constant area models.</p>
<p>
The authors' approach of distinguishing two distinct free energy terms-clathrin assembly and curvature generation-and then combining them to identify the favorable pathway is both innovative and effective in addressing the problem.</p>
<p>
Notably, their identification of the energetically favorable pathways, and how these pathways either lead to full endocytosis or fail to proceed due to insufficient energetic drives, is particularly insightful.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have carefully addressed all my comments, and the revised manuscript is now clear, rigorous, and satisfactory.</p>

<p>One thing that is unclear is what is new with this work. If the main finding is that the differences are in the early stages of endocytosis, then one wonders if that should be tested experimentally. Also, the role of clathrin assembly and adhesion are treated as mechanical equilibrium but perhaps the process should not be described as equilibria but rather a time-dependent process. Ultimately, there are so many models that address this question that without direct experimental comparison, it's hard to place value on the model prediction.</p>

<p>Thank you for your insightful questions. We fully agree that distinguishing between the two models should ultimately be guided by experimental tests. This is precisely the motivation for including Fig. 5 in our manuscript, where we compare our theoretical predictions with experimental data. In the middle panel of Fig. 5, we observe that the predicted tip radius as a function of 𝜓<sub><italic>𝑚𝑎𝑥</italic></sub> from the constant curvature model (magenta curve) deviates significantly from both the experimental data points and the rolling median, highlighting the inconsistency of this model with the data.</p>
<p>Regarding our treatment of clathrin assembly and membrane adhesion as mechanical equilibrium processes, our reasoning is based on a timescale separation argument. Clathrin assembly typically occurs over approximately 1 minute. In contrast, the characteristic relaxation time for a lipid membrane to reach mechanical equilibrium is given by <inline-formula id="sa3equ1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-102591-sa3-equ1.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>, where 𝜇∼5 × 10<sup>-9</sup> 𝑁𝑠𝑚<sup>-1</sup> is the membrane viscosity, 𝑅<sub>0</sub> =50𝑛𝑚 is the vesicle size, 𝜅=20 𝑘<sub>𝐵</sub>𝑇 is the bending rigidity. This yields a relaxation time of 𝜏≈1.5 × 10<sup>−4</sup>𝑠, which is several orders of magnitude shorter than the timescale of clathrin assembly. Therefore, it is reasonable to treat the membrane shape as being in mechanical equilibrium throughout the assembly process.</p>
<p>We believe the value of our model lies in the following key novelties:</p>
<p>(1) Model novelty: We introduce an energy term associated with curvature generation, a contribution that is typically neglected in previous models.</p>
<p>(2) Methodological novelty: We perform a quantitative comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental data, whereas most earlier studies rely on qualitative comparisons.</p>
<p>(3) Results novelty: Our quantitative analysis enables us to unambiguously exclude the constant curvature hypothesis based on time-independent electron microscopy data.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript (line 141), we have added a statement about why we treat the clathrin assembly as in mechanical equilibrium.</p>

<p>While an attempt is made to do so with prior published EM images, there is excessive uncertainty in both the data itself as is usually the case but also in the methods that are used to symmetrize the data. This reviewer wonders about any goodness of fit when such uncertainty is taken into account.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Author response: We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. We agree that there is uncertainty in the experimental data. Our decision to symmetrize the data is based on the following considerations:</p>
<p>(1) The experimental data provide a one-dimensional membrane profile corresponding to a cross-sectional view. To reconstruct the full two-dimensional membrane surface, we must assume rotational symmetry.</p>
<p>(2)In addition to symmetrization, we also average membrane profiles within a certain range of 𝜓<sub>𝑚𝑎𝑥</sub> values (see Fig. 5d). This averaging helps reduce the uncertainty (due to biological and experimental variability) inherent to individual measurements.</p>
<p>(3)To further address the noise in the experimental data, we compare our theoretical predictions not only with individual data points but also with a rolling median, which provides a smoothed representation of the experimental trends.</p>
<p>These steps are taken to ensure a more robust and meaningful comparison between theory and experiments.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript (line 338), we have explained why we have to symmetrize the data:</p>
<p>“To facilitate comparison between the axisymmetric membrane shapes predicted by the model and the non-axisymmetric profiles obtained from electron microscopy, we apply a symmetrization procedure to the experimental data, which consist of one-dimensional membrane profiles extracted from cross-sectional views, as detailed in Appendix 3 (see also Appendix 3--Fig. 1).”</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors employ theoretical analysis of an elastic membrane model to explore membrane vesiculation pathways in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. A complete understanding of clathrin-mediated endocytosis requires detailed insight into the process of membrane remodeling, as the underlying mechanisms of membrane shape transformation remain controversial, particularly regarding membrane curvature generation. The authors compare constant area and constant membrane curvature as key scenarios by which clathrins induce membrane wrapping around the cargo to accomplish endocytosis. First, they characterize the geometrical aspects of the two scenarios and highlight their differences by imposing coating area and membrane spontaneous curvature. They then examine the energetics of the process to understand the driving mechanisms behind membrane shape transformations in each model. In the latter part, they introduce two energy terms: clathrin assembly or binding energy, and curvature generation energy, with two distinct approaches for the latter. Finally, they identify the energetically favorable pathway in the combined scenario and compare their results with experiments, showing that the constant-area pathway better fits the experimental data.</p>

<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The manuscript is well-written, well-organized, and presents the details of the theoretical analysis with sufficient clarity. The calculations are valid, and the elastic membrane model is an appropriate choice for addressing the differences between the constant curvature and constant area models.</p>
<p>The authors' approach of distinguishing two distinct free energy terms-clathrin assembly and curvature generation-and then combining them to identify the favorable pathway is both innovative and effective in addressing the problem.</p>
<p>Notably, their identification of the energetically favorable pathways, and how these pathways either lead to full endocytosis or fail to proceed due to insufficient energetic drives, is particularly insightful.</p>

<p>Weaknesses and Recommendations</p>
<p>Weakness: Membrane remodeling in cellular processes is typically studied in either a constant area or constant tension ensemble. While total membrane area is preserved in the constant area ensemble, membrane area varies in the constant tension ensemble. In this manuscript, the authors use the constant tension ensemble with a fixed membrane tension, σe. However, they also use a constant area scenario, where 'area' refers to the surface area of the clathrin-coated membrane segment. This distinction between the constant membrane area ensemble and the constant area of the coated membrane segment may cause confusion.</p>
<p>Recommendation: I suggest the authors clarify this by clearly distinguishing between the two concepts by discussing the constant tension ensemble employed in their theoretical analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this question.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript (line 136), we have added a sentence, emphasizing the implication of the term “constant area model”:</p>
<p>“We emphasize that the constant area model refers to the assumption that the clathrin-coated area 𝑎<sub>0</sub> remains fixed. Meanwhile, the membrane tension 𝜎<sub>𝑒</sub> at the base is held constant, allowing the total membrane area 𝐴𝐴 to vary in response to deformations induced by the clathrin coat.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weakness: As mentioned earlier, the theoretical analysis is performed in the constant membrane tension ensemble at a fixed membrane tension. The total free energy E_tot of the system consists of membrane bending energy E_b and tensile energy E_t, which depends on membrane tension, σe. Although the authors mention the importance of both E_b and E_t, they do not present their individual contributions to the total energy changes. Comparing these contributions would enable readers to cross-check the results with existing literature, which primarily focuses on the role of membrane bending rigidity and membrane tension.</p>
<p>Recommendation: While a detailed discussion of how membrane tension affects their results may fall outside the scope of this manuscript, I suggest the authors at least discuss the total membrane area variation and the contribution of tensile energy E_t for the singular value of membrane tension used in their analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the insightful suggestion. In the revised manuscript (line 916), we have added Appendix 6 and a supplementary figure to compare the bending energy 𝐸<sub>𝑏</sub> and the tension energy 𝐸<sub>𝑡</sub>. Our analysis shows that both energy components exhibit an energy barrier between the flat and vesiculated membrane states, with the tension energy contributing more significantly than the bending energy.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript (line 151), we have also added one paragraph explaining why we set the dimensionless tension <inline-formula id="sa3equ2"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-102591-sa3-equ2.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>. This choice is motivated by our use of the characteristic length <inline-formula id="sa3equ3"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-102591-sa3-equ3.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> as the length scale, and <inline-formula id="sa3equ4"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-102591-sa3-equ4.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> as the energy scale. In this way, the dimensionless tension energy is written as</p>
<disp-formula id="sa3equ5">
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-102591-sa3-equ5.jpg" mimetype="image"/>

<p>Where <inline-formula id="sa3equ6"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-102591-sa3-equ6.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> is the dimensionless area.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weakness: The authors introduce two different models, (1,1) and (1,2), for generating membrane curvature. Model 1 assumes a constant curvature growth, corresponding to linear curvature growth, while Model 2 relates curvature growth to its current value, resembling exponential curvature growth. Although both models make physical sense in general, I am concerned that Model 2 may lead to artificial membrane bending at high curvatures. Normally, for intermediate bending, ψ &gt; 90, the bending process is energetically downhill and thus proceeds rapidly. The bending process is energetically downhill and thus proceeds rapidly. However, Model 2's assumption would accelerate curvature growth even further. This is reflected in the endocytic pathways represented by the green curves in the two rightmost panels of Fig. 4a, where the energy steeply increases at large ψ. I believe a more realistic version of Model 2 would require a saturation mechanism to limit curvature growth at high curvatures.</p>
<p>Recommendation 1: I suggest the authors discuss this point and highlight the pros and cons of Model 2. Specifically, addressing the potential issue of artificial membrane bending at high curvatures and considering the need for a saturation mechanism to limit excessive curvature growth. A discussion on how Model 2 compares to Model 1 in terms of physical relevance, especially in the context of high curvature scenarios, would provide valuable insights for the reader.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising the question of excessive curvature growth in our models and the constructive suggestion of introducing a saturation mechanism. In the revised manuscript (line 405), following your recommendation, we have added a subsection “Saturation effect at high membrane curvatures” in the discussion to clarify the excessive curvature issue and a possible way to introduce a saturation mechanism:</p>
<p>“Note that our model involves two distinct concepts of curvature growth. The first is the growth of imposed curvature — referred to here as intrinsic curvature and denoted by the parameter 𝑐<sub>0</sub> — which is driven by the reorganization of bonds between clathrin molecules within the coat. The second is the growth of the actual membrane curvature, reflected by the increasing value of 𝜓<sub>𝑚𝑎𝑥</sub>.</p>
<p>The latter process is driven by the former.</p>
<p>Models (1,1) and (1,2) incorporate energy terms (Equation 6) that promote the increase of intrinsic curvature 𝑐<sub>0</sub>, which in turn drives the membrane to adopt a more curved shape (increasing 𝜓<sub>𝑚𝑎𝑥</sub>). In the absence of these energy contributions, the system faces an energy barrier separating a weakly curved membrane state (low 𝜓<sub>𝑚𝑎𝑥</sub>) from a highly curved state (high 𝜓<sub>𝑚𝑎𝑥</sub>). This barrier can be observed, for example, in the red curves of Figure 3(a–c) and in Appendix 6—Figure 1. As a result, membrane bending cannot proceed spontaneously and requires additional energy input from clathrin assembly.</p>
<p>The energy terms described in Equation 6 serve to eliminate this energy barrier by lowering the energy difference between the uphill and downhill regions of the energy landscape. However, these same terms also steepen the downhill slope, which may lead to overly aggressive curvature growth.</p>
<p>To mitigate this effect, one could introduce a saturation-like energy term of the form:</p>
<disp-formula id="sa3equ7">
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-102591-sa3-equ7.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>where 𝑐<sub>𝑠</sub> represents a saturation curvature. Importantly, adding such a term would not alter the conclusions of our study, since the energy landscape already favors high membrane curvature (i.e., it is downward sloping) even without the additional energy terms. “</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Recommendation 2: Referring to the previous point, the green curves in the two rightmost panels of Fig. 4a seem to reflect a comparison between slow and fast bending regimes. The initial slow vesiculation (with small curvature growth) in the left half of the green curves is followed by much more rapid curvature growth beyond a certain threshold. A similar behavior is observed in Model 1, as shown by the green curves in the two rightmost panels of Fig. 4b. I believe this transition between slow and fast bending warrants a brief discussion in the manuscript, as it could provide further insight into the dynamic nature of vesiculation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your constructive suggestion regarding the transition between slow and fast membrane bending. As you pointed out, in both Fig. 4a (model (1,2)) and Fig. 4b (model (1,1)), the green curves tend to extend vertically at the late stage. This suggests a significant increase in 𝑐<sub>0</sub> on the free energy landscape. However, we remain cautious about directly interpreting this vertical trend as indicative of fast endocytic dynamics, since our model is purely energetic and does not explicitly incorporate kinetic details. Meanwhile, we agree with your observation that the steep decrease in free energy along the green curve could correspond to an acceleration in dynamics. To address this point, we have added a paragraph in the revised manuscript (in Subsection “Cooperativity in the curvature generation process”) discussing this potential transition and its consistency with experimental observations (line 395):</p>
<p>“Furthermore, although our model is purely energetic and does not explicitly incorporate dynamics, we observe in Figure 3(a) that along the green curve—representing the trajectory predicted by model (1,2)—the total free energy (𝐸<sub>𝑡𝑜𝑡</sub>) exhibits a much sharper decrease at the late stage (near the vesiculation line) compared to the early stage (near the origin). This suggests a transition from slow to fast dynamics during endocytosis. Such a transition is consistent with experimental observations, where significantly fewer number of images with large 𝜓<sub>𝑚𝑎𝑥</sub> are captured compared to those with small 𝜓<sub>𝑚𝑎𝑥</sub> (Mund et al., 2023).”</p>

<p>The geometrical properties of both the constant-area and constant-curvature scenarios, as well depicted in Fig. 1, are somewhat straightforward. I wonder what additional value is presented in Fig. 2. Specifically, the authors solve differential shape equations to show how Rt and Rcoat vary with the angle ψ, but this behavior seems predictable from the simple schematics in Fig. 1. Using a more complex model for an intuitively understandable process may introduce counter-intuitive results and unnecessary complications, as seen with the constant-curvature model where Rt varies (the tip radius is not constant, as noted in the text) despite being assumed constant. One could easily assume a constant-curvature model and plot Rt versus ψ. I wonder What is the added value of solving shape equations to measure geometrical properties, compared to a simpler schematic approach (without solving shape equations) similar to what they do in App. 5 for the ratio of the Rt at ψ=30 and 150.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this important question. While simple and intuitive theoretical models are indeed convenient to use, their validity must be carefully assessed. The approximate model becomes inaccurate when the clathrin shell significantly deviates from its intrinsic shape, namely a spherical cap characterized by intrinsic curvature 𝑐<sub>0</sub>. As shown in the insets of Fig. 2b and 2c (red line and black points), our comparison between the simplified model and the full model demonstrates that the simple model provides a good approximation under the constant-area constraint. However, it performs poorly under the constant-curvature constraint, and the deviation between the full model and the simplified model becomes more pronounced as 𝑐<sub>0</sub> increases.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we have added a sentence emphasizing the discrepancy between the exact calculation with the idealized picture for the constant curvature model (line 181):</p>
<p>“For the constant-curvature model, the ratio remains close to 1 only at small values of 𝑐<sub>0</sub>, as expected from the schematic representation of the model in Figure 1. However, as 𝑐<sub>0</sub> increases, the deviation from this idealized picture becomes increasingly pronounced.”</p>

<p>Recommendation: The clathrin-mediated endocytosis aims at wrapping cellular cargos such as viruses which are typically spherical objects which perfectly match the constant-curvature scenario. In this context, wrapping nanoparticles by vesicles resembles constant-curvature membrane bending in endocytosis. In particular analogous shape transitions and energy barriers have been reported (similar to Fig.3 of the manuscript) using similar theoretical frameworks by varying membrane particle binding energy acting against membrane bending:</p>
<p>DOI: 10.1021/la063522m</p>
<p>DOI: 10.1039/C5SM01793A</p>
<p>I think a short comparison to particle wrapping by vesicles is warranted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your constructive suggestion to compare our model with particle wrapping. In the revised manuscript (line 475), we have added a subsection “Comparison with particle wrapping” in the discussion:</p>
<p>“The purpose of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis studied in our work is the recycling of membrane and membrane-protein, and the cellular uptake of small molecules from the environment — molecules that are sufficiently small to bind to the membrane or be encapsulated within a vesicle. In contrast, the uptake of larger particles typically involves membrane wrapping driven by adhesion between the membrane and the particle, a process that has also been studied previously (Góźdź, 2007; Bahrami et al., 2016). In our model, membrane bending is driven by clathrin assembly, which induces curvature. In particle wrapping, by comparison, the driving force is the adhesion between the membrane and a rigid particle. In the absence of adhesion, wrapping increases both bending and tension energies, creating an energy barrier that separates the flat membrane state from the fully wrapped state. This barrier can hinder complete wrapping, resulting in partial or no engulfment of the particle. Only when the adhesion energy is sufficiently strong can the process proceed to full wrapping. In this context, adhesion plays a role analogous to curvature generation in our model, as both serve to overcome the energy barrier. If the particle is spherical, it imposes a constant-curvature pathway during wrapping. However, the role of clathrin molecules in this process remains unclear and will be the subject of future investigation.”</p>
