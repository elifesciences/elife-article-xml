<title>Abstract</title><p>Mycofactocin is a redox cofactor essential for the alcohol metabolism of Mycobacteria. While the biosynthesis of mycofactocin is well established, the gene <italic>mftG</italic>, which encodes an oxidoreductase of the glucose-methanol-choline superfamily, remained functionally uncharacterized. Here, we show that MftG enzymes strictly require <italic>mft</italic> biosynthetic genes and are found in 75% of organisms harboring these genes. Gene deletion experiments in <italic>Mycolicibacterium smegmatis</italic> demonstrated a growth defect of the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutant on ethanol as a carbon source, accompanied by an arrest of cell division reminiscent of mild starvation. Investigation of carbon and cofactor metabolism implied a defect in mycofactocin reoxidation. Cell-free enzyme assays and respirometry using isolated cell membranes indicated that MftG acts as a mycofactocin dehydrogenase shuttling electrons toward the respiratory chain. Transcriptomics studies also indicated remodeling of redox metabolism to compensate for a shortage of redox equivalents. In conclusion, this work closes an important knowledge gap concerning the mycofactocin system and adds a new pathway to the intricate web of redox reactions governing the metabolism of mycobacteria.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mycobacteria are a metabolically versatile group of microorganisms that are able to utilize various organic compounds for their carbon and energy metabolism. Especially environmental mycobacteria like <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> utilize for instance sugars, polyols, small organic acids, fatty acids, or sterols for their growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). While obligate pathogens like <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, the causative agent of tuberculosis, are more limited in their menu, they still retain the ability to metabolize various nutrients available in the host organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Intriguingly, alcohols like ethanol are readily consumed by many mycobacterial species, but the metabolic pathway for ethanol consumption requires genes related to the biosynthesis of the unusual redox cofactor mycofactocin (MFT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Indeed, the inactivation of the mycofactocin biosynthetic gene cluster <italic>mftA-F</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>) showed a severe impact on the growth of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> and <italic>M. marinum</italic> cultivated on ethanol as the sole carbon source. For <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis,</italic> a similar growth deficit on media containing ethanol and cholesterol was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). In <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, it was shown that the gene MSMEG_6242, encoding a MFT-associated alcohol dehydrogenase (termed Mno or Mdo), is strictly required for alcohol utilization. Mno/Mdo was also demonstrated to catalyze methanol metabolism in the same organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) and involvement of mycofactocin in this process was suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Furthermore, a metabolomics study conducted in our lab revealed that MFT production in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> was significantly increased on ethanol as carbon source in comparison to a control cultivated on glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Recently, a homolog of Mdo was shown to be essential for MFT-dependent ethylene glycol oxidation in <italic>Rhodococcus jostii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). All of this evidence supported the hypothesis that mycofactocin enables alcohol metabolism by acting as an electron acceptor of alcohol dehydrogenases (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>).</p>

<p>Although the role of MFT in alcohol metabolism is well established, further biological roles of mycofactocin appear to exist. Intriguingly, the MFT gene locus seems to be derepressed by long-chain fatty acid-CoA esters in <italic>M. smegmatis,</italic> which bind to the repressor <italic>mftR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Furthermore, a comparison of the proteome of active and dormant cells revealed that <italic>mftD</italic> (Rv0694) was upregulated in the dormant state, which is associated with the persistence of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Lastly, a study on the impact of mycofactocin inactivation (Δ<italic>mftD</italic>) on <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> showed increased growth on glucose containing media as well as a decreased number of mycobacterial cells in a mouse model after the onset of hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>Mycofactocin is a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). After translation, the precursor peptide MftA is bound by its chaperone MftB and undergoes several modifications until it matures into a redox-active molecule. More precisely, its C-terminal core peptide (Val-Tyr) is decarboxylated and cyclized by the radical SAM maturase MftC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). The cyclized core peptide (AHDP) is liberated from the precursor by the peptidase MftE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The flavoenzyme MftD further deaminates AHDP to premycofactocin (PMFT) thus creating a redox-active ketoamide moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, mycofactocins exist in oligoglycosylated forms (MFT-n), where n denotes the number of <italic>β</italic>-1,4-linked glucose moieties. The glycosylation requires the presence of the glycosyltransferase MftF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In some mycobacteria, the glycosyl chain of MFT-n is further modified by methylation at the second sugar moiety (yielding MMFT-n) by the mycofactocin-associated methyltransferase MftM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>).</p>
<p>The reduction of M/MFT-n to M/MFT-nH<sub>2</sub> during growth on ethanol is likely to be catalyzed by the above-mentioned alcohol dehydrogenase Mno/Mdo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). However, two important questions remained open concerning the mycofactocin system. First, it is unclear how MFT-nH<sub>2</sub> is re-oxidized to MFT-n after reduction by Mno/Mdo or other enzymes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). Such a step would be crucial to regenerate the cofactor and allow for further electron transfer to terminal electron acceptors such as oxygen. Second, the role of the <italic>mftG</italic> gene (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>), the terminal gene in the <italic>mft</italic> gene cluster of mycobacteria, encoding a flavoenzyme of the glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductase superfamily remained unknown. GMC oxidoreductases are present in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) and are known to catalyze redox reactions using a variety of different types of substrates and electron acceptors. Prominent examples are the fungal glucose oxidases, which are used in portable glucose biosensors for diabetes patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Other important representatives are the alcohol oxidases from the methylotrophic yeast <italic>Pichia pastoris,</italic> which uses oxygen as an electron acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), or the choline dehydrogenase of <italic>E. coli</italic>, which feeds electrons into the electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that MftG may be an oxidoreductase involved in mycofactocin-related metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Here, we show that <italic>mftG</italic> (MSMEG_1428), encoding a flavoenzyme of the GMC family, is crucial for ethanol metabolism of the model organism <italic>Mycolicibacterium smegmatis.</italic> We further present evidence that MftG acts as a mycofactocin dehydrogenase and promotes MFT regeneration via electron transfer to the respiratory chain of mycobacteria.</p>

<title>Phylogeny and co-occurrence of <italic>mftG</italic> and mycofactocin</title>
<p>Primary sequence alignments with known members of the GMC family and AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) prediction of the tertiary structure of MftG (WP_014877070.1) from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> MC<sup>2</sup> 155 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>) confirmed that MftG is a protein of the GMC superfamily with an intact FAD binding pocket (Rossmann fold) and a conserved active site histidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). While these properties are general characteristics of the GMC superfamily, a hallmark of the MftG subfamily of GMC oxidoreductases is their tight genetic linkage to the mycofactocin biosynthetic gene cluster <italic>mftA-F</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). These MFT-associated GMC homologs are defined by three protein families. The first, TIGR03970.1 (dehydrogenase, Rv0697 family) describes proteins from various actinobacteria and includes the <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> homolog. The other two families are TIGR04542 (GMC_mycofac_2) and NF038210.1 (GMC_mycofac_3). TIGR04542 is specific to the <italic>Gordonia</italic> genus, while NF038210.1 is exclusive to the <italic>Dietzia</italic> genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To further investigate the co-occurrence of <italic>mftG</italic> with the <italic>mft</italic> gene cluster we retrieved a set of genomes encoding MftG or MftC homologs, the latter serving as a proxy for the <italic>mft</italic> biosynthetic gene cluster (<bold>Supplementary Table S1</bold>). To refine the annotation of MftGs, we first performed a phylogenetic analysis. To the MftG candidates, we added further GMC-superfamily enzymes from the same genome set as well as sixteen experimentally characterized GMC enzymes used in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Maximum Likelihood analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Figure S1</bold>) clustered the MftG candidates described by TIGR03970 into a well-supported clade, which comprised MftG proteins from <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>, other <italic>Nocardiaceae</italic> and <italic>Mycobacteriaceae</italic>. The <italic>Gordonia</italic> and <italic>Dietzia</italic> MftG candidates were also phylogenetically related to the main MftG clade. We therefore defined all sequences belonging to this clade as MftG. Two sequences previously annotated as MftG, however, were placed outside of the proposed MftG clade. Their corresponding genomes (<italic>Nocardia terpenica</italic> and <italic>Peterkaempfera bronchialis</italic>) did not contain any MftC candidate and the MftG candidates were therefore treated as misannotations. We conclude that all MftG candidates are monophyletic. To further improve the annotations, the gene neighborhood of the MftG candidates was investigated, confirming that MftG candidates are frequently encoded within a 5 kb distance from <italic>mft</italic> genes (<bold>Supplementary Table S1</bold>). After refinement of the MftG annotation, we proceeded with co-occurrence analysis of MftC and MftG in our microbial genome set. In a total of 312 genomes that contained either MftC or MftG, 311 encoded an MftC homolog, and 235 encoded a putative MftG homolog. In 234 genomes the two genes co-occurred (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). This result reinforced the hypothesis that MftG enzymes strictly require mycofactocin. On the other hand, about 25% of the genomes encoding MftC, lack an MftG enzyme. It remains an open question for future investigations, whether other enzymes can complement the function of MftG or whether the function of MftG is dispensable in these organisms.</p>

<title>The role of MftG in growth and metabolism of mycobacteria</title>
<p>To investigate the physiological role of MftG, a <italic>mftG</italic> deletion mutant (Δ<italic>mftG</italic>) was generated in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> MC<sup>2</sup> 155. Since <italic>mft</italic> mutant strains typically display defects in ethanol utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), we compared the growth of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> MC<sup>2</sup> 155 Δ<italic>mftG</italic> with the WT (wild-type) strain on media containing 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> of ethanol as the sole carbon source (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). Indeed, almost no growth of Δ<italic>mftG</italic> was detected on ethanol (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>), whereas the growth curve of the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutant on glucose-containing media was indistinguishable from the isogenic WT strain (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We also investigated the growth of the WT and the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> strain on several related carbon sources and recorded growth curves (<bold>Supplementary Figure S2</bold>). The growth of WT and mutant strains was not supported by 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> methanol, 5 g L<sup>−1</sup> hexanol, 0.01 g L<sup>−1</sup> acetaldehyde as sole carbon sources as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Notably, WT and Δ<italic>mftG</italic> cells displayed significant growth with 5 g L<sup>−1</sup> acetate or 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> glycerol. However, evaluation of the growth using other alcohols showed differential behavior. A prolonged lag phase of the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> strain was detected on 1-propanol (29 h), 1-butanol (18 h), and 1,3-propanediol (20 h) compared to the WT strain. Interestingly, a putative 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase (MSMEG_6239) is present in the same operon as MSMEG_6242, indicating that 1,3-propanediol degradation might be also MFT-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). We further assessed the growth of Δ<italic>mftG</italic> using a panel of phenotype microarrays. While no further defect regarding carbon source utilization was detected, the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutant showed the ability to grow to a small extent on formic acid in contrast to the WT. Besides the different usage of carbon sources, only minor differences in bacterial growth were found in some of the sensitivity plates (<bold>Supplementary Figure S3)</bold> demonstrating that the lack of the <italic>mftG</italic> gene did not induce relevant sensitivity towards antibiotics and stressors compared to WT when grown on glucose alone.</p>

<title>The role of Δ<italic>mftG</italic> in ethanol metabolism of mycobacteria</title>
<p>Since the utilization of ethanol was the process that was most strikingly impacted by <italic>mftG</italic> inactivation, it was investigated further. First, the complementation of the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> deletion using an integrative vector carrying the <italic>mftG</italic> gene (Δ<italic>mftG attB</italic>::pMCpAINT-<italic>mftG</italic>, here named Δ<italic>mftG-mftG</italic>) was performed and resulted in the restoration of growth on 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> ethanol. Intriguingly, the growth curve of the complemented strain, which could be dysregulated in <italic>mftG</italic> expression, displayed a shorter lag phase, a faster second exponential growth phase, and a higher final biomass yield compared to the WT (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). Altered growth kinetics of complement mutants on ethanol are a known phenomenon, albeit not always well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). However, duplication of the <italic>mftG</italic> gene using the same vector in the WT strain (WT <italic>attB</italic>::pMCpAINT-<italic>mftG</italic>, here named WT<italic>-mftG</italic>) also showed enhanced growth. These results indicate that MftG might catalyze a rate-limiting step during ethanol utilization.</p>
<p>To further characterize the metabolic processes during ethanol consumption, the amount of ethanol and acetic acid present in the growth media with and without mycobacterial strains (WT, Δ<italic>mftG</italic>, Δ<italic>mftG-mftG</italic> and WT<italic>-mftG</italic>) was measured (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, E</xref></bold>). As reported previously, ethanol consumption during exponential growth of WT mycobacteria was accompanied by acetic acid production (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>), a process known as overflow metabolism where the rate of ethanol oxidation to acetate exceeds the rate of carbon assimilation for biomass formation during fast growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Although the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> strain could achieve residual growth after 45 h, the consumption of ethanol and the production of acetic acid remained at a very low level. (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). While this finding is in line with the occurrence of a metabolic roadblock in the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutant, it indicates, however, that enzymatic activities supporting ethanol oxidation to acetate are not completely abolished in Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutants. This interpretation is also supported by growth curves recorded on a combination of ethanol and glucose, where a simultaneous feeding enhanced the growth yield of the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutant (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>) suggesting at least partially intact ethanol utilization in Δ<italic>mftG</italic> cells.</p>
<p>Typically, ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde first, which is further oxidized to acetic acid. To test whether the metabolic roadblock affects acetaldehyde formation or consumption, we also quantified acetaldehyde from supernatants of WT and Δ<italic>mftG</italic> cells grown on ethanol or ethanol combined with glucose (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref></bold>). Interestingly, when comparing WT and the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutant, we noticed that both strains produced a similar amount of acetaldehyde regardless of whether ethanol was used as the sole carbon source or supplemented (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref></bold>), indicating that acetaldehyde formation is not altered in the mutant strain. At this point it may be helpful to revisit the fact that Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutants grew well on acetate (<bold>Supplementary Figure S2</bold>). This observation together with the detection of acetaldehyde and acetate in the supernatants of Δ<italic>mftG</italic> cultures excludes the hypothesis that <italic>mftG</italic> is required for acetaldehyde and acetate assimilation. When investigating the carbon metabolism of the Δ<italic>mftG-mftG</italic> (complement) and WT<italic>-mftG</italic> (overexpression) strains, an inverted phenotype became visible. Parallel to the accelerated and enhanced growth described above (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>), the overexpression strains displayed higher rates of ethanol consumption as well as an earlier onset of acetate overflow metabolism and acetate consumption (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). These results indicate that MftG activity is, at least indirectly, related to ethanol oxidation. Notably, the accelerated turnover of the volatile substrate ethanol, which is subject to substantial evaporation during the cultivation process, to acetate, which is less volatile, could explain the enhanced final growth yield of the complement and overexpression strains.</p>

<title>The impact of ethanol on survival and cell division of <bold>Δ</bold><italic>mftG</italic> mutants</title>
<p>To investigate whether the reduced growth of Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutants on ethanol is due to limited carbon and energy supply or rather a consequence of insufficient ethanol detoxification, we cultivated bacteria on combinations of glucose and ethanol and recorded growth curves. Surprisingly, simultaneous feeding with 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> glucose and 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> ethanol even promoted the growth of the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutant. In addition, we determined the percentage of dead cells upon cultivation with different carbon sources using propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometry quantification (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). Regardless of the genotype, the bacterial cultures grown on glucose or ethanol as the sole carbon source and under starvation displayed a similar percentage of dead cells after a cultivation period of 72 h. We, therefore, conclude that the inability of Δ<italic>mftG</italic> cells to grow on ethanol alone is not due to ethanol toxicity. This conclusion was further supported by measurements of the transmembrane potential that did not reveal any disturbance of the proton motif force (PMF) in the mutant (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). Previous studies of the transmembrane potential of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> Δ<italic>mftC</italic> cells, another mutant unable to grow on ethanol as a carbon source, showed the same pattern with no differences compared to WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). However, unexpectedly, an elevated proportion of dead cells was detected when Δ<italic>mftG</italic> was cultivated on combined carbon sources, while the WT tolerated this condition well. This finding emphasizes the role of the mycofactocin system in enhancing the metabolic adaptability of mycobacterial cells under increasingly complex environmental conditions.</p>

<p>To reveal potential morphological changes induced by ethanol treatment, we further examined the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutant incubated with different carbon sources by super-resolution microscopy. The identification of elongation and replication sites was achieved by the sequential incubation of the cells with the fluorescent <sub>D</sub>-amino acid labeling probes NADA (green) and RADA (red) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-E</xref></bold>). These probes are incorporated via extracellular routes of mycobacterial peptidoglycan assembly, labeling both elongation poles as well as the sidewall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). The <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> WT and Δ<italic>mftG</italic>-<italic>mftG</italic> cultivated on glucose as the sole carbon source appear elongated with mainly polar growth (accumulation of RADA at the poles indicates the most recent active site of peptidoglycan incorporation). NADA occurs mainly at a non-polar location (previous active replication site). The Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutant grown on glucose, however, showed few yellow cells (overlap of green and red) indicating growth arrest on a small part of the culture. Some cells are not actively synthesizing peptidoglycan and thus not growing, which leads to the overlap of both dyes (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Mycobacteria grown on glucose and ethanol showed a regular dispersion profile of both dyes, with polar RADA, non-polar NADA, and occasional mid-cell septum formation with no obvious differences between the three genotypes. In contrast, cultivation on 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> ethanol alone as well as under starvation condition (no carbon source) had a strong influence on peptidoglycan synthesis as the dyes show decreased incorporation into the cell wall. The simultaneous incorporation of both dyes in WT and Δ<italic>mftG</italic>-<italic>mftG</italic> cells grown on ethanol as the sole carbon source reflected the reduced growth rate, as shown by the growth curves (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref></bold>) compared to the glucose condition. Interestingly, Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutant cells struggled to divide on ethanol displaying multiple septa and extreme elongation compared to WT on ethanol, leading to a higher ratio of foci per cell compared to WT grown on the same condition (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, E</xref></bold>). Independent of the genotype, the cultivation in the presence of ethanol significantly decreased cell size. A similar phenotype was previously observed in <italic>Mycobacterium vaccae</italic> cells exposed to ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Starving cells were also significantly reduced in size in WT and Δ<italic>mftG</italic> strains compared to growth on glucose alone (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, E</xref></bold>), reflecting the limitation of resources available for propagation and elongation. Especially under starvation conditions, the cells appeared predominantly yellow, suggestive of growth arrest. A previous study on the effect of starvation on mycobacteria also showed the formation of large cells with multiple septa as a hallmark of starvation, from which after 14 days, mildly starved cells (with traces of carbon source available) remodeled into small resting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Our results indicated that the major phenotype of Δ<italic>mftG</italic> on ethanol as a sole source of carbon is a growth defect comparable to a starvation effect. When incubated solely with this carbon source, Δ<italic>mftG</italic> cells are almost unable to divide, but remain alive and in a metabolically active state, most likely consuming ethanol in trace amounts.</p>

<title>Impact of <italic>mftG</italic> on mycobacterial cofactor metabolism</title>
<p>Based on the results above, we concluded that MftG is crucial for proper ethanol metabolism in mycobacteria. However, deletion of its corresponding gene still allowed for basal metabolic activity and ethanol oxidation. One way to explain these findings is that MftG is involved in cofactor regeneration during growth on ethanol as a carbon source. The genetic linkage of <italic>mftG</italic> with mycofactocin biosynthesis supported the hypothesis that MftG might be responsible for mycofactocin regeneration. However, before directly addressing mycofactocin metabolism, we decided to monitor the central respiratory redox cofactor NAD. We therefore determined the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios of WT and KO during the exponential phase when bacteria were grown on glucose or ethanol as the sole carbon sources. However, the presence or absence of <italic>mftG</italic> did not significantly influence the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio of bacteria grown on either carbon source (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). This finding indicated that NAD homeostasis remained intact in the <italic>ΔmftG</italic> mutant. Notably, when looking at absolute NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>) an increase of the NAD pool in cells growing on ethanol was detected, however, independent of the genotype. Along with central redox (NAD<sup>+</sup>) metabolism, we also monitored the central energy metabolism of the cells by determining ADP/ATP ratios. These clearly supported the hypothesis that <italic>ΔmftG</italic> cells suffered from starvation. The mutant strain exhibited a significant energy deficit at all three sampled time points, with the energy depletion progressively worsening between 24 and 48 hours of incubation (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). Previous studies of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> under starvation also showed a reduction of ATP levels as a result of hampered energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). It should be mentioned that ATP synthesis strictly depends on respiration in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. Mycobacteria typically cannot sustain growth, even on fermentable substrates, via substrate-level phosphorylation alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). After confirming energy shortage but intact NAD homeostasis in <italic>ΔmftG</italic> cells, we decided to test whether MftG is involved in mycofactocin regeneration. To this end, we directly analyzed the MFT pool using targeted liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We have previously shown that the total pool size of MFT species is highly expanded when <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> uses ethanol as a sole carbon source and that both reduced (M/MFT-nH<sub>2</sub>) as well as oxidized species (M/MFT-n) are stable when extracted and can thus be detected by LC-MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Here, we performed a comparative analysis of the metabolome of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> WT and Δ<italic>mftG</italic> grown in HdB-Tyl supplemented with either 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> glucose, 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> ethanol, or both carbon sources combined (10 g L<sup>−1</sup> glucose and 20 g L<sup>−1</sup> ethanol). Metabolites were extracted during the exponential or stationary growth phase. Additionally, metabolome extracts from complemented Δ<italic>mftG</italic>-<italic>mftG</italic> and WT-<italic>mftG</italic> strains grown on HdB-Tyl with 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> ethanol sampled only at the stationary phase were analyzed. Strikingly, this analysis revealed significantly elevated levels of MMFT-8H<sub>2</sub> in Δ<italic>mftG</italic> compared to the other strains tested (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-F</xref></bold>). MMFT-8H<sub>2</sub> is the major representative of reduced mycofactocins (mycofactocinols) in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. Interestingly, Δ<italic>mftG</italic> strains contained almost none of the corresponding oxidized mycofactocinone (MMFT-8) in any of the conditions tested. These results strongly supported the hypothesis that MFT regeneration was hampered in the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutant while MFT reduction was still taking place, thus resulting in a near-total conversion of mycofactocinones to mycofactocinoles. This phenotype was also observed when Δ<italic>mftG</italic> cells were cultivated on glucose and ethanol combined (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>) and even on glucose alone (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>). Complementation of the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutant (Δ<italic>mftG</italic>-<italic>mftG</italic>) reverted the MMFTH<sub>2</sub> to MMFT ratio back to WT levels. In contrast, the overexpression strain WT-<italic>mftG</italic> grown in ethanol contained significantly more MMFT-8 (oxidized) compared to other strains in the same condition (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref></bold>), thus providing further evidence that MftG is involved in reoxidation of mycofactocin and re-enforcing that this step might even represent a rate-limiting step during ethanol utilization.</p>

<title>MFT dehydrogenase assay with recombinant MftG</title>
<p>To further support the hypothesis that MftG is responsible for MFT reoxidation, purification of MftG as a recombinant fusion protein with hexahistidine tag followed by <italic>in-vitro</italic> enzyme assays was attempted.

The restoration of the growth on ethanol of the Δ<italic>mftG-mftG</italic>His<sub>6</sub> expression strain indicated that the recombinant protein was produced in an active form. Semi-purified cell-free extracts of Δ<italic>mftG-mftG</italic>His<sub>6</sub> incubated with metabolome extract from <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> Δ<italic>mftG</italic> as substrate showed that the <italic>mftG-mftG</italic>His<sub>6</sub> lysate significantly increased the amount of MMFT-8 and decreased the amount of the MMFT-8H<sub>2</sub> while the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> lysate did not affect the ratio of the two compounds (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold>).

However, the reaction proceeded only with partial conversion of the substrate. Additionally, since some enzymes of the GMC family can utilize oxygen as electron acceptors, the role of oxygen in MftG activity was accessed. To this end, the assays were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere at &lt; 0.1% oxygen. Under these conditions the MftG activity remained unchanged (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C, D</xref></bold>), thus ruling out that MftG acts as a mycofactocin oxidase using O<sub>2</sub> as an electron acceptor.</p>

<p>In order to confirm that the activity detected in cell-free lysates was not due to background effects, the heterologous production of MftG in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> followed by activity assays was attempted.

However, none of the potential acceptors tested, DCPIP, NAD<sup>+</sup>, NDMA and PMS, were able to increase substrate turnover (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></bold>). Assays with increasing concentrations of protein suggested that the observed activity was due to single-turnover reactions, most likely using the FAD cofactor in the active site as an electron acceptor (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref></bold>). We, therefore, concluded that MftG can indeed interact with mycofactocins as electron donors but might require complex electron acceptors, for instance, proteins present in the respiratory chain.</p>

<title>Influence of MftG and MFT in mycobacterial respiration</title>
<p>The phenotypes observed for cell growth and division together with an increased ratio of ADP/ATP in the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> strain suggested a potential involvement of MftG in mycobacterial respiration. To further test this hypothesis, the consumption of O<sub>2</sub> from whole cells of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> WT and Δ<italic>mftG</italic> grown on HdB-Tyl with 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> of ethanol was measured in a respirometer equipped with a Clark-type electrode. This experiment revealed that the respiration rate of Δ<italic>mftG</italic> reached only about 45% of the WT level (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></bold>). Notably, the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> carrying a duplicated <italic>mftG</italic> gene, WT-<italic>mftG</italic>, showed accelerated oxygen consumption, supporting the idea that MftG is a limiting factor in the respiration of mycobacteria grown on ethanol.</p>

<p>To test whether MftG might interact with components of the respiratory chain, we investigated mycobacterial membrane preparations for respiratory activities. The influence of mycofactocin on mycobacterial respiration was tested using isolated membranes from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> WT supplemented with either NADH, succinate, synthetic PMFTH<sub>2</sub>, or purified MMFT-2H<sub>2</sub>. In these respiration assays, the consumption of oxygen after supplementation with NADH or succinate was highly increased showing the expected respiratory activity of the isolated membranes via NADH or succinate dehydrogenases (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></bold>). The addition of PMFTH<sub>2</sub> or MMFT-2H<sub>2</sub> stimulated oxygen consumption to a rate that was comparable to succinate-induced respiration of the WT strain. In <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic>, cyanide is a known inhibitor of the cytochrome <italic>bc</italic>/<italic>aa3</italic> but not of cytochrome <italic>bd</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), therefore, the decrease of oxygen consumption when MFTs were added to the membrane fractions in combination with KCN (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></bold>), revealed that MFT-induced oxygen consumption is indeed linked to mycobacterial respiration.</p>
<p>The membrane fraction of the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> strain showed a decreased consumption of oxygen compared to WT. Although the auto-respiration, i.e., the consumption of oxygen in the absence of a stimulant, was lower in the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> strain, the supplementation of NADH and succinate stimulated oxygen consumption demonstrating that the membranes contained a functional electron transport chain. The addition of reduced mycofactocins to the reaction revealed strongly reduced respiration when compared to the WT membrane. To test whether increased O<sub>2</sub> consumption was linked to the oxidation of mycofactocinols, we also we carried out LC-MS analysis of the samples used in the respiration assays. Indeed, mycofactocinols were oxidized to mycofactocinols (e.g. PMFTH<sub>2</sub> to PMFT) under active assay conditions, while only low amounts of PMFTH<sub>2</sub> were oxidized in membranes of the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> strain or by membranes treated with KCN. Two observations suggest a low level of MftG-independent mycofactocin oxidation: (I) The residual induction of oxygen consumption in the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> strain by mycofactocinols, (II) the formation of low amounts of oxidized mycofactocins in the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> strain (at a similar level to WT inhibited by KCN). From the respirometry experiments, we conclude that MftG catalyzes the electron transfer from mycofactocinol to membrane-bound components of the respiratory chain. These could be the quinone pool as known from succinate dehydrogenase complex, or cytochromes, for instance. For example, MftG in mycobacteria might play a similar role as the subunit II of the pyrroquinoline quinone-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (PQQ-ADH) complex from acetic acid bacteria. The subunit II transfers electrons from the alcohol dehydrogenase (subunit I/III) to the ubiquinone pool, from which further electron transfer to oxygen occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>).</p>

<title>Transcriptomic analysis of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> Δ<italic>mftG</italic> cells</title>
<p>To monitor genome-wide regulatory adaptation caused by <italic>mftG</italic> deletion, we employed high-throughput sequencing to record transcriptomic changes in WT and Δ<italic>mftG</italic> cells when grown to exponential phase (60 h of incubation for Δ<italic>mftG</italic> on ethanol) on glucose or ethanol. In the glucose condition, only nine out of 6.506 annotated genes classified significantly upregulated in Δ<italic>mftG</italic> when compared to the WT (adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 and log2FoldChange &gt; 2). Since these genes showed neither functional nor spatial clustering, we conclude that no meaningful differences in the mycobacterial transcriptome between WT and mutant grown on glucose were observed (<bold>Table S2).</bold></p>
<p>On the contrary, transcriptomics analysis of Δ<italic>mftG</italic> and WT grown on ethanol detected 578 genes as significantly up-regulated and 697 as down-regulated (adjusted p-value&lt;0.05 and log2FoldChange &gt; 2 or &lt;-2) in the mutant when compared to the WT (<bold>Table S2</bold>). The deletion of the <italic>mftG</italic> gene induced mainly processes related to transmembrane transporter activity, iron binding, monooxygenase activity, quinone activity and NADH dehydrogenase (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref></bold>). Downregulated processes were related to ATP binding and ATPase transmembrane movement, respiration, and DNA replication (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref></bold>). Significant changes, presumably due to energy limitation, took place in the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutant compared to the WT. For instance, the <italic>nuo</italic> genes (MSMEG_2050 - 2063) encoding NADH dehydrogenase I (NADH-I), were amongst the most highly expressed genes (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, Table S2</bold>). In mycobacteria, two NADH dehydrogenases (NDH-I and II) are active, while in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> the NADH-I dehydrogenase typically contributes only a low proportion of total NADH activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Notably, enhanced expression of the high-efficiency, proton-pumping NADH-I (<italic>nou</italic>) system was previously observed under energy-limited starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). In addition, alternative dehydrogenases fostering electron transfer from other electron donors to the respiratory chain were strongly upregulated (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref></bold>). These comprise enzymes like proline dehydrogenase (MSMEG_5117), pyruvate dehydrogenase (MSMEG_4710 – 4712), carbon monoxide oxidase (MSMEG_0744 – 0749), the hydrogenases 1 (MSMEG_2262 – 2276) and 2 (MSEMG_2720-2719). Furthermore, quinone-dependent succinate dehydrogenase SDH1 (MSMEG_0416-0420) was highly upregulated when compared to the WT. Again, similar patterns were previously described in cultures growing under carbon limitation and can be seen as an attempt of the cell to compensate for poor loading of the electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). This finding is in line with our hypothesis that electron transfer to the respiratory chain is hampered and mutant cells suffer from mild starvation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Alcohols are widespread ingredients of various foods and beverages and are used as active principles of many disinfectants. Therefore, the impact of alcohols on commensal and clinically important bacterial strains have high relevance. However, ethanol metabolism in mycobacteria is still poorly characterized. While it is established that the cofactor mycofactocin plays a major role in this process, the fate of electrons during alcohol oxidation remained unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on bioinformatics analysis we hypothesized that MftG homologs, flavoenzymes of the GMC superfamily, might be involved in redox metabolism connected to MFT-dependent alcohol metabolism. Using <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> as a model system we showed that MftG is indeed essential for ethanol metabolism, a process known to depend on both an intact mycofactocin biosynthetic pathway as well as the putative MFT-dependent alcohol-dehydrogenase Mdo/Mno. Mutants lacking the <italic>mftG</italic> gene incubated on ethanol as the sole carbon source displayed strongly impaired growth. Super-resolution microscopy combined with peptidoglycan labeling, transcriptomics as well as direct measurements of ADP/ATP ratios demonstrated that mutants grown on ethanol suffer from energy limitation and growth arrest similar to a mild starvation condition. However, the mutant maintained a level of functional metabolism, conserving its transmembrane potential. The ethanol oxidation pathway was proven to be affected in the KO strain but not fully interrupted as suggested by partially intact co-metabolism with glucose and production of intermediate products.</p>
<p>Investigation of cofactor metabolism revealed that deletion of <italic>mftG</italic> resulted in a drastic increase in the ratio of reduced/oxidized mycofactocins in the mycobacterial cell while the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio remained unchanged. This finding prompted the hypothesis that MftG could be involved in MFT cofactor regeneration. Assays with homologously and heterologously produced, semi-purified enzymes showed that MftG indeed oxidized PMFTH<sub>2</sub> and MMFT-2H<sub>2</sub>, but only single-turnover reactions could be observed. Respirometry studies further demonstrated that reduced mycofactocins feed redox equivalents into the intact mycobacterial respiratory chain. Strikingly, this process was severely hampered in Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutants, suggesting that MftG, while directly accepting electrons from mycofactocinol, delivers electrons either directly or indirectly into the respiratory chain. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a profound re-organization of the respiration machinery when MftG was absent suggestive of starvation and low availability of redox equivalents to the respiratory chain.</p>
<p>We, therefore, conclude that MftG is a mycofactocin dehydrogenase requiring electron acceptors associated with the membrane-bound respiratory chain. This assumption is plausible considering that other members of the GMC superfamily, e.g., choline dehydrogenase from <italic>E. coli</italic>, were reported to couple substrate oxidation with the electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). While the exact electron acceptor remains a subject for future studies, it is plausible that cytochromes might fulfill this function. Interestingly, cellobiose dehydrogenase, a fungal GMC enzyme, is a multidomain enzyme where the dehydrogenase domain (GMC) is linked to a cytochrome domain. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). This situation is reminiscent of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Those enzymes, that mainly occur in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria, are typically coupled to a dedicated cytochrome c subunit, which is genetically clustered along with the other subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). It is also likely that the membrane-associated quinone pool serves as the electron acceptor. For instance, the GMC-family oxidoreductase enzymes PhcC and PhcD from <italic>Sphingobium</italic> sp. involved in lignin oxidation were suggested to transfer electrons to the ubiquinone pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Reduction of menaquinone (E<sub>0</sub>’ = –74 mV), the dominant respiratory quinone of <italic>Mycobacteria</italic>, by mycofactocinol would be thermodynamically favorable considering the midpoint potential of premycofactocins (PMFT/PMFTH<sub>2</sub>: E<sub>0</sub>’ = –255 mV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). However, other redox coenzymes, redox proteins or protein complexes of the respiratory chain might act as direct reaction partners of MftG.</p>
<p>Our study sets the ground for future investigations into the connection of the mycofactocin system to further (known or unknown redox) systems. For instance, background MFTH<sub>2</sub> oxidation by membrane preparations of the Δ<italic>mftG</italic> mutant points towards the existence of alternative MFT-dependent dehydrogenases or oxidases. Our results provide insights that are important for mechanistic studies of previous effects shown to be related to MftG. For instance, previous studies reported growth defects connected to <italic>mftG</italic> inactivation by transposon mutagenesis in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). More recently, the transcriptome analysis of a dose-dependent response of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> to the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor BB2-50F showed that this new antibiotic induced upregulation of <italic>mftG</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Furthermore, vulnerability studies of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic>, <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv and the hypervirulent strain HN878 using a CRISPRi library revealed that, although disruption of <italic>mftG</italic> did not induce any phenotype in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic>, still the disturbance of this gene induced growth defects in both <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Moreover, disruption of the <italic>mftG</italic> gene by this technique showed increased fitness of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv when exposed to various drugs, e.g., bedaquiline and ethambutol, while reducing fitness when exposed to isoniazid and vancomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Having these results in mind, further investigations of the role of MftG in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> survival and infection might disclose important implications of the MFT system for TB treatment.</p>
<p>Taken together, we close an important knowledge gap by showing that the flavoprotein MftG plays a role in MFT regeneration and acts as a redox shuttle between alcohol substrates and the respiratory chain. With the clarification of the MftG function, the entire set of <italic>mft</italic> genes are now elucidated in mycobacteria. Thereby, this study adds another important element to the amazingly flexible network of mycobacterial redox metabolism and opens up an avenue for future investigations of the mycofactocin system.</p>

Samples were re-suspended in 500 µL HdB-Tyl with no carbon source with OD<sub>600</sub> adjusted to 0.2. To samples of each condition were added either 2.5 µL of 750 µM of propidium iodide; 3 µL of 3 mM 3,3’-diethyloxacarbocyanine iodide [DIOC<sub>2</sub>(3)]; 20 µL of 500 mM of the protonophore (uncoupler) carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP, Sigma-Aldrich) followed by 3 µL of 3 mM DIOC<sub>2</sub> (3) combined. Samples were incubated for 15 min and briefly vortexed. All the samples were injected on a FACS AriaFusion (BD Biosciences) and for each sample, FSC and SSC were detected using the blue laser (488 nm) and a threshold set to 400. The propidium iodide is excited by 488 nm and has an emission of 630 nm and emission was detected with the help of a 600 nm long-pass filter and a 610/20 nm bandpass filter. DiOC2(3) has the excitation maximum at 488 nm and the cells with a low level of transmembrane potential (or the cells treated with uncoupler CCCP) have a maximum emission at 530 nm (green color), the cells with a higher level of electric potential energy accumulate more concentration of this lipophilic dye, which results in its accumulation within the cells and these aggregates of dye have a maximum of emission at 600 nm (red fluorescence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). The emission of DIOC<sub>2</sub>(3) was detected with the help of a 502 nm long-pass filter and a 530/30 nm bandpass filter and 600 nm long-pass filter and a 610/20 nm bandpass. PMT voltages were adjusted to values of 600 V for the red channel and 350 V for the blue channel. The propidium iodide data were analyzed in a batch using flowCore and ggcyto R packages in R (version 4.1.0). Single cells were gated using FSC.A vs. FSC.H (intensities below 0.5e3 and above 1e5 have been discarded) and in the following step the highly fluorescent single cells were gated using YG610.A vs. FSC.A.

Briefly, WT, Δ<italic>mftG,</italic> and Δ<italic>mftG</italic>-<italic>mftG</italic> cells were grown in HdB-Tyl supplemented with either 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> glucose, 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> ethanol, or 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> glucose combined with 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> ethanol. The starvation condition was accomplished with the incubation of bacteria in a plain HdB-Tyl medium with no carbon source added. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C and 210 rpm until the mid-logarithmic growth phase. For FDAA incorporation, the green NADA was added to a final concentration of 250 µM, and cells were left to grow for 2,5 h. To stop incorporation, cells were placed on ice for 2 min followed by one washing step with ice-cold PBS. The red RADA was added to the same final concentration for 2,5 h. After the final washing step with PBS, bacterial cells were fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution for 20 min at 4 °C.</p>

<title>Purification of methylmycofactocinol-2 (MMFT-2H<sub>2</sub>) from WT-<italic>mftABCDEF</italic></title>
<p>To isolate MMFT-2H<sub>2</sub> from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis,</italic> the mycofactocin gene cluster duplication strain WT-<italic>mftABCDEF</italic> was built by integration of the plasmid pPG23 in the WT strain. A first preculture was prepared through inoculation of 3 mL LBT with the strain and incubation for 24 h. The first preculture was used to inoculate a second preculture of 50 mL HdB-Tyl supplemented with 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> glucose in a 250 mL shake flask and cultivated for 48 h. From the second preculture 1:100 [v/v] was used to inoculate the 5 L main culture of 2x HdB, i.e. all components except tyloxapol were concentrated twice compared to standard HdB-Tyl, supplemented with 3% [v/v] ethanol. The main culture was cultivated as 10x 500 mL cultures in 2 L shake flasks sealed with breathable rayon film (VWR) for reproducible aeration for 72 h. All cultivation steps were performed at 37 °C and 210 rpm in a shaker with a 25 mm throw. The culture was harvested through centrifugation at 8,000 × <italic>g</italic> and 18 °C for 3 min. The cell pellet of the harvested culture was washed with 500 mL ultrapure water once followed by centrifugation at 8,000 × <italic>g</italic> and 18 °C for 5 min and resuspension in 500 mL of 50 mM citrate phosphate buffer (Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> anhydrous 7.1 g L<sup>−1</sup>, citric acid 9.6 g L<sup>−1</sup>, pH 5.2). The cell suspension was autoclaved at 134 °C for 30 min to disrupt the cells followed by treatment with 20 µg mL<sup>−1</sup> of cellulase mix from <italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic> (Sigma Aldrich) at 37 °C for 18 h, which was subsequently heat-inactivated at 95 °C for 15 min to condense the pool of different long-chain mycofactocinols present <italic>in vivo</italic> to MMFT-2H<sub>2</sub> and PMFTH<sub>2</sub>. The treated crude extract was cleared through centrifugation at 15,000 × <italic>g</italic> and 18 °C for 20 min. To avoid column overloading, the extract was split into two 250 mL parts before fractionation on 70 mL/10 g octadecyl modified silica solid phase extraction columns (Chromabond SPE, Machery-Nagel). Before fractionation, the SPE column was washed with three column volumes of methanol (CV, 1 CV = 40 mL) followed by equilibration with three CVs of 50 mM citrate phosphate buffer. After application of the crude extract, bound molecules were washed with 1 CV water and step-wise eluted with 4 CV 80:20 [v/v] water:methanol, 3 CV 70:30 [v/v] water:methanol, and 1 CV 50:50 [v/v] water:methanol. Samples of each fraction were tested for the presence of MMFT-2H<sub>2</sub> via LC-MS as described above. The 70:30 fraction showed the highest concentration of MMFT-2H<sub>2</sub> and thus was subjected to further purification. The fraction was lyophilized at 1 mbar and −90 °C until all solvent was removed. The lyophilizate was resuspended in 500 µL water and subjected to a final purification via size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex 30 Increase 10/300 GL (Cytiva) equilibrated with 50 mL water operated at 500 µL min<sup>−1</sup> on an NGC medium-pressure chromatography system (Bio-Rad). Per chromatography, 250 µL resuspended enriched fractions were separated. Each of the SEC fractions was tested for the presence of MMFT-2H<sub>2</sub> via LC-MS/MS as described above and the fractions with the highest concentrations of MMFT-2H<sub>2</sub> and lowest amounts of LC-MS/MS detectable impurities were combined and lyophilized at 0.01 mbar and −90 °C until complete dryness.</p>

<p>The WT and Δ<italic>mftG</italic> cells were incubated on HdB-Tyl supplemented with 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> ethanol for 48h at starting OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1 for WT and 0.7 for Δ<italic>mftG</italic> at 37 °C and 210 rpm. For the starvation experiment, WT was cultivated for 24 h in the same conditions as the latter in HdB-Tyl without carbon sources and starting OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.7. After this period the cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and pellets were resuspended in fresh HdB supplemented with 0.25 g L<sup>−1</sup> Tyloxapol without carbon sources and normalized to OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.7.</p>
<p>Aliquots of 200 µL of bacterial samples were placed in the electrochemical chamber supplied with a Clark-type polarographic sensor (Oxytherm<sup>+</sup>, Hansatech Instruments). Before experiments, the chamber was calibrated according to the manufacturer’s manual (‘liquid phase calibration’) and set to 37 °C and 50 rpm stirring. The oxygen consumption was monitored over 10 min. The retrieved data was further plotted using R version 2023.03.0+.</p>

<title>Isolation of mycobacterial membranes</title>
<p><italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> WT and Δ<italic>mftG</italic> strains were grown in 320 mL HdB-Tyl medium supplemented with 1 g L<sup>−1</sup> ethanol as the sole carbon source in 2 L flasks covered by breathable rayon film (VWR) in triplicates and incubated at 37 °C and 210 rpm with a starting OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1 for WT and 2.0 for Δ<italic>mftG</italic> for a period of 48 h.</p>
<p>The cells were concentrated by centrifugation at 7,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and the resulting pellets were resuspended in buffer (38 mL) of the following composition: 50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM sucrose, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> at pH 6.7. Pellets were disrupted with 0.1 mm ZrO<sub>2</sub> beads (CarlRoth, GmbH) in 15 mL plastic tubes using a bead beater (MP Biomedicals, FastPrep-24 5G). A total of 6 cycles of beating were applied (3 times of application of the pre-installed program for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> cells from the manufacturer). After each step of beating, tubes were cooled down on ice for at least one minute. To get rid of the beads and undisrupted cells the resulting material was centrifuged twice at 4 °C and 6,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. The obtained lysate was further ultra-centrifuged (Thermo Scientific™ Sorvall LYNX 6000 Superspeed Centrifuge) at 4 °C, 100,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 2 h to obtain the sedimentation of the mycobacterial membrane fraction and clarified soluble fraction (cytoplasm and disrupted periplasm).

<title>Analysis of MMFT-2H<sub>2</sub> and PMFTH<sub>2</sub> oxidation in respiration assay</title>
<p>Oxygen consumption was measured using Oxytherm<sup>+</sup> (Hansatech Instruments) advanced oxygen electrode system at 37 °C and stirred at 50 rpm. For homogenization of mycobacterial membranes, the assay buffer of the following composition was used: 50 mM sucrose, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM KF, 2 mM AMP, 4 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 50 mM Tris at pH 6.7. All experiments were performed with 250 µL of membrane homogenates. The respiration stimulation started after circa 100 s from the beginning of the oxygen measurement experiments by the addition of 1 mM of the substrates: MMFT-2H<sub>2</sub>, PMFTH<sub>2</sub>, NADH (CarlRoth), or sodium succinate (Sigma-Aldrich). Inhibition of the reaction was tested by the addition of a final concentration of 2.5 mM KCN (Sigma-Aldrich) to the solution. To exclude non-enzymatic oxidation, controls such as reaction mixtures without substrates, as well as microwave-inactivated membrane fractions were included. Total protein concentration was quantified using Roti-Nanoquant 5x Concentrate (Carl Roth) and normalization on the total protein concentration of the fractions was used to make the results comparable. The respirometry curves were plotted using R version 2023.03.0+. For the analysis of PMFTH<sub>2</sub> conversion into PMFT, 200 µL of the sample from the respirometry analysis was quenched by 200 µL of acetonitrile followed by two centrifugations at 17,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 min to remove debris. To assess if PMFTH<sub>2</sub> conversion was membrane-bound, an assay was carried out with soluble fractions and further quenched as previously described. The LC-MS/MS profiling and the obtained chromatograms were analyzed as described above in this study. Generated csv tables were further plotted and analyzed in R version 2023.03.0+.</p>

<title>RNA extraction, library preparation and analysis of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> MC<sup>2</sup> 155 WT and <bold>Δ</bold><italic>mftG</italic></title>
<p><italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> MC<sup>2</sup> 155 WT and Δ<italic>mftG</italic> were grown on HdB-Tyl with 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> for 24h. Cultures were centrifuged, supernatant removed and resuspended on HdB-Tyl plain medium and used as inoculum for triplicate cultures on HdB-Tyl with 10 g L <sup>−1</sup> of ethanol at a starting OD<sub>600</sub> concentration of 0.1. Samples of 4mL of WT at exponential phase and 8ml of Δ<italic>mftG</italic> after 60h of incubation were retrieved and further processed for RNA extraction following the manufacturer’s instructions (InnuPREP RNA Mini kit 2.0 – Analytik Jena). An additional DNAse step was included to remove traces of gDNA. RNA samples were then subjected to RNA-Seq library preparation following the stranded total RNA prep Ligation with Ribo-Zero plus kit (Illumina). After depletion of the rRNA by hybridization with directed probes, the RNA samples were normalized to 500 ng/sample. The RNA samples were then subjected to fragmentation and denaturation, followed by reverse transcription through first-strand (and subsequently second-strand) cDNA synthesis. After 3’ end adenylation, anchors and indexes were ligated. Barcoding was accomplished using the IDT® for Illumina® RNA UD Indexes Set A, Ligation (Ref# 20040553, Ilumina, Berlin, Germany). Standard AMPURE XP Beads protocols (Ref# A63881; Beckman, Krefeld, Germany) were employed to purify the final library fragments, and their size and molarity were verified using a Tape Station 2200 (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). The equimolarly pooled libraries were subsequently subjected to a 100-cycle run on a NovaSeq 6000 apparatus (Ilumina, Berlin, Germany) using an SP flowcell v. 1.5 (Ref# 20028401; Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany).</p>
<p>Raw reads were checked for quality using fastP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), and polyX tails (-x 10), low quality ends (−3, −5, -M 25) were removed, and resulting sequences shorter than 25 were discarded (-l 25). The remaining reads were mapped to the reference genome (RefSeq accession GCF_000015005.1) using bwa-mem2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>) with default parameters for the affine gap scoring model. For each sample and every gene annotation, all overlapping reads were counted and a counts table was generated for every experiment condition using custom scripts. The counts’ tables were used as an input to the R package DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>) to compute fold changes and false discovery rates of differentially expressed genes between the control condition and each experiment condition.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> work examines the role of the oxidoreductase MftG in Mycolicibacerium smegmatis alcohol metabolism. A <bold>solid</bold> set of data is presented to show that, in the context of ethanol metabolism, MftG couples electrons derived from the oxidation of redox cofactor mycofactocin to mycobacterial respiratory chain. The theoretical and functional analyses could benefit from more rigour to expand on hypotheses that already exist in the field. This work highlights the metabolic flexibility of mycobacteria, but it will also be of interest to the broader field of bacterial metabolism.</p>

<p>Using a knock-out mutant strain, the authors tried to decipher the role of the last gene in the mycofactocin operon, mftG. They found that MftG was essential for growth in the presence of ethanol as the sole carbon source, but not for the metabolism of ethanol, evidenced by the equal production of acetaldehyde in the mutant and wild type strains when grown with ethanol (Fig 3). The phenotypic characterization of ΔmftG cells revealed a growth-arrest phenotype in ethanol, reminiscent of starvation conditions (Fig 4). Investigation of cofactor metabolism revealed that MftG was not required to maintain redox balance via NADH/NAD+, but was important for energy production (ATP) in ethanol. Since mycobacteria cannot grow via substrate-level phosphorylation alone, this pointed to a role of MftG in respiration during ethanol metabolism. The accumulation of reduced mycofactocin points to impaired cofactor cycling in the absence of MftG, which would impact the availability of reducing equivalents to feed into the electron transport chain for respiration (Fig 5). This was confirmed when looking at oxygen consumption in membrane preparations from the mutant and would type strains with reduced mycofactocin electron donors (Fig 7). The transcriptional analysis supported the starvation phenotype, as well as perturbations in energy metabolism, and may be beneficial if described prior to respiratory activity data.</p>
<p>While the data and conclusions do support the role of MftG in ethanol metabolism, the title of the publication may be misleading as the mutant was able to grow in the presence of other alcohols (Supp Fig S2). Furthermore, the authors propose that MftG could not be involved in acetate assimilation based on the detection of acetate in the supernatant and the ability to grow in the presence of acetate. The minimal amount of acetate detected in the supernatant but a comparative amount of acetaldehyde could point to disruption of an aldehyde dehydrogenase.</p>
<p>The link between mycofactocin oxidation and respiration is shown, however the mutant has an intact respiratory chain in the presence of ethanol (oxygen consumption with NADH and succinate in Fig 7C) and the NADH/NAD+ ratios are comparable to growth in glucose. Could the lack of growth of the mutant in ethanol be linked to factors other than respiration? To this end, bioinformatic investigation or other evidence to identify the membrane-bound respiratory partner would strengthen the conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Patrícia Graça et al., examined the role of the putative oxidoreductase MftG in regeneration of redox cofactors from the mycofactocin family in Mycolicibacerium smegmatis. The authors show that the mftG is often co-encoded with genes from the mycofactocin synthesis pathway in M. smegmatis genomes. Using a mftG deletion mutant, the authors show that mftG is critical for growth when ethanol is the only available carbon source, and this phenotype can be complemented in trans. The authors demonstrate the ethanol associated growth defect is not due to ethanol induced cell death, but is likely a result of carbon starvation, which was supported by multiple lines of evidence (imaging, transcriptomics, ATP/ADP measurement and respirometry using whole cells and cell membranes). The authors next used LC-MS to show that the mftG deletion mutant has much lower oxidised mycofactocin (MFFT-8 vs MMFT-8H2) compared to WT, suggesting an impaired ability to regenerate myofactocin redox cofactors during ethanol metabolism. These striking results were further supported by mycofactocin oxidation assays after over-expression of MftG in the native host, but also with recombinantly produced partially purified MftG from E. coli. The results showed that MftG is able to partially oxidise mycofactocin species, finally respirometry measurements with M. smegmatis membrane preparations from WT and mftG mutant cells show that the activity of MftG is indispensable for coupling of mycofactocin electron transfer to the respiratory chain. Overall, I find this study to be comprehensive and the conclusions of the paper are well supported by multiple complementary lines of evidence that are clearly presented.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The major strengths of the paper are that it is clearly written and presented and contains multiple, complementary lines of experimental evidence that support the hypothesis that MftG is involved in the regeneration of mycofactocin cofactors, and assists with coupling of electrons derived from ethanol metabolism to the aerobic respiratory chain. The data appear to support the the authors hypotheses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>No major weaknesses were identified, only minor weaknesses mostly surrounding presentation of data in some figures.</p>
