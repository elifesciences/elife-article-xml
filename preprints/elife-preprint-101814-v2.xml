<title>Abstract</title><p>Chemical communication is the cornerstone of eusocial insect societies since it mediates the social hierarchy, division of labor, and concerted activities of colony members. The chemistry of social insect pheromones received considerable attention in both major groups of social insects, the eusocial Hymenoptera and termites. By contrast, current knowledge on molecular mechanisms of social insect pheromone detection by odorant receptors (ORs) is limited to hymenopteran social insects and no OR was yet functionally characterized in termites, the oldest eusocial insect clade. Here, we present the first OR deorphanization in termites. We selected four OR sequences from the previously annotated antennal transcriptome of the termite <italic>Prorhinotermes simplex</italic> (Rhinotermitidae), expressed them in Empty Neuron <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and functionally characterized using single sensillum recording (SSR) and a panel of termite semiochemicals. In one of the selected ORs, PsimOR14, we succeeded in obtaining strong and reliable responses to the main component of <italic>P. simplex</italic> trail-following pheromone, the monocyclic diterpene neocembrene. PsimOR14 showed a narrow tuning to neocembrene; only one additional compound out of 67 tested (geranylgeraniol) generated non-negligible responses. Subsequently, we used SSR in <italic>P. simplex</italic> workers and identified the olfactory sensillum specifically responding to neocembrene, thus likely expressing <italic>PsimOR14</italic>. We report on homology-based modelling of neocembrene binding by PsimOR14 and show how different ligands impact the receptor dynamicity using molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, we demonstrate that <italic>PsimOR14</italic> is significantly more expressed in worker antennae compared to soldiers, which correlates with higher sensitivity of workers to neocembrene.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chemical communication is the cornerstone of eusocial insect societies. It mediates the social hierarchy and division of labor, social cohesion and concerted activities of colony members. Different clades of eusocial insects have independently evolved chemical signals acting in similar social contexts, such as trail, alarm and queen pheromones, colony and caste recognition cues, and other signals. The convergent evolution of chemical signaling is the best manifested by many similarities between ants and termites, in spite of the great evolutionary distance between these two dominant groups of social insects with great ecological significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Leonhardt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Tuma et al. 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the identification of the multigene family of insect odorant receptors (ORs) expressed in antennae and maxillary palps of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Clyne et al., 1999</xref>), neurophysiology of insect olfaction has seen great progress in terms of phylogenetic reconstructions of OR evolution across taxa, functional characterizations (deorphanisations) of multiple ORs and ultimately their recent structural characterizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Butterwick et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">del Mármol et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zhao et al. 2024</xref>). Even though the insect ORs have seven transmembrane domains like the ORs known from vertebrates, they do not share many tangible sequence similarities. Insect ORs have an inverted membrane topology in the dendrites of olfactory sensory neurons compared to vertebrate ORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Benton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Clyne et al., 1999</xref>) and unlike the vertebrate ORs known to act as GPCR receptors, insect ORs function as odorant-gated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wicher et al., 2008</xref>). While the ORs from the basal wingless insect lineage Archaeognatha are homotetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">del Mármol et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brand et al., 2018</xref>), ORs of all other Insecta form heteromeric complexes with a highly conserved coreceptor protein (ORCo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brand et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Butterwick et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Larsson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sato et al., 2008</xref>). As recently shown in mosquitoes and aphids, these complexes consist of one OR and three ORCo subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zhao et al. 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>The OR repertoire is greatly variable across Insecta and ranges from units in the wingless Archaeognatha and basal winged order Odonata to tens or hundreds ORs identified in most other flying insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Robertson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Yan et al., 2020</xref>). Insect ORs often lack a clear orthology pattern across phylogeny, because the OR family evolved via rapid birth-and-death process, accompanied by multiple gene duplications, pseudogenizations, and losses. Lineage-specific expansions, together with a considerable variability in OR ligand specificities (from broad to narrow tuning) allow for a rapid response of olfactory system to ecological and life history changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andersson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Benton, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Nei &amp; Rooney, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Robertson, 2019</xref>). Ecology-driven plasticity in OR evolution has been convincingly demonstrated by comparisons of specialist vs. generalist insects, the former often having much lower repertoires of ORs and other chemosensory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Robertson, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The knowledge on OR function and ligand specificities has historically been obtained mainly from deorphanisation studies on <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other holometabolan insects using various heterologous expression systems. Recently, this bias was in part compensated by OR deorphanisations in more basal taxa, e.g., the wingless Archaeognatha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">del Mármol et al., 2021</xref>), or the hemimetabolous aphids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">2019a</xref>) and locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Guo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chang et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
    <p>Within social insects, eusocial Hymenoptera received considerable attention both in terms of OR repertoire reconstructions and functional characterizations with multiple ORs being deorphanized in ants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pask et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Slone et al., 2017</xref>) and the honey bee (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gomez Ramirez et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wanner et al., 2007</xref>). The amassed knowledge suggests that the complex communication and orientation capabilities in the colonies of eusocial Hymenoptera are facilitated by the greatly expanded repertoire of ORs, especially that of the 9-exon subfamily in ants and paper wasps participating in the detection of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) as important cues in contact chemoreception of colony and caste identity and fertility status in eusocial insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Engsontia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Legan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">McKenzie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pask et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). The 9-exon subfamily and the overall OR richness have been inherited by the extant eusocial Hymenoptera from the ancestor of Aculeata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">McKenzie et al., 2016</xref>), and also solitary aculeate taxa display large OR repertoires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Obiero et al., 2021</xref>); this preadaptation might had been important for the repeated emergence of eusociality and the related complex communication. This is supported by the reduction of OR array (including 9-exon genes) in parasitic ant taxa, along with the simplification of their behavioral repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jongepier et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The multiple convergences in biology and life histories between termites and ants call for comparison of olfactory detection of chemical signals and environmental cues in the two groups. Yet, despite relatively good knowledge on chemistry of termite pheromones and recognition cues (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bagnères &amp; Hanus, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bordereau &amp; Pasteels, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mitaka &amp; Akino, 2021</xref>), molecular aspects of olfaction remain largely understudied in termites. Termite ORs were so far only addressed with respect to their diversity, inferred from genome assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Harrison et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Terrapon et al., 2014</xref>) or whole-body transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mitaka et al., 2016</xref>), recently complemented by comprehensive search for chemosensory protein repertoire using the antennal transcriptomes of three termite species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Johny et al., 2023</xref>). Termite ORs are organized in relatively conserved, highly orthologous pattern and their total numbers range from 28 to 69 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Johny et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Terrapon et al., 2014</xref>). These numbers are lower than in their solitary cockroach relative <italic>Blattella germanica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Harrison et al., 2018</xref>), and dramatically lower than in ants, having up to over 400 ORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Engsontia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Legan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">McKenzie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pask et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, termites clearly contradict the paradigm on eusociality as a driver of OR richness, even though their chemical communication is by far more complex than in solitary insects and includes pheromone components from a variety of chemical classes, such as fatty-acyl derived alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, terpenoids, and, last, but not least, the CHCs. Independently of eusocial Hymenoptera, termites evolved an intricate communication system using CHCs as kin- and nestmate discrimination cues and as indicators of caste identity and fertility status (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bagnères &amp; Hanus, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mitaka &amp; Akino, 2021</xref>). Therefore, compared to ants, the termite social evolution seemingly adopted a different trajectory to accommodate the needs of chemical communication, including CHC detection.</p>
<p>One of alternative hypotheses springs from observations that termites possess an extraordinarily rich set of ionotropic receptors (IRs), reaching up to more than one hundred in some species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Harrison et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Johny et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Terrapon et al., 2014</xref>). Even though the richness of IRs is shared by termites and their cockroach relatives, with <italic>B. germanica</italic> having the largest IR repertoire ever identified in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Robertson et al., 2018</xref>), IRs also underwent termite-specific expansions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Harrison et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Johny et al., 2023</xref>). Since insect IRs have been shown to respond to volatile ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Benton et al., 2009</xref>), we cannot rule out that they also participate in the complex chemical communication in termites as has been previously speculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Harrison et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, since no chemosensory proteins have yet been functionally characterized in termites, ORs remain the prime candidates for pheromone detection.</p>
<p>Here, we report on the first OR deorphanization in termites. We build on the knowledge about the chemical ecology of the Cuban subterranean termite <italic>Prorhinotermes simplex</italic> (Rhinotermitidae) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hanus et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jirošová et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Piskorski et al., 2007</xref>), on the annotated repertoire of 50 ORs from <italic>P. simplex</italic> antennal transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Johny et al., 2023</xref>), on additional <italic>P. simplex</italic> sequencing data (caste-specific head transcriptomes, draft genome assembly), and on laboratory culture of the species. We select four <italic>P. simplex</italic> OR sequences, study their function by means of the Empty Neuron <italic>Drosophila</italic> expression system and single-sensillum recording (SSR) using panels of biologically relevant ligands including the <italic>P. simplex</italic> pheromones and chemically related compounds. We identify PsimOR14 as the pheromone receptor narrowly tuned to the monocyclic diterpene neocembrene, known as the major component of the trail-following pheromone (TFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sillam-Dussès et al., 2009</xref>). We demonstrate strong and selective response of PsimOR14 to neocembrene, with only one additional ligand, geranylgeraniol, generating non-negligible receptor response. We further report on homology-based modelling of neocembrene binding by PsimOR14 and perform molecular dynamics simulations to estimate the impact of ligand binding on PsimOR14 dynamicity. Finally, we identify the <italic>P. simplex</italic> olfactory sensillum specifically responding to neocembrene and document worker caste-biased expression of PsimOR14 accompanied by significantly higher sensitivity to neocembrene compared to <italic>P. simplex</italic> soldiers.</p>

<p>In the first step, we reconstructed the phylogeny of termite ORs and ORCos using published protein sequences from two species in combination with our antennal transcriptome data on three species and the bristletail <italic>Lepisma saccharina</italic> as basal insect outgroup. In the resulting tree, all ORCo sequences and ORs from <italic>L. saccharina</italic> were basally situated, while majority of termite OR sequences were organized into two large sister clusters, both of which were further split into several sub-branches mostly containing one sequences from all five termite species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Only a few exceptions to this highly orthologous pattern were spotted, such as isolated sequences or species-specific expansions with a maximum of four paralogs.</p>

<title>Identification of <italic>P. simplex</italic> olfactory sensillum responding to neocembrene</title>
<p>Our next goal was to identify the antennal olfactory sensillum responsible for neocembrene detection by <italic>P. simplex</italic> workers using a combination of SSR measurements with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution SEM (HR-SEM) imaging. Since no previous study reported SSR responses of termite olfactory sensilla to pheromones or environmental cues, we decided to search for the neocembrene-detecting sensillum on the last flagellomere, known to harbor by far the most sensilla in termite workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Castillo et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In SSR experiments with the termite-relevant compounds from Panel 1, we obtained strong response to both neocembrene and geranylgeraniol from a short multiporous grooved sensillum situated in the apical part of the last antennal segment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). The response of this sensillum to neocembrene was confirmed on workers originating from two different colonies. Detailed view on spontaneous firing pattern of the neocembrene-responding sensillum revealed three different spike amplitudes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), suggesting the potential presence of as many as three olfactory sensory neurons (a–c). Comparison with spike amplitudes upon neocembrene and geranylgeraniol stimulations then indicated that the responses are generated by the neuron labeled as b.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Identification of PsimOR14 as the pheromone receptor narrowly tuned to neocembrene in <italic>P. simplex</italic> represents the first OR deorphanisation in termites and confirms that the trail-following communication is mediated by odorant receptors. This assumption, validated here for the monocyclic diterpene neocembrene, is indirectly supported by previous experiments in two termite species having a C<sub>12</sub> fatty alcohol as TFP; ORCo silencing in these species impaired the ability to follow the foraging trail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). Because trail-following in termites has the shared evolutionary origin with courtship communication and both neocembrene and C<sub>12</sub> alcohols also occur as sex-pairing pheromone components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bagnères &amp; Hanus, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bordereau &amp; Pasteels, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sillam-Dussès, 2010</xref>), it is likely that the two communication modalities share identical or closely related ORs. Future OR deorphanizations should test this hypothesis and provide an insight on how the functional diversification of trail-following and sex attraction is imprinted into the OR evolution.</p>
<p>Neurophysiological characteristics of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ab3A neuron expressing PsimOR14 showed expected patterns of spontaneous firing rates of units of Hz (6.87 ± 4.73, mean ± SD) and maximum firing rates of 90 spikes/s at the highest used neocembrene doses (1 µg), though not reaching the reported maxima for ab3A responses with genuine and exogenous receptors, which may be well over 100 spikes/s (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chahda et al., 2019</xref>). This confirms that co-expression of termite ORs with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORCo using the Empty Neuron system is a suitable technique for termite OR characterizations. PsimOR14 has a narrow tuning to neocembrene with receptor lifetime sparseness equal to 0.88. ORs detecting pheromone components (pheromone receptors) and other volatiles with high biological importance, such as key food or host attractants, are often expressed in specialized sensilla and are highly selective, in contrast to the broad tuning of ORs sensing the general environmental stimuli (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Carey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fleischer &amp; Krieger, 2018</xref>). Such a high selectivity is the best known for sex pheromone receptors, e.g. in moths (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zhang &amp; Löfstedt, 2015</xref>) or <italic>Drosophila</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Haverkamp, et al. 2018</xref>), mostly tuned to a single compound, even though in some cases the respective ORs can be adaptively shaped to selectively detect more pheromone compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Díaz-Morales et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mariette et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, the narrow tuning of PsimOR14 is in line with expectations from a pheromone receptor, especially when considering the ancient origin of trail-following from sex-pairing behavior and the great importance of TFP for concerted foraging in these blind insects. Nevertheless, due to the low coverage of insect diversity by OR deorphanization studies and their strong bias towards derived Holometabola, it remains difficult to make any general considerations about the OR selectivity relative to the receptor function across Insecta. This has been recently demonstrated by a comprehensive functional characterization of ORs in migratory locust unveiling an unexpected design of the olfactory information decoding, consisting of a large set of narrowly tuned ORs for environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chang et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>With average Δ spike/s over 20, the linear diterpene alcohol geranylgeraniol was the only other agonist with non-negligible response. None of the remaining compounds elicited a Δ spike of more than 7, despite the presence of multiple other compounds derived from terpenoid scaffolds in the tested panels. It is difficult to attribute any adaptive significance to this observation since there is no record of geranylgeraniol in communication context in termites. Therefore, the observed significant biological activity, high docking score and high ranking in free energy comparison, may be due to non-adaptive binding affinity of PsimOR14 to the non-native ligand (see also below). Interestingly, another related terpene alcohol, the monoterpene linalool, had the biggest negative Δ spike score (-6.8) and the absolute spikes/s ranged from 0 to 5 (1.5 ± 1.9, mean ± SD), suggesting a possible inverse agonist function of linalool.</p>
<p>The neocembrene-sensing sensilla identified using SSR in <italic>P. simplex</italic> workers provided a response pattern to Panel 1 very similar to that of <italic>PsimOR14</italic>-expressing ab3 <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensillum, e.g., strong response to neocembrene followed by geranylgeraniol, supporting independently the results obtained from transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic>. No other important responses to termite pheromone components from the Panel 1, which also included the minor <italic>P. simplex</italic> TFP component (3<italic>Z</italic>,6<italic>Z</italic>,8<italic>E</italic>)-dodecatrien-1-ol, were recorded, in spite of the likely presence of two additional olfactory neurons housed in the neocembrene-detecting sensillum. The function of these additional neurons remains elusive and examples from other insects offer multiple scenarios. A neuron expressing a highly selective pheromone receptor may co-exist with functionally independent neurons detecting environmental cues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Tateishi et al. 2020</xref>), or the co-habitation of several neurons may generate more complex interactions such as lateral inhibition of the neighboring neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Su et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zhang et al., 2019b</xref>). However, it must be noted, that our SSR analyses focused a specific sensillum defined by its topology on the last flagellomere and we did not perform a comprehensive mapping of olfactory sensilla on the entire worker antenna. Therefore, also our image on the distribution of neocembrene-detecting sensilla and the pattern of neurons housed in these sensilla is incomplete.</p>
<p>The basic PsimOR14 protein architecture with seven transmembrane domains is typical for insect ORs. Likewise, the docking experiments identified a binding site defined by a binding pocket deep in the transmembrane region, homologous to that in previously studied insect ORs, and confirmed the nature of the ligand binding to mainly rely on hydrophobic interactions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">del Mármol et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Pettersson &amp; Cattaneo, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Yuvaraj et al., 2021</xref>). In case of PsimOR14, mainly the residues from S3 and S4 interacted with the studied ligands; these transmembrane domains were shown to participate in ligand binding also in other studied insect ORs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">del Mármol et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Yuvaraj et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zhao et al. 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>The calculated binding scores for the three tested ligands correlated with observed biological effects of the ligands. The MM/PBSA data also in part corroborated the SSR measurements by estimating (+)-limonene as the worst agonist; by contrast, geranylgeraniol and not neocembrene ranked as the best ligand. This may potentially be explained by the additional residues interacting with geranylgeraniol compared to neocembrene and (+)-limonene, and the relatively higher contribution of electrostatic interactions in geranylgeraniol binding. Moreover, in systems where ligand binding induces allosteric effects, as is the case of insect ORs, the simple binding affinity does not provide a complete picture of receptor signal transduction function.</p>
<p>In contrast to the general protein stabilization upon binding of the three tested ligands, some parts of the intracellular S4-S5 loop showed a significant increase in the dynamics upon binding of the biologically active ligands geranylgeraniol and neocembrene, compared to apoform and the weak agonist (+)-limonene binding. What is the mechanistic role of this allosteric transmission of the binding effect to the intracellular loop remains elusive. However, the impact of the S4-S5 loop on OR function has previously been reported for the MhOR5 from <italic>Machilis hrabei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">del Mármol et al., 2021</xref>); replacement of the loop with a short linker increased the receptor response to native ligand. Interestingly, in some insect ORs this loop has been reduced to a short sequence of a few residues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wang et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>PsimOR14</italic> does not belong to the most expressed <italic>P. simplex</italic> ORs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, interestingly, it is among those having the most caste-biased expression with significantly higher transcript abundance in antennae of workers compared to soldiers. Accordingly, also the electrophysiological responses of workers to neocembrene were significantly stronger in workers.</p>
<p>Termite soldiers are known to lay pheromone trails, to detect TFPs and to participate in foraging and field exploration in a number of termite species, though the behavioral patterns of soldiers and workers during these activities differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kaib, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Traniello, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Traniello &amp; Busher, 1985</xref>). This has also been demonstrated in a close relative to our model, the congeneric species <italic>Prorhinotermes inopinatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rupf &amp; Roisin, 2008</xref>). Yet, differences in sensitivity of termite workers and soldiers have not previously been addressed at the electrophysiological level. Caste-biased <italic>PsimOR14</italic> expression and neocembrene sensitivity may represent olfactory information filtering adaptive to the different tasks of the two castes, as documented, e.g., in ants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Caminer et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Genus <italic>Prorhinotermes</italic> is the most basally situated termite taxon known to have a terpenoid component as a part of its pheromone repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sillam-Dussès et al., 2009</xref>). The acquisition of terpenoid pheromone components is undoubtedly due to the evolution of terpene biosynthesis in basal Neoisoptera, which has led to the fascinating diversity of defensive terpenoids produced by soldiers of Neoisoptera in their frontal gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gössinger, 2019</xref>). In line with general observations on pheromone evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Steiger et al., 2010</xref>), some of these defensive terpenoids from the frontal gland gained via exaptation a novel function of alarm pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dolejšová et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Roisin et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Šobotník et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">2010</xref>). Likewise, the cyclic diterpenes probably became part of trail-following pheromones and sex-pairing pheromones by co-opting the terpenoid biosynthesis in exocrine glands other than the defensive frontal gland of soldiers. Beside the occurrence of neocembrene in the sub-basal <italic>Prorhinotermes</italic>, it only occurs as a pheromone component in much later diverging representatives of the subfamily Nasutitermitinae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bordereau &amp; Pasteels, 2011</xref>). Once reliable genome or antennal transcriptome of Nasutitermitinae become available, it would be of interest to search in these species for OR orthologs of PsimOR14 and test whether they have retained the function of neocembrene detection.</p>
<p>Insect ORs are frequently organized in tandem arrays (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bohbot et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">McKenzie and Kronauer, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Robertson and Wanner, 2006</xref>). Likewise, the genomic locus of <italic>PsimOR14</italic> contains a likely tandem copy paralog of <italic>PsimOR15</italic> gene. The two genes share the gene architecture, and their transcripts are equally represented in worker antennal transcriptome, though <italic>PsimOR15</italic> does not display the caste-biased expression. Thanks to the close similarity of both genes, <italic>PsimOR15</italic> is a candidate for potential pheromone receptor function.</p>
<p>Future research in termites should also aim at finding the ORs or other chemosensory proteins involved in the detection of CHCs. In spite of the similarities in CHC roles in termites and ants, ranging from nestmate recognition to fertility signaling, termite OR sequences do not show any conspicuous expansions analogous to 9-exon subfamily in ants. Therefore, finding the chemosensory principle of CHC detection in termites would bring another piece of knowledge about the fascinating convergent evolution in these two unrelated major groups of eusocial insects. Yet another appealing target for OR deorphanization is the search for pheromone receptors of queen pheromones, the central signals ensuring the reproductive dominance of queens in the colonies of social insects. In the honeybee and ants, narrowly tuned ORs responding to main queen pheromone components were already described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wanner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pask et al., 2017</xref>). In termites, queen pheromones were so far only identified in two species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dolejšová et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Matsuura et al. 2010</xref>). They are volatile and were shown to act as airborne signals via olfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dolejšová et al., 2022</xref>), it is thus reasonable to expect a selective OR responsible for their detection.</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>SSR recordings on <italic>Drosophila</italic> ab3 sensillum were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benton &amp; Dahanukar, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Olsson &amp; Hansson, 2013</xref>). We used 2–4 days old flies for one recording per each to avoid neuronal adaptations from multiple stimulations. To expose more ab3 sensilla, the fly preparation was done with arista down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Keesey et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In termites, the olfactory sensilla situated on the last antennal flagellomere of workers were targeted for SSR, since their number increases towards the distal end of termite antennae, the last segment being significantly more populated by olfactory sensilla than any other segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Castillo et al., 2021</xref>). The grounding electrode was carefully inserted into the clypeus and the antenna was fixed on a microscope slide using a glass electrode. To avoid the antennal movement, the microscope slide was covered with double-sided tape and the three distal antennal segments were attached to the slide.</p>
<p>The sensilla were observed under the Nikon FN1 eclipse microscope at 60× magnification. For all electrophysiological measurements, the recording electrode was brought into contact with the base of the sensillum using a Kleindiek Nanotechnik MM3A micromanipulator connected to a cubic micromanipulator device. Using Syntech stimulus delivery system (CS55 model, Syntech, Germany), the odorant stimulus was administered as a 0.3 s pulse by inserting the tip of the glass Pasteur pipette through an opening into the delivery tube (situated 4 cm from the tube outlet) carrying a purified air stream (0.4 L/min). The tube outlet was placed approximately 1 cm from the antenna. The experiments were conducted at 25–26 °C.</p>
<p>From each diluted odorant (100 ng/µL), 10 µL were pipetted on 1 cm diameter filter paper disk placed in a glass Pasteur pipette in the screening experiment, while the doses ranging from 0.01 to 500 ng of neocembrene per filter paper were used in the dose-response experiments.</p>
<p>The signal was amplified and digitally converted using Syntech IDAC-4. The neuronal cells were sorted based on their amplitude and the spikes were counted using the AutoSpike v3.9software (Syntech Ockenfels, Germany). Δ spike was calculated by subtracting the number of spikes during 1 second post-stimulation from the number of spikes generated 1 second before the stimulation. In dose response experiments and measurements on termite antennae, the counting periods were 0.5s. Δ spike values were corrected by subtracting the response generated by the solvent and converted into Δ spike/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benton &amp; Dahanukar, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Olsson &amp; Hansson, 2013</xref>). The receptor lifetime sparseness value was calculated according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chang et al. (2023)</xref>.</p>
<p>EAG experiment addressing the caste-specificity of antennal responses to neocembrene was performed with 15 workers and 15 soldiers; each individual was only used for one stimulation series consisting of air–hexane–neocembrene (10 ng)–hexane–air. Brain and antennal tip were placed between two Ag/AgCl electrodes containing Ringer’s solution and connected to a high impedance (10<sup>14</sup> Ω) amplifier (Syntech, Buchenbach, Germany). The antennal preparation was placed into a stream of cleaned air (500 mL/min), into which the stimuli were injected from Pasteur pipettes containing a 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> filter paper impregnated with 10 µL of the tested solution. Odor injections were controlled by a foot switch-operated Syntech stimulus controller and maximal negative deflection was measured using Syntech EagPro software. Pasteur pipettes containing odorant stimuli were changed after three stimulations. Air responses were used for data normalization, the responses log<sub>2</sub>-transformed to reduce heteroscedasticity and comply with assumptions for parametric testing (Bartlett test for equal variances, and Shapiro-Wilk normality test), and then compared between workers and soldiers using Student’s t-test.</p>

<p>For SEM, 10 workers with intact antennae were cold-anesthetized and decapitated with micro-scissors. Heads were desiccated in increasing ethanol concentrations (60, 80, 90, and 96%, each for 2 h) followed by 12 h in acetone. Heads were then attached to aluminium holders for microscopy using adhesive tape, and differentially oriented to allow axial, dorsal, ventral, and lateral views. The samples were gold-coated for regular SEM (4 nm gold layer) and high-resolution SEM (HR-SEM, 2 nm) using sputter coater Bal-Tec SCD 050. Last antennal segments were inspected and photographed under scanning electron microscope JEOL 6380 LV (SEM). Surface of particular sensilla were studied using high resolution field emission scanning electron microscope JSM-IT800 (HR-SEM) and Olympus Soft Imaging Solution software. Working distance for all samples was 4.0–4.1 mm and accelerating voltage 2.0 kV.</p>

<p>Unless noted otherwise, all reactions were carried out under argon in oven-dried glassware. Solvents were distilled from drying agents as indicated and transferred under nitrogen: THF (Na/benzophenone), toluene (Na/benzophenone). All starting materials were used as purchased (Sigma Aldrich, Combi-Blocks), unless otherwise indicated. Chromatography was performed using Fluka silica gel 60 (0.040 - 0.063 mm). For TLC analysis, F254 – coated aluminum sheets were used. The spots were detected both in UV and by the solution of Ce(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O (1%) and H<sub>3</sub>P(Mo<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>)<sub>4</sub> (2%) in 10% sulfuric acid. <sup>1</sup>H- and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz and 100 MHz, respectively, with a Bruker 400 MHz instrument at 25 °C (the solvents are indicated in parentheses). Chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to TMS. The residual solvent signals in the <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were used as an internal reference (CDCl<sub>3</sub>: δ = 7.26 for <sup>1</sup>H and δ = 77.23 for <sup>13</sup>C). The compounds were analyzed using the gas chromatograph TRACE 1310 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), equipped with a nonpolar Zebron ZB-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) connected to a ThermoFisher Scientific ISQ LT mass-selective detector (70eV ionization voltage, source temperature 200 °C, transferline heated to 260 °C). The column temperature was held at 50 °C for 1 min, gradually increased to 320 °C at 8 °C/min and then held at 320 °C for 20 min. Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow 1.2 mL/min. Split/splitless port was heated to 200 °C, and samples were injected in splitless mode with a purge time of 1 min.</p>

<body>
<p>This <bold>important</bold> work by Diallo et al. substantially advances our understanding of the chemosensory system of a non-hymenopteran eusocial insect by identifying the first olfactory receptor for the trail pheromone in termites.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their comprehensive analysis Diallo et al. deorphanise the first olfactory receptor of a non-hymenopteran eusocial insect - a termite and identified the well established trail pheromone neocembrene as the receptor's best ligand. By using a large set of odorants the authors convincingly show that, as expected for a pheromone receptor, PsimOR14 is very narrowly tuned. While the authors first make use of an ectopic expression system, the empty neuron of Drosophila melanogaster, to characterise the receptor's responses, they next perform single sensillum recordings with different sensilla types on the termite antenna. By that they are able to identify a sensillum which houses three neurons, of which the B neuron exhibits the narrow responses described for PsimOR14. Hence the authors do not only identify the first pheromone receptor in a termite but can even localise its expression on the antenna. The authors in addition perform a structural analysis to explain the binding properties of the receptor and its major and minor ligands (as this is beyond my expertise, I cannot judge this part of the manuscript). Finally, they compare expression patterns of ORs in different castes and find that PsimOR14 is more strongly expressed in worker than in soldier termites, which corresponds well with stronger antennal responses in the worker caste.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written and a pleasure to read.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Whenever it comes to the deorphanization of a receptor and its potential role in behaviour (in the case of the manuscript it would be trail following of the termite) one thinks immediately of knocking out the receptor to check whether it is necessary for the behaviour. However, I definitely do not want to ask for this (especially as the establishment of CRISPR Cas-9 in eusocial insects usually turns out to be a nightmare). I also do not know either, whether knock downs via RNAi have been established in termites, but maybe the authors could consider some speculation on this in the discussion.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I appreciate how the authors have replied to my comments and I have the feeling that also the other reviewers' comments have been dealt with carefully. I therefore support the acceptance of this very nice and interesting manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors performed the functional analysis of odorant receptors (ORs) of the termite Prorhinotermes simplex to identify the receptor of trail-following pheromone. The authors performed single-sensillum recording (SSR) using the transgenic Drosophila flies expressing a candidate of the pheromone receptor and revealed that PsimOR14 strongly responds to neocembrene, the major component of the pheromone. Also, the authors found that one sensillum type (S I) detects neocembrene and also performed SSR for S I in the wild termite workers. Furthermore, the authors revealed the gene, transcript, and protein structures of PsimOR14, predict the 3D model and ligand docking of PsimOR14, and demonstrated that PsimOR14 is higher expressed in workers than soldiers using RNA-seq for heads of workers and soldiers of P. simplex and that EAG response to neocembrene is higher in workers than soldiers. I considered that this study will contribute to further understanding of the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms of chemoreception system in termites.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written. As far as I know, this study is the first study that identified a pheromone receptor in termites. The authors not only present a methodology for analyzing the function of termite pheromone receptors but also provide important insights in terms of the evolution of ligand selectivity of termite pheromone receptors.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>This revised manuscript appears to me to have no major weaknesses.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Chemical communication is essential for the organization of eusocial insect societies. It is used in various important contexts, such as foraging and recruiting colony members to food sources. While such pheromones have been chemically identified and their function demonstrated in bioassays, little is known about their perception. Excellent candidates are the odorant receptors that have been shown to be involved in pheromone perception in other insects including ants and bees but not termites. The authors investigated the function of the odorant receptor PsimOR14, which was one of four target odorant receptors based on gene sequences and phylogenetic analyses. They used the Drosophila empty neuron system to demonstrate that the receptor was narrowly tuned to the trail pheromone neocembrene. Similar responses to the odor panel and neocembrene in antennal recordings suggested that one specific antennal sensillum expresses PsimOR14. Additional protein modeling approaches characterized the properties of the ligand binding pocket in the receptor. Finally, PsimOR14 transcripts were found to be significantly higher in worker antennae compared to soldier antennae, which corresponds to the worker's higher sensitivity to neocembrene.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study presents an excellent characterization of a trail pheromone receptor in a termite species. The integration of receptor phylogeny, receptor functional characterization, antennal sensilla responses, receptor structure modeling, and transcriptomic analysis is especially powerful. All parts build on each other and are well supported with a good sample size. (I cannot comment on protein modeling and docking due to a lack of expertise in this area)</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>None.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that a functional proof of the PsimOR14 function using reverse genetics would be a valuable addition to the study to firmly establish its role in trail pheromone sensing. Nevertheless, such a functional proof is difficult to obtain. Due to the very slow ontogenetic development inherent to termites (several months from an egg to the worker stage) the CRISPR Cas-9 is not a useful technique for this taxon. By contrast, termites are quite responsive to RNAimediated silencing and RNAi has previously been used for the silencing of the ORCo co-receptor in termites resulting in impairment of the trail-following behavior (DOI: 10.1093/jee/toaa248). Likewise, our previous experiments showed a decreased ORCo transcript abundance, lower sensitivity to neocembrene and reduced neocembrene trail following upon dsPsimORCo administration to <italic>P. simplex</italic> workers, while we did not succeed in reducing the transcript abundance of PsimOR14 upon dsPsimOR14 injection. We do not report these negative results in the present manuscript so as not to dilute the main message. In parallel, we are currently developing an alternative way of dsRNA delivery using nanoparticle coating, which may improve the RNAi experiments with ORs in termites.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript would benefit from a more detailed explanation of the research advances this work provides. Stating that this is the first deorphanization of an odorant receptor in a clade is insufficient. The introduction primarily reviews termite chemical communication and deorphanization of olfactory receptors previously performed. Although this is essential background, it lacks a good integration into explaining what problem the current study solves.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the comment about the lack of an intelligible cue to highlight the motivation and importance of the present study. In the current version of the manuscript the introduction has been reworked. As suggested by Reviewer 3 in the Recommendations section below, the introduction now integrates some parts of the original discussion, especially the part discussing the OR evolution and emergence of eusociality in hymenopteran social insects and in termites, while underscoring the need of data from termites to compare the commonalities and idiosyncrasies in neurophysiological (pre)adaptations potentially linked with the independent eusociality evolution in the two main social insect clades.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Selecting target ORs for deorphanization is an essential step in the approach. Unfortunately, the process of choosing these ORs has not been described. Were the authors just lucky that they found the correct OR out of the 50, or was there a specific selection process that increased the probability of success?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, we were extremely lucky. Our strategy was to first select a modest set of ORs to confirm the feasibility of the Empty Neuron <italic>Drosophila</italic> system and newly established SSR setup, while taking advantage of having a set of termite pheromones, including those previously identified in the <italic>P. simplex</italic> model, some of them <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized for this project. The selection criteria for the first set of four receptors were (i) to have full-length ORF and at least 6 unambiguously predicted transmembrane regions, and (ii) to be represented on different branches (subbranches) of the phylogenetic tree. Then it was a matter of a good luck to hit the PsimOR14 selectively responding to the genuine <italic>P. simplex</italic> trail-following pheromone main component. In the revised version, we state these selection criteria in the results section (Phylogenetic reconstruction and candidate OR selection).</p>
<p>The deorphanization attempts of additional <italic>P. simplex</italic> ORs are currently running.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors assigned antennal sensilla into five categories. Unfortunately, they did not support their categories well. It is not clear how they were able to differentiate SI and SII in their antennal recordings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the classification of multiporous sensilla into five categories lacks robust discrimination cues. The identification of the neocembrene-responding sensillum was initially carried out by SSR measurements on individual olfactory sensilla of <italic>P. simplex</italic> workers one-by-one and the topology of each tested sensillum was recorded on optical microscope photographs taken during the SSR experiment. Subsequently, the SEM and HR-SEM were performed in which we localized the neocembrene sensillum and tried to find distinguishing characters. We admit that these are not robust. Therefore, in the revised version of the manuscript we decided to abandon the attempt of sensilla classification and only report the observations about the specific sensillum in which we consistently recorded the response to neocembrene (and geranylgeraniol). The modifications affect Fig. 4, its legend and the corresponding part of the results section (Identification of <italic>P. simplex</italic> olfactory sensillum responding to neocembrene).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors used a large odorant panel to determine receptor tuning. The panel included volatile polar compounds and non-volatile non-polar hydrocarbons. Usually, some heat is applied to such non-volatile odorants to increase volatility for receptor testing. It is unclear how it is possible that these non-volatile compounds can reach the tested sensilla without heat application.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer points at an important methodological error we made while designing the experiments. Indeed, the inclusion of long-chain hydrocarbons into Panel 1 without additional heat applied to the odor cartridges was inappropriate, even though the experiments were performed at 25–26 °C. We carefully considered the best solution to correct the mistake and finally decided to remove all tested ligands beyond C22 from Panel 1, i.e. altogether five compounds. These changes did not affect the remaining Panels 2-4 (containing compounds with sufficient volatility), nor did they affect the message of the manuscript on highly selective response of PsimOR14 to neocembrene (and geranylgeryniol). In consequence, Figures 2, 3 and 5 were updated, along with the supplementary tables containing the raw data on SSR measurements. In addition, the tuning curve for PsimOR14 was re-built and receptor lifetime sparseness value re-calculated (without any important change). We also exchanged squalene for limonene in the docking and molecular dynamics analysis and made new calculations.</p>

<p>(4) L260-265: The authors confirmed higher expression of PsimOR14 in workers than soldiers by using RNA-seq data and stronger EAG responses of PsimOR14 to neocembrene in workers than soldiers, but I think that confirming the expression levels of PsimOR14 in workers and soldiers by RT-qPCR would strengthen the authors' argument (it is optional).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>qPCR validation is a suitable complement to read count comparison of RNA Seq data, especially when the data comes from one-sample transcriptomes and/or low coverage sequencing. Yet, our RNA Seq analysis is based on sequencing of three independent biological replicates per phenotype (worker heads vs. soldier heads) with ~20 millions of reads per sample. Thus, the resulting differential gene expression analysis is a sufficient and powerful technique in terms of detection limit and dynamic range.</p>
<p>We admit that the replicate numbers and origin of the RNA seq data should be better specified since the Methods section only referred to the GenBank accession numbers in the original manuscript. Therefore, we added more information in the Methods section (Bioinformatics) and make clear in the Methods that this data comes from our previous research and related bioproject.</p>

<p>(9) L860-864: Why did the authors select the result of edgeR for the volcano plot in Figure 7 although the authors use both DESeq2 and edgeR? An explanation would be needed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Both algorithms, DESeq2 and EdgeR, are routinely used for differential gene expression analysis. Since they differ in read count normalization method and statistical testing we decided to use both of them independently in order to reduce false positives. Because the resulting fold changes were practically identical in both algorithms (results for both analyses are listed in Supplementary table S15), we only reported in Fig. 7 the outputs for edgeR to avoid redundancies. We added in the Results section the information that both techniques listed PsimOR14 among the most upregulated in workers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The discussion contains many descriptions that would fit better into the introduction, where they could be used to hint at the study's importance (e.g., 292-311, 381-412). The remaining parts often lack a detailed discussion of the results that integrates details from other insect studies. Although references were provided, no details were usually outlined. It would be helpful to see a stronger emphasis on what we learn from this study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Along with rewriting the introduction, we also modified the discussion. As suggested, the lines 292-311 were rewritten and placed in the introduction. By contrast, we preferred to keep the two paragraphs 381-412 in the discussion, since both of them outline the potential future interesting targets of research on termite ORs.</p>
<p>As suggested, the discussion has been enriched and now includes comparative examples and relevant references about the broad/narrow selectivity of insect ORs, about the expected breadth of tuning of pheromone receptors vs. ORs detecting environmental cues, about the potential role of additional neurons housed in the neocembrene-detecting sensillum of <italic>P. simplex</italic> workers, etc. From both introduction and discussion the redundant details on the chemistry of termite communication have been removed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>This includes explanations of the advantages of the specific methodologies the authors used and how they helped solve the manuscript's problem. What does the phylogeny solve? Was it used to select the ORs tested? It would be helpful to discuss what the phylogeny shows in comparison to other well-studied OR phylogenies, like those from the social Hymenoptera.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the comment. In fact, our motivation to include the phylogenetic tree of termite ORs was essentially to demonstrate (i) the orthologous nature of OR diversity with few expansions on low taxonomic levels, and (ii) to demonstrate graphically the relationship among the four selected sequences. We do not attempt here for a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, because it would be redundant given that we recently published a large OR phylogeny which includes all sequences used in the present manuscript and analysed them in the proper context of related (cockroaches) and unrelated insect taxa (Johny et al., 2023). This paper also discusses the termite phylogenetic pattern with those observed in other Insecta. This paper is repeatedly cited on appropriate places of the present manuscript and its main observations are provided in the Introduction section. Therefore, we feel that thorough discussion on termite phylogeny would be redundant in the present paper.</p>

<p>The authors categorized the sensilla types. Potential problems in the categorization aside, it would be helpful to know if it is expected that you have sensilla specialized in perceiving one specific pheromone. What is known about sensilla in other insects?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand. In the discussion of the revised version, we develop more about the features typical/expected for a pheromone receptor and the sensillum housing this receptor together with two other olfactory sensory neurons, including examples from other insects.</p>

<p>(3) L129: How and why did the authors choose four candidate ORs? I could not find any information about this in the manuscript. I wondered why they did not pick the more highly expressed PsimOr20 and 26 (Figure 7).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As already replied above in the Weaknesses section, we selected for the first deorphanization attempts only a modest set of four ORs, while an additional set is currently being tested. We also explained above the inclusion criteria, i.e. (i) full-length ORF and at least 6 unambiguously predicted transmembrane regions, and (ii) presence on different branches (subbranches) of the OR phylogeny. For these reasons, we did not primarily consider the expression patterns of different ORs. As for Fig. 7, it shows differential expression between soldiers and workers, which was not the primary guideline either and the data was obtained only after having the ORs tested by SSR. Yet, even though we had data on <italic>P. simplex</italic> ORs expression (Fig. 1B), we did not presume that pheromone receptors should be among the most expressed ORs, given the richness of chemical cues detected by worker termites and unlike, e.g., male moths, where ORs for sex pheromones are intuitively highly expressed.</p>
<p>The strategy of OR selection is specified in the results section of the revised manuscript under “Phylogenetic reconstruction and candidate OR selection”.</p>

<p>(4) 198 to 200: SI, II, and III look very similar. Additional measurements rather than qualitative descriptions are required to consider them distinct sensilla. The bending of SIII could be an artifact of preparation. I do not see how the authors could distinguish between SI and SII under the optical microscope for recordings. A detailed explanation is required.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we responded above in “Weaknesses” chapter, we admit that the sensilla classification is not intelligible. Therefore, we decided in the revised version to abandon the classification of sensilla types and only focus on the observations made on the neocembreneresponding sensillum. To recognize the specific sensillum, we used its topology on the last antennal segment. Because termite antennae are not densely populated with sensilla, it is relatively easy to distinguish individual sensilla based on their topology on the antenna, both in optical microscope and SEM photographs. The modifications affect Fig. 4, its legend and the corresponding part of the results section (Identification of <italic>P. simplex</italic> olfactory sensillum responding to neocembrene).</p>

<p>(12) 501: How was the termite antenna fixated? The authors refer to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> methods, but given the large antennal differences between these species, more specific information would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Understood. We added the following information into the Methods section under “Electrophysiology”: “The grounding electrode was carefully inserted into the clypeus and the antenna was fixed on a microscope slide using a glass electrode. To avoid the antennal movement, the microscope slide was covered with double-sided tape and the three distal antennal segments were attached to the slide.”</p>

<p>(13)509: I want to confirm that the authors indicate that the outlet of the glass tube with the airstream and odorant is 4 cm away from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> or termite antenna. The distance seems to be very large.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for spotting this obvious mistake. The 4 cm distance applies for the distance between the opening for Pasteur pipette insertion into the delivery tube, the outlet itself is situated approx. 1 cm from the antenna. This information is now corrected.</p>

<p>(14) 510/527: It looks like all odor panels were equally applied onto the filter paper despite the difference in solvent (hexane and paraffin oil). How was the solvent difference addressed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our study we combine two types of odorant panels. First, we test on all four studied receptors a panel containing several compounds relevant for termite chemical communication including the C12 unsaturated alcohols, the diterpene neocembrene, the sesquiterpene (3R,6E)-nerolidol and other compounds. These compounds are stored in the laboratory as hexane solutions to prevent the oxidation/polymerization and it is not advisable to transfer them to another solvent. In the second step we used three additional panels of frequently occurring insect semiochemicals, which are stored as paraffin oil solutions, so as to address the breadth of PsimOR14 tuning. We are aware that the evaporation dynamics differ between the two solvents but we did not have any suitable option how to solve this problem. We believe that the use of the two solvents does not compromise the general message on the receptor specificity. For each panel, the corresponding solvent is used as a control. Similarly, the use of two different solvents for SSR can be encountered in other studies, e.g. 10.1016/j.celrep.2015.07.031.</p>

<p>(15) 518: delta spikes/sec works for all tables except for the wild type in Table S5. I could not figure out how the authors get to delta spikes/sec in that table.</p>

<p>Thank you for your sharp eye. Due to our mistake, the values of Δ spikes per second reported in Table S5 for W1118 were erroneously calculated using the formula for 0.5 sec stimulation instead of 1 sec. We corrected this mistake which does not impact the results interpretation in Table S5 and Fig. 2.</p>

<p>(16) Figure 6C/D: I suggest matching colors between the two figures.

In addition, the binding pocket could be separated better from anything else in a different color.</p>

<p>We agree that the color match for the intracellular flap was missing. This figure is now reworked and the colors should have a better match and the binding region is better delineated.</p>

<p>(17) Figure 7/Table S15: It is unclear where the transcriptome data originate and what they are based on. Are these antennal transcriptomes or head transcriptomes? Do these data come from previous data sets or data generated in this study? Figure 7 refers to heads, Table S15 to workers and soldiers, and the methods only refer to antennal extractions. This should be clarified in the text, the figure, and the table.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We admit that the replicate numbers and origin of the RNA seq data should be better specified and that the information that the RNASeq originated from samples of heads+antennae of workers and soldiers should be provided at appropriate places. Therefore, we added more information on replicates and origin of the data in the Methods section (Bioinformatics) and make clear that this data comes from our previous research and refer to the corresponding bioproject. Likewise, the Figure 7 legend and Table S15 heading have been updated.</p>
