<title>Abstract</title><p>Existence of cilia in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) raises a fundamental question in biology: how the transcriptional regulation of ciliogenesis has evolved? One conceptual answer to this question is by an ancient transcription factor regulating ciliary gene expression in both unicellular and multicellular organisms, but examples of such transcription factors in eukaryotes are lacking. Previously, we showed that an ancient transcription factor XAP5 is required for flagellar assembly in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. Here, we show that XAP5 and XAP5L are two conserved pairs of antagonistic transcription regulators that control ciliary transcriptional programs during spermatogenesis. Male mice lacking either XAP5 or XAP5L display infertility, as a result of meiotic prophase arrest and sperm flagella malformation, respectively. Mechanistically, XAP5 positively regulates the ciliary gene expression by activating the key regulators including FOXJ1 and RFX families during the early stage of spermatogenesis. In contrast, XAP5L negatively regulates the expression of ciliary genes via repressing these ciliary transcription factors during the spermiogenesis stage. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms by which temporal and spatial transcription regulators are coordinated to control ciliary transcriptional programs during spermatogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cilia and flagella are evolutionarily conserved hair-like microtubule organelles that project from the surfaces of most eukaryotic cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Derderian, Canales, &amp; Reiter, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mitchell, 2017</xref>). They play essential roles in sensory reception, signal transduction and cell movement(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Goetz &amp; Anderson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Nachury &amp; Mick, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Singla &amp; Reiter, 2006</xref>). The dysfunction of cilia in humans leads to an emerging class of genetic diseases called ciliopathies classified into first-order and second-order ciliopathies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ishikawa &amp; Marshall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lovera &amp; Lüders, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Reiter &amp; Leroux, 2017</xref>). First-order ciliopathies are caused by aberrations in ciliary proteins, and second-order ciliopathies occur due to defects in non- ciliary proteins, such as transcription factors, that are required for cilia formation and function(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Reiter &amp; Leroux, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Cilia are complex organelles and are dynamically regulated during development and the cell cycle(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Eggenschwiler &amp; Anderson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kasahara &amp; Inagaki, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Santos &amp; Reiter, 2008</xref>). The transcriptional regulation of ciliary genes must be precisely coordinated during ciliogenesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Choksi, Lauter, Swoboda, &amp; Roy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Collins, Ventrella, &amp; Mitchell, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lewis &amp; Stracker, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>). In metazoans, several transcription factors, including FOXJ1 and RFXs, have been shown to be involved in directing the expression of ciliary genes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Stubbs, Oishi, Izpisua Belmonte, &amp; Kintner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Swoboda, Adler, &amp; Thomas, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yu, Ng, Habacher, &amp; Roy, 2008</xref>). These key ciliary transcription factors show dynamic expression patterns during development and differentiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Stubbs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Swoboda et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). However, how these key transcriptional programs are spatially and temporally controlled by cell type-specific transcription factors and signaling pathways in order to activate specific target ciliary genes and generate diverse cilia is largely unknown.</p>
<p>Despite transcriptional regulation of ciliary genes is required for ciliogenesis in both unicellular and multicellular organisms, the underlying mechanism mediating ciliary gene expression may be fundamentally different, as the two major transcription factors, FOXJ1 and RFXs, are absent from many unicellular organisms(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chu, Baillie, &amp; Chen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Piasecki, Burghoorn, &amp; Swoboda, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Vij et al., 2012</xref>). Cilia and ciliary genes have been highly conserved throughout evolution, suggesting that the regulation of ciliary genes could be programmed by yet undiscovered transcriptional mechanisms, which possibly coevolved with multicellularity. Recently, an ancient transcription factor, XAP5, is found to regulate ciliary gene expression in a unicellular organism, <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Li et al., 2018</xref>). XAP5 is highly conserved among different species and is widely expressed across tissues(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Martin-Tryon &amp; Harmer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Mazzarella, Pengue, Yoon, Jones, &amp; Schlessinger, 1997</xref>). In vertebrates, <italic>XAP5-like</italic> (<italic>XAP5L</italic>) with an intronless open reading frame originated in Therians via retrotransposition of the ancestral <italic>XAP5</italic>, and it is highly expressed during spermatogenesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sedlacek et al., 1999</xref>; A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). However, whether XAP5 and XAP5L play essential roles in cilia development in multicellular organisms remains unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we show that XAP5/XAP5L are antagonistic transcription factors required for ciliary transcriptional programs during spermatogenesis. XAP5 is widely expressed in different tissues, while XAP5L is exclusively present in the testes. To explore the roles of XAP5/XAP5L in ciliogenesis, we generated a <italic>XAP5L</italic> knockout (KO) mouse line and found that <italic>XAP5L</italic> KO male mice are infertile due to the malformation of sperm flagella. Interestingly, male mice with the loss of XAP5 protein in germ cells also exhibited infertile, due to the arrest of spermatogenesis in the meiotic prophase stage. These data suggest that XAP5/XAP5L play crucial roles in sperm flagellar assembly. Mechanistically, XAP5 positively modulates transcriptional rewiring of ciliary genes via activating the key regulators including FOXJ1 and RFXs during the early stage of spermatogenesis. Conversely, XAP5L negatively regulates the transcriptional program controlling ciliogenesis by repressing these ciliary transcription factors during the spermiogenesis stage. Thus, ciliary transcriptional programs are spatially and temporally controlled by XAP5/XAP5L antagonistic transcription factors during spermatogenesis.</p>

<title>XAP5 and XAP5L are indispensable for male fertility</title>
<p>To explore the potential functions of XAP5/XAP5L during ciliogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed Western blot analysis to investigate the spatiotemporal expression of XAP5/XAP5L in various mouse tissues. We observed that XAP5 protein was widely expressed in diverse tissues and present at all stages of postnatal testes maturation, whereas XAP5L protein was mainly present in the testes and its level increased dramatically from postnatal day 21 (P21) and continued into adulthood (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref>, B). Next, we identified the specific testicular cell types expressing XAP5/XAP5L using published single-cell RNA-seq data(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Jung et al., 2019</xref>). XAP5 mRNA was found predominantly expressed in spermatogonia, while XAP5L mRNA was observed in pachytene spermatocytes, and remained until elongating spermatids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Consistent with the mRNA localization patterns, immunofluorescence staining showed that XAP5 protein was mainly detected in the nuclei of spermatogonia, whereas XAP5L protein was present in the nuclei of pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids within the seminiferous tubules, and neither of XAP5 or XAP5L was detected in mature sperm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate the physiological function of the uncharacterized XAP5/XAP5L protein, we attempted to generate global KO mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We successfully established a <italic>XAP5L</italic> KO mouse line (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2A</xref>-C) and found that while all <italic>XAP5L</italic> KO mice survived to adulthood and appeared indistinguishable from the wildtype (WT) mice, <italic>XAP5L</italic> KO males were sterile (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E</xref>, F). Notably, generating mosaic F0 founders with <italic>XAP5</italic> mutant allele proved challenging, and no F1 generation inherited the mutant alleles from the few F0 founders in over a year of breeding experiments, underscoring the critical roles of XAP5 in mouse development. Subsequently, we generated floxed-<italic>XAP5</italic> mice and crossed them with <italic>Stra8-GFPCre</italic> knockin mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lin et al., 2017</xref>) to produce <italic>XAP5</italic> germline-specific KO mice (<italic>XAP5</italic> cKO) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2D</xref>-F). Similar in appearance to controls (<italic>XAP5<sup>fl/Y</sup></italic>), all <italic>XAP5</italic> cKO males were also found to be sterile (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1G</xref>, H). Collectively, these results suggest that XAP5/XAP5L play essential roles in spermatogenesis.</p>

<title>XAP5 and XAP5L function at different stages of spermatogenesis</title>
<p>To uncover the cause of male infertility, we conducted gross and histological analyses of the testes from WT and <italic>XAP5L</italic> KO mice. There were no differences in the gross appearance of testis or in the weight of mouse body and testis between WT and XAP5L KO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Histological analysis did not reveal any severe abnormity in the seminiferous epithelial cycle of XAP5L KO testes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We then investigated the motility of sperm collected from cauda epididymis, and found that total motility of sperm was significantly reduced in <italic>XAP5L</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and Videos S1, 2). Further examination of the morphology and structure of cauda epididymal sperm in <italic>XAP5L</italic> KO mice revealed significantly higher rates of abnormal flagella (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D-F</xref>), indicating that XAP5L is crucial for flagellar assembly during spermiogenesis.</p>

<p>We also investigated the spermatogenic defects in the seminiferous tubules and epididymis of <italic>XAP5</italic> cKO male mice. Notably, the testes of <italic>XAP5</italic> cKO males were significantly smaller compared to WT controls at P16 and older (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Many seminiferous tubules in P16 and older <italic>XAP5</italic> cKO males were vacuolated due to the absence of spermatocytes and spermatids, as indicated by the lack of XY body formation and the absence of PNA signal, a marker of spermatids and sperm, in <italic>XAP5</italic> cKO germ cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B-D</xref>). As a consequence, no sperm were observed in the adult cauda epididymides of <italic>XAP5</italic> cKO mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that germ cell development in <italic>XAP5</italic> cKO males was arrested in meiotic prophase, and XAP5 is indispensable for meiotic progression during spermatogenesis.</p>

<title>XAP5 and XAP5L function as antagonistic regulators of ciliary transcriptional regulatory networks via regulating transcription factors</title>
<p>To gain insight into the regulatory mechanisms of XAP5L during sperm flagellar assembly, we employed RNA-seq analysis to examine mature sperm collected from the cauda epididymis of WT and <italic>XAP5L</italic> KO adult mice. Differential expression analysis identified 2093 upregulated and 267 downregulated genes in <italic>XAP5L</italic> KO sperm (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>). Gene ontology analysis revealed that the upregulated genes were associated with cilia assembly or function (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figures S3B</xref>, C). When crossed with the previously compiled ciliogenesis-related gene list(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Nemajerova et al., 2016</xref>), the upregulated genes were observed encompassing diverse structural and functional components of the ciliogenic program (Table S1 and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3D</xref>). Notably, several key transcription factor (TF) regulators of ciliogenesis were among the upregulated genes, including FOXJ1 and RFX families (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B</xref>, C and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3E</xref>). Moreover, several key regulators of spermatogenesis, particularly spermiogenesis, were identified, including RFX2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kistler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), SOX families(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Schartl et al., 2018</xref>; D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), TAF7L(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>) and TBPL1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Martianov et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3E</xref>). Many core ciliary genes were also upregulated, such as <italic>CFAP206</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Beckers et al., 2020</xref>) and <italic>IFT81</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Qu et al., 2020</xref>) which are critical for male fertility (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3E</xref>), consistent with the tight coregulation between spermiogenesis and cilia-related genes during spermatogenesis. These findings suggest that the genes identified in our study provide an excellent resource for candidates with novel ciliary or spermatogenesis-related functions, and the newly identified testes-specific protein TULP2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Oyama et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>) was selected for validation. We observed that <italic>TULP2</italic> KO male mice were sterile due to malformation of sperm flagella (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>). Overall, our results clearly indicate that XAP5L acts as a central transcriptional repressor of ciliogenesis during mouse spermatogenesis.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we performed RNA-seq analysis using P16 testes samples from WT and <italic>XAP5</italic> cKO mice to explore the underlying mechanism of XAP5-mediated germ cell loss. Differential expression analysis identified 554 upregulated and 1587 downregulated genes in <italic>XAP5</italic> cKO sperm (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref>). We observed that the downregulated genes in <italic>XAP5</italic> cKO males were involved in cilium assembly or functions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figures S5B</xref>-D). Strikingly, many of these downregulated genes were upregulated in <italic>XAP5L</italic> KO sperm, including the key ciliogenesis regulators FOXJ1 and RFX families (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E</xref>, F, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5E</xref> and Table S1). In addition, meiosis initiation marker STRA8(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ferder et al., 2019</xref>), meiosis-specific genes SPO11(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Romanienko &amp; Camerini-Otero, 2000</xref>) and DMC1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bishop, Park, Xu, &amp; Kleckner, 1992</xref>), key transcription regulators of spermiogenesis RFX2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kistler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), SOX30(D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) and CREM(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Blendy, Kaestner, Weinbauer, Nieschlag, &amp; Schutz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Nantel et al., 1996</xref>) were also downregulated in <italic>XAP5</italic> cKO mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E</xref> and S5F), consistent with the aforementioned result that loss of XAP5 induced spermatogenesis arrest in meiotic stage.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cilia and flagella are ancient organelles present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mitchell, 2017</xref>). Cilia assembly and maintenance are under strict transcriptional regulation in both unicellular and multicellular organisms(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Choksi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Collins et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lewis &amp; Stracker, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>). Despite cilia and flagella having an ancient origin, the evolutionary history of ciliary gene regulation has remained an unsolved problem. The main reason is that the master ciliary transcription factors found in multicellular organisms, including FOXJ1 and RFXs, are absent from unicellular organisms(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Choksi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Collins et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lewis &amp; Stracker, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>). Previously, we showed that an ancient transcription factor, XAP5, was required for flagella assembly in the unicellular green algae <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Li et al., 2018</xref>). XAP5 proteins are evolutionarily conserved across diverse organisms(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Li et al., 2018</xref>; Martin- Tryon &amp; Harmer, 2008), which offers the possibility to investigate the conservation of the role of XAP5 in multicellular organisms. In the present study, we report that XAP5 positively regulates transcriptional network of ciliary genes by activating the key regulators including FOXJ1 and RFXs during spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>Cilia are dynamic organelles, and the expression profile of ciliary genes is dynamic during the cell cycle and under certain physiological conditions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Eggenschwiler &amp; Anderson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kasahara &amp; Inagaki, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Santos &amp; Reiter, 2008</xref>). Cells have developed regulatory mechanisms to generate functional cilia in a temporal and spatial manner(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Choksi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Collins et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lewis &amp; Stracker, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>). However, how ciliary transcription factors determine temporal and spatial ciliary transcriptional programs is poorly understood. Sperm flagellar assembly is likewise tightly regulated during a highly complex temporal process named spermatogenesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Holstein, Schulze, &amp; Davidoff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>). Several key transcriptional regulators of spermatogenesis, such as FOXJ1 and RFX2, have been identified(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen, Knowles, Hebert, &amp; Hackett, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kistler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). The flagellar formation of FOXJ1-null sperm is severely impaired, and the FOXJ1 target genes are required for sperm motility(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Beckers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Weidemann et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>RFX2</italic> KO mice are completely sterile and RFX2 regulates the expression of ciliary genes during spermiogenesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kistler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Ciliary transcription factors (FOXJ1 and RFX2) are dynamically regulated during spermatogenesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Jung et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, our results show that XAP5 and XAP5L are two conserved pairs of antagonistic transcription factors that regulate these key transcriptional regulators required for spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>By using Western blot analysis, we found that XAP5 was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined, whereas XAP5L expression was restricted to the testes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, previous research found that XAP5L was widely expressed in normal tissue via using TCGA expression data(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Thompson et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, loss of XAP5/XAP5L perturbs transcriptional programs in cancer cells. At present, as shown by the recent data, we cannot rule out the possibility that XAP5L is dynamically expressed in other tissues during development. Although XAP5 and XAP5L are highly expressed in testes and critical for spermatogenesis, they are not present in mature sperm (Extended Data Fig. 1). Thus, XAP5/XAP5L are not needed for sperm maintenance. Given the dynamic expression of XAP5/XAP5L during spermatogenesis, it will be interesting to identify the key signaling factors that regulate the timely and spatial expression of XAP5 and XAP5L.</p>
<p>A role for XAP5 in human brain development is suggested by the association of X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) with rare <italic>XAP5</italic> missense variants(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). However, how defects in XAP5 lead to XLID syndrome is unknown. Although there is as yet no evidence that XAP5 regulates ciliogenesis in any system besides <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and mice, the function in cilia could help clarify the unexplained role of <italic>XAP5</italic> mutations in causing XLID. The possibility that XAP5 could be a ciliary transcription factor in humans would add XLID to the growing list of the second-order ciliopathies.</p>

<p>This study reports <bold>useful</bold> data suggesting the critical roles of two ancient proteins, XAP5 and XAP5L, in controlling the transcriptional program of ciliogenesis during mouse spermatogenesis. However, this study is considered <bold>incomplete</bold> because the data only partially support the conclusion. This work will be of interest to biomedical researchers who work on ciliogenesis and reproduction.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wang et al. generate XAP5 and XAP5L knockout mice and find that they are male infertile due to meiotic arrest and reduced sperm motility, respectively. RNA-Seq was subsequently performed and the authors concluded that XAP5 and XAP5L are antagonistic transcription factors of cilliogenesis (in XAP5-KO P16 testis: 554 genes were unregulated and 1587 genes were downregulated; in XAP5L-KO sperm: 2093 genes were unregulated and 267 genes were downregulated).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Knockout mouse models provided strong evidence to indicate that XAP5 and XAP5L are critical for spermatogenesis and male fertility.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The key conclusions are not supported by evidence. First, the authors claim that XAP5 and XAP5L transcriptionally regulate sperm flagella development; however, detailed molecular experiments related to transcription regulation are lacking. How do XAP5 and XAP5L regulate their targets? Only RNA-Seq is not enough. Second, the authors declare that XAP5 and XAP5L are antagonistic transcription factors; however, how do XAP5 and XAP5L regulate sperm flagella development antagonistically? Only RNA-Seq is not enough. Third, I am concerned about whether XAP5 really regulates sperm flagella development. XAP5 is specifically expressed in spermatogonia and XAP5-cKO mice are in meiotic arrest, indicating that XAP5 regulates meiosis rather than sperm flagella development.</p>

<p>In this study, Wang et al., report the significance of XAP5L and XAP5 in spermatogenesis, involved in transcriptional regulation of the ciliary gene in testes. In previous studies, the authors demonstrate that XAP5 is a transcription factor required for flagellar assembly in Chlamydomonas. Continuing from their previous study, the authors examine the conserved role of the XAP5 and XAP5L, which are the orthologue pair in mammals.</p>
<p>XAP5 and XAP5L express ubiquitously and testis specifically, respectively, and their absence in the testes causes male infertility with defective spermatogenesis. Interestingly, XAP5 deficiency arrests germ cell development at the pachytene stage, whereas XAP5L absence causes impaired flagellar formation. RNA-seq analyses demonstrated that XAP5 deficiency suppresses ciliary gene expression including Foxj1 and Rfx family genes in early testis. By contrast, XAP5L deficiency abnormally remains Foxj1 and Rfx genes in mature sperm. From the results, the authors conclude that XAP5 and XAP5L are the antagonistic transcription factors that function upstream of Foxj1 and Rfx family genes.</p>
<p>This reviewer thinks the overall experiments are performed well and that the manuscript is clear. However, the current results do not directly support the authors' conclusion. For example, the transcriptional function of XAP5 and XAP5L requires more evidence. In addition, this reviewer wonders about the conserved XAP5 function of ciliary/flagellar gene transcription in mammals - the gene is ubiquitously expressed despite its functional importance in flagellar assembly in Chlamydomonas. Thus, this reviewer thinks authors are required to show more direct evidence to clearly support their conclusion with more descriptions of its role in ciliary/flagellar assembly.</p>
