<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Tendinopathies are debilitating diseases currently increasing in prevalence and associated costs. There is a need to deepen our understanding of the underlying cell signaling pathways to unlock effective treatments. In this work, we screen cell signaling pathways in human tendinopathies and find enriched IL-6/JAK/STAT signaling alongside signatures of cell populations typically activated by IL-6 in other tissues. To dissect the underlying causalities, we combine IL-6 knock-out mice with an explant-based assembloid model of tendon damage to successfully connect IL-6 signaling to fibroblast progenitor activation and recruitment. Vice versa, we show that these fibroblast progenitors promote the development of tendinopathy hallmarks in the damaged explant upon IL-6 activation. Finally, we present in vivo data confirming diminished migration of progenitors to acute Achilles tendon lesions in IL-6 knock-out mice. We conclude that IL-6 activates tendon tissues to initiate normal healing processes that can deteriorate into tendinopathy hallmarks.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tendons are essential to every human movement.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]</sup> Tendinopathies represent the largest group of common tendon diseases and approximately 22% of all sport-related injuries.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]</sup> They can strike tendons at many different anatomical locations, can dramatically diminish quality of life by limiting the associated movements, and often share a history of repetitive overuse-induced damage and repair cycles.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]</sup> Once adult tendon regions fail to keep up with functional demands, they fall into a state of non-resolving, uncontrolled lesion repair.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]</sup></p>
<p>These chronic tendon lesions underlying tendinopathies feature characteristics of normal wound healing including accelerated extracellular matrix turnover and proliferation of (fibroblast) progenitor populations as well as their migration to replace and repopulate damaged tissues.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]</sup> In tendon, (e.g. Scx<sup>+</sup>) progenitor populations are assumed to reside primarily in the extrinsic compartment comprising epitenon and paratenon from where they are recruited to the damaged intrinsic compartment embodied by the load-bearing tendon core.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]</sup> While the mechanisms governing tendon progenitor activation, proliferation, and recruitment are unclear, some insight can be gleaned from studies on other musculoskeletal tissues.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]</sup></p>
<p>In acute muscle lesions, mechanisms for repair, hypertrophy, and hyperplasia are dominated by the satellite cells residing in the muscle basal lamina.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]</sup> Satellite cells in muscle and dermal fibroblasts in skin are mainly activated and recruited by interleukin-6 (IL-6), a key player in the acute phase response to stress.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]</sup> Stress-related mechanisms activating <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA transcription in the absence of exogenous pathogens include damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), calcium signaling after membrane-depolarization, but also energetic stressors like glycogen depletion and redox signaling following exercise.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]</sup> In humans, IL-6 transmits its signal via classical or trans-signaling.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]</sup> Classical signaling involves the membrane-bound receptor IL6R, which forms a homodimer with gp130 upon IL-6 binding. Trans-signaling works similarly, except that the IL6R has been solubilized (sIL6R) by metalloproteases (mostly ADAM10 &amp; 17)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]</sup>, which cleave it from the cell membrane.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]</sup> Since not all cell populations express IL6R, trans-signaling via sIL6R enables IL-6 signaling for a wider range of cell populations. Regardless of classical or trans-signaling initiation, further transduction of the IL-6 signal runs via two major pathways (JAK/STAT/ERK<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]</sup> &amp; SHP2/Gab/MAPK<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]</sup>) to turn on cellular processes inducing proliferation, migration, metabolic adaptations, and tissue turnover.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]</sup> In chronic muscle lesions like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, IL-6 is persistently upregulated, and anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies have been proposed as treatment options.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]</sup> Anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies (IL-6 inhibitors) like Tocilizumab inhibit both classical and trans-signaling and are routinely used in other chronic inflammatory diseases like systemic sclerosis, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]</sup> In this context, IL-6 inhibitors have been shown to reduce disease-hallmarks including arthritis-concomitant tendon inflammation.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]</sup> Analogous to these chronic inflammatory musculoskeletal diseases, tendinopathies present with localized pain, swelling, and functional decline in the affected organ.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]</sup> Histological and molecular characteristics of tendinopathy include hypercellularity, disorganized collagen fibers including mechanically inferior collagen-3, and dysregulated extracellular matrix homeostasis.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]</sup></p>
<p>Here, we investigated the hypothesis that IL-6 plays a vital role in activating fibroblast progenitor proliferation within the extrinsic tissue compartment (i.e. tendon sheath or synovial membranes) and recruitment of these cells to the damaged tendon core tissue.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]</sup> While this likely represents a critical step in normal tendon healing<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]</sup>, we further propose that extended and excessive IL-6 signaling may causally exacerbate tendinopathy through the same mode of action.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]</sup></p>
<p>We experimentally tested and confirmed these hypotheses in three steps:

<title>The IL-6/JAK/STAT signaling signature is enriched in human tendinopathic tendons alongside signatures of extrinsic cell population activation and hallmarks of clinical tendinopathy</title>
<p>To better illuminate the ongoing wound healing processes that are a central feature of chronic tendon disease, we first searched for enriched signaling pathways underlying tendinopathic tendons in a publicly available dataset (GEO: GSE26051).<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]</sup> To deduce common disease patterns affecting tendons from diverse anatomical locations, the microarray dataset contained analyzed samples from 23 healthy and 23 lesional human tendons of mixed anatomical origin. We excluded 7 healthy and 6 tendinopathic subjects identified as outliers after principal component analysis (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref></bold>). Overall, we found 1488 significantly upregulated genes, 1788 significantly downregulated genes, and 18623 not-differentially regulated genes in tendinopathic compared to healthy control tendons.</p>
<p>Further analysis revealed significantly upregulated <italic>IL-6</italic> transcripts in tendinopathic tendon tissue (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">B</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Conversely, <italic>IL-6</italic> receptor (<italic>IL6Rα</italic>) expression trended toward downregulation and <italic>IL-6</italic> signaling transducer (<italic>IL6ST,</italic> also known as <italic>GP130</italic>) expression remained unchanged. Focusing on proteases that generate soluble <italic>IL6Rα</italic>, we found significant upregulation of <italic>ADAM10</italic> and a trend toward upregulated <italic>ADAM17</italic> in human tendinopathic tendons. Downstream of <italic>IL-6</italic> receptor binding, <italic>JAK1</italic> as well as <italic>STAT1/3</italic> were significantly upregulated. Other <italic>IL-6</italic> regulated signaling checkpoints included downregulated expression of <italic>MAPK3</italic> and <italic>GAP2</italic>. Aside from <italic>IL-6</italic>, other members of the IL-6 family were significantly dysregulated as well, including interleukin-11 (IL-11) and oncostatin M (<italic>OSM)</italic>.</p>

<p>In line with aberrant matrix turnover generally featured in tendinopathy, the transcripts of the following genes were significantly increased in the tendinopathic samples: <italic>COL1A1</italic>, <italic>COL3A1</italic>, <italic>MMP9</italic>, <italic>MMP13</italic>.</p>
<p>Since changes in single transcripts alone have a limited predictive value for pathway-level changes, we next performed unbiased gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the human hallmark dataset from MSigDB.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]</sup> Confirming the trends from the single transcript analysis, GSEA revealed a positive enrichment of the IL-6/JAK/STAT pathway (qvalue: 0.129) alongside WNT / β-catenin, hedgehog, and hypoxic signaling (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">D</xref></bold>). We then looked further into changed biological processes by mapping the significantly changed single transcripts (p-value &lt; 0.01) to the respective gene ontology (GO) database in an overrepresentation analysis (ORA). The resulting enrichment map plot (emapplot, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>)</bold> depicting the top 200 enriched biological processes in clusters highlighted proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover, which are known hallmarks of both wound healing and tendinopathy. Lastly, we attributed the detected transcript changes to cell types typically inducing them by exploiting the human cell type signature gene sets from MSigDB in an unbiased GSEA.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]</sup> While this database does not yet include tendon-specific cell populations, it mapped the transcript change signatures to the following archetypes: multipotent progenitor cells (satellite &amp; transit-amplifying cells), cells forming vascular networks (bronchial vessel &amp; lymphatic endothelial cells), and fibroblasts (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>). Based on research performed in other tissues, progenitor cells and fibroblasts are prime targets and effectors for IL-6 signaling in a wound healing context.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]</sup></p>
<p>We conclude from the above analysis that IL-6 signaling in tendinopathic tendons plausibly contributes to chronic tendinopathic hallmarks like hypercellularity and aberrant matrix turnover, potentially by activating fibroblast progenitor cell populations. On this basis, we sought to directly test whether a causal relationship exists between the observed changes in IL-6 signaling and the associated disease processes. To this end, we harnessed an <italic>in vitro</italic> assembloid model of inter-compartmental crosstalk to better dissect the role of IL-6 in tendinopathy.</p>

<title>IL-6 signaling by tendon core explants activates extrinsic fibroblast progenitors</title>
<p>We have previously validated a hybrid explant // hydrogel assembloid model that reproduces the <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue compartment interface between the load-bearing tendon core and the synovium-like extrinsic compartment (i.e. tendon sheath).<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]</sup> We exploited this model to test whether IL-6 signaling across tissue compartments could activate fibroblast progenitor cells in the peritendinous space in a manner that mimics the IL-6 signaling signatures we uncovered in the human data analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). Briefly, we isolated and clamped mouse tail tendon fascicles to represent the tendon core while selecting (mainly Scx<sup>+</sup> and CD146<sup>+</sup>) fibroblast progenitors from digested Achilles tendons based on plastic adherence growth as established previously (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">C</xref></bold>).<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]</sup> To form the artificial extrinsic compartment, we encapsulated these fibroblast progenitor populations into a collagen hydrogel which we then let polymerize around the clamped core explants. To dissect the effect of IL-6 signaling on these extrinsic target populations, we integrated either wildtype-derived (WT) or IL-6 knock-out-derived (KO) explants from the B6.129S2-Il6<sup>tm1Kopf</sup>/J<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]</sup> mouse line. We then performed bulk RNA-sequencing on the extrinsic populations after one week of co-culture (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Overall, integration of an IL-6 KO core increased transcripts of 256 genes in the surrounding extrinsic compartment, decreased transcripts of 98 genes, and left 15’295 unchanged (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">C</xref>)</bold>. After mapping the significant transcript changes to biological processes in the GO database, we conducted a biased search for processes matching those dysregulated in human tendinopathic tendons. Out of the 195 significantly enriched biological processes (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05), 10 (5.1%) could be linked to changes in local cellularity and another 10 to ECM turnover (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>IL-6 signaling by tendon core explants stimulates cell proliferation and Scx<sup>+</sup> cell recruitment to the signaling tendon core</title>
<p>Using the assembloid model, we investigated whether IL-6 signaling could play a causative role in the hypercellularity that is a major hallmark of tendinopathy. Closely mimicking human tendinopathic tendons, we indeed found cellularity-increasing biological processes to be enriched in cell populations around WT compared to those around IL-6 KO tendon core explants. We then assessed whether these IL-6-dependent transcript-level changes would translate to an increased cell density. To do this, we seeded tendon fibroblast progenitor populations isolated from ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> mice (co-expressing the tendon-marker Scleraxis (Scx) with a green fluorescent protein) into the hydrogel extrinsic compartment of our assembloids and incorporated either a WT or an IL-6 KO core into the center (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, top panels)</bold>.</p>

<p>Representative fluorescence microscopy images taken after seven days in co-culture confirmed a higher total cell number in WT core // ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> progenitor assembloids compared to KO core // ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> progenitor assembloids. These cell number differences were not confined to ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> progenitors (green) but extended to other populations (blue). In addition, ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> progenitors only accumulated around the WT core in WT core // ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> progenitor assembloids, presumably either through increased core-directional migration or faster proliferation closer to the core. These observations are consistent with IL-6 being essential to increased cellularity and core (damage)-directed migration in this model.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]</sup></p>

The WT core // ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> progenitor assembloids exhibited the highest core-resident to extrinsic ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> progenitor ratio and KO core // ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> progenitor assembloids had a significantly lower core-resident to extrinsic ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> progenitor ratio. The cumulative spatial distribution of ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> progenitors (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></bold>) supported these insights.</p>

<p>To further confirm the specific impact of IL-6 signaling on overall cell proliferation and core-directed migration of Scx<sup>+</sup> fibroblast progenitors, we desensitized the WT core // progenitor assembloids to IL-6 by neutralizing IL6R with Tocilizumab and attempted to rescue the KO core // progenitor assembloids by adding recombinant IL-6 to compensate for their reduced IL-6 levels (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, bottom panels</bold>).

The addition of recombinant IL-6 to KO core // progenitor assembloids significantly increased the total cell number and the number of ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> cells, rescuing the wildtype phenotype of IL-6 enhanced cell proliferation in the extrinsic compartment. However, core-directed migration was not rescued by recombinant IL-6.</p>
<p>Fully in line with transcript signature changes detected in the extrinsic compartment, these data suggest that IL-6 signaling increases local cellularity in at least two ways. First, IL-6 stimulates both overall and specific ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> cell proliferation. Second, IL-6 gradient effects (i.e. IL-6 induced secondary gradients) cause core-directed ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> cell migration.</p>

<p>On the transcript level, we found 276 upregulated, 192 downregulated, and 20’204 unchanged genes in the core of KO core // progenitor assembloids compared to that of WT core // progenitor assembloids (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">C</xref></bold>). To see whether an IL-6 knock-out would partially reverse fibroblast progenitor-invoked hallmarks, we matched the list of differentially expressed genes (p-value &lt; 0.01) to the signatures in the GO database and then compared the surfacing enriched biological processes with those enriched by differentially expressed genes between the core of a WT core // progenitor assembloid and a WT core // cell-free assembloid. The largest overlap lay in the signaling pathways (Wnt, ERK1/2, and IL-6), where 5/5 signatures for biological processes remained similarly enriched (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref></bold>). We found slightly fewer overlapping signatures connected to ECM turnover (6/14) and cellularity (6 /18) while there seemed to be a disconnect in hypoxia &amp; glucose metabolism (2/8). Overall, about a third of all signatures enriched by the presence of fibroblast progenitors where also enriched by the IL-6 KO (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref></bold>). Regarding the respective contribution of increased and decreased transcripts to the enriched GO biological processes and molecular functions, it seems that the IL-6 KO correlates positively with processes aimed at decreasing cellularity and ECM turnover in the core (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Figure 8</xref></bold>), which could mean that IL-6 signaling indeed contributes to these tendinopathy hallmarks on the gene level.</p>
<p>As we have already demonstrated the tissue-level effects of IL-6 signaling on cellularity (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>), we next wanted to examine the tissue-level consequences of changed transcript signatures for ECM turnover on core biomechanics. To do so, we measured the assembloid’s linear elastic modulus as an indicator for their ability to resist longitudinal tension, which is one of the main functions of adult tendons (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref></bold>). In WT core // progenitor assembloids, the linear elastic modulus decreased the most between the initial clamping of the core explant and 21 days of co-culture (light blue). The linear elastic modulus of assembloids containing a KO core (violet) or a WT core explant devitalized through multiple freeze-thaw cycles (black) decreased as well, but not as fast or as strongly. In connection with the bulk RNA-seq data, the changes in the assembloid’s ability to resists tension suggest that IL-6 signaling accelerates (catabolic) ECM turnover.</p>
<p>Normally, it would be hard to predict the effect of an accelerated catabolic ECM turnover <italic>in vitro</italic> on wound healing <italic>in vivo</italic> since both ECM degradation and synthesis are required to replace damaged tissue structures. However, previous studies have already reported a delayed wound healing response in IL-6 KO mice and our experiments here suggest that the decelerated catabolic ECM turnover could be responsible for this.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]</sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an attractive translational research target. Signaling cascades related to IL-6 are upregulated in tendon tissues after exercise, acute tissue damage, and in chronic tendon disease.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]</sup> Little is currently understood of the precise role that IL-6 plays in these processes.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]</sup> The goal of the present work was to clarify the role of IL-6 signaling in the tendon tissue’s response to damage, with a particular focus on inter-compartmental crosstalk between the damaged tendon core and extrinsic fibroblast progenitor populations targeted by it.</p>
<p>We first reanalyzed existing microarray data of tendinopathic tendons to verify a hypothesized (dys)functional role of IL-6 that seems to run partially via JAK/STAT pathway enriched by increased transcripts. The JAK/STAT pathway interweaves with ERK1/2 downstream, which fits with recent data from our lab showing that ERK inhibition alone can prevent tendon matrix deterioration while reducing the secretion of IL-11, another member of the IL-6 cytokine family that was also upregulated in the tendinopathic tendons analyzed here.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]</sup> More generally, overactivation of JAK/STAT/ERK has been associated with auto-immune arthritis.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]</sup> While analysis of human samples indicated the expression of <italic>IL-6</italic> and <italic>ADAM10</italic> (known to transform membrane-bound Il6R into soluble Il6R) to be upregulated in tendinopathic tendons, the expression of <italic>Il6R</italic> itself was downregulated. We speculate that this points towards increased trans-signaling aimed at stromal cells unable to express <italic>Il6R</italic>, in this tendinopathic context particularly stromal fibroblasts, progenitors, and satellite cell-like populations as reported by the cell type signatures.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]</sup> This theory is supported by enriched GO terms relating to increased ECM turnover and wound healing, both processes supposedly powered by fibroblast progenitors.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]</sup> Most of the remaining top 20 enriched GO terms pointed towards increased cell proliferation, potentially increasing the leverage of the proliferating fibroblast progenitors.</p>
<p>While beneficial in controlled dosages during normal wound healing, both excessive hypercellularity and imbalanced matrix turnover are also hallmarks of tendinopathy. However, deciphering their direct connections to IL-6 <italic>in vivo</italic> is rather challenging due to unclear IL-6 sources and concentration gradients. For the second part of this work, we therefore turned to tendon assembloids: hybrid explant // hydrogel models of core tendon damage and repair that were recently developed in our lab and which identified an underloaded core explant as a potentially biologically relevant source of IL-6.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]</sup> The simultaneously increased and imbalanced matrix tissue turnover perpetuated by the crosstalk between the core and an extrinsic fibroblast progenitor population seemed to put the system into a prime position to decipher the connections between IL-6, hypercellularity, and (catabolic) matrix turnover.</p>
<p>Replacing the wildtype core explant with an IL-6 KO core explant in our assembloids was sufficient to reduce the expression of genes in gene sets related to matrix turnover, proteolysis, cell proliferation, and cell migration in the extrinsic fibroblast progenitor population. We confirmed the IL-6-induced gene-level differences regarding cell migration by exploiting trackable ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> progenitors and demonstrated effective manipulation of both recruitment and proliferation of ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> cells through IL-6. We did so by using the IL-6 inhibitor Tocilizumab to desensitize resident cell populations to IL-6 and recombinant IL-6 to replace the IL-6 not secreted by an IL-6 KO core. Recombinant IL-6 rescuing proliferation but not migration of ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> cells highlights the necessity of an IL-6 gradient and / or the establishment of a secondary cytokine gradient (e.g. TGF-β) by IL-6.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]</sup> Alternatively, IL-6 has also been described as an energy allocator in other musculoskeletal tissues and could in this function be accelerating a diverse range of processes (i.e. migration) by increasing the baseline cell metabolism.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]</sup> Fittingly, the extrinsic cell populations around an IL-6 KO core upregulated biological processes related to oxidative stress and hypoxia, which indicates a disrupted energy allocation. Since we found similar biological processes to be enriched in human tendinopathic tendons, future studies should more closely examine the role of hypoxic signaling in the pathogenesis of tendinopathy.</p>
<p>To transfer these insights from our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments to an <italic>in vivo</italic> setup, we used an Achilles tenotomy model of the <italic>in vivo</italic> tendon damage response. These <italic>in vivo</italic> results supported our <italic>in vitro</italic> finding that IL-6 activates Scx<sup>+</sup> fibroblast progenitor cells,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]</sup> which then either migrate into or proliferate faster in the damaged and unloaded Achilles tendon stump. Consequently, one could expect a decelerated healing response upon acute injury in IL-6 KO mice. Indeed, previous studies with mice subjected to a patellar punch procedure reported reduced mechanical properties in the healing patellar tendon of IL-6 KO mice compared to the WT.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]</sup> However, we are cautious in interpreting these <italic>in vivo</italic> results, mainly because the Achilles tenotomy model system represents an acute rather than a chronic tendon lesion.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]</sup> Also, although the detected difference was statistically significant, simplifying assumptions were applied to interpreting the observed migration patterns and available Scx antibodies are known to be plagued by considerable background noise.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, one can currently only speculate on the spatial distribution of IL-6 and its tissue gradients that emerge <italic>in vivo</italic> as well as the resulting patterns of inward progenitor cell migration.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]</sup></p>
<p>Since the migrating Scx<sup>+</sup> progenitors were apparently targeting the damaged core tissue (likely to support the limited intrinsic regenerative potential of the explanted tendon core secreting IL-6 in the first place)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]</sup>, the next set of experiments we conducted in this work focused on the effects of the activated and recruited fibroblast progenitors on the tendon core.</p>
<p>According to existing literature, in particular Scx<sup>+</sup> fibroblast progenitors are increasingly present in <italic>in vivo</italic> murine adult tendon lesions<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]</sup> and depleting them alternately improves or impairs adult tendon healing depending on the timepoint of depletion.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]</sup> One underlying reason could be that adult, Scx<sup>+</sup> fibroblast progenitor cells hold a bi-fated potential that enables a cartilage-like differentiation when exposed to mechanical compression or tensile unloading.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>]</sup> Our <italic>in vitro</italic> assembloid model captured these behaviors as well with increased Scx / Sox9 transcripts and enriched gene sets indicating a stronger presence of fibroblast progenitors alongside cartilage development in a core surrounded by (migrating) fibroblast progenitors compared to one embedded in a cell-free hydrogel. Besides, genes differentially expressed in a core explant surrounded by fibroblast progenitors enriched gene sets related to hypercellularity, ERK1/2 signaling, oxygen / glucose metabolism, and ECM turnover. Most of these processes were reduced in an IL-6 KO core, speculatively because of the reduced presence of extrinsic fibroblast progenitors resulting from the reduced migration and proliferation. On the tissue-level, we also found signs for a decreased catabolic matrix turnover in the more stable mechanical properties of IL-6 KO core explants, a process likely linked to ERK1/2 signaling.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]</sup></p>
<p>In summary, our data consistently point to IL-6 signaling targeting stromal (progenitor) cells being upregulated in chronic human tendon lesions in a manner that directly leads to fibroblast progenitor recruitment and proliferation as well as aberrant matrix turnover. This activity contributes to typical hallmarks of tendinopathy including hypercellularity and loss of biomechanical tissue integrity. Our hybrid explant // hydrogel assembloid model suggests that IL-6 is necessary for the recruitment of Scx<sup>+</sup> progenitors in a role analogous to satellite cell recruitment in muscle tissue.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]</sup> Overall, IL-6 in tendon seems so assume the role of a general tissue activator and energy allocator to initiate and power recovery of acute tendon lesions, but may also aggravate hallmarks of chronic tendon lesions through the same action.</p>

<title>Human microarray data analysis</title>
<p>We reanalyzed a microarray dataset (GEO: GSE26051) from 2011 with contemporary methods (principal component analysis, volcano plots, heatmaps, GSEA, and ORA), focusing on the Il-6 signaling cascade. All steps from downloading the dataset to the differential expression computation were conducted in RStudio (“Prairie Trillium”, 9f796939, 2022-02-16) running R version 4.1.2. Overall, we closely followed the steps described here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sbc.shef.ac.uk/geo_tutorial/tutorial.nb.html">https://sbc.shef.ac.uk/geo_tutorial/tutorial.nb.html</ext-link> (last visited: 02.05.22). First, we log<sub>2</sub>-transformed the expression values and checked their distribution with boxplots. Since the original dataset was gathered from a wide variety of anatomical locations and differently aged patients (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Supplementary Table 1</xref></bold>), we started with a principal-component analysis to filter-out outliers. We excluded the samples GSM639748 (Brachialis), GSM639761 (ECRB), GSM639751 (Flexor-Pronator), GSM639756 (Flexor-Pronator), GSM639765 (ECRL), GSM639766 (Subscapularis), GSM639755 (Subscapularis), GSM639780 (Supraspinatus), GSM639782 (Supraspinatus), GSM639788 (ECRB), GSM639773 (Patella), GSM639786 (Supraspinatus), and GSM639775 (Supraspinatus).</p>
<p>To improve the power to detect differentially expressed genes, we filtered-out genes with very low expression. We considered 50% of genes to not be expressed and therefore used the median expression as the cut-off. In addition, we only kept genes expressed in more than 2 samples for further analysis and calculated the average of replicated probes. Afterwards, we applied the empirical Bayes’ step to receive the differential expression values and p-values. We plotted the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as a volcano plot and annotated IL-6 signaling-related genes, other cytokines of the IL-6 family, their respective receptors, and genes involved in matrix turnover. Here, we considered genes with a p-value &lt; 0.05 to be differentially expressed. In addition, we plotted the row scaled z-scores of a selection of the annotated genes in a heatmap.</p>
<p>To produce the GO annotations, we fed the list of IDs from differentially expressed genes into the enrichGO function from the clusterProfiler package (version 3.0.4, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/clusterProfiler/versions/3.0.4/topics/enrichGO">https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/clusterProfiler/versions/3.0.4/topics/enrichGO</ext-link>, last visited: 31.10.22) using the org.Hs.eg.db as reference and the Benjamini-Hochberg method to calculate the false discovery rate / adjust the p-values. To visualize the data, we used the emapplot function and the dotplot function from the enrichPlot package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rdrr.io/bioc/enrichplot/">https://rdrr.io/bioc/enrichplot/</ext-link>, last visited: 31.10.22). We also looked at the increased (logFC &gt; 0) and decreased (logFC &lt; 0) transcripts in isolation to estimate their contribution to the enrichment and give it directionality. For the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) performed in RStudio with clusterProfiler, we used the human hallmark and the cell type signature gene set annotations from the molecular signature database (MSigDB, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/">https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/</ext-link>, last visited: 31.10.22) after ranking the genes according to their p-value. We used the following input parameters: pvalueCutoff = 1.00, minGSSize = 15, maxGSSize = 500, and eps=0. Lastly, we used the gseaplot and dotplot functions from the enrichPlot package to plot the data and the sign of the enrichment score / NES to estimate the directionality.</p>

After seven days, the assembloids were removed from the clamps and washed with PBS before staining them with Ethidium Homodimer (EthD-1, Sigma-Aldrich, 2 mM stock in DMSO) diluted to 4 µM with PBS (20 min, 37°C). They were then again washed with PBS, fixated with 4% formaldehyde (Roti-Histofix, Karlsruhe) for 1 hour at room temperature, washed again with PBS, and stored in PBS at 4°C. Immediately before the imaging, nuclei were stained with NucBlue Live Ready Probes Reagent<sup>TM</sup> (R37605, ThermoFisher) for 1 hour at room temperature. We used the Nikon Eclipse T<italic>i</italic>2 confocal scanning microscope controlled by NIS-Elements to acquire the images (3 per sample), which we then processed with ImageJ 1.53q. Briefly, we first registered all cell locations by creating a mask from the NucBlue channel.

We then transferred the signal intensity per location data to RStudio, where we first calculated the total cell numbers of all the images of one sample combined and normalized them to the wildtype median. Afterwards, we determined the fluorescence threshold for the ScxGFP-signal (using density plots and a negative control image) and applied this threshold to the dataset. We then calculated the total ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> cell numbers for each sample and normalized them to the wildtype median. Finally, we combined the cell location with the fluorescence intensity data to find the distance from the core where most of the ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> cells were located and to calculate the ratio between ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> present at the core and those present in the surrounding extrinsic hydrogel.</p>

<p>(A) Representative fluorescence microscopy images of mouse hindleg sections from wildtype (WT) and IL-6 knock-out (KO) Achilles tendons that underwent unilateral tenotomy. (B) Boxplot reporting the number of CD146+ cells normalized to the WT median. (C) Boxplot reporting the number of TPPP3+ cells normalized to the WT median. In these boxplots, the upper and lower hinges correspond to the first and third quartile (25th and 75th percentile), the middle one to the median, the whiskers extend from the hinges no further than 1.5 times the interquartile range, and the points beyond the whiskers are treated as outliers. (D, E) Lineplots depicting the cumulative percentages of CD146+ and TPPP3+ cells depending on their distance from the Achilles tendon center. The points and the line represent the mean cumulative percentages and the error bands their standard error of the mean (sem). The dashed line indicates locations inside the Achilles tendon stump. N=4. The applied statistical test was the non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test and no significant differences were detected.</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study details an enrichment of the IL-6 signaling pathway in human tendinopathy, and applies transcriptional profiling to an advanced in vitro model to test IL-6 specific phenotypes in tendinopathy. Overall, the strength of evidence is <bold>solid</bold> yet <bold>incomplete</bold>, as transcriptomic measurements provide clarity, though functional studies including analysis of proliferation are needed to confirm these findings.

<p>This work by Stauber et al. is focused on understanding the signaling mechanisms that are associated with tendinopathy development, and by screening a panel of human tendinopathy samples, identified IL-6/JAK/STAT as a potential mediator of this pathology. Using an innovative explant model they delineated the requirement for IL-6 in the main body of the tendon to alter the dynamics of cells in the peritendinous synovial sheath space.</p>
<p>The use of a publicly available existing dataset is considered a strength since this dataset includes expression data from several different human tendons experiencing tendinopathy. This facilitates the identification of potentially conserved regulators of the tendinopathy phenotype.</p>
<p>The clear transcriptional shifts between WT and IL6-/- cores demonstrates the utility of the assembloid model, and supports the importance of IL6 in potentiating the cell response to this stimuli.</p>
<p>There are two main concerns with the manuscript in its current form:</p>
<p>
First, the experimental approach does not directly assess proliferation, as such the conclusions regarding proliferation are not well supported. In the ex-vivo model, the use of cell counting approaches is somewhat acceptable since the system is constrained by the absence of potential influx of new cells. However, given the nearly unlimited supply of extrinsically derived cells in vivo (vs. the explant model), assessment of actual proliferation (e.g. Edu, BrdU, Ki67) is critical to support this conclusion.</p>
<p>Second, the justification for the use of Scx-GFP+ cells as a progenitor population is not well supported. Indeed, in the discussion, Scx+ cells are treated as though they are uniformly a progenitor population, when the diversity of this population has been established by the cited studies, which do not suggest that these are progenitor populations. Additional definition/ delineation of these cells to identify the subset of these cells that may actually display other putative progenitor markers would support the conclusions. As it stands, the study currently provides important information on the impact of IL6 on Scx+ cells, but not tendon progenitors.</p>

<p>The authors of this study describe a goal of elucidating the signaling pathways that are upregulated in tendinopathy in order to target these pathways for effective treatments. Their goal is honorable, as tendinopathy is a common debilitating condition with limited treatments. The authors find that IL-6 signaling is upregulated in human tendinopathy samples with transcriptomic and GSEA analyses. The evidence of their initial findings are strong, providing a clinically-relevant phenotype that can be further studied using animal models.</p>
<p>Along these lines, the authors continue with an advanced in vitro system using the mouse tail tendon as the core with progenitors isolated from the Achilles tendon as the external sheath embedded in a hydrogel matrix. One question that comes to mind is whether the fibroblast progenitors in the extrinsic sheath of Achilles tendon is similar to those surrounding the tail tendon. The similarity of progenitors between different tendons is assumed with this model. I would consider this to be a minor issue, and would consider the in vitro system to be an additional strength of this study.</p>
<p>In order to address the IL-6 signaling pathway, the authors use core tendons from IL-6 knockout mice and progenitors from wild-type mice. The reasoning behind this approach was a little confusing... is IL-6 expressed solely in the tendon core compared to the extrinsic sheath? Furthermore, is a co-culture system for 7 days appropriate to model tendinopathy without the supplementation of exogenous inflammatory compounds? The transcriptomic differences in Figure 3 seem to be subtle, and may perhaps suggest that it could be a model that more closely resembles steady state compared to tendinopathy. If so, is IL-6 still relevant during steady state?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the results presented in Figures 4 and 5 are impressive, demonstrating a link between IL-6 and fibroblast progenitor numbers and migration. Their experimental design in these figures show strong evidence, using Tocilizumab and recombinant IL-6 to rescue shown phenotypes. I would reduce the claims on proliferation, however, unless a proliferation-specific marker (e.g., Ki67, BrdU, EdU) is included in confocal analyses of Scx+ progenitors. The Achilles tendon injury model provides a nice in vivo confirmation of Scx-progenitor migration to the neotendon.</p>
<p>Given their goal to elucidate signaling pathways that could be targeted in the clinic, I think it would significantly strengthen the study if they could measure tendon healing in IL-6 knockouts or in wild-type mice treated with IL-6 inhibitors, since conventional ablation of IL-6 may lead to the elevation of compensatory IL-6 superfamily ligands that could activate STAT signaling. The authors claim that reducing IL-6 signaling decreases transcriptomic signatures of tendinopathy, but IL-6 may be necessary to promote normal healing of the tendon following injury. It is supposed that a lack of Scx+ progenitor migration would delay tendon healing.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors of this study elucidated IL-6 signaling in tendinopathy and provided a strong level of evidence to support their conclusions at the transcriptomic level. However, functional studies are needed to confirm these phenotypes and fully support their aims and conclusions. With these additional studies, this work has the potential to significantly influence treatments for those suffering from tendinopathy.</p>
