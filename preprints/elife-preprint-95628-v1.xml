<title>Abstract</title><p>Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that cause the water-borne disease schistosomiasis, affecting millions of people worldwide. The miracidium larva of schistosomes represents the first post-embryonic stage of development and is critical to transmission. After hatching, a miracidium infects a freshwater snail and transforms into a mother sporocyst, where its stem cells generate daughter sporocysts that give rise to many human-infective cercariae larvae. To understand this important life cycle stage at the cellular and molecular levels, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation and image analysis to create a whole-body cell atlas of the miracidium larva of <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>. Our atlas shows that each miracidium is composed of ∼365 cells and 19 transcriptionally distinct cell types. We show that 93% of miracidium cells are somatic (57% neural, 19% muscle, 13% epidermal (tegument), 2% parenchyma, 2% protonephridia), and the remaining 7% are stem cells. Cellular diversity within tissue types is revealed, and is highest in neurons. There are two stem cell populations, and they show different activation and potency states. Trajectory analysis indicates that one stem cell population is the origin of the tegument lineage and the other likely contains pluripotent cells. Furthermore, each of these stem populations is transcriptionally distinct based on sex-linked gene expression in male and female larvae. Through single cell transcriptomics we identified every cell in the whole organism revealing the organisation of the miracidium, and present here the single cell atlas. Because of its simplicity, the miracidium provides a tractable system to understand the development of <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> as it increases in complexity around the life cycle.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The parasitic blood fluke <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> is a causative agent of the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis, which is responsible for a chronic disease burden equivalent to 1.0–2.6 million Disability Adjusted Life Years and over 11,000 human deaths annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">WHO, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">IHME, 2019</xref>). The life cycle of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> is complex, involving parasitic stages in two hosts (a snail and a mammal), with short-lived, freshwater infectious larval stages in between. Mature male and female worms reside in the portal veins of the mammalian host, and fertilisation of the zygote occurs inside the female worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jurberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Embryogenesis proceeds as the egg is laid in the host and continues over the ensuing six days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ashton <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). During this time, the egg passes through the host vascular endothelium into the intestine and is passed in faeces into the outside environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Costain <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). If the egg lands in freshwater, a miracidium larva hatches out, swims and infects a snail host. Once inside the snail, the miracidium transforms into the mother sporocyst, and its stem cells (historically known as ‘germinal cells’) divide and differentiate to produce many daughter sporocysts that migrate within the snail. In the daughter sporocysts, a second round of embryogenesis generates the cercariae larvae by asexual reproduction from a stem cell. The cercariae emerge from the snail, swim towards and infect water-exposed mammals including humans, penetrating the skin. At the point of infection, the cercariae shed their tails, and once inside the mammal the tegument is remodelled during metamorphosis to the schistosomulum stage. The schistosomulum then moves into the blood vessels and, over the following five weeks, grows into a juvenile stage that migrates from the lungs to the liver and to the hepatic portal vein where sexually dimorphic male and female worms pair, mature and mate. Thus, during the development from egg to adult, the body axes are established three times, once during the development of the miracidia, once during the development of the daughter sporocyst and finally during the development of the cercariae. Additionally, there are two rounds of embryogenesis, first from fertilised zygote to the mature miracidium, and second, the neo-embryogenesis from a single stem cell in the daughter sporocyst to a mature cercaria.</p>
<p>Enabled by the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), molecular classification of cell types has been initiated for <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tarashansky <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2020; Diaz <italic>et al</italic>., 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Diaz &amp; Attenborough <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). These studies have opened the door to investigate schistosome developmental cell biology and to identify new targets for controlling infection and transmission of the disease. To date, scRNA-seq studies have identified heterogeneity amongst stem cells that drive schistosome development and reproduction, classified a variety of differentiated cell types across the life cycle and revealed several key genes and their native cell types that are essential for parasite survival and propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sarfati <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Single-cell RNA-seq studies for the whole animal have only been carried out on intra-molluscan and intra-mammalian stages to date: the mother sporocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Diaz &amp; Attenborough <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), the schistosomulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Diaz <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), juvenile (3.5 weeks post-infection of mouse, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) and adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Single cell studies on stem cells, however, have only been undertaken in the mother sporocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>) and juvenile stages (2.5 and 3.5 weeks post-infection)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tarashansky <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>An obvious gap in the coverage of the life cycle is the lack of single cell data for the earliest developmental time point currently accessible – the miracidium larva; earlier embryonic stages are inaccessible due to the impenetrable egg capsule. The miracidium is a short-lived, non-feeding stage that relies on internal stores of energy to sustain swimming, and host location and infection (Maldonado and Matienzo, 1948; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chernin, 1968</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan, 1980</xref>). The role of the miracidium and its differentiated somatic cells is to carry stem cells to a favourable environment inside the snail where they can proliferate to generate daughter sporocysts, and subsequently cercariae. If the miracidium fails to infect a snail within 12 hours it dies. At the ultrastructural level, a rich set of cell types have been previously identified in the miracidium and classified into eight major systems: musculature, nervous, penetration gland cells, excretory, interstitial, stem/germinal cells, epithelial (ciliary plates and epidermal ridges) and terebratorium (an apical modified epidermal plate with sensory structures and gland openings) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>To characterise this critical transmission stage, we have generated a single cell transcriptome atlas for the miracidium. Our atlas provides molecular definitions for all described cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan, 1980</xref>) and indicates the functions of different cell types within tissues. Multiplexed <italic>in situ</italic> validation of cell type marker genes enabled the cell types to be spatially resolved within the larva. Furthermore, the nuclear segmentation of the cells expressing tissue-specific genes has revealed the relative contribution of each tissue type to the animal and each cell in the larva has been assigned to a tissue. A key finding is the identification of two stem cell populations in a miracidium, and advances in our understanding of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buddenborg <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) has enabled us to determine that these two stem populations are transcriptionally distinct between male and female larvae due to sex-linked gene expression. To predict the fate of these two stem populations we carried out a trajectory analysis, combining scRNA-seq data from miracidia and mother sporocysts, and this indicated that one stem cell population likely contains the pluripotent cells that will develop into the cercariae, while the other population gives rise to the tegument lineage. Similarities in gene expression with the adult suggest that there is a tegument developmental program that is redeployed at multiple stages of the complex life cycle.</p>

<title>Single-cell RNA-seq of 20,478 miracidia cells reveals 19 cell types</title>
<p>There are ∼365 nuclei in a miracidium (median = 365, larva #1: 342, larva #2: 365, larva #3: 377). However, some cell types, such as the apical gland and epithelial/tegument cells, are multinucleate; and others, such as the ciliary plates may be anucleate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan, 1980</xref>, but cf Meulemen <italic>et al</italic>., 1978). Therefore, the number of nuclei provides an approximation for the actual number of cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>We performed scRNA-seq on a pool of ∼20,000 mixed-sex miracidia, collected within four hours of hatching from eggs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Following dissociation, four samples of the cell suspensions were collected; two were enriched for live cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and two were left unsorted to capture the maximum cellular diversity for the atlas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Using the droplet-based 10X Genomics Chromium platform, transcriptome-sequencing data were generated from a total of 33,391 cells, of which 20,478 passed strict quality-control filters, resulting in a median of 858 genes and 1,761 median UMI counts per cell (Supplementary Table 1). Given that an individual miracidium comprises ∼365 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), the number of quality-controlled cells theoretically represents &gt;56-fold coverage of each cell in the larva.</p>
<p>Using Seurat, 19 distinct clusters of cells were identified, along with putative marker genes best able to discriminate between the populations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C &amp; D</xref> and Supplementary Table 2 and 3). Manually curated lists of previously defined cell-type-specific genes from later developmental stages (Diaz <italic>et al</italic>., 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sarfati <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) were compared against the list of putative markers generated in this analysis. The expression of genes from both these lists in the miracidia single-cell data was then examined to identify the cell types that each Seurat cluster represented. Based on these markers, the 19 clusters were resolved into the following cell populations: two muscle-like (3,934 cells), five resembling neurons (3,255 cells), one ciliary plate (40 cells), one tegumental (366 cells), one protonephridial (539 cells), two parenchymal (1698 cells) and seven clusters resembling stem cells (10,686 cells) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Orthogonal body wall muscle fibres are transcriptionally distinct</title>
<p>The two muscle clusters were identified based on the expression of previously described muscle-specific genes; <italic>paramyosin</italic> (Smp_085540), <italic>troponin t</italic> (Smp_179810) and <italic>titin</italic> (Smp_126240)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Diaz <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Diaz &amp; Attenborough <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), as well as other differentially expressed markers; e.g. a putative collagen alpha chain (Smp_159600)(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). A crp1/csrp1/crip1 homolog (Smp_087250), encoding a conserved transcriptional regulator of muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tarashansky <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) was also expressed in both muscle clusters. High expression of <italic>paramyosin</italic> (<italic>PRM</italic>; Smp_085540) was seen in muscle cell clusters 1 and 2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> hybridisation (ISH) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> &amp; C; Supplementary video 1) and image analysis (Supplementary video 2) identified 74 nuclei surrounded by <italic>PRM</italic> transcripts (i.e. ∼19% of cells in a miracidium are muscle cells). Counterstaining with phalloidin (to label F-actin filaments) revealed an orthogonal grid of circular and longitudinal body wall muscles and from this we identified which <italic>PRM</italic><sup>+</sup> nuclei belonged to each muscle subtype. The nuclei of the circular muscles formed two distinct bilaterally symmetrical lines that ran peripherally from pole to pole of the larva (∼28 nuclei in total). Thirty-three more <italic>PRM</italic><sup>+</sup> nuclei sat regularly spaced between the circular muscle nuclei and corresponded to longitudinal muscles. Another 13 <italic>PRM</italic><sup>+</sup> nuclei formed a unilateral cluster adjacent to the apical gland cell (identifiable by its four nuclei; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan, 1980</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2Cii</xref>; Supplementary Video 1 and 2).</p>

<p>Muscle cluster 1 (2,407 cells) was distinguished from muscle cluster 2 by markedly higher expression of a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (Smp_052230; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), and ISH showed Smp_052230 transcripts along the two peripheral lines of circular muscle nuclei (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).

<p>Muscle cluster 2 (1,355 cells) was distinguished by higher expression of genes encoding a PDZ domain protein (Smp_311170) and <italic>Calcium-transporting ATPase</italic> (Smp_136710), as well as the unique expression of a putative calcium-activated potassium channel (Smp_156150), and the transcription factor <italic>MyoD</italic> (Smp_167400)(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>); ISH of the latter two genes showed expression only in the longitudinal body wall muscles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>; Supplementary video 5). Orthologs of other axial patterning genes, <italic>Netrin receptor UNC5</italic> (Smp_172470), <italic>Wnt5</italic> (Smp_145140), and a putative wnt inhibitor frizzled, frzb2 (Smp_062560)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Witchley <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>), showed distinct expression in muscle 2 cells.</p>
<p>The higher expression of muscle 1 markers in circular body wall muscles (BWM) and muscle 2 genes in the longitudinal BWM revealed distinct transcriptomic signatures for these two types of myocyte that make up the orthogonal body wall musculature.

<p>Cells from neuron clusters 1, 2, and 3 had nuclei in the nuclear rind of the brain. Neuron cluster 1 was large (1,470 cells), connected to stem F and expressed neuron-specific <italic>complexin</italic>, the neuroendocrine precursor <italic>7B2</italic> (Smp_073270) and an uncharacterised gene (Smp_068500). At this resolution, there were no clear marker genes restricted to neuron 1; however, using the self-assembling manifold (SAM) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tarashansky <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), fifteen subclusters could be resolved (Supplementary Figure 1; Supplementary Table 5). Three of the subclusters expressed the following neuropeptide precursor genes amongst their top five markers and expressed in the nuclear rind of the brain (Supplementary Figure 2): <italic>PWamide</italic> (Smp_340860)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>) in cluster 14, <italic>Neuropeptide F</italic> (Smp_088360) in cluster 8, and <italic>Neuropeptide Y</italic> (Smp_159950) in cluster 13. Another subcluster was composed of putative photoreceptor cells (cluster 7 - Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Table 5) because their top-ten markers include two opsins (Smp_180350 and Smp_332250) – identified here as a rhabdomeric opsin and a peropsin, respectively (Supplementary Figure 3) – and other conserved phototransduction cascade genes, such as a 1-phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate phosphodiesterase (Smp_245900) and a beta-arrestin (Smp_152280) (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Table 5).</p>
<p>Two further rhabdomeric opsins (Smp_180030 and Smp_104210; Supplementary Figure 3) were expressed in the Neuron 2 cluster, but across the cluster of 282 cells, the most expressed marker was the uncharacterised gene Smp_201600. ISH revealed three strongly Smp_201600<italic><sup>+</sup></italic> cells, with nuclei in a median posterior location of the brain, and three cells with weaker expression in a more anterior position (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, Supplementary video 6). Other top markers include <italic>7B2,</italic> a guanylate kinase (Smp_137940) and a putative homeobox protein (Smp_126560).</p>
<p>Neuron 3 was a small cluster (47 cells) expressing <italic>complexin</italic> and <italic>7B2</italic>. The uncharacterised gene, Smp_071050, was unique to and highly expressed throughout this population (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). ISH showed expression in ∼6 cells with projections that extended into the brain and to the periphery, three of which sat adjacent to three neuron 2 cells. There was also weak expression in the four nuclei of the apical gland cell (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3Ci</xref>, Supplementary Video 6). STRING analysis of neuron 3 markers produced two networks with functional enrichment; these were associated with ‘synapses’ and ‘calcium’ (Supplementary Figure 5). In neuron clusters 1, 2 and 3, there was an enrichment for genes annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to ‘neuropeptide signalling pathway’ and ‘neurotransmitter transport’ (Supplementary Table 6). There were, therefore, at least 3, and up to 15 more, transcriptionally distinct cell types in the brain mass.</p>
<p>Cells from neuron clusters 4 and 5 had nuclei peripheral to the brain. Neuron 4 formed a large (1,140 cells), discrete cluster. The top marker was an uncharacterised gene, Smp_319480 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), that, based on protein-structure prediction using I-TASSER (Yang &amp; Zhang, 2015), was similar to human mTORC1 (PDB entry 5H64; TM-score 0.85). <italic>In situ</italic> expression revealed ∼26 Smp_319480<sup>+</sup> cells; four at the anterior end, with projections leading to the body wall in the first tier of ciliary plates, and ∼22 sat lateral and directly posterior to the brain. These latter cells formed four clusters of ∼3–7 cells, with Smp_319480 transcripts distributed around the nuclei and along projections leading into the brain and extending out to the body wall terminating between the second and third tier of ciliary plates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, Supplementary Video 9 and 10). Twenty-three multi-ciliated nerve endings formed a girdle around the larva between the second and third tier of ciliary plates (Supplementary Figure 2C), and Smp_319480 transcripts were expressed at the base of these cilia (Supplementary Figure 2D); some transcripts also reached the nuclei of circular body wall muscles (Supplementary Figure 2E), suggesting these cells may function as sensory-motor neurons. Two genes, identified as top markers and co-expressed in many neuron 4 cells, encode likely orthologues of <italic>Polycystin 1</italic> (Smp_165230) and <italic>Polycystin 2</italic> (Smp_165660)(Supplementary Figure 4A), with the latter prediction strongly supported by a Foldseek search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">van Kempen <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) against the protein database (PDB). Polycystins 1 and 2 form a heterodimeric ion channel required for oscillating calcium concentrations within vertebrate cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). A Sox transcription factor, Smp_301790, was also expressed in neuron 4 and co-expressed with <italic>Polycystin 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> (Supplementary Figure 4B). Other top markers included a putative potassium channel (Smp_141570), a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Smp_079010), a GTP-binding protein (Smp_045990) and an ortholog of human <italic>fibrocystin-L</italic> (Smp_303980). The GO terms ‘cilium’, ‘regulation of apoptotic process’ and ‘potassium ion transmembrane transport’ were significantly enriched, and STRING analysis showed networks enriched in ‘plasma membrane-bound cell projection’ (Supplementary Table 6. Supplementary Figure 5).</p>
<p>Neuron 5 cluster comprised 276 cells. An EF-hand domain-containing protein, Smp_343710, was highly expressed in 55% of these cells. ISH showed expression in 10-20 cells whose nuclei sat outside of, and anterior to, the brain, in and around the paired lateral glands and their secretory ducts (Supplementary Video 11). There was also expression in a pair of bilaterally symmetrical bulbous protrusions (called lateral sensory papilla and thought to be depth sensors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan, 1980</xref>)(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). STRING analysis revealed networks associated with ‘synapses’, ‘ion channel binding’ and ‘cation transmembrane transporter activity’ (Supplementary Figure 5).</p>
<p>We expected to find a discrete cluster(s) for the penetration glands within the neural clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Steger <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>); there are three gland cells per larva - one apical and two lateral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan, 1980</xref>). While the top marker gene for neuron 3 was expressed in the four nuclei of the apical gland (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3Ci</xref>), and there was expression of a neuron 5 marker in the lateral glands (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3Fi</xref>), these genes were expressed in many other cells as well. This suggests that gland cells are either sub-clusters of neurons 3 and 5 or they were not captured in the 10X GEMs. To characterise the transcriptomes of the gland cells, we carried out plate-based single cell RNA-seq (New England BioLabs) on 37 manually selected gland cells (Supplementary Table 7). The biological process GO terms enriched in the most abundant genes (top 200 genes by median transcripts per million, Supplementary table 7) included translation, protein folding and ATP synthesis coupled electron transport (Supplementary Table 8). The gland cells showed co-expression of neural markers (<italic>Complexin</italic> and <italic>7B2</italic>) and muscle markers <italic>Myosin light chain 1</italic> (Smp_045200), <italic>Troponin t</italic> (Smp_179810) and <italic>Actin-2</italic> (Smp_307020) (Supplementary Figure 6). To identify genes that were specific to gland cells, we searched for differentially expressed genes in the gland cells compared to the other cells in the plate-based scRNA-seq data (i.e. ciliary plates and unknown cells) (Supplementary Table 9 and 10), and then looked at their expression in the 10X-based scRNA-seq data. A lack of, or minimal, expression of these markers in the 10X-based scRNA-seq data, would support the hypothesis that they were specific to the gland cells. Five venom antigen-like (VAL) genes (belonging to the SCP/TAPS or CAP) superfamily) were expressed in the gland cells; Smp_120670 (VAL 5) and Smp_070250 (VAL 15) in over 60% of the gland cells, and Smp_176180 (VAL 9), Smp_002630 (VAL 2) and Smp_331830 (SCP protein) in less than 50%. Many gland cells expressed multiple VAL genes (Supplementary Figure 6). In the 10X-based scRNA-seq data, very few cells expressed these VAL genes (1-5 cells for each gene, distributed between neurons 1 and 5, muscle 1, parenchyma 2, and stem F and G clusters). The VAL genes expressed in the gland cells are uniquely expressed during the egg, miracidia and sporocyst stages (Yoshino <italic>et al</italic>., 2014; Lu <italic>et al</italic>., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Buddenborg <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), and it has been reported that VAL 9 (Smp_176180) induces the differential expression of an extracellular matrix remodelling gene in the snail host (Yoshino <italic>et al</italic>., 2014). Other differentially expressed genes in the gland cells included Smp_303400 (an HSP70 homolog), Smp_179250 (α<italic>-galactosidase/</italic>α<italic>-N-acetylgalactominidase</italic>), Smp_317530 (uncharacterised protein), and two putative major egg antigens Smp_185680 and Smp_303690 (Supplementary Figure 6). Eight putative secreted proteins previously identified in miracidia and <italic>in vitro</italic> transformed miracidia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2006) were expressed in the glands cells (and not in other cell types based on the 10X data), and five of these showed relatively high expression; Smp_302170 (<italic>HSP70</italic> homolog), Smp_303400 (<italic>HSP70</italic> homolog), Smp_049230 (<italic>HSP20</italic>), Smp_304250 (<italic>purine nucleoside phosphorylase</italic>), and Smp_302180 (putative heat shock protein 70)(Supplementary Figure 6). Typical of venom glands in other animals, the transcriptomes of the miracidia gland cells are enriched in genes involved in protein translation, stabilisation and stress response to cope with mass protein production (Zancolli <italic>et al</italic>., 2021).</p>

<title>Ciliary plate gene marker identifies six submuscular cell bodies</title>
<p>A small cluster of 40 cells (almost exclusively from the unsorted samples) was identified near the tegument cluster (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The top markers were Smp_096390, a 16 kDa calcium-binding protein (CaBP) and <italic>p25 alpha</italic> (Smp_097490, a marker for ciliated neurons in adult worms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> hybridisation revealed CaBP and <italic>p25 alpha</italic> expression in the ciliary plates; epithelial cells with thousands of motile cilia used for swimming (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref> and Supplementary Figure 2). Both genes were also expressed in six previously undescribed cells that sent a projection out to the exterior (between the first and second tier of ciliary plates as seen with phalloidin staining, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>) and whose nuclei sat below the body wall musculature (Supplementary Videos 7 &amp; 8; Supplementary Figure 2F). Given the association of <italic>p25 alpha</italic> with ciliated neurons in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), expression in the sub-muscular cells suggested they project cilia into the external environment and may be sensory cells. The expression of CaBP and <italic>p25</italic> in both the ciliary plates and submuscular cells suggests that these anatomical structures are functionally linked. GO terms for this cluster were related to ‘mitochondrial transmembrane transport’ and ‘microtubule-based process’ (Supplementary Table 6), and STRING analysis showed two interaction networks: one associated with ‘carbon metabolism and mitochondria envelope’, the second associated with ‘cytoplasmic dynein complex’ and ‘dynein light chain superfamily’ (Supplementary Figure 5). Further plate-based scRNA-seq of 21 individual ciliary plates confirmed the high expression of CaBP (Smp_096390) and <italic>p25 alpha</italic> (Smp_097490), with more than two-fold higher expression of CaBP than any other gene by median TPM (transcripts per million) (Supplementary Table 11).

<p>We identified two clusters of cells (1,093 cells from parenchyma 1 and 605 cells from parenchyma 2) that were transcriptionally similar to the parenchymal cells found in later developmental stages; e.g. they express hypothetical protein (Smp_063330), <italic>cathepsin B-like cysteine proteinase</italic> (Smp_141610) and <italic>serpin</italic> (Smp_090080) (Diaz <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Diaz &amp; Attenborough <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). All top marker genes for parenchyma 1 were also expressed in parenchyma 2 but at lower levels, whereas the DUF2955 domain-containing protein (Smp_191970) was uniquely expressed in parenchyma 2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). A gene encoding a Zinc transporter Slc39a7 (Smp_318890) was a top marker for both clusters, with expression confirmed <italic>in situ</italic> within 7–9 cells; two of which were located anteriorly on either side of the brain and 5-7 located posterior to the brain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B &amp; F</xref>). These parenchyma cells have long cytoplasmic protrusions that reach between all the other cells, filling the intercellular space (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Fii</xref>-iii; Supplementary Videos 13 &amp; 14). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan (1980)</xref> called these the interstitial cells and, observing abundant glycogen particles and lipid droplets, proposed they function as sources of energy for the non-feeding larva and as nurse cells for the stem cells during the first few days post-infection of the snail. We performed ISH for two parenchyma 2 markers, Smp_191970 and Smp_320330, but the first showed no detectable signal, and the second had broad expression across all cells with no specific overlap with the pan-parenchymal marker Smp_318890. Therefore, by ISH, we could only identify parenchymal cells in general and could not identify the two clusters <italic>in situ</italic>. STRING analysis for the parenchyma 1 showed enrichment in networks for ‘carbohydrate metabolic process’ and ‘hydrolase’, and for parenchyma 2: ‘phagosome’, ‘mTOR signalling pathway’, ‘mitochondrial inner membrane’ and ‘proton-transporting two sector atpase complex’ (Supplementary Figure 8). Analysis of GO annotations was able to distinguish between the two parenchyma sub-populations, with parenchyma 1 genes enriched for ‘extracellular region’ and ‘endopeptidase inhibitor activity’, and parenchyma 2 genes enriched for processes that are ‘dynein complex’ and ‘microtubule-based process’ (Supplementary Table 6; Supplementary Figure 9).</p>

<title>Two major stem cell populations in the miracidium that clustered by sex</title>
<p>We identified stem cells based on the expression of known stem cell markers for the mother sporocyst stage, e.g. <italic>ago2-1</italic> (Smp_179320), <italic>nanos-2</italic> (Smp_051920), <italic>fgfrA</italic> (Smp_175590), <italic>fgfrB</italic> (Smp_157300), <italic>klf</italic> (Smp_172480)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">2018</xref>)(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).

<p>Working with the latest version of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> genome (v10), where the sex chromosomes Z and W have been resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buddenborg <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), we were able to determine that the Delta/Phi-like and Kappa-like populations are each composed of two well-separated clusters that can be distinguished based on the expression of sex-linked genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>; Supplementary Figure 11). <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> has 7 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes; males are homogametic (ZZ) and females heterogametic (ZW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buddenborg <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). The sex chromosomes are composed of sex-specific regions that are unique to each chromosome flanked by pseudoautosomal regions that are common to both Z and W. To unveil the genes contributing to the sex-driven clustering we removed in turn different sex chromosome regions from the analysis. When all Z-specific region (ZSR) and W-specific region (WSR) genes were removed simultaneously, the two Delta/Phi-like and two Kappa-like clusters each collapsed into single stem cell clusters, giving five stem cell clusters in total (i.e. Delta/Phi, Kappa, E, F and G; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Removing from the dataset genes located solely on the WSR, the ZSR, or just the gametologs (i.e. genes with homologous copies on the WSR and ZSR) did not impact the overall UMAP clustering, i.e. in all three scenarios the stem cell clusters remained separated by sex (Supplementary Figure 11). ZSR or WSR expression is therefore sufficient on their own to split each of these stem clusters in two (Supplementary Figure 11).</p>
<p>The unexpected subclustering of Delta/Phi and Kappa stem cells by sex could be due to an incomplete or a lack of dosage compensation in the ZSR genes (Supplementary Figure 11A&amp;B). In many animals, dosage compensation equalises gene expression across the sex chromosomes that are unevenly distributed between the sexes. We classified all cells based on the expression of WSR genes (i.e. only found in female individuals), so each cell was designated as W<sup>+</sup> (likely female) or W<sup>-</sup> (likely male) (Supplementary Figure 12A&amp;B). The difference in ZSR and WSR gene expression was most pronounced in the Delta/Phi-like and Kappa-like cells, shown by the separation of W<sup>+</sup> and W<sup>-</sup> cells (Supplementary Figure 12B). However, this analysis revealed other tissue-specific sex differences in ZSR gene expression e.g. in the protonephridia, which was evident through segregation of W<sup>+</sup> and W<sup>-</sup> cells within that cluster. We found that W<sup>+</sup> and W<sup>-</sup> cells were well mixed in the majority of the remaining clusters (Supplementary Figure 12B). Male cells have two copies of the ZSR (ZZ) and produce higher coverage across genes in this region compared to female cells, which have one ZSR and one WSR (ZW). These findings suggest that sex-linked gene dosage is not fully compensated in the miracidium, and there may be tissue-specific variation.</p>
<p>To identify the stem cells <italic>in situ</italic>, we investigated the expression of the pan-stem marker <italic>ago2-1</italic>. <italic>Ago2-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells were distributed lateral and posterior to the brain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Ci</xref>) and there was variation in the number between larvae, ranging from 20-29 (n = 5, median = 23, mean = 23.4)(i.e. ∼7% of cells that make up the larva are stem cells). Cells in the Delta/Phi-like cluster expressed a canonical <italic>p53 tumour suppressor family gene</italic> (<italic>p53-1</italic>, Smp_139530) as a top marker; <italic>in situ</italic> expression showed 12–14 <italic>p53-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells (n=3)(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Cells in the Kappa-like cluster expressed <italic>Uridine phosphorylase A</italic> (<italic>UPPA</italic>, Smp_308145) as a top marker; <italic>in situ</italic> expression showed 8–9 <italic>UPPA<sup>+</sup></italic> cells, and they were located amongst the <italic>p53-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells (n = 3)(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). We were not able to detect cells from the stem E, F and G clusters in the miracidium using ISH as there were no predicted marker genes that were unique to these clusters. Although <italic>Phosphomevalonate kinase</italic> (<italic>pmk</italic>) (Smp_072460) was a predicted marker for the stem E cluster (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), when multiplexed as <italic>p53/UPPA/pmk</italic>, no <italic>pmk</italic><sup>+</sup>-only cells could be found (Supplementary Video 16). Likewise, multiplexing <italic>ago2-1/ p53/ UPPA</italic> revealed no <italic>ago2-1<sup>+</sup></italic>-only cells (Supplementary Video 17). Overall, we could spatially validate two stem cell populations within the miracidia: Delta/Phi and Kappa. Cells in stem E, F and G <italic>in silico</italic> clusters might be stressed/damaged/dying cells or cells in transcriptionally transitional states.</p>
<p>A lack of EdU incorporation into miracidia cells (Supplementary Figure 13) indicated that DNA replication does not take place in the stem or somatic cells during this free-swimming stage. As the first stem cells start proliferating in the mother sporocyst ∼20 hours post-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>), this suggests that both stem cell populations pause cell division for at least 26 hours.</p>
<p>Many top markers for the Delta/Phi and Kappa stem clusters were ribosomal proteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). STRING analysis showed that most of the top 100 markers of each cluster both formed large single networks enriched for genes involved in translation, ribosome biogenesis and gene expression, and this was particularly striking in the Delta/Phi cluster (Supplementary Figure 14). Amongst the top genes differentially expressed between Kappa and Delta/Phi (Supplementary Figure 15A; Supplementary Table 12) were six transcription factors up-regulated in Delta/Phi: an ortholog of <italic>lin-39</italic> (Smp_247590), <italic>tiptop</italic> (Smp_180690), <italic>hes-related</italic> (Smp_024860), <italic>p53-1</italic> (Smp_139530), <italic>Zfp-1</italic> (Smp_145470) and a putative <italic>homothorax homeobox protein/ six-3-1</italic> (Smp_147790). The simultaneous co-expression of multiple transcription factors, indicates a multipotent progenitor stage (Kumar <italic>et al</italic>., 2019). Enriched in, or specific to, Kappa cells were genes involved in glycolysis and lipid metabolism, i.e. malate dehydrogenase (Smp_129610), 14 kDa fatty acid-binding protein (Smp_095360) and a very long chain fatty acid elongase (Smp_051810). GO analysis of differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Table 13) revealed that the most significantly upregulated genes in Delta/Phi were related to the structural component of the ribosome and translation; these are the first markers of a pre-activation stage in stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shin <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Whereas GO analysis showed that up-regulated genes in Kappa are involved in transcription and metabolism (Supplementary Figure 15B), which indicated quiescent rather than primed and activated stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Llorens-Babadilla <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>One miracidia stem population contributes to somatic tissues and the other to the germline</title>
<p>The Delta/Phi stem population simultaneously co-expressed three transcription factors that are known to be specific to the flatworm tegument/epidermal lineage, i.e <italic>p53-1, zfp-1, six3-1</italic>(Cheng <italic>et al</italic>., 2018; Collins <italic>et al</italic>., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">2022</xref>). This suggests that the Delta/Phi stem population may have been the origin of the miracidia tegument cells and may be the source of new tegument cells in the sporocyst stages. To explore the fates of the two miracidia stem populations, we investigated the dynamics of their gene expression in stem and tegument cells across the transition from miracidia to sporocyst. To do this, we combined single-cell data from these developmental stages and cell types (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Diaz &amp; Attenborough <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) and used RNA velocity analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bergen <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) to estimate relative induction/repression and timing of gene expression in this dataset.</p>
<p>A UMAP plot of the combined clustering shows that the miracidia tegument cells form a bridge connecting the miracidia stem Delta/Phi with the sporocyst tegument cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) (batch-corrected samples showed similar results, Supplementary Figure 16). The velocity field and latent time representations show the progression of some miracidia Delta/Phi stem cells towards the miracidia tegument cells and a high speed of differentiation was inferred from the miracidia tegument cells to the sporocyst tegument (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B &amp; C</xref>). This suggests that the miracidia tegument cluster may contain cells that range from post-mitotic stem cell progeny to tegument progenitors to terminally differentiated tegumental cells.</p>

<p>Investigations into tegument development in adult schistosomes has revealed key regulators and genes associated with different development states (Collins <italic>et al</italic>., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). We examined the dynamics of these genes in the combined miracidia/mother sporocyst dataset using RNA velocity and found that the velocities of these genes show different temporal dynamics. <italic>P53-1</italic> (Smp_139530) was induced in the Delta/Phi stem cells but repressed in some miracidia tegument cells and expression decreased along the bridge formed by the miracidia tegument cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). The flatworm-specific transcription factor <italic>Zfp-1</italic> (Smp_145470) showed a similar expression pattern to <italic>p53-1</italic>, except that the predominance of spliced copies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>) suggested that transcription happened earlier, during embryogenesis. A second zinc finger protein, <italic>Zfp-1-1</italic> (Smp_049580) was expressed in tegumental cells more than stem cells, which suggested a role in stem cell progeny and tegument progenitors (Supplementary Figure 17). In adults, tegument cells are renewed continuously by a population of <italic>tsp2+</italic> (Smp_335630) progenitor cells that fuse with the tegument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). In the miracidia, <italic>tsp2</italic> was expressed in the Delta/Phi stem cells as well as tegument cells (Supplementary Figure 17), suggesting earlier expression than in the adult, or that Delta/Phi are progenitor cells. Several markers of mature tegument cells in the adult were expressed in the miracidia and sporocyst tegument cells but not in the stem cells, e.g. <italic>annexin</italic> (Smp_077720), <italic>calpain</italic> (Smp_241190) and <italic>endophilin B</italic> (Smp_003230) (Supplementary Figure 17). <italic>Annexin</italic> is specific to the tegument cells, and the phase plot showed the accumulation of mature transcripts in the sporocyst tegument, while there was evidence of recent transcription in the miracidia tegument (Supplementary Figure 17). A putative ortholog of a planaria transcription factor <italic>six-3-1</italic> (Smp_147790), a marker for early epidermal progenitors (Cheng <italic>et al</italic>., 2018) was expressed in the Delta/Phi stem cells and miracidia tegument (Supplementary Figure 17). All of these genes showed little expression in the Kappa stem population (Supplementary Figure 17). The expression of these known tegument/epidermal development and lineage-specific genes in the Delta/Phi stem cluster, and the indication that <italic>zfp-1</italic> transcription occurred pre-hatching, suggested that this stem population was the origin of the miracidia tegument cells and is the source of the tegumental lineage. This, together with the observation that more than 80% of protein-coding genes in the genome are detected in these miracidia data, suggests that similar molecular programs for the development of tissues in the miracidia and mother sporocyst may be redeployed multiple times across the life cycle.</p>
<p>As well as allowing us to interrogate the dynamics of known marker genes (Supplementary Figure 17), the RNA velocity analysis also revealed genes previously unknown to have dynamic behaviours across these stages; these included genes up-regulated from miracidia tegument to sporocyst tegument, e.g. <italic>epidermal growth factor receptor</italic> (Smp_035260), genes down-regulated from miracidia tegument to sporocyst tegument, e.g. <italic>galectin domain</italic> (Smp_140590), and dynamic behaviour across stem cells and tegument, e.g. <italic>unc44/ankyrin 2,3</italic> (Smp_145700)(Supplementary Figure 17, Supplementary Table 14).</p>
<p>In the Kappa stem population, there was transcription and expression of genes detected in germline stem cells (GSCs) and germ cells in the intra-mammalian stages of the life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). A second P53 homolog, <italic>p53-2</italic> (Smp_136160), was highly expressed and actively transcribed in Kappa cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). In adults, this gene is enriched in reproductive organs and has a genotoxic stress response that is thought to defend the integrity of the genome by eliminating germ cells that have acquired mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Also expressed solely in Kappa cells are the germline-specific regulatory genes <italic>eled</italic> (Smp_041540)(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>), <italic>onecut1</italic> (Smp_196950), <italic>irx</italic> (Smp_063520), <italic>akkn</italic> (Smp_131630), and <italic>boule</italic> (Smp_144860)(expressed in the male Kappa cells and stem E, Supplementary Figure 20)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), as well as <italic>klf</italic> (Smp_172480) (Supplementary Figure 18), a homolog of KLF4, which is an important transcriptional regulator governing pluripotency (Takahashi &amp; Yamanaka, 2006).</p>
<p>Together, these data suggest that the Delta/Phi population is the origin of the tegumental lineage and likely contributes to extra-embryonic somatic tissues during intra-molluscan development, while the Kappa population likely contains pluripotent cells that will contribute to the development of cercariae and the germline in intra-mammalian stages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

They suggested that germ cells may be derived from ε-cells early in juvenile development, and <italic>eled</italic> is the earliest germline marker yet identified in schistosomes. This led to the idea that <italic>S. mansoni</italic> does not specify its germline until the juvenile stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>) and a germline-specific regulatory program (including <italic>eled, oc-1, akkn, nanos-1, boule</italic>) was identified in intra-mammalian stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). We show expression of these genes in κ stem cells in the miracidium. This suggests that after ∼6 days of embryogenesis, at hatching of the miracidium, the cells that may contribute to the germline might already be segregated into the κ population and the molecular regulatory program that differentiates somatic (delta/phi, LJ/LJ) and germ cell (κ) lineages is active. Furthermore, as <italic>p53-2</italic> plays a genotoxic stress response role in adult reproductive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), it’s expression in κ cells in the miracidia is another line of evidence that indicates that this population may contain the pluripotent stem cells that likely give rise to the germline.</p></caption>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Schistosomes are complex metazoan parasites, with adult worms of <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> characterised into 68 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Understanding the genes involved in the development and maintenance of these cell types is a promising approach for identifying novel therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Here we have shown that the miracidium larva is composed of ∼365 cells. Compared to later life cycle stages, where the cercariae is made up of ∼1,600 cells, the schistosomulum ∼900 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Diaz <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) and the adults tens of thousands of cells (unpublished data), the miracidium is a simple stage of the life cycle. We identified and spatially resolved 19 transcriptionally distinct cell types, revealing the relative contribution of each tissue type to the larva (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). The miracidium, therefore, with its diversity of differentiated cells present in relatively low numbers, makes a simple and tractable system with which to gain a fundamental understanding of the biology and spatial architecture of schistosome cells, and their transcriptomes.</p>

<p>Nineteen cell types may be a conservative characterisation, but at this resolution most cell types formed clearly defined clusters. There was sufficient sensitivity to detect cell types with as few as six cells per larva, for example, neurons 2 and 3, and the protonephridial system. Some rarer cell types are embedded in existing clusters, particularly in neuron 1, and a complete neural cell atlas and a study of the putative photoreceptor cells is in progress (Rawlinson <italic>et al</italic>., in prep). Some cell types were preferentially recovered, e.g. the stem cells; ISH revealed that they comprise only 7% of the total cell number in the larva, yet they accounted for ∼52% of the scRNA-seq data. Preferential recovery may be due to differences in the robustness of different cell types to dissociation, cell sorting, and/or the microfluidics of the 10X GEM capture process. The ciliary plates, for instance, were only found in sufficient numbers to be defined as a cluster in unsorted samples. Therefore, there are clear benefits to including unsorted cell samples to discover the diversity of cell types in a tissue, organ, or organism, especially when cell types may be fragile, sticky, or unusually shaped. Even with the inclusion of unsorted cells, some known cell types were not captured, i.e. the penetration glands. With three gland cells per larva and a theoretical 56x coverage of each cell, we would have expected ∼168 gland cells in the dataset. These cells were easily identified after dissociation by their distinct flask-shape but were not identifiable in these 10X data. Perhaps, because of their large size (20x50µm) and irregular shape, they were not incorporated into the 10X GEMs. Therefore, we used plate-based scRNA-seq for the penetration glands to complete the cell type transcriptome atlas for all known cell types. Together, we have transcriptomically characterised the anatomical systems described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan (1980)</xref>, and we discuss key findings below.</p>
<p>The two muscle clusters in our dataset correspond to the circular and longitudinal muscles that comprise the orthogonal body wall muscles of the miracidium. We identified differences between circular and longitudinal muscle transcriptomes that have also been observed in planaria; e.g. <italic>MyoD</italic> and <italic>Wnt-11-1</italic> are expressed in longitudinal and circular muscles, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Scimone <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Posterior Wnt signalling and anterior Wnt inhibition are commonly observed features of anterior-posterior body patterning in animals (Peterson &amp; Reddien, 2009). The expression of <italic>Wnt-11-1</italic> and a Wnt inhibitor, <italic>Notum,</italic> in the circular muscles at opposite poles of the miracidium suggested these muscles are involved in defining the anterior-posterior axis. Furthermore, the unilateral, asymmetrical expression of <italic>Notum</italic> at the anterior end is suggestive of a dorso-ventral axis and/or a left-right axis, neither of which have been identified in the miracidium before. Many axial patterning genes expressed in planaria muscles are essential for patterning during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Witchley <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Vogg <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). The expression of orthologs in <italic>S. mansoni</italic> muscles, a nonregenerative animal, suggests that these genes may regulate stem cells during homeostasis in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). As the body axes of the miracidium were defined during embryogenesis, the expression of these genes in the muscles of the larva suggest they will provide positional information to the stem cells of the mother sporocyst in the axial patterning of the daughter sporocysts.</p>
<p>The nervous system accounts for over 50% of cells that make up the larva and is the most transcriptionally heterogeneous tissue, as observed in other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Siebert <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vergara <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). At the end of embryogenesis, at hatching, most of the miracidia neurons are fully differentiated and form the functional neural circuits of the larva. This is evident in our scRNA-seq data by the presence of discrete, well-defined neural cell clusters. <italic>In situ</italic> validation of marker genes revealed many of the nerves identified ultrastructurally; for example, the location and shape of neuron 4 cells resemble that of the bipolar ganglion cells with multi-ciliated nerve endings described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan, 1980</xref>. Examination of their transcriptional profiles indicates their function; top markers include a putative <italic>mTORC1</italic>, two <italic>Polycystin</italic> genes, a <italic>GTP-binding ras-like</italic> and <italic>fibrocystin.</italic> Mammalian orthologs of these function in cells with primary cilia in the detection of flow sheer and regulate mTORC1 signalling to maintain the cell in a quiescent and functional state (Lai &amp; Jiang, 2020). Polycystins 1 and 2 expressed in ciliated neurons of the larva of the annelid <italic>Platynereis dumerilli</italic> are involved in mechanosensation, detection of water vibrations and mediate the startle response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bezares-Calderón <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>). Furthermore, in planaria, SoxB1-2 regulates polycystin genes and together they function in ciliated cells that are involved in water flow sensation (Ross <italic>et al</italic>., 2018). The gene expression profile of neuron 4 cells in the miracidium suggests they could function as flow and/or vibration sensors and may be specified by a Sox transcription factor. These multiciliated receptors degenerate 12 hours after the miracidia transform into a mother sporocyst (Poteaux <italic>et al</italic>., 2023).</p>
<p><italic>In situ</italic> validation of marker genes also revealed an undescribed cell type, namely the six submuscular cells that express the top marker genes for the ciliary plates (i.e. a 16KDa calcium binding protein and <italic>p25 alpha</italic>). The expression of these genes in both the ciliary plates and the submuscular cells suggests that these latter cells are transcriptionally similar and might play a role in the development and functioning of the ciliary plates. Their projection into the external environment suggests a sensory role, which, together with their location between the first and second tier of ciliary plates, could suggest a role in coordinating the movement of the motile cilia across the plates and tiers in response to sensory cues (i.e. similar in function to the ciliomotor pacemaker neurons in <italic>Platynereis</italic> larvae, Verasztó <italic>et al</italic>., 2017). The ciliary plates are a miracidium-specific cell type (it is the only life cycle stage that uses motile cilia for locomotion), and once inside the snail, these plates are shed within 2 – 48 hours (Meulement <italic>et al</italic>., 1978; Poteaux <italic>et al</italic>., 2023). As expected, they are transcriptomically typified by enrichment with dynein and high metabolic activity. The 16KDa calcium binding protein (Smp_096390) is clearly important to the function of ciliary plates as it is highly expressed in data collected from both droplet- and plate-based scRNA-seq platforms. Accordingly, bulk RNAseq data shows this gene was previously detected in the late embryonic stage, miracidia and early mother sporocyst stage (Lu <italic>et al</italic>., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Buddenborg <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Between all the ciliary plates sit the ridges of the tegumental cells. The ridges connect to the cell bodies beneath the body wall musculature, and their transcriptomes show a predicted network of genes involved in protein folding, export and translocation. This is consistent with ultrastructural studies that have observed abundant RER, ribosomes, Golgi apparatus, and complex carbohydrates in these cell bodies, suggesting they are active in producing exportable proteins (Meulement <italic>et al</italic>., 1978; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan, 1980</xref>). Large numbers of membrane-bound vesicles were also observed and thought to become part of the new tegument membrane (syncytium) that rapidly forms around the mother sporocyst during the early stages of transformation, protecting the mother sporocyst from attack by the snails’ amoebocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan, 1980</xref>). The RNA velocity analysis has revealed dynamic genes that may be crucial in the maturation of the tegument cells across this life cycle transition, and in turn, for evasion of host defences and parasite survival. This analysis also suggests a developmental trajectory for the tegument cells that starts in the miracidia Delta/Phi stem cells and follows their progeny to terminally differentiated tegument cells in the miracidium and five-day-old sporocyst. Many of the molecular regulators and markers of adult tegument biogenesis (Collins <italic>et al</italic>., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) are expressed in the miracidia and sporocyst stem and tegument cells, indicating that there is a conserved molecular program for the development of the syncytial tegument in the mother sporocyst and its maintenance in the adult worm.</p>
<p>The transcriptomes of the two stem populations in the miracidium suggest they are in different activation states. This finding aligns with the discovery of two stem cell populations in the mother sporocyst that have different proliferation kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). The pre-activated state of Delta/Phi stem cells in the miracidia may signify that they are the first population to proliferate once the miracidium transforms into the mother sporocyst inside the snail. These two stem populations may also have different potency states; the co-expression of multiple transcription factors in Delta/Phi, including those specific to the tegument lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">2022</xref>), indicates a multipotent progenitor stage. Whereas in the Kappa stem cells, the expression of genes that define the germline in the intra-mammalian stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>) suggest pluripotency. Supporting this, the RNA velocity analysis shows that <italic>p53-2</italic>, the genome protection gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), is most highly expressed, and being actively transcribed, in the Kappa population. The incorporation of miracidia single-cell data into existing stem cell scenarios on <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) shows the continuum of the Kappa population from hatching through the intra-molluscan stages to the adult stage inside the mammalian host (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). The finding that <italic>eled</italic>, and many of the germline-specific regulatory program components, are expressed in some miracidia Kappa cells suggests that when a miracidium hatches, the cells that will contribute to the germline may already be segregated and the molecular regulatory program that differentiates somatic (Delta/Phi) and germ cell (Kappa) lineages is active.</p>
<p>An unexpected finding regarding the stem cells was the further clustering of the two populations by sex. This is the first identification of any sex differences in the miracidium. This degree of transcriptomic sexual difference was most evident in the Delta/Phi and Kappa stem cell clusters, with no distinct clustering by sex observed in other cell clusters. This could be explained by incomplete gene dosage compensation in the miracidium. Following investigations of differences in gene dosage compensation across developmental stages using bulk RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Picard <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), our study suggests tissue-specific variation could add a further dimension to the role of dosage compensation in schistosomes. A similar phenomenon has been described in mouse embryonic stem cells and in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> where a precise regulation of a gene-by-gene dosage compensation mechanism is critical to the proper development of specific tissues and organs, such as the wing and eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Valsecchi <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). In contrast to the miracidium, sex differences in undifferentiated stem cells have not been reported in later stages of the schistosome life cycle (Wang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018; Diaz <italic>et al</italic>., 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). In fact, it may not have been possible to detect these differences in earlier studies because scRNA-seq data were mapped onto older versions of the genome, where the sex chromosomes were not as well defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buddenborg <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). In addition to using an improved reference annotation, the present study has also benefited from a high level of coverage, enabling differences in stem cells to be more easily discerned. Whether these sex-linked gene expression and dosage differences have functional implications in developing male and female sporocysts remains to be investigated.</p>
<p>The current understanding of schistosome development is that differentiated somatic cells of the miracidium do not continue into the daughter sporocyst stage, the cercariae and beyond; it is the stem cells that persist and differentiate into the cell types of the subsequent life stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). In this respect, all miracidium somatic cells are miracidium-only cells. Our atlas shows that their transcriptional signatures are similar to comparable tissue types at later stages (Diaz <italic>et al</italic>., 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wendt <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Diaz &amp; Attenborough <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) and that there may be conserved tissue-specific molecular developmental programs that are deployed multiple times during the complex life cycle. Through this atlas, we have shown that even in this simple and sexually monomorphic short-lived stage, there are different populations of muscle, a diverse and distinct range of neural cell types, and that stem cell transcriptomes are already different based on the sex of the miracidium. The molecular definitions and spatial analyses of the miracidia cell types we have presented here allow us to explore the molecular processes and pathways to reveal cell functions and interactions. In addition, high coverage data from individual cells has allowed us to examine how gene expression changes across and within tissue types. Already, a picture is emerging of how the peripheral neurons may detect environmental cues, connect to the brain, muscles and ciliary plates to orientate in the water column; how the parenchymal cells supply nutrients to the surrounding cells; what the contents of the penetration glands may be; and how the tegumental and stem cells are primed for the transition to the intra-molluscan stage.</p>

<title>Single-cell tissue dissociation</title>
<p><italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> miracidia for single-cell dissociation were collected as described above. Eggs isolated from mouse livers were hatched in nuclease-free water (NFW) and collected within four hours of hatching. Two samples of miracidia were collected; sample 1 contained approximately ∼8250 individuals, and sample 2 ∼11,700. The samples (live miracidia in NFW in Low Protein Binding 15 mL Falcon Tubes [cat# 30122216]) were placed on ice for an hour to sink and concentrate the larvae, and all but 20 μl of water was then removed.</p>
<p>Three hundred µl of digestion buffer (2.5 µl of 0.5 M EDTA in 300 µl of Hank’s Buffered Salt Solution without Ca2+ and Mg2+ [HBSS-/-]) was added to the larvae.

The samples were kept on ice for 45 minutes and pipetted gently ∼20 times every five minutes. Two hundred µl of 25% BSA in 1X HBSS-/- was added to the sample to quench the enzyme, and 10 ml of ice-cold PBS +/+ was added to bring the BSA to ∼0.5%. The samples were centrifuged at 350 g for 5 minutes at 4LJ, and all but 20 µl of the supernatant was removed. We reconstituted 5 mg of the enzyme Liberase™ (Thermolysin Medium) Research Grade (LIBTM-RO Roche) in 2 mL of PBS (to give a stock concentration of 2.5 mg/ml) and added 100 µl of this stock to the sample (final enzyme concentration = 2.08 mg/ml). The samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes, pipetting gently ∼10 times every five minutes. The suspension was passed through 60 µm and 30 µm cell strainers (Falcon) and resuspended in 5 mL of cold 1× PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA.

The Cell Ranger implementation of EmptyDrops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lun <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) was used to detect cells and empty droplets. Across the four samples, on average 63.88% of the reads mapped confidently to the transcriptome (63.4% for sorted, 64.35% for unsorted), and an average 83.65% of reads were associated with a cell. There were an average of 118,395 reads per cell. Across the four samples, we captured an estimated 33,319 cells: 8,815 and 24,504 cells from sorted and unsorted samples, respectively.

<title>Quality control (QC) and clustering using Seurat</title>
<p>The four samples were imported into Seurat (version 4.3.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hao <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) using R (version 4.1.3) in RStudio (version 1.4.1106) for quality control, clustering, and marker gene identification. The four samples were initially processed separately. Cells with less than 200 genes expressed and genes in less than three cells were removed. QC metrics, including gene distribution and UMI counts per cell, were inspected visually and used to select QC cut-offs. Following a preliminary analysis without further cell filtering, cells with fewer than 500 UMIs were removed, and a maximum mitochondrial threshold of 5% was applied. This was based on data distribution, best practices from the authors of the software, and other similar studies; here, we were aiming to remove low-quality cells while being relatively permissive as there may be cell types in these data outside of standard filtering parameters. Based on existing knowledge of this larva, we were expecting both multinucleate and anucleate cell type(s) as well as single-nuclei cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan, 1980</xref>). The data were normalised, scaled (regressing for mitochondrial gene percentage), and variable genes were identified for clustering following Seurat guidelines. Throughout the analysis of these data, several tools were used to select the optimal number of principal components (PCs) to use: Seurat’s ElbowPlot and JackStraw, and molecular cross-validation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/constantAmateur/MCVR/blob/master/code.R">https://github.com/constantAmateur/MCVR/blob/master/code.R</ext-link>), and Seurat’s clustree tool was used to assess the stability of clusters with increasing resolution. We employed DoubletFinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">McGinnis <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) to identify multiplets, which can lead to spurious signals. The estimated doublet rate was calculated based on 10X loading guidelines; for our data, we estimated multiplet rates at 8% for sorted samples and 52.8% for unsorted samples. We used paramSweep, as recommended, to identify the optimum parameters for each sample in our data and removed cells classified as multiplets. DoubletFinder removed 299 and 303 cells from the two sorted samples, and 6,069 and 5,496 cells from the two unsorted samples.</p>
<p>We then combined the two sorted samples and the two unsorted samples (producing one sorted object and one unsorted object). We used SCTransform to normalise and scale these two objects (with regression for mitochondrial percentage and sample ID). Seurat’s IntegrateData function was then used to integrate the sorted and unsorted samples (with normalization.method = &quot;SCT&quot;). This resulted in 20,478 cells passing all the QC filters and going onto the primary analysis, 3,849 and 3,962 from the sorted samples and 6,702 and 5,965 from the unsorted samples.</p>
<p>Following integration, principal component analysis (PCA) was run for up to 100 PCs. The data were explored using a range of PCs and resolutions and using the tools listed above, 55 PCs and a resolution of 1 were selected for the analysis. Top markers were identified using Seurat’s FindAllMarkers (min.pct = 0.0, logfc.threshold = 0.0, test.use = &quot;roc&quot;) as recommended by Seurat best practices (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/">https://satijalab.org/seurat/</ext-link>) to capture subtle differences in gene expression, and were sorted by AUC. We used the identity and expression of top marker genes (as identified by AUC), along with previously published cell and tissue type marker gene expression, to determine the identity of the cell clusters. To link gene description and chromosome locations to gene IDs, the GFF for the latest publicly available genome version was downloaded from WBPS (WBPS18 release, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Howe <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2017</xref>)).</p>

<p>To investigate sex effects on the single cell transcriptome, the cells were categorised as W+ or W- (an approximation of female and male cells respectively, as males lack WSR genes). As ground-truth data was absent, the % of reads mapping to ZSR and WSR was calculated using Seurat’s PercentageFeatureSet. Cells with 0.2% or more reads mapping to the WSR were classified as W+, and the remaining cells were classified as W-. The 0.2% threshold was selected (Supplementary Figure 12) to avoid classifying ZZ cells with a few transcripts erroneously mapping to a gene on the WSR as W+.

<p>All four miracidia samples and the raw data from the mother sporocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Diaz &amp; Attenborough <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) were pseudo-mapped using kallisto bustools (v 0.27.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Melsted <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) using the lamanno workflow to the version 10 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> genome (WBPS18 release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Howe <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2017</xref>, with the same amendments as listed above). The filtered spliced and unspliced matrices for each sample individually were imported to R. DropletUtils (v 1.20.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lun <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) and BUSpaRse (v 1.14.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Moses and Pachter, 2023</xref>) were used to process and QC the matrices, and filter out cells and genes with few reads. The matrices were then converted to Seurat objects and further filtered so only cells with the cell barcodes that passed QC filtering in the primary Seurat analysis were retained. The metadata and raw counts of the unspliced and spliced reads following filtering were exported as CSV files. The same method was performed on the mother sporocyst samples, which were combined before exporting. For the joint analyses of miracidia and sporocyst cells, the combined sporocyst Seurat object was merged with each of the four miracidia samples separately (due to the mismatch in sample size and batch effect between sorted and unsorted samples) and all were exported.</p>
<p>The CSV files containing spliced and unspliced reads, together with sample metadata were combined to make an AnnData object using Scanpy (v 1.8.2, Python v 3.8.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wolf <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Using scvelo (v 0.2.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bergen <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), the standard parameters were used to filter and normalise the data, compute moments, and recover dynamics. Velocity was calculated using the dynamical mode. Following PCA, a UMAP was generated (n_neighbors=10, n_pcs=40) and Leiden clustering was added (resolution=0.8). The top-ranked dynamical genes for each cluster and known genes of interest were plotted. This was performed for each of the four miracidia samples combined with the sporocyst samples, with and without the use of combat for batch correction. As the sporocyst samples were also sorted, we used the sorted miracidia samples to reduce technical effects.</p>
<p>To focus on the stem/germinal and tegument clusters, the same method as above was used after subsetting the data in Seurat to contain only cells from the clusters Stem/germinal, Tegument 1, and Tegument 2 in the sporocyst samples, and only Stem A-G and Tegument clusters from the miracidia clusters.</p>
<p>We present the stem and tegument cells from the sporocyst stage merged with sample 1 (sorted). The equivalent results from sporocysts merged with sample 4 of the miracidia and results with all cells from those two conditions are available in the supplementary data (Supplementary Figures 19-21).</p>

<title>EdU-staining experiment</title>
<p>Miracidia were collected as described above for 2 hours. As miracidia continually hatched over this time period, they ranged from 0 to 2 hours post-hatching. The miracidia were collected and split into two samples: one for EdU labelling and the second for a negative control (miracidia in water without EdU). Sample one was pulsed with 500 µM EdU in water for 4 hours. Sample two was kept in water for 4 hours. Both samples were fixed in 4% PFA for 30 minutes at room temperature. EdU incorporation was detected by click reaction with 25 µM Alexa Fluor488 Azide conjugates (Invitrogen) for 30 minutes. As a positive control, we pulsed freshly-transformed mother sporocysts in EdU for 3 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Three biological replicates were carried out, with 20 miracidia and 20 mother sporocysts per treatment examined for each replicate.</p>

<title>Plate-based scRNAseq analysis of individually isolated cells</title>
<p>A sample of thousands of miracidia was dissociated into a single cell suspension using the dissociation protocol described above. Individual gland cells, ciliary plates and unknown cells were picked up one at time using an EZ Grip transfer pipette set to aspirate a 3µl volume (Research Instruments Ltd 7-72-2800). Each cell was placed in a well of a 96-well plate containing a lysis buffer (NEBNext Cell Lysis Buffer, E6428). cDNA was generated using the NEB low input RNA kit (E6420). DNA library construction was carried out using the NEBNext<sup>®</sup> Ultra<sup>™</sup> II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (E7805). The libraries were sequenced on one lane of NovaSeq SP. The reads from the 96 samples were pseudoaligned to the version 10 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> genome (WBPS18 release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Howe <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2017</xref>, with the same amendments as listed above) using kallisto (v 0.44.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bray <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>)). These were imported into R (v4.3.1) and the metadata were inspected, after which only samples coming from a single cell with a minimum of 20% reads pseudoaligned were retained (n=76). The samples were then processed using sleuth (v0.30.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pimentel <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) following guidance from sleuth tutorials, including the steps for normalising, fitting error models, and differential analysis. Differential analysis was used to identify significant genes between the cell types, which were visualised, along with known genes of interest, using sleuth’s heatmap function. Furthermore, the kallisto outputs were used to calculate the top 200 genes by median transcripts per million (TPM) of the two key cell types of interest, ciliary plates and gland cells, and these were used for GO term analysis following the method described below.</p>

<title><italic>In situ</italic> hybridisation</title>
<p>Miracidia collected as described above within 4 hours of hatching were fixed in 4% PFA in 2 μm filtered PBSTw (1x PBS + 0.1% Tween) at room temperature for 30 minutes on a rocker. The larvae were transferred to incubation baskets (Intavis, 35 µm mesh) in a 24-well plate, rinsed 3 x 5 minutes in PBSTw, and incubated in 5 μg/ml Proteinase K (Invitrogen) in 1x PBSTw for 5 minutes at room temperature. They were post-fixed in 4% Formaldehyde in PBSTx for 10 minutes at room temperature and then rinsed in PBSTw for 10 minutes. From this point on, the <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation experiments followed the protocol described by Choi <italic>et al</italic>., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">2018</xref>) and developed for wholemount nematode larvae. We carried out fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation on 27 cell-type marker genes. Probes, buffers, and hairpins for third-generation <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization chain reaction (HCR) experiments were purchased from Molecular Instruments (Los Angeles, California, USA). Molecular Instruments designed probes against the sequences on WormBase ParaSite (WBPS version 18, WS271, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Howe <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>)(Supplementary Table 15). We subsequently labelled some larvae with phalloidin by adding 1 µl phalloidin to 1 ml 5X SSCT for an hour at room temperature in the dark, then rinsing 6 x 30 minutes in SSCT, incubating overnight at 4°C in DAPI fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech) and then mounting and imaging on a confocal laser microscope (Leica Sp8).</p>

<title>Opsin phylogeny</title>
<p>Amino acid sequences for selected metazoan opsin proteins were obtained from the GenBank database and aligned using the —auto mode of MAFFT v7.450 (Katoh &amp; Standley, 2013), then trimmed using trimAl v1.4.rev22 (Capella-Gutierrez <italic>et al</italic>., 2009) to remove alignment columns with more than 50% gap characters ensuring at least 50% of alignment columns were maintained in the final alignment. Phylogenetic analysis of this alignment was performed using RaxML v8.2.12 (Stamatakis, 2014). The best-fitting empirical amino acid substitution model was identified as maximising the log-likelihood of the data under a model incorporating gamma-distributed variation in substitution rates across sites, and this optimal model (LG) was used for subsequent inference. The maximum-likelihood tree and branch lengths were identified as the highest likelihood from 25 independent searches starting from different random starting tree topologies, and support for partitions on this tree was estimated using 1000 bootstrap replicates of resampling alignment positions with replacement, using the fast bootstrap (-x) algorithm implemented in RaxML.</p>

<title>Protein-Protein interaction analysis</title>
<p>Protein interactions were predicted using the online search tool STRING (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.string-db.org">www.string-db.org</ext-link>; V 11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Szklarczyk <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) for the following well-defined cell clusters: neuron 3-5, ciliary plates, protonephridia, parenchyma 1 &amp; 2, tegument and the two main stem cell populations, Delta/Phi and Kappa. Protein sequences for the top 100 marker genes for each cell cluster were collected from WormBase ParaSite. The protein sequences were entered as a multiple protein search. Default settings were used to predict interactions with either a minimum interaction (confidence) score of 0.4 or 0.7, corresponding to a medium or high level of confidence.</p>

<title>Gene Ontology enrichment analysis</title>
<p>Each cluster’s list of marker genes was filtered to focus on specific cluster markers. Genes were retained for analysis if they had a minimum AUC score of 0.7. To compare the functional enrichment in Stem 1 v Stem 2, Stem A was combined with Stem B and Stem C was combined with Stem D, and the DE markers were identified using Seurat’s FindMarkers. These markers were filtered (with adjusted p-values &lt;0.001) and used as the basis for GO enrichment analysis in the Delta/Phi and Kappa stem clusters. TopGO (version 2.46.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alexa &amp; Rahnenfuhrer, 2023</xref>) was used in R with the weight01 method to identify enriched GO terms. Node size was set to a minimum of 5 terms, and analysis was run for each cluster on the BP and MF categories. Fisher’s exact test was used to assess the statistical significance of overrepresented terms, with a FDR threshold set &lt; 0.05.</p>

The sex chromosomes are composed of sex-specific regions that are unique to each chromosome flanked by pseudoautosomal regions that are common to both Z and W. The W-specific region (WSR) is a large, highly repetitive region that contains 38 genes, most of which are gametologs (genes with homologous copies on the WSR and ZSR). The Z-specific region (ZSR) contains 941 genes, of which only 35 are gametologs. <bold>A &amp; B)</bold> The proportion of reads mapping to the WSR and ZSR across all cell type clusters shows <bold>A)</bold> putative male cells (Stem A and C i.e. those that lack WSR gene expression) and <bold>B)</bold> evidence of incomplete ZSR gene dosage compensation in the male stem cells. <bold>C)</bold> To determine whether any of the WSR genes were responsible for the clustering pattern, we excluded them from the mapping reference. The impact on the overall UMAP clustering was minimal. We repeated this excluding the <bold>D)</bold> ZSR genes, <bold>E)</bold> gametologues and <bold>F)</bold> ZSR genes, except the gametologues, in turn. In all four scenarios the stem cell clusters remained separated by sex. ZSR or WSR expression is therefore sufficient on their own to split these stem clusters in two.</p>

<p>In this work, the authors provide a valuable transcriptomic resource for the intermediate free-living transmission stage (miracidium larva) of the blood fluke. The single-cell transcriptome inventory is beautifully supplemented with in situ hybridization, providing spatial information and absolute cell numbers for many of the recovered transcriptomic states. The identification of sex-specific transcriptomic states within the populations of stem cells was particularly unexpected. The work comprises a rich resource to complement the biology of this complex system, however falls short in some technical aspects of the bioinformatic analyses of the generated sequence data.</p>
<p>(1) Four sequencing libraries were generated and then merged for analysis, however, the authors fail to document any parameters that would indicate that the clustering does not suffer from any batch effects.</p>
<p>(2) Additionally, the authors switch between analysis platforms without a clear motivation or explanation of what the fundamental differences between these platforms are. While in theory, any biologically robust observation should be recoverable from any permutation of analysis parameters, it has been recently documented that the two popular analysis platforms (Seurat - R and scanPy - python) indeed do things slightly differently and can give different results (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.04.588111v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.04.588111v1</ext-link>). For this reason, I don't think that one can claim that Seurat fails to find clusters resolved by SAM without running a similar pipeline on the cluster alone as was done with SAM/scanPy here. The manuscript itself needs to be checked carefully for misleading statements in this regard.</p>
<p>(3) Similarly, the manuscript contains many statements regarding clusters being 'connected to', or forming a 'bridge' on the UMAP projection. One must be very careful about these types of statements, as the relative position of cells on a reduced-dimension cell map can be misleading (see Chari and Pachter 2023). To support these types of interpretations, the authors should provide evidence of gene expression transitions that support connectivity as well as stability estimates of such connections under different parameter conditions. Otherwise, these descriptors hold little value and should be dropped and the transcriptomic states simply defined as clusters with no reference to their positions on the UMAP.</p>
<p>(4) The underlying support for the clusters as transcriptomically unique identities is not well supported by the dot plots provided. The authors used very permissive parameters to generate marker lists, which hampers the identification of highly specific marker genes. This permissive approach can allow for extensive lists of upregulated genes for input into STRING/GO analyses, this is less useful for evaluating the robustness of the cluster states. Running the Seurat::FindAllMarkers with more stringent parameters would give a more selective set of genes to display and thereby increase the confidence in the reader as to the validity of profiles selected as being transcriptomically unique.</p>
<p>(5) Figure 5B shows a UMAP representation of cell positions with a statement that the clustering disappears. As a visual representation of this phenomenon, the UMAP is a very good tool, however, to make this statement you need to re-cluster your data after the removal of this gene set and demonstrate that the data no longer clusters into A/B and C/D. Also, as a reader, these data beg the question: which genes are removed here? Is there an over-representation of any specific 'types' of genes that could lead to any hypotheses of the function? Perhaps the STRING/GO analyses of this gene set could be informative.</p>
<p>(6) How do the proportions of cell types characterized via in situ here compare to the relative proportions of clusters obtained? It does not correspond to the percentages of the clusters captured (although this should be quantified in a similar manner in order to make this comparison direct: 10,686/20,478 = ~50% vs. 7%), how do you interpret this discrepancy? While this is mentioned in the discussion, there is no sufficient postulation as to why you have an overabundance of the stem cells compared to their presence in the tissue. While it is true that you could have a negative selection of some cell types, for example as stated the size of the penetration glands exceeds both that of the 10x capabilities (40uM), and the 30uM filters used in the protocol, this does not really address why over half of the captured cells represent 'stem cells'. A more realistic interpretation would be biological rather than merely technical. For example, while the composition of the muscle cells and the number of muscle transcriptomes captured are quite congruent at ~20%, the organism is composed of more than 50% of neurons, but only 15% of the transcriptomic states are assigned to neuronal. Could it be that a large fraction of the stem cells are actually neural progenitors? Are there other large inconsistencies between the cluster sizes and the fraction of expected cells? Could you look specifically at early transcription factors that are found in the neurons (or other cell types) within the various stem cell populations to help further refine the precursor/cell type relationships?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript the authors have generated a single-cell atlas of the miracidium, the first free-living stage of an important human parasite, Schistosoma mansoni. Miracidia develop from eggs produced in the mammalian (human) host and are released into freshwater, where they can infect the parasite's intermediate snail host to continue the life cycle. This study adds to the growing single-cell resources that have already been generated for other life-cycle stages and, thus, provides a useful resource for the field.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Beyond generating lists of genes that are differentially expressed in different cell types, the authors validated many of the cluster-defining genes using in situ hybridization chain reaction. In addition to providing the field with markers for many of the cell types in the parasite at this stage, the authors use these markers to count the total number of various cell types in the organism. Because the authors realized that their cell isolation protocols were biasing the cell types they were sequencing, they applied a second method to help them recover additional cell types.</p>
<p>Schistosomes have ZW sex chromosomes and the authors make the interesting observation that the stem cells at this stage are already expressing sex (i.e. W)-specific genes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The sample sizes upon which the in situ hybridization results and cell counts are based are either not stated (in most cases) or are very small (n=3). This lack of clarity about biological replicates and sample sizes makes it difficult for the reader to assess the robustness of the results and the extremely small sample sizes (when provided) are a missed opportunity to explore the variability of the system, or lack thereof.</p>
<p>Although assigning transcripts to a given cell type is usually straightforward via in situ experiments, the authors fail to consider the potential difficulty of assigning the appropriate nuclei to cells with long cytoplasmic extensions, like neurons. In the absence of multiple markers and a better understanding of the nervous system, it seems likely that the authors have overestimated the number of neurons and misassigned other cell types based on their proximity to neural projections.</p>
<p>The conclusion that germline genes are expressed in the miracidia stem cells seems greatly overstated in the absence of any follow-up validation. The expression scales for genes like eled and boule are more than 3 orders of magnitude smaller than those used for any of the robustly expressed genes presented throughout the paper. These scales are undefined, so it isn't entirely clear what they represent, but neither of these genes is detected at levels remotely high (or statistically significant) enough to survive filters for cluster-defining genes. Given that germ cells often develop early in embryogenesis and arrest the cell cycle until later in development, and that these transcripts reveal no unspliced forms, it seems plausible that the authors are detecting some maternally supplied transcripts that have yet to be completely degraded.</p>
