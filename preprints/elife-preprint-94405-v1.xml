<title>Abstract</title><p>In animal cells, the centrosome, consisting of two centrioles, duplicates only once per cell cycle for bipolar spindle formation. Defective centriole duplication results in abnormal spindle formation and chromosome missegregation, which is closely linked to tumor growth. However, the molecular mechanisms licensing only one centriole duplication cycle within a cell cycle are less well known. Here we found that CEP44 is negatively correlated with breast carcinoma. CEP44, jointly with CEP57 and CEP57L1, maintains centriole engagement in the interphase to ensure centriole duplication once per cell cycle. Depletion of CEP44 leads to centriole overduplication because of premature centriole disengagement and multipolar spindle formation. Additionally, CEP44 is phosphorylated by Aurora A at the G2/M phase to facilitate spindle localization and maintain spindle integrity. Collectively, our results reveal the function of CEP44 in spindle formation by preventing centriole overduplication and maintaining spindle integrity, and CEP44 may serve as a potential marker for breast carcinoma prognosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The centrosome, at the center of which is a pair of centrioles, is surrounded by pericentriolar material (PCM) and centriolar satellites, and acts as the major microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In mitosis, the two centrosomes move to the opposite side in a cell and function in the nucleation of microtubules important for forming the bipolar spindle to ensure even segregation of genetic material. Therefore, centriole duplication, occurring only once per cell cycle, is strictly initiated through assembly of the procentriole at the proximal parts of preexisting centrioles during the S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Anomalies in centriole duplication caused by improper centrosome number control lead to disrupted spindle formation and chromosomal segregation errors, and eventually culminate in cancer and other developmental diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>The molecular mechanisms controlling only one centriole duplication cycle within a cell cycle are not well understood, despite significant advancements in understanding copy number control of centriole duplication in the S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Maintenance of centriole engagement in the interphase has been reported to be fundamental for ensuring that centriole duplication occurs only once per cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Immediately after centriole duplication, the newly formed daughter centriole is perpendicularly engaged with preexisting centrioles until late mitosis (centrosome engagement). After mitotic exit, the close-connected mother and daughter centrioles are separated (centrosome disengagement), and this separation allows for centriole duplication in the next cell cycle. When premature centriole disengagement happens as early as the S phase, centrioles are reduplicated, producing numerous centrioles within the same cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been reported that PCM plays a pivotal role not only in microtubule nucleation, but also in modulation of centriole engagement and disengagement both in mitosis and interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Pericentrin (PCNT), a PCM scaffold protein, is critical for ensuring the maintenance of centriole engagement in mitosis. For normal centriole disengagement during mitotic exit, PCNT is specifically cleaved by separase to disassemble the expanded PCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). PLK1-dependent phosphorylation of PCNT is a prerequisite for the cleavage of PCNT by separase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>).</p>
<p>CEP57, a PCM protein, is closely associated with tumor development and variegated aneuploidy syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). As a crucial binding partner of PCNT, CEP57 serves as a PCM organization modulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>); CEP57 depletion causes premature centriole disengagement in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Notably, co-depletion of CEP57 with its paralog CEP57L results in premature centriole disengagement in interphase, resulting in centriole reduplication and disturbed chromosome segregation by amplified centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Thus, centriole engagement in interphase is of much greater importance than that in mitosis for centriole duplication and proper chromosome segregation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying centriole engagement in interphase are largely unknown, although there has been some progress in understanding the basis of centriole engagement in mitosis.</p>
<p>A centrosomal protein of 44 kDa (CEP44) was first identified as a centrosome protein, and probable spindle protein, via complementary proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). It has been reported that CEP44 is a centrosome linker protein that functions in centrosome cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Recent studies also demonstrate that CEP44, as a centriole luminal protein, plays a vital role in the centriole-to-centrosome conversion program by promoting the formation of structurally-intact centrioles with a 9-fold symmetric triplet microtubule structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). In this study, we show that the expression of CEP44 is negatively correlated with breast carcinogenesis. CEP44 ensures centriole duplication once per cell cycle by maintaining centriole engagement with CEP57 and CEP57l1 in interphase. In mitosis, CEP44 is required for spindle integrity and is activated by Aurora A-mediated phosphorylation.</p>

<title>CEP44 is negatively correlated with breast carcinogenesis</title>
<p>Several studies have conclusively demonstrated that certain centrosome proteins act as powerful tumor suppressors or activators(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). The centrosomes in breast cancer cells show characteristic structural and functional aberrations attributed to dysregulation of important centrosome or non-centrosome proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). To reveal the mechanisms underlying intracellular centrosome structure and function in breast cancer cells, we conducted a search for new centrosome proteins that might function in intrinsic mechanisms of centrosome structure and function in breast cancer cells. Intriguingly, MDA-MB-436 cells showed a nearly total loss of CEP44 protein expression and centrosome localization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>). Human CEP44 consists of 390 amino acids (aa) containing two short coiled-coil domains in the middle region and C-terminus (Supplementary Figure S1A). To confirm the specificity of the antibodies against CEP44, CEP44 was depleted by CEP44 siRNAs and detected by immunoblots. Both our homemade and commercial antibodies recognized a band at approximately 45 kDa by immunoblotting in HeLa cells, and this band was specifically abolished by siRNAs targeting CEP44 (Supplementary Figure S1B and C).</p>

<p>Moreover, the expression data obtained from TCGA showed lower expression of CEP44 mRNA in breast cancer patients in comparison with normal individuals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), as well as in breast cancer tissue in comparison with normal tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Consistently, immunohistology analysis of CEP44 expression levels using human breast tissue arrays that included paired tumor and tumor-adjacent tissues showed that CEP44 was expressed at a low level in breast carcinoma samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-G</xref>). Analysis of data from the cancer genome atlas program (TCGA) cohort also revealed that lower CEP44 expression in breast cancer patients was associated with worse overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) outcomes (Figure H-I). In conclusion, these observations suggest a vital role for CEP44 in breast carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>Detailed localization of CEP44 by stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy showed that CEP44 formed a small ring-like structure, enclosed by the circle marked by polyglutamylated and acetylated tubulin, a centriole wall marker (from the top view), and localized tightly along the inner side of the circle (from the side view) (Supplementary Figure 1D-G), suggesting that CEP44 is a luminal centriole protein as previously reported(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) revealed that CEP44 colocalized with C-Nap1, a marker of the centrosome linker at the proximal ends, more closely than it colocalized with CEP164 or GFP-Centrin-3 (both markers of the distal ends of centrioles), suggesting that CEP44 is localized at the proximal halves of centrioles. Co-staining of CEP44 with CEP152 (localized to the proximal halves of centrioles) and CEP192 (localized along the entire walls of centrioles)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) revealed that CEP44 was partly colocalized with CEP192 and encircled by CEP152 (Supplementary Figure S1H), demonstrating that CEP44 is localized to the proximal halves of centrioles.</p>

<p>As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), centrioles are remarkably overduplicated in breast cancer cells such as MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3 and HCC1806 cells, but not in the spontaneously immortalized, non-malignant breast cell line MCF10A (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In particular, centriole overduplication was found to be particularly severe in the MDA-MB-436 line (approximately 80%) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that it CEP44 may play critical role in regulating centriole duplication in breast cancer cells.</p>

<p>To investigate the function of CEP44 in centriole duplication, we performed siRNA knockdown experiments with two CEP44-targeting siRNAs in HeLa cells and observed remarkably increased centriole amplification (more than four centrioles marked by CEP97 or Centrin-3), which was rescued by overexpressing siRNA-resistant CEP44 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-F</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether the increased number of centrioles in MDA-MB-436 cells is attributed a loss of CEP44, centriole numbers in MDA-MB-436 cells were recalculated after CEP44 ectopic overexpression. The fraction of cells showing centriole overduplication significantly decreased to approximately 40% in CEP44 overexpressed MDA-MB-436 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G-H</xref>), demonstrating that CEP44 plays an important role in controlling centriole duplication in MDA-MB-436 cells.</p>

<title>CEP44 maintains centriole engagement in interpahse</title>
<p>To dissect the mechanism of centriole overduplication after CEP44 depletion, we observed centrosome phenotypes. CEP44-depleted cells showed increased distance (&gt;0.75 μm) between newly formed daughter centrioles and old centrioles after centriole duplication in interphase and mitosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref>), indicating that precocious centriole disengagement occurred after CEP44 depletion. To exclude the possibility that the four separated centrioles observed in interphase after CEP44 depletion resulted from failed cytokinesis, we determined the number of old mother centrioles; if cytokinesis failed, then two old mother centrioles were expected. Immunostaining with two markers of old mother centrioles, CEP164 and ODF2, revealed the presence of only one dot marked by CEP164 and ODF2 in ∼70% of CEP44-depleted cells with four separated or amplified centrioles (Supplementary Figure 2A-B). These findings suggest that the separated centrioles were likely caused by premature centriole disengagement instead of cytokinesis failure.</p>

<p>Given that depletion of CEP44 resulted in both centriole disengagement and overduplication (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-F</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3A-C</xref> and Supplementary figure 2C-F), we performed experiments to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these events. Firstly, we used an S phase marker (5-ethynyl-29-deoxyuridine, EdU) and a G2 phase marker (centromere protein F, CENP-F) to observe the occurrence of centriole disengagement and overduplication during particular stages of the cell cycle. In the G1 phase (Edu and CENP-F negative), CEP44-depleted cells and control cells both exhibited two centrioles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-F</xref>). However, CEP44-depleted cells exhibited a remarkably increased percentage of cells with four or more separated centrioles in the S phase (Edu positive and CENP-F negative) and G2 phase (Edu negative and CENP-F positive) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-F</xref>). These results verify that CEP44 depletion results in centriole disengagement as early as the S phase, and thus CEP44 KO cells exhibit four or more separate centrioles. Notably, centriole overduplication also occurred as early as the S phase after CEP44 depletion. However, these results did not reveal the sequential order of centriole disengagement and overduplication caused by CEP44 depletion, as both of these events occurred in the S phase. Therefore, to address the link between these events, centriole dynamics were monitored in cells transfected with GFP-Centrin-3 and H2B-RFP by tracing centrioles with time-lapse microscopy. In control cells, maintenance of centriole engagement was observed after centriole duplication, whereas CEP44 knockout cells showed premature centriole disengagement followed by centriole overduplication per cell cycle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G-H</xref>), suggesting that premature centriole disengagement in interphase contributes to centriole overduplication. It is worth noting that centriole overduplication after premature centriole disengagement resulting from CEP44 depletion generally led to the formation of only one newly formed daughter centriole, instead of excessive centrioles, from each pre-existing centriole (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>).</p>
<p>As the daughter centriole is formed, PCM is recruited to it to ensure initiation of the first stage of centrosome duplication, referred to as centriole-to-centrosome conversion (CCC). It has been reported that CEP44 is required for CCC; therefore, it is conceivable that the CCC of precociously disengaged daughter centrioles was impaired in CEP44-depleted cells in interphase, which may have impaired centriole duplication, rather than inducing centriole overduplication, as shown by CEP44-depleted cells in our assay. To address this paradox, we co-stained γ-tubulin and centrin-3 in CEP44 knockout cells. CEP44-depleted cells with more than 2 γ-tubulin-positive centrioles were quite rare before the G2 phase, but they gradually became more abundant during the G2 phase, during which cells exhibited two dots with strong γ-tubulin staining, and one or two dots with weak γ-tubulin staining. The light dots stained by γ-tubulin most likely represent the disengaged daughter centrioles. After centriole duplication in CEP44-depleted cells, we also detected recruitment of γ-tubulin in the reduplicated centrioles (Supplementary Figure 2G-H). These findings demonstrate that PCM is initially absent in the precociously disengaged daughter centrioles, and PCM components are gradually recruited to their surroundings, primarily during the G2 phase.</p>

<title>CEP44 maintains centriole engagement in interpahse via CEP57 and CEP57L1</title>
<p>To determine the molecular mechanism underlying centriole engagement regulation by CEP44, we searched for proteins capable of interacting with CEP44. Our immunoprecipitation assay showed that there was no interaction between CEP44 and several centriole engagement modulators, including PCNT, Sgo1 and SCC1, but protein-protein interaction was observed between CEP44 and CEP57/CEP57L (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-B</xref>). Further immunoprecipitation assays showed that there was no interaction between CEP44 and several centriole luminal proteins known to be important for centriole duplication, including SAS6, STIL, PLK4 and CEP135. Given that CEP57/CEP57L1 is known to be involved in controlling centriole disengagement in interphase(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), these results suggest that the molecular mechanism by which CEP44 regulates centriole engagement is likely mediated by its interaction with CEP57/CEP57L1. Thus, we further examined the relationship among CEP44, CEP57, and CEP57L1. To determine whether CEP44 affects CEP57/CEP57L1 expression or localization, we first knocked down CEP44 expression in HeLa cells and observed CEP57/CEP57L1 expression and localization. Although depletion of CEP44 by two different siRNAs did not affect CEP57/CEP57L1 expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), localization of CEP57/CEP57L1 at centrosomes was significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-F</xref>). As previously reported(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), we also observed impaired γ-tubulin localization at centrosomes in CEP44-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and Supplementary Figure 3A-B). Conversely, depletion of CEP57 or CEP57L1 did not significantly affect CEP44 localization at centrosomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G-H</xref> and Supplementary Figure 3A). Similar to the expression pattern of CEP44 in breast cancer patients vs normal individuals, the expression data obtained from TCGA showed lower expression of CEP57 mRNA in patients with breast cancer compared with normal individuals (Supplementary Figure 3C), as well as in breast cancer tissue compared with normal tissue (Supplementary Figure 3D). Taken together, these results suggest that CEP44 maintains centriole engagement by regulating CEP57/CEP57L1 localization at the centriole.</p>

<p>Given that depletion of CEP44 led to centriole amplification, we speculated that multipolar spindles in mitotic cells that formed after depletion of CEP44 were attributed to the presence of an elevated number of centrioles. To test our hypothesis, we stained mitotic HeLa cells with centriole marker CEP97 and calculated the centriole number. We observed an increased number of centrioles in multipolar spindles following depletion of CEP44 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E-F</xref> and Supplementary Figure 4F-G). These results indicate that depletion of CEP44 induced centrosome overduplication and abnormal spindle formation.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, CEP44-depleted HeLa cells exhibited a remarkably increased percentage of multipolar spindles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-C</xref> and Supplementary Figure 4C-D). To determine whether centriole disengagement or/and centriole overduplication in interphase led to the increased percentage of multipolar spindles in CEP44 knockout cells, we transfected cells with GFP-centrin-3 and H2B-RFP and observed centrioles and chromosomes by live cell imaging. Based on the pattern of centriole disengagement and overduplication, we grouped cells into three categories in interphase: normal, premature centriole disengagement in interphase without centriole overduplication (pattern 1), and premature centriole disengagement in interphase with centriole overduplication (pattern 2). In control cells, the two paired centrioles were engaged during the entire interphase (normal). In CEP44 knockout cells, paired centrioles disengaged in interphase without centriole overduplication (pattern 1) or with centriole overduplication (pattern 2). Quantification of the percentage of multipolar spindles in cells showing pattern 1 or pattern 2 revealed that CEP44 knockout cells associated with centriole disengagement and centriole overduplication (pattern 2) exhibited the highest frequency of multipolar spindles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G-J</xref>). These results suggest that the formation of multipolar spindles after CEP44 depletion is mainly attributed to centriole overduplication resulting from premature centriole disengagement instead of premature centriole disengagement itself.</p>

<title>Aurora A phosphorylates CEP44 in mitosis</title>
<p>Apart from its localization at centrosomes, CEP44 was also identified as a probable spindle protein in a complementary proteomics study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Thus, we determined whether CEP44 localizes at spindles, and found that it was readily detected at mitotic spindles throughout mitosis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and Supplementary Figure 5A). To determine the pattern of CEP44 protein level changes during the cell cycle, we synchronized HeLa cells with nocodazole treatment. CEP44 protein levels peaked in the enriched M phase population (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), similar to the well-known mitotic regulator cyclin B, indicating that CEP44 plays a critical role in mitosis. Multiple kinases, including Aurora A, PLK1, NEK2A, and CDK1, are localized to the spindle or centrosome and serve to regulate spindle dynamics during mitosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). To test whether these kinases can phosphorylate CEP44 to exert their function in mitosis, we firstly co-overexpressed CEP44 with these mitosis-related kinases in HEK293T cells. The band representing CEP44 was shifted slightly when CEP44 was co-overexpressed with wild-type Aurora A, but not kinase-dead Aurora A (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and Supplementary Figure 5B). However, this shifted band was completely abolished when the cell lysate was pretreated with lambda protein phosphatase (λ-PPase) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Moreover, treatment with Aurora A inhibitor MLN8237 also abolished the shifted CEP44 band at the G2/M phase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref> and Supplementary Figure 5C), indicating that CEP44 is phosphorylated by Aurora A at the G2/M phase. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed three sites that might be phosphorylated by Aurora A: Ser192, Ser324 and Ser342. To confirm the CEP44 phosphorylation site for Aurora A, we constructed unphosphorylatable mutants in which Ser192, Ser324 or Ser342 was replaced by alanine (S192A, S324A and S342A) using site-directed mutagenesis. The shifted band of CEP44-S324A was barely detected in cells co-overexpressing CEP44 and Aurora A (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), demonstrating that CEP44 Ser324 is the site of Aurora-A-mediated phosphorylation. Additionally, Aurora A is known to recognize the consensus sequence R-X-pS/T-L/V for phosphorylation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), and Ser324 of CEP44 accords with the consensus sequence (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>), confirming that Ser324 of CEP44 is phosphorylated by Aurora A. We then raised a phospho-CEP44 antibody against CEP44 Ser324 and verified the specificity of the antibody through peptide competition assays (Supplementary Figure 5D). A band was detected when nocodazole-treated HeLa cell protein samples were incubated with the phospho-CEP44 antibody, but no band was detected from the control HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Moreover, depletion of Aurora A resulted in the loss of the band detected with the phospho-CEP44 antibody in nocodazole-synchronized HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that Aurora A phosphorylates CEP44 at Ser324 in the G2/M phase.</p>

<p>The results showing that CEP44 is highly expressed and phosphorylated during mitosis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-D</xref>) suggest that phosphorylation of CEP44 by Aurora A might alter its protein level. However, the CEP44 protein level did not change significantly after Aurora A knockdown in the G2/M phase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref> and Supplementary Figure 5E). Next, we further examined the effect of Aurora-A-mediated phosphorylation on CEP44 localization. Immunostaining microscopy showed that mitotic Aurora A-depleted cells exhibited remarkably increased fluorescence intensity of CEP44 at the mitotic spindle pole, but less fluorescence intensity at the spindle, compared to the control cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I-J</xref>). This abnormal distribution of CEP44 in mitosis after Aurora A depletion was also detected in HeLa cells after treatment with MLN8237 (Supplementary Figure 5F-H), suggesting that Aurora A-mediated phosphorylation of CEP44 regulates its localization between the spindle pole and spindle.</p>

<title>CEP44 phosphorylation by Aurora A maintains spindle integrity</title>
<p>To clarify the physiological function of CEP44 and its phosphorylation at the spindle, we immunostained mitotic HeLa cells with α-tubulin to label spindle microtubules. Depletion of CEP44 significantly decreased the intensity of spindle microtubule staining, which was rescued after re-introduction of CEP44 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-B</xref> and Supplementary Figure 6A-B), indicating that CEP44 regulates spindle microtubule stability. This finding suggests that CEP44 phosphorylation may be responsible for spindle microtubule stability, because CEP44 is phosphorylated in the G2/M phase. To determine whether CEP44 phosphorylation affects microtubule stability, CEP44 phosphorylation was mimicked in interphase HeLa cells by overexpressing phosphorylatable (CEP44-Flag S324D and S324E) or unphosphorylatable (CEP44-Flag S324A) mutants. Microtubule stability was not dramatically altered by overexpression of the phosphorylatable or unphosphorylatable mutants. However, after treatment with nocodazole for 5 min, HeLa cells overexpressing CEP44-Flag S324A exhibited more un-stabilized microtubules in comparison with HeLa cells overexpressing CEP44-Flag wild-type, S324D or S324E (Supplementary Figure 6C), suggesting that CEP44 phosphorylation plays an important role in controlling microtubule stability. Similarly, in mitotic HeLa cells, ectopic overexpression of CEP44-Flag S324A remarkably impaired spindle microtubule stability (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C-E</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate the critical role of CEP44 phosphorylation in maintenance of microtubule stability and spindle structure. Notably, we found that CEP44-depleted cells showed weakened localization of γ-tubulin at the spindle (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F-G</xref>), which negatively affected spindle structure stability.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study reveals that centriole luminal protein CEP44 is a master regulator of centriole disengagement in interphase via its interaction with CEP57/CEP57L1, and its depletion results in premature centriole disengagement, centriole overduplication and multipolar spindle formation. Additionally, CEP44 is a spindle-localized protein that ensures spindle integrity, and this localization is modulated by Aurora A phosphorylation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that CEP44 maintains correct spindle formation through its localization at the centrosome and spindle (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig8" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 8.</label>
<caption><p>Schematic of the role of CEP44 in the cell cycle. In wild-type HeLa cells, CEP44 is localized at the proximal halves of the centriole lumen. For centriole duplication during the S phase, CEP44 exists in the lumen of the procentrioles to maintain disengagement between the old centrioles and the procentrioles. During mitosis, CEP44 translocates to the spindle due to Aurora A phosphorylation at serine 324 to ensure spindle integrity. After depletion of CEP44, premature centriole disengagement occurs following centriole duplication in the S phase, which licenses centriole overduplication as early as the S phase. The supernumerary centrioles result in multipolar spindle formation during mitosis. In addition, a lack of CEP44 localization at the spindle impairs spindle integrity, leading to an increase in the percentage of disorganized spindles. Notably, after Aurora A depletion or inhibition, unphosphorylated CEP44 fails to translocate to spindle microtubules and accumulates at the spindle pole, leading to impaired spindle integrity.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>In contrast to the effects of co-depletion of PCM proteins CEP57 and CEP57L1, depletion of CEP44 alone was sufficient to result in premature centriole disengagement in interphase. A previous study reported that depletion of CEP44 impaired centrosome localization of PCM proteins, such as CEP152 and CEP192, which are required for centriole duplication(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). However, we observed centriole overduplication caused by premature centriole disengagement in CEP44-depleted cells, indicating that the effect of premature centriole disengagement in interphase, which accelerates centriole overduplication, overrides the effect of defective PCM recruitment (impaired CCC), which impedes centriole duplication, in the context of CEP44 depletion. These findings suggest that the residual PCM around prematurely disengaged centrioles is sufficient to induce centriole duplication after CEP44 deficiency. Collectively, our findings confirm that centriole disengagement is a critical prerequisite for a subsequent round of centriole duplication, demonstrating the fundamental role of centriole engagement/disengagement in modulating centriole duplication.</p>
<p>The centriole number is controlled based on two distinct rules to coordinate multiple cellular processes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>); the first rule ensures that centrosomes duplicate once and only once per cell cycle (cell cycle control), and the second rule stipulates that only one progeny centriole may form adjacent to each parental centriole in the S phase (copy number control). In contrast to encouraging recent progress in understanding copy number control of centriole duplication in the S phase, the mechanisms licensing only one centriole duplication cycle within a cell cycle are not well understood. However, our study reveals the great importance of CEP44 in controlling the centriole number during cell cycle progression, providing important insight into the detailed mechanisms underlying centriole duplication.</p>
<p>It also has been reported that CEP44 functions in centrosome cohesion by stabilizing rootletin(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Centrosome cohesion is mediated by a loose connection between the proximal ends of the two parental centrioles, which is known as the G1-G2 tether (GGT). GGT assembly occurs in the G1 phase, which occurs simultaneously with, or just after, dissolution of the centriole engagement component termed the S-M linker (SML). Therefore, it has been speculated that GGT assembly depends on SML dissociation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), but few studies have assessed the relationship between the SML and GGT. Apart from the function of CEP44 in centrosome cohesion, we found that CEP44 is involved in centriole engagement, suggesting the existence of some relationship between the SML and GGT, and additional studies will likely further illuminate the close relationship between the SML and GGT.</p>
<p>The localization and function of CEP44 led us to speculate that CEP44 may be a part of the SML. Previous studies found that SML functionality depends on the SAS-6–ANA2 complex(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) and suggested that cohesin might constitute part of the SML(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). However, the composition of the SML remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that CEP44 does not interact with the SAS6-STIL complex or cohesin (data not shown). Based on our results, it is plausible that the luminal protein CEP44 in the proximal part of the procentriole interacts with PCM protein CEP57/CEP57L1 in pre-existing centrioles to maintain centriole engagement, indicating that CEP44 is a potential SML component. Future studies aimed at determining whether CEP44 is a component of the SML will shed new light on the molecular mechanisms regulating centriole engagement.</p>
<p>We found that CEP44 is highly expressed in G2/M phase HeLa cells and nearly absent in MDA-MB-436 breast cancer cells, indicating that the protein level of CEP44 is precisely modulated during different stages of the cell cycle and in specific cell types. However, Aurora A-mediated phosphorylation of CEP44 had no effect on the protein level of CEP44 in our assay (Supplementary Figure 5E). It is possible that epigenetic mechanisms or post-translational modifications function to regulate the protein level of CEP44.</p>
<p>Centrosome proteins have been reported to represent potent tumor suppressors or activators, because centrosome amplification is extremely common in a wide range of malignancies, including breast, prostate, ovarian, and lung tumors, and it is closely linked to tumor growth and a worse prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Preclinical research has shown that extra centrosomes can directly cause tumor initiation, at least partly by counteracting centrosome functionality-decreasing mutations or by increasing chromosome instability through transiently formed abnormal spindles that result in missegregation because of deficiency in mitotic kinetochore-spindle attachments(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Therefore, due to insufficient CEP44, the presence of supernumerary centrosomes and abnormal spindle structure may compensate for impaired centrosome functionality of CCC during breast cancer initiation. Thus far, anti-mitotic drugs such as Aurora A and Plk1 inhibitors have largely failed in clinical contexts due to their low efficacy and serious side effects(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Notably, defective mitosis targeted by therapeutic strategies is always induced by centrosome amplification; therefore, it should be noted whether patients show centrosome amplification, and whether these inhibitors affect centrosome amplification, to ensure the achievement of a precise anti-tumor effect.</p>

<title>Cell synchronization and drug treatment</title>
<p>Synchronized HeLa cells in mitosis were treated with 100 ng/ml Nocodazole for 16-18 h. For double-thymidine blocking, HeLa cells were firstly subjected to 2.5 mM thymidine for 18-24 h, then released for 12 h, and subsequently blocked again for 18-24 h. To identify the kinase of CEP44, HeLa cells were mock-treated or treated with a kinase inhibitor: 100 nM MLN8237 (an Aurora A inhibitor) for 24 h, 100 nM BI2536 (a PLK1 inhibitor) for 4 h or 25 μM Roscovitine (a CDK5 inhibitor) for 18 h.</p>

<title>Gene silencing by siRNA</title>
<p>All siRNAs used in this study were purchased from GenePharma. CEP57- and CEP57L1-siRNAs were designed according to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). The siRNA sequences are shown in Supplementary Table. The siRNA transfection procedure was performed for 48-72 h based on the manufacturer’s protocols. For the rescue assay, six silent mutations were introduced into the CEP44 sequence to construct siRNA-resistant CEP44 (resCEP44) (5’-GCTATAGTACAGCATCAT-3’ mutated to 5’-GATACAGCACCGCTTCATC-3’). HeLa cells were transfected with resCEP44 for 48 h after 24 h siRNA transfection.</p>

<title>λ-PPase treatment and Phos-tag assay</title>
<p>Cells cultured in a 35 mm dish were rinsed twice with tris-buffered saline (TBS) (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) for collection, followed by lysis with RIPA buffer (1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.4) on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 °C, the lysate supernatants were mixed with 10× NEBuffer Pack for Protein MetalloPhosphatases (PMP), 10× MnCl<sub>2</sub>, and 400 U λ-PPase to react at 30 °C for 30 min, and quenched by the addition of SDS loading buffer. To analyze phosphorylated protein samples, Phos-tag gel electrophoresis (10% separating gel) was applied based on the manufacturer’s protocol (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). The gel was supplemented with 50 μM MnCl<sub>2</sub> and 25 μM Phos-tag Acrylamide AAL-107 and polymerized overnight. Samples were run at constant current of 30 mA per gel until the bromophenol blue arrived at the bottom of the separating gel. Before transfer of proteins, the gels were washed in 1 mM EDTA-containing transfer buffer for 30 min and then soaked in transfer buffer without EDTA for 20 min before the proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes for western blotting.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>The RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data was obtained from TCGA. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for overall survival analyses and recurrence free survival. Overall survival was defined as time from the first treatment after primary diagnosis to death of any cause. Recurrence free survival was defined as time from the first treatment after primary diagnosis to death or recurrence of any cause. The target regions were drawn around the fluorescent dots and measured using ImageJ software (NIH). Either a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test was applied using GraphPad Prism 5 (version 5.01; GraphPad, US) to compare differences between groups. The results are presented as the means ± S.E.M, and p &lt; 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference, unless otherwise stated.</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study investigates the role of the centrosomal protein CEP44 in centriole duplication and mitotic spindle formation. While the analysis of CEP44 mitotic phosphorylation and spindle recruitment is <bold>solid</bold>, the characterization of CEP44's role at centrioles is <bold>incomplete</bold> and would benefit from additional controls and analyses. Since the work links CEP44 reduced expression to poor survival in breast cancer patients, it is of interest not only to cell biologists but also to cancer researchers.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Zhang et al. describe novel roles for the centriolar protein CEP44, namely that it is required for centriole engagement (and thus inhibition of centriole reduplication) and that it promotes microtubule stability. While a function of CEP44 in centriole engagement is somehow convincingly shown, the data do not support a role for CEP44 in microtubule stabilization.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The finding that centriole engagement relies on CEP44 is novel and of great interest to the centriole field. Interestingly, the authors correlate reduced CEP44 expression levels with the occurrence of breast carcinoma, which makes this study also very interesting for a broad audience.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The paper has important findings, but unfortunately, the main claims are only partially supported.</p>
<p>1. The role of CEP44 in microtubule stability is not clear from the presented data:</p>
<p>2. Several figure parts are not properly labelled.</p>
<p>3. Several of the experiments (WBs) likely miss proper controls: How did the authors detect proteins that run at very similar sizes: 55 kDa (alpha-tubulin), 44 kDa (Cep44), and 57 kDa (Cep57 and Cep57L)? The loading control needs to be detected in the same lane as the protein of interest. Did the authors strip and reprobe membranes? If so, this needs to be indicated and included in the methods section.</p>
<p>4. It is not clear how such a low CEP44-FLAG expression (Fig. 5A) can rescue a CEP44 KO.</p>

<p>Zhang and Wei, et al. investigated the role of a centrosomal protein, CEP44, in regulating centrosomes and spindle integrity, with a focus on processes that may be dysregulated in breast cancer. The authors found that a breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-436, lacks CEP44 protein and has amplified centrioles. CEP44 expression is reduced in samples from breast cancer patients. By super-resolution microscopy, the authors localize CEP44 to the proximal inner lumen of centrioles, as has also been previously shown by another group (Atorino et al 2020). Next, the authors investigate the role of CEP44 in centrosome regulation. They found that loss of CEP44 in HeLa cells results in extra puncta of CEP97 or Centrin-3, while ectopic overexpression of CEP44 in MDA-MB-436 cells reduces the number of CEP97 foci. Only one of the excess puncta in a CEP44-depleted HeLa cell recruits CEP164 or ODF2, indicating that extra foci were not the result of cytokinesis failure. In G1, most (~80%) of CEP44-depleted cells have 2 centrin foci, while in G2, a small population (~20%) have more than 4 centrin foci, and gamma-tubulin is recruited in foci in G2. The authors were able to observe centriole disengagement and amplification using live cell imaging. The authors propose that CEP44 acts in regulating centriole engagement by recruiting CEP57 and CEP57L1 to centrioles. The authors made CEP44 knockout cell lines using CRISPR and found that loss of CEP44 results in multipolar spindles, correlated with an increase in centriole amplification. Finally, the authors investigate the role of CEP44 at the mitotic spindle. The authors find that CEP44 localizes to spindles and is phosphorylated by Aurora A at G2/M on Ser324. Phosphorylation of CEP44 is required for its proper distribution between centrosomes and the spindle and microtubule stability within both spindles and interphase microtubules. Together, these studies shed light on the roles of CEP44 within centrosomes and spindles and will be of interest to cell biologists and cancer biologists studying cell division and centrosomes.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are only partially supported. The analyses could be improved to address the concerns about the major conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript by Zhang et al. analyzes the function of the centrosomal protein CEP44 in centriole duplication and in the formation of the mitotic spindle. The first part addresses the role of CEP44 at centrioles. Using mostly RNAi-mediated depletion in cell lines and in some cases KO cells, the authors find increased centriole numbers in depleted cells and, based on quantification of centrioles stained with various centriole markers as well as live imaging, conclude that this is due to premature centriole disengagement and overduplication. The second part, which is largely independent of the first, focuses on the role of CEP44 in the mitotic spindle. The authors find that CEP44 is phosphorylated in mitosis in an Aurora A-dependent manner and identify the phosphorylation site, which controls CEP44 spindle localization and functions in maintaining spindle integrity.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>
The manuscript makes the interesting observation that reduced expression of CEP44 is observed in breast cancer and correlated with poor survival in patients.</p>
<p>
The analysis of mitotic phosphorylation including the identification of the modified site and its role in spindle recruitment is interesting and useful.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>
The authors seem to largely ignore previously published work that contrasts with the findings presented in the current study. The previous work found a role of CEP44 in centriole formation and centrosome conversion and observed reduced centriole numbers in depleted cells, whereas the current study claims the opposite, a role in centriole engagement that leads to overduplication and increased centriole number in depleted cells. However, the supporting evidence is not strong enough, especially in light of the previous work. Considering that CEP44 depletion also disrupts mitosis, which could affect centriole numbers by failed segregation/division, a more careful analysis in synchronized cultures would be needed. Also, cell cycle analysis would be required to rule out cell cycle effects in CEP44-depleted cells, which could also explain altered centriole numbers. Moreover, the quality of the imaging is often not sufficient to support the claims.</p>
<p>
The second part is largely disconnected from the first and reads as if it was a separate study. There is no attempt to integrate both parts. For example, the second part seems to largely focus on normal bipolar spindles, even though the first part reveals multipolarity as a phenotype after CEP44 knockdown. It remains unclear if the spindle defects are due to centriole defects, defective spindle microtubule stability/organization, or both, and whether the centriole-localized or spindle-localized CEP44 is involved.</p>
<p>Another weak aspect is that neither for RNAi nor for KO cells the authors show that CEP44 is depleted at centrioles and to what extent. This is only shown in cell extract.</p>
