<title>Abstract</title><p>The rapid and sustained proliferation in cancer cells requires accelerated protein synthesis. Accelerated protein synthesis and disordered cell metabolism in cancer cells greatly increase the risk of translation errors. ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) is a recently discovered mechanism for resolving ribosome collisions caused by frequent translation stalls. The role of the RQC pathway in cancer initiation and progression remains controversial and confusing. In this study, we investigated the pathogenic role of mitochondrial stress-induced protein carboxyl-terminal terminal alanine and threonine tailing (msiCAT-tailing) in glioblastoma (GBM), which is a specific RQC response to translational arrest on the outer mitochondrial membrane. We found that msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial proteins frequently exist in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Ectopically expressed msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha (ATP5α) protein increases the mitochondrial membrane potential and blocks mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) formation/opening. These changes in mitochondrial properties confer resistance to staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis in GBM cells. Therefore, msiCAT-tailing can promote cell survival and migration, while genetic and pharmacological inhibition of msiCAT-tailing can prevent the overgrowth of GBM cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Proteins are the molecular basis of life activities. Excessive protein synthesis is particularly important in rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells. To cope with this demand, cancer cells extensively regulate the initiation, elongation and termination of their protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). However, increased protein translation also proportionally accumulates the likelihood of translation errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Combined with the significant changes in cellular metabolism, such as energy fluctuations and redox state shifts, how to respond to various sudden abnormal events during the protein translation process becomes essential. Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) is a recently discovered class of mechanisms in eukaryotic cells that sense and rescue ribosome decelerations, stalls, and even collisions that occur during translation elongation or termination steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>RQC consists of a sequence of molecular events. The first is that the ZNF598/RACK1 complex recognizes the characteristic 40S-40S interface formed by collided ribosomes and promotes the ubiquitination of specific 40S subunit proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Subsequently, the ASC-1 complex dissociates the leading collided ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Events that occur thereafter include: ribosomal subunit splitting and recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), modification of the nascent peptide chains through the C-terminal alanine and threonine (CAT-tailing) mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), release of CAT-tailed products from the 60S subunits by ANKZF1/VMS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), and degradation of aberrant peptides by the Ltn1/VCP/NEMF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The biological significance of the CAT-tailed translation products generated in the RQC remains unclear. On one side of the coin, CAT-tails can push lysine residues out of the ribosome exit channel to achieve Ltn1-mediated ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), or promote degradation of faulty nascent peptide chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>); on the other side, CAT-tailed proteins are prone to form detergent-insoluble aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). In addition, depending on the nature and subcellular localization of the original target, CAT-tailed proteins may also have unique functions, but this is currently poorly understood. Importantly, CAT-tailed proteins have been found in a variety of human neurodegenerative diseases and are believed to play important roles in their pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>The increased abnormalities in translation have been found in cancer cells, such as stop codon readthrough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), frame-shifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), and oxidative stress-induced ribosome stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), indicating the possible involvement of the RQC pathway. However, despite the detection of CAT-tail modification on mitochondrial proteins caused by impaired RQC in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), there is still a lack of mechanistic studies on the role of RQC factors in cancer biology. The expression of many RQC factors (<italic>e.g.</italic>, ASCC3, ABCE1, ANKZF1 and VCP) has been shown to be dysregulated in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Intriguingly, different RQC factors, or even the same factor, may exhibit completely opposite functions in oncogenesis and tumor suppression under distinct conditions. Inhibition of ABCE1, ASCC3 and VCP inhibits cancer cell growth and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), whereas inhibition of NEMF/Clbn and ZNF598 may promote cancer growth and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). This suggests that the role of RQC factors in cancer cells is sophisticated and highly genetic and environmental context dependent. A recent study investigated the mechanism of ANKZF1 in mitochondrial proteostasis and its impact on the malignant progression of GBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). However, the nonphysiologically mitochondria-targeted GFP was used in the study to induce the matrix proteotoxicity, and the role of endogenous mitochondrial proteins in this process remains unclear.</p>
<p>The co-translational import defects triggered by mitochondrial stress induce CAT-tailing not only on the mitochondrial C-I30 protein (complex-I 30 kD subunit protein, also known as NDUFS3), but also widely on other nuclear genome-encoded mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). How these mitochondrial stress-induced CAT-tailed (msiCAT-tail) proteins participate in and influence the core of mitochondrial biology has not yet been studied. Since CAT-tailing imparts new properties to target proteins, it is likely to contribute to some unique characteristics of cancer cell mitochondria, such as mitochondrial hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) and high mitochondrial membrane potential-related resistance to drug-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Mitochondrial membrane potential is formed by the proton (H<sup>+</sup>) concentration gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane. It is generated and maintained by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), in which H<sup>+</sup> ions are shuttled through the electron transport chain composed of four complexes (I to IV), resulting in the accumulation of H<sup>+</sup> in the intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). ATP synthase (complex-V) then harnesses the energy from the H<sup>+</sup> gradient by promoting its influx into the mitochondrial matrix and produces ATPs in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Despite increased metabolic demands, many cancer cells have reduced OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). It remains unclear how cancer cells maintain or even increase mitochondrial membrane potential in the absence of OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we focused on msiCAT-tailing modification on the mitochondrial ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha (ATP5α). We observed that msiCAT-tailed ATP5α is present in GBM. The short-tailed ATP5α can incorporate into the ATP synthase, increase mitochondrial membrane potential, and inhibit the assembly and opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). Therefore, the presence of msiCAT-tailed ATP5α enhances the resistance of GBM cells to staurosporine (STS)- and temozolomide (TMZ)-induced programmed cell death and promotes cancer cell survival, proliferation, and migration. Conversely, inhibition of msiCAT-tailing suppresses cancer cell growth and resensitizes GBM cells to apoptosis. Our study elucidates the role of CAT-tailed mitochondrial proteins in cancer cells, reveals the importance of the RQC pathway in cancer biology, and indicates that components and products in the RQC pathway may be effective therapeutic targets for GBM.</p>

<title>Presence of mitochondrial stress-induced protein carboxyl-terminal terminal alanine and threonine tailing (msiCAT-tailing) in glioblastoma cells</title>
<p>Dysregulation of individual factors associated with ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) has been described in a variety of cancer cells such as prostate cancer, adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer and colon cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), but an overall characterization of the RQC pathway genes has not been performed. We first performed differential expression analysis using the transcriptomic data between 153 glioblastoma (GBM) patients and 206 healthy controls from public datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). We found that compared with normal subjects, the expression levels of genes related with the RQC pathway such as <italic>ABCE1</italic>, <italic>ASCC1</italic>, <italic>ASCC2</italic>, <italic>ASCC3</italic>, <italic>RACK1</italic>, and <italic>VCP</italic> were significantly elevated (logFC &gt; 1; adj.P.Val &lt; 0.001) in GBM cells, whereas <italic>ANKZF1</italic> was the only gene whose expression level (logFC = -0.43, adj.P.Val = 0.0005) was downregulated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). Changes in these genes imply activation of the RQC pathway and accumulation of CAT-tailed protein. The msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial protein C-I 30 (complex-I 30 kD subunit, also known as NDUFS3) was previously discovered in HeLa (cervical cancer) cells as the endogenous substrate of RQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). We wanted to know whether C-I 30 and other msiCAT-tailed proteins are indeed present in GBM cells. Patient-derived GBM stem cells (pGSCs), but not normal neural stem cells (NSCs), displayed several msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial proteins, such as C-I30, COX4 (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4), and ATP5⍺ (ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha). In line with the detectable msiCAT-tailed proteins in pGSCs, we also found elevated levels of NEMF (nuclear export mediator factor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) but decreased expression of ANKZF1 (ankyrin repeat and zinc-finger peptidyl tRNA hydrolase 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), indicating an increase in CAT-tailing activation, which is similar to the results of bioinformatics analysis in GBMs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In the following experiments, we selected two GBM cell lines, SF268 (labeled as SF cells in figures) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>) and GSC827 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) with more stem cell characteristics, and two control cell lines SVG p12 (abbreviated as SVG) and Normal Human Astrocytes E6/E7/hTERT (abbreviated as NHA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). We also examined their expression of RQC proteins (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). Similar to the results with patient-derived GSC cells, we also observed decreased ANKZF1 expression and increased ASCC3 in GSC827 and SF268 cells. Although there was no obvious change in NEMF expression, we found modification on NEMF (indicated by *) in GSC827 cells, hinting its possible functional changes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). In line with this, we used non-stop protein translation system to induce CAT-tailing on Flag tagged β-globin reporter in GBM and control cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). We are surprised to observe that the translation rate of GBM cells for normal proteins (β-globin-control) actually decreased compared to control cells, the RQC system in GBM cells could produce significantly more CAT-tailed protein (β-globin-nonstop); and this process can be inhibited by the CAT-tailing elongation inhibitor anisomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>We next wanted to know the biological consequences of generating these CAT-tailed mitochondrial proteins. The heterogeneity of CAT-tailing toward substrates and tail lengths makes it difficult to study the function of specific CAT-tail-modified proteins. In our previous study, adding the AT repeat tails to the C-terminus of mitochondrial proteins can effectively simulate a CAT-tail like reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Among the CAT-tailed mitochondrial targets we found, ATP5⍺ is one of those with the highest abundance in functional mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) and has additional critical roles in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). We therefore wondered what unique functions CAT-tailed ATP5⍺ might provide. To test it, in control (SVG and NHA) and GBM (SF268 and GSC827) cell lines, we overexpressed ATP5⍺ proteins having artificial CAT-tails: ATP5α-AT3 containing three alanine-threonine repeats and ATP5α-AT20 that contains containing twenty alanine-threonine repeats. Consistent with previous observations, long CAT-tailed but not short CAT-tailed proteins, has post-translational modifications and detergent-insoluble aggregates that appear as slower migrating bands and high molecular weight smeared signals in protein electrophoresis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Notably, compared with the control cells (SVG, NHA), the GBM cell lines (GSC827, SF268) expressed more ATP5α-AT20 proteins, indicating that GBM cells have more capability to deal with protein aggregation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, ratios). In addition, cytological analysis tells us that the short AT tail does not significantly affect subcellular localization. Like the tailless ATP5α protein, ATP5α-AT3 is mainly located in mitochondria, while a significant proportion of ATP5α-AT20 appears in the cytoplasm near mitochondria and forms protein aggregates (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). Moreover, the proportion of cells having protein aggregates was highest in GSC cells, which are the most malignant (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>). Importantly, not only exogenously expressed tailed proteins, endogenous ATP5α also formed protein aggregates attached to mitochondria (outer membrane) in some GBM cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). Taken together, we found evidence showing the existence of RQC dysregulation and msiCAT-tailing occurring in GBM cells.</p>

<title>msiCAT-tailed ATP5α elevates mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm)</title>
<p>Cancer cells can keep their mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) stable, sometimes even elevated, while their respiration is reduced. We first confirmed this phenomenon in patient-derived pGSC cells, which had a higher membrane potential but lower ATP production than control NSC cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). We also tested our GBM cell lines (GSC827, SF268) and the control cell line NHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>).

<p>We next wanted to determine how msiCAT-tailed proteins significantly impact mitochondrial functions. We ectopically expressed ATP5⍺-AT3 and ATP5⍺-AT20 (Flag tagged) proteins in GBM and control cell lines. We found that they both can increase mitochondrial membrane potential in GBM but not NHA cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Intriguingly, Blue Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) analysis indicated that CAT tails of different lengths exert distinct effects on mitochondria. ATP5α-AT3 proteins were incorporated into mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, while ATP5α-AT20 proteins formed high molecular weight complexes or existed in monomers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). As expected, long CAT-tails form protein aggregates, which may cause proteostasis stress in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We next utilized the Agilent Seahorse Cell Mitochondrial Stress Test to measure key parameters of mitochondrial respiration by directly measuring the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of cells. Interestingly, we found that the expression of both ATP5α-AT3 and ATP5α-AT20 can impair mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in decreased ATP synthesis, basal respiration, and maximum respiration rates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>). Collectively, these data indicated that expression of CAT-tailed ATP5α protein significantly affects mitochondrial function. In comparison, short tails are more likely to directly influence the function of ATP synthase, whereas long tails may cause mitochondrial proteostasis stress thereby indirectly affecting mitochondrial respiration.</p>

<title>msiCAT-tailed ATP5α regulates mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening</title>
<p>In addition to its primary function of generating ATP, recent studies have implicated F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub> ATP synthase may be an integral component of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). If MPTP is affected by CAT-tailed components such as ATP5α, this may cause dysregulation of its open-close state or assembly. Therefore, in the following experiments, we investigated how msiCAT-tailing modulates the status of MPTP. By comparing the MPTP status in GBM cells and control cells, we found that MPTP in GSC827 cells is largely in a close state. Interestingly, the CAT-tailing inhibitor anisomycin can effectively eliminate the endogenous ATP5α aggregation (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3B</xref>) and promote the opening of MPTP in GSC827 cells, illustrated by the reduced Calcein signal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Short-term opening of MPTP promote the efflux of proton, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and other signaling molecules from the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> retention capacity (CRC) measurements have been used to calculate the amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions needed to open MPTP, directly indicating their open-close states. We observed that GSC827 cells establish higher CRC than NHA cells, and anisomycin pre-treatment and NEMF knockdown significantly reduce the CRC, suggesting the opening of MPTP in GBM cells upon elimination of CAT-tailed proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine whether the CAT-tail modifications on ATP5α can modulate the open-close state of MPTP, we compared the effects of artificial AT repeat tails on MPTP in GBM cells. Interestingly, we found that the short AT tail (AT3) can inhibit the functional opening of MPTP, while the long AT tail (AT20) has a weaker effect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>), which may be explained by their differential involvement in ATP synthase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). To gain a glimpse into the role of ATP5α protein with different msiCAT-tails, we examined the interaction between ATP5α and two known MPTP components Cyp-D and ANT2; however, no direct interaction was detected (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>). Interestingly, we found that Cyp-D expression is reduced in varying proportions, when ATP5α-AT3 or ATP5α-AT20 is ectopically expressed, hinting reduced MPTP formation (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D</xref>). We then used BN-PAGE to detect the complex composed of ANT1/2. We found that the presence of both ATP5α-AT3 and -AT20 significantly changed the pattern of ANT1/2-containing complexes, with the expected bands disappearing (indicated by *) and aggregates forming at high-molecular weight positions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). It is worth mentioning that the ANT1/2 complex is in close proximity to ATP synthase in the electrophoresis, supporting the hypothesis that ATP synthase may be part of the MPTP supercomplex. In summary, we conclude that msiCAT-tailed ATP5α proteins, especially the short-tailed (AT3) ones, incorporate into the ATP synthase and regulate the MPTP status.</p>

<title>msiCAT-tailing promotes GBM cells migration and enhances their resistance to apoptosis</title>
<p>The high mitochondrial membrane potential and tightened MPTP conferred by msiCAT-tailed ATP5α and other mitochondrial proteins may make cells more adaptable to stresses. Therefore, we next wanted to know how the msiCAT-tailing mechanism affects GBM cells at the cellular level. In the MTT assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>), we observed that overexpression of the short AT repeat tail (AT3) and the long AT repeat tail (AT20) fused with ATP5α significantly promotes GBM cell but not NHA cell viability (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Further, in <italic>in vitro</italic> transwell cell migration assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>) and wound healing experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), we observed that that GBM cells overexpressing CAT-tailed ATP5α showed stronger cell invasion ability and faster wound healing, indicating faster cell migration occurs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4A</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4B</xref>). It is worth mentioning that in ANKZF1 knockdown U87 and U251 cell lines, the accumulation of abnormal mitoGFP can lead to a decrease in cellular adaptability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We speculate that this is because the mitochondria of different cell lines have different adaptability to proteostasis stress. One support was that in the initial experiments, we did not find that the mild expression of ATP5α-AT3 and ATP5α-AT20 induces strong mitochondrial proteotoxic responses, such as significantly up-regulated <italic>LONP1</italic>, <italic>mtHSP70</italic> and <italic>HSP60</italic> mRNA level (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition to this, we found that GBM cells are more resistant to staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by reduced TUNEL-positive cells (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4D</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4E</xref>) and significantly weakened cleavage of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) proteins (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). To confirm whether CAT-tailed ATP5α proteins contribute to resistance to apoptosis, we further overexpressed these proteins in GBM cells. We found that both short tail (ATP5α-AT3) and long tail (ATP5α-AT20) can effectively enhance cells resistance to STS-induced apoptosis, proving that protein CAT-tailation caused may be closely related to tumorigenesis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that overexpression of artificial CAT-tailed ATP5α proteins, also enhance the resistance of GBM cells to temozolomide (TMZ)-induced apoptosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Combining these data, we demonstrate that RQC-induced CAT-tailing on ATP5α protein may contribute to the resistance of GBM cells to drug-induced apoptosis.</p>

<title>Inhibiting the RQC pathway impedes GBM cell progression</title>
<p>Through previous studies, we confirmed the importance of the RQC pathway mediated msiCAT-tailing mechanism mediated for GBM progression. Therefore, inhibiting the RQC pathway may be a potentially effective means to combat GBM. To test this hypothesis, we first treated patient-derived pGSC cells with the CAT-tailing inhibitor anisomycin. We found that the pGSC cell lines were more sensitive to anisomycin treatment than control NSC cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Similarly, by knocking down NEMF (sgNEMF) or overexpressing ANKZF1 (oeANZKF1) in GBM cell line (SF268), we found that genetically inhibiting the RQC pathway can also inhibit GBM growth (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Notably, the growth of NHA cells as a control was also inhibited, indicating that these two genes are critical factors in general cell proliferation (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>). The RQC pathway has a more significant impact on the migration ability of GBM cells.

<p>Next, we studied the effect of RQC pathway on the anti-apoptosis of GBM cells. The first thing we discovered were changes in mitochondrial function. Previously, genetic inhibition of the RQC pathway (sgNEMF or oeANKZF1) could significantly reduce the membrane potential of GBM mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>); anisomycin treatment also has the same effect here (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). We also found that in GSC cells, anisomycin treatment could promote MPTP opening, but not in NHA cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Correspondingly, inhibition of the RQC pathway with anisomycin rendered GBM cell lines more sensitive to STS-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by more PARP-1 cleavage and TUNEL-positive signals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>). Similarly, genetic inhibition of the RQC pathway could achieve the similar sensitization (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5D</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5E</xref>). Finally, we found that the RQC pathway also plays a role in TMZ-induced cell death. For example, co-treatment of anisomycin and TMZ significantly inhibited the survival of GBM cell lines (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>) and effectively inhibited the size of spheroids formed by GSC cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5K</xref>). In conclusion, the activity of the RQC pathway is important for GBM progression, including their proliferation, migration, and survival upon induction of apoptosis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we mainly explored the role of RQC and its products, especially the mitochondrial proteins modified by the msiCAT-tailing mechanism, in cancer cells. We used GBM cells as a model to conduct research, but this does not mean that these phenomena only occur in GBMs. They may be widely present in the occurrence and development of cancer. Here, we focused on msiCAT-tail modifications on the mitochondrial protein ATP5⍺. In our model, due to the specific function of mitochondrial ATP synthase itself, msiCAT tail-modified proteins endow GBM cells with several unique properties, such as maintaining or increasing mitochondrial membrane potential despite reducing ATP production, promoting the survival and migration of GBM cells, and providing resistance to STS-induced apoptosis, and this last point may be related to regulating the open-close state of MPTP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). These characteristics promote the malignancy of tumor cells, thus inhibiting the RQC pathway may be used as an effective adjuvant treatment to complement existing chemotherapy methods. In addition, studying the behavior of ATP synthase in cancer is also of special significance. In carcinogenesis, ATP synthase is often found re-localized to the plasma membrane and is known as the ectopic ATP synthase complex (eATP synthase). These eATP synthases have catalytic activity and can promote the generation of ATP in the extracellular environment to establish a suitable tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). eATP synthase was shown to be first assembled in mitochondria and then delivered to the cell surface via microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). However, what kind of ATP synthase can be delivered to the plasma membrane is not clear. Studying the localization of CAT-tailed eATP synthase in the future may provide us with clues.</p>

<caption><title>A working model of how msiCAT-tail modified ATP5⍺ protein affects mitochondrial function in GBM cells</title>
<p>In normal cells, the ATP5⍺ protein encoded by the nuclear genome enters the mitochondrial matrix through a co-translational import mechanism through the TOM/TIM complex and is subsequently assembled into ATP synthase (Left Side). In GBM cells, the CAT-tailed ATP5⍺ protein forms insoluble aggregates close to the outer membrane of mitochondria or can be imported into mitochondria. In the mitochondrial matrix, proteins with shorter CAT-tails easily incorporate into ATP synthase and affect its function, which is manifested by a decrease in the ATP synthesis rate and accumulation of protons (H<sup>+</sup>), resulting in an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential. Ultimately, changes in ATP synthase leads to the malfunction of mPTP, thereby affecting cell proliferation, migration and resistance to drug-induced apoptosis (Right Side).</p></caption>

<p>It is worth noting that more than one mitochondrial protein can be CAT-tailed in cancer cells. It is very likely that the multiple nuclear-genome encoded mitochondrial proteins have been CAT-tailed in the similar way, and due to the different properties of these base proteins, msiCAT-tailed peptides may have diverse effects on mitochondria or cells. For example, CAT-tailed COX4 protein may contribute to a more significant and direct reduction in mitochondrial respiratory efficacy. It may be interesting to investigate their roles separately, as the combined effects of the individual defects may be key to helping us understand the observed mitochondrial changes in cancer. Indeed, in a recent study, the authors found that knocking down ANKZF1 inhibited the progression of GBM by causing the accumulation of abnormal proteins within mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Combined with our data, we conclude that the balance of ANKZF1 expression and activity is essential for cancer proliferation. Excess or deficiency may cause changes in cell adaptability. A minor drawback is that in their study, the authors used a mitochondrial-localized non-stopped GFP protein to induce proteostasis stress, and there was no direct biochemical evidence for detecting the CAT-tailed proteins. Here, we focus on endogenous proteins to analyze the impact of target proteins on mitochondria in more detail. The consideration is that abundantly expressed non-physiological ectopic proteins may cause general proteostasis failure and thus mask the specific functions of endogenous proteins. In addition, the cell lines used in the two studies were different. GSC is a patient-derived GBM cell line with more stemness, and its mitochondrial status and RQC pathway activity may be different from those of the U87 or U251 cell lines. Therefore, rather than thinking that the conclusions from the two studies are in conflict, it is better to say that they are complementary, and both prove the importance of RQC in tumorigenesis. Our study explores the mechanistic role of RQC pathway in GBM and provides new potential targets for future treatments.</p>
<p>Comprehensive analysis of how many nuclear genome-encoded mitochondrial proteins are modified through the msiCAT-tailing mechanism using advanced mass spectrometry is an interesting topic and deserves further study. In a recent study published in <italic>Cell Reports</italic>, Lv and colleagues found that the cytoplasmic E3 ligase Pirh2 and the mitochondrial protease ClpXP can complement the classic NEMF-ANKZF1 to degrade mitochondrial protein aggregation caused by ribosome stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). The elevation of ClpXP in various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>) may be explained by increased msiCAT-tailing products in mitochondria, and the impact of ClpXP on mitochondrial RQC also depends on future research. ClpXP also regulates the levels of a variety of mitochondrial proteins. In our experiments, we found that ATP5α proteins without msiCAT-tails are most difficult to ectopically express; short tails (AT3) containing proteins are better, while proteins with long tails (AT20) have higher expression levels and form SDS-insoluble protein aggregates. This regulation may also be achieved through the degradation of ClpXP. Another possibility is regulation at the transcriptional level. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator (PGC-1α) is a master regulator of mammalian mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). PGC-1α can bind and activate nuclear transcription factors, leading to the transcription of nuclear genome-encoded mitochondrial proteins and the mitochondrial transcription factor Tfam. Tfam subsequently activates transcription and replication of the mitochondrial genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). In the future, careful examination of the mRNA levels of the msiCAT-tailed targets and the binding of PCG1α and Tfam to transcriptional elements will help us distinguish between these two possibilities.</p>
<p>MPTP is an ion nonselective, calcium-dependent, and multifunctional supramolecular channel that penetrates both the inner membranes of mitochondria. Although the function and regulation of MPTP have been widely studied, our understanding of its molecular structure has remained unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). Currently, multiple structural models of MPTP have been proposed: i) the VDAC (voltage-dependent anion channel)/ANT (adenine nucleotide translocator)/Cyp-D (cyclophilin D) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). However, subsequent genetic studies have shown that whether these proposed proteins are structural components of MPTP is still highly controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). ii) the ATP synthase model of MPTP. In this model, dimers of ATP synthase or reconstitution of ATP synthase (c-ring) may form the molecular structure of MPTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). This hypothesis is intriguing and the role of ATP synthase as a component of the pore structure has been the subject of many conflicting studies yet has not yet been unequivocally confirmed. iii) the current prevalent hypothesis is that ANT and ATP synthase together form a large complex (ATP synthasome), and Cyp-D regulates the dynamics of ATP synthasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>).</p>
<p>MPTP is regulated by the physiological voltage of mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>), and conversely, the opening of MPTP can also impact ion homeostasis and energy metabolism in the mitochondrial matrix. In our study, two threads converge here. The msiCAT-tailed ATP5α protein helps cancer cells: i) maintain a high/stable membrane potential, which can desensitize MPTP induction, and ii) directly participate in MPTP assembly, thus inhibiting MPTP’s function. Intriguingly, MPTP is an important mediator of cell death. However, for a long time, no reports have been published to clearly confirm or refute the hypothesis, that is more closed (inhibition) MPTP could be an important feature of cancer cells, which can help them escape drug-induced programmed cell death. Here we present evidence supporting this hypothesis. In our observation, GBM cells, especially GSC cells, have a more closed MPTP than control cells. And this state is directly related to the CAT-tailing modification of the ATP synthase subunit. This is also consistent with evidence that genetic mutations or post-translational modifications in certain ATP synthase subunits can affect MPTP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Cai et al have investigated the role of msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial proteins that frequently exist in glioblastoma stem cells. Overexpression of msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha (ATP5) protein increases the mitochondrial membrane potential and blocks mitochondrial permeability transition pore formation/opening. These changes in mitochondrial properties provide resistance to staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis in GBM cells. Therefore, msiCAT-tailing can promote cell survival and migration, while genetic and pharmacological inhibition of msiCAT-tailing can prevent the overgrowth of GBM cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The CAT-tailing concept has not been explored in cancer settings. Therefore, the present provides new insights for widening the therapeutic avenue.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the paper does have strengths in principle, the weaknesses of the paper are that these strengths are not directly demonstrated. The conclusions of this paper are mostly well-supported by data, but some aspects of image acquisition and data analysis need to be clarified and extended.</p>

<p>This work explores the connection between glioblastoma, mito-RQC, and msiCAT-tailing. They build upon previous work concluding that ATP5alpha is CAT-tailed and explore how CAT-tailing may affect cell physiology and sensitivity to chemotherapy. The authors conclude that when ATP5alpha is CAT-tailed, it either incorporates into the proton pump or aggregates and that these events dysregulate MPTP opening and mitochondrial membrane potential and that this regulates drug sensitivity. This work includes several intriguing and novel observations connecting cell physiology, RQC, and drug sensitivity. This is also the first time this reviewer has seen an investigation of how a CAT tail may specifically affect the function of a protein. However, some of the conclusions in this work are not well supported. This significantly weakens the work but can be addressed through further experiments or by weakening the text.</p>

<p>We are grateful for the reviewers' acknowledgment of the originality of our manuscript and its potential importance in cancer treatment. We appreciate the reviewers' critiques on certain conclusions and thank them for their thorough feedback on the manuscript. In the revised version, we will provide a more detailed clarification of the previous data and methods, bolster the existing data, and present additional evidence in support of our hypothesis. Please find below our replies to particular concerns.</p>
<p>In brief, to address the comments from Reviewer 1, we will make the following revisions in the manuscript:</p>
<p>(1) To discuss the issues regarding the specificity of ATP5⍺ CAT-tailing, we will provide new patient-derived cell lines and tumor samples and investigate the CAT-tail modifications of nuclear genome-encoded mitochondrial proteins and changes in RQC proteins within them. We will endeavor to explore the nature of NEMF modifications in GSC cells (Fig. S1A).</p>
<p>(2) To enhance the quality of image data, we will substitute some images (such as Fig. 1E and 3A) with higher quality images.</p>
<p>(3) To further understand the influence of NEMF on cancer, the effects of NEMF overexpression in GSC cells will be evaluated through testing (<italic>e.g.</italic>, Fig. 3D).</p>
<p>(4) To further explore changes in apoptosis, we will employ additional methods to detect apoptosis, including Annexin-PI FACS assays, caspase cleavage analysis, assessing BAX-BCL2 ratios, and monitoring cytochrome c release.</p>
<p>(5) To further confirm the effectiveness of the CAT-tailing-mitochondria mechanism in <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor models, we will utilize a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model to study the impact of the RQC pathway and CAT-tailing mechanism on tumor proliferation in vivo. The overactivation of the Notch signaling pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic> can stimulate malignant proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) through both canonical (c-Myc mediated pathway) and non-canonical (PINK1-mitochondrial-mTORC2 pathway) pathways, leading to the development of a tumor-like phenotype in the larval brain. A recent publication in PNAS Nexus (Khaket et al., <italic>PNAS Nexus</italic>, 2024) discusses the impact of the RQC pathway on c-Myc. It is possible for us to analyze the alterations in CAT-tailing on mitochondrial proteins and mitochondrial membrane potential in this Notch model and study how the RQC pathway regulates them. Moreover, tumor implantation experiments will be carried out using immunodeficient mice. Our goal is to conduct a comparative analysis of the growth of control and NEMF KD glioblastoma cell lines in animal models, alongside performing essential biochemical analyses.</p>

<p>To address the comments from Reviewer 2, we will make the following revisions in the manuscript:</p>
<p>(1) The concerns raised by the reviewer regarding the authenticity of the ATP5a CAT-tail modification are duly noted. Critical control experiments will be incorporated into our study, including <italic>NEMF</italic> knockout (or NFACT domain mutants) and cycloheximide treatment, alongside other methodologies. The results of these experiments will include placements such as Fig. 1B, 1C, S3A, and S3B to improve comprehension of the CAT-tail modification on ATP5⍺.</p>
<p>(2) We thank the reviewer for reminding us to consider the differences between the artificial tail and the endogenous CAT-tail. A recently published study (Khan et al., 2024) provides a thorough analysis of the components of the CAT-tail. Our approach to addressing this issue involves emphasizing the use of the artificial CAT-tail sequence and adopting a more measured tone in the revised version. Additionally, we will induce the endogenous ATP5⍺-CAT-tail by express <italic>ATP5⍺-K20-non-stop</italic> in cells to validate their function in glioblastoma cells.</p>
<p>(3) Moreover, we aim to examine the impact of different amino acid compositions in the ATP5⍺ c-terminus extension, such as the poly (Gly-Ser) repeats noted by the reviewer, on both mitochondrial function and glioblastoma biology in our revision. By comparing the results obtained from ATP5⍺-CAT-tails with different compositions, it is anticipated that more definitive conclusions can be drawn.</p>
<p>(4) Additional minor revisions will be implemented to the text in accordance with the feedback given by the reviewer.</p>
