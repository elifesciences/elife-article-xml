<title>Abstract</title><p>Despite their importance for brain function, cortico-subcortical white matter tracts are underrepresented in diffusion MRI tractography studies. Their non-invasive mapping is more challenging and less explored compared to other major cortico-cortical bundles. We introduce a set of standardised tractography protocols for delineating tracts between the cortex and various deep subcortical structures, including the caudate, putamen, amygdala, thalamus and hippocampus. To enable comparative studies, our protocols are designed for both human and macaque brains. We demonstrate how tractography reconstructions follow topographical principles obtained from tracers in the macaque and how these translate to humans. We show that the proposed protocols are robust against data quality and preserve aspects of individual variability stemming from family structure in humans. Lastly, we demonstrate the value of these species-matched protocols in mapping homologous grey matter regions in humans and macaques, both in cortex and subcortex.</p>

<label>1</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Function-specific brain activity involves the integration of information from multiple remote brain regions. This integration is enabled by white matter (WM) bundles interconnecting different brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Of particular interest and importance are bundles connecting cortical areas with deep brain structures. Subcortical structures have important roles in affective, cognitive, motor and social functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), which emerge through interactions with cortical areas that such connections enable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Hence, the variability of these connections between individuals has been linked to differences in behavioural traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Furthermore, their disruption has been associated with abnormal function and pathology in neurodegenerative and mental health disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). In the clinic, individual variability in cortico-subcortical connectivity has been used to assist presurgical planning and predict personalised targets for efficacious interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>).</p>
<p>Chemical tracer studies in the non-human primate (NHP) brain, have provided, and continue to provide, invaluable insights into cortico-subcortical connections, and neuroanatomy in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Examples include tracing of cortico-striatal connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), amygdalofugal connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) and thalamo-cortical connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Comparative neuroanatomy studies can subsequently explore and translate principles of white matter organisation learnt from NHPs to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>)). Brain imaging and, in particular, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) is a crucial component in these comparative studies and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), allowing non-invasive mapping of these connections in the living human.</p>
<p>Towards this direction, recent dMRI-based frameworks have been developed to map respective white matter bundles (“tracts”) across NHPs and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). These rely on standardised dMRI tractography protocols, comprising of functionally-driven, rather than geometric, definitions, enabling automated and generalisable mapping of homologous major white matter tracts across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). These developments have allowed cross-species neuroanatomy studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) and mapping of connections across humans to study links with brain development, function and dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). A current limitation of these imaging-based approaches is that they have mainly focused so far on cortico-cortical bundles (with the exception of cortico-thalamic connections).</p>
<p>Tractography protocols for white matter bundles that reach deeper subcortical regions, for instance the striatum or the amygdala, are more difficult to standardise. The relative size and proximity of these bundles, and the white matter complexities and bottlenecks they go through, can make their mapping through dMRI particularly challenging. As a consequence, considerably fewer studies have proposed solutions for their reproducible reconstruction, both within and across primate species, compared to more major cortico-cortical bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Some existing studies have focused on cortico-striatal bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), uncinate and amygdalofugal fasciculi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), parts of the extreme capsule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) and the anterior limb of the internal capsule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). However, these either utilise labour-intensive single-subject protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), are not designed to be generalisable across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), or are based mostly on geometrically-driven parcellations that do not necessarily preserve topographical principles of connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). We propose an approach that addresses these challenges and is automated, standardised, generalisable across two species and includes a larger set of cortico-subcortical bundles than considered before, yielding tractography reconstructions that are driven by neuroanatomical constraints.</p>
<p>Specifically, we build upon our previous work on FSL-XTRACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) to propose standardised protocols and an end-to-end framework for automated cortico-subcortical tractography in the macaque and human brain, considering connections between the cortex and the caudate, putamen and amygdala. To this end, we use prior anatomical knowledge from NHP tracers to define new generalisable protocols, including the amygdalofugal tract, the Muratoff bundle and the striatal bundle (external capsule) with its frontal, sensorimotor, temporal and parietal parts, augmenting our previous protocols for hippocampal and thalamic tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Due to their close proximity, we also develop new protocols for the respective extreme capsule parts (frontal, temporal, parietal) and revise previously released protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) for the uncinate fasciculus, anterior commissure and fornix.</p>
<p>We demonstrate the mapping of the respective bundles in the human and macaque brain and show that tractography reconstructions follow topographical principles obtained from tracers. We show that the proposed definitions are robust against dMRI data quality and preserve aspects of individual variability stemming from family structure in humans, as reflected by higher similarity of reconstructed tracts in the brains of monozygotic twins compared to non-twin siblings and unrelated subjects. We subsequently demonstrate how these tractography reconstructions can improve the identification of homologous grey matter (GM) regions across species, both in cortex and subcortex, on the basis of similarity of grey matter areal connection patterns to the set of proposed white matter bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>).</p>

<label>2</label><title>Results</title>
<p>Using prior anatomical knowledge from tracer studies in the macaque, we developed new tractography protocols for the macaque brain and subsequently translated them to the human brain. We considered 23 tracts in total (11 bilateral, 1 commissural), which included tracts connecting the cortex to the amygdala, caudate and putamen. Specifically, we developed protocols for the amygdalofugal (𝐴𝑀𝐹) pathway, the sensorimotor, frontal, temporal and parietal parts of the striatal bundle/external capsule (𝑆𝑡𝐵<sub>𝑚</sub>, 𝑆𝑡𝐵<sub>𝑓</sub>, 𝑆𝑡𝐵<sub>𝑡</sub>, 𝑆𝑡𝐵<sub>𝑝</sub>), and the Muratoff bundle (𝑀𝐵). Due to their proximity, we also developed protocols for the frontal, temporal and parietal parts of the extreme capsule (𝐸𝑚𝐶<sub>𝑓</sub>, 𝐸𝑚𝐶<sub>𝑡</sub>, 𝐸𝑚𝐶<sub>𝑝</sub>) (neighbouring to the corresponding external capsule parts), and revised previous protocols for the uncinate fasciculus (𝑈𝐹) (neighbouring to the 𝐴𝑀𝐹), the fornix (𝐹𝑋) (output tract of the hippocampus next to the amygdala), as well as the anterior commissure (𝐴𝐶) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and Supplementary Table S1).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>We used the XTRACT approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) to define tractography protocols, governed by two principles: (i) protocols are comprised of seed/stop/target/exclusion regions of interest (ROIs) defined in template space, so that they are standardised and generalisable (compared to subject-specific protocols), (ii) ROIs are coarse enough and defined equivalently between macaques and humans to enable the tracking of corresponding bundles across species. Full tractography protocols, and modifications to existing protocols, are described in detail in Methods. Protocols were defined in MNI152 template space for human tractography and F99 space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) for macaque tractography. Additionally, we generalised the macaque protocols to the NIMH Macaque Template (NMT v2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). For clarity, results shown in the main text use the F99 space protocols. Comparison between results in NMT and F99 space can be seen in Supplementary Figure S3.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>Subcortical tract reconstruction across species and comparisons with tracers</title>
<p>Using dMRI data from the macaque (𝑁 = 6) and human brain (𝑁 = 50) and the defined protocols, we performed tractography reconstructions for all the tracts of interest. Maximum intensity projections of the resultant group-averaged tract reconstructions for the macaque and human are shown colour-coded in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> (individual tracts can be seen in Supplementary Figure S1). These reveal overall correspondence in the main bodies of tracts across species, whilst capturing differences in (sub)cortical projections.</p>

<p>We explored whether white matter organisation principles known from the tracer literature are captured in these tractography reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). For instance, the striatal bundle (𝑆𝑡𝐵)/external capsule is always medial to the extreme capsule and the Muratoff bundle runs along the head of the caudate nucleus. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> shows the relative positioning for 𝑆𝑡𝐵 <sub>𝑓</sub>, 𝐸𝑚𝐶<sub>𝑓</sub> and 𝑀𝐵 bundles. Correspondence between tractography results and tract tracing reconstruction in the macaque can be observed, with their relative positions being preserved. This relative position was preserved in the human tractography results as well. Furthermore, the medio-lateral separation is also observed in the other parts of 𝑆𝑡𝐵 and 𝐸𝑚𝐶 (i.e. parietal, temporal), as shown in Supplementary Figure S2. Similarly for the amygdalofugal (𝐴𝑀𝐹) bundle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), this runs through the anterior commissure and ventral pallidum, as well as, in its lateral part, over the uncinate fasciculus (𝑈𝐹). We see agreement with respect to these relative positions in both the macaque and human.</p>

<p>In addition to the main white matter core of the reconstructed bundles, we also explored agreement of the relative connectivity patterns within the striatum between tracers and tractography. Cortical injections of anterograde tracers from different parts of the macaque brain reveal a dorsolateral to ventromedial organisation in the putamen, from parietal to temporal projections (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Using the path distribution of the tractography reconstructed 𝑆𝑡𝐵 parts within the putamen, we could obtain a similar pattern in the macaque brain. This also resembled the pattern found in the human brain, as shown in both coronal and axial views.</p>

<label>2.2</label><title>Generalisability across data and individuals</title>
<p>We subsequently explored generalisability and robustness of the tractography protocols against NHP template spaces and dMRI data quality. Supplementary Figure S3 shows tract reconstructions in the macaque brain when using the F99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) vs the NMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) templates, similar tractography reconstructions for protocols defined in either of the two templates.</p>
<p>To explore performance against data quality, we compared tractography reconstruction in very high-quality high-resolution data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), to tractography in more standard quality data from the UK Biobank dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Supplementary Figure S4 demonstrates the ability to reconstruct all tracts across a range of data qualities, with good correspondence of the main bodies of the tracts in both datasets. We quantified this agreement by calculating the mean Pearson’s correlation across the set of new and revised tracts for each unique pair of subjects across and within each of the HCP and UK Biobank (UKB) datasets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). For reference, we performed similar correlations for the original set of XTRACT tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) (see Supplementary Table S1 for a list of Original vs New+Revised tracts). Higher correlation was observed within each dataset, but also a sufficiently high correlation between the two datasets. We found similar patterns across datasets both for the original and the new tracts, showcasing that the new protocols behave similarly to the widely-used original XTRACT protocols, across data qualities.</p>

<p>The mean agreement between HCP and UKB reconstructions was lower compared to withindataset agreements. The two cohorts correspond to different age ranges, with HCP having younger adults than the UKB, which could be contributing to these differences. In addition, this was due to occasionally reconstructing a sparser path distribution in the low-resolution data, particularly for some of the new tracts, as both their relative size and their proximity make them more challenging. This highlights the potential importance of having high-resolution data in tracking white matter bundles in densely-packed areas of higher complexity. It is interesting to note, however, that similar tracts were less/more reproducible between subjects across data qualities. For the lower quality data from the UKB, the tracts with lowest agreement across subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) were the anterior commissure (𝐴𝐶) and the temporal part of the Extreme Capsule (𝐸𝑚𝐶<sub>𝑡</sub>), while the highest correlations were for the Muratoff Bundle (𝑀𝐵) and the temporal part of the Striatal Bundle (𝑆𝑡𝐵<sub>𝑡</sub>). For the higher quality HCP data, the temporal part of the Extreme Capsule (𝐸𝑚𝐶<sub>𝑡</sub>) and the Muratoff Bundle (𝑀𝐵) were also the tracts with the lowest/highest correlations across subjects, respectively. Hence, certain tract reconstructions were consistently more variable than others across subjects, which may hint to also being more challenging to reconstruct. Taken together, despite differences, our results suggest all tracts could be reconstructed across both data qualities in a generalisable manner (Supplementary Figure S4).</p>
<p>We subsequently explored whether the proposed protocols preserve aspects of individual variability. We used the family structure in the HCP data to explore whether tract reconstructions from monozygotic twin pairs are more similar compared to tracts obtained from other pairs of siblings or unrelated subjects. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, we found a decrease in pairwise tract similarity going from monozygotic twins, to dizygotic twins and non-twin siblings, and to pairs of unrelated subjects. For reference, we performed the same analysis for the original XTRACT tracts and the same pattern persisted for the new (and revised) tracts, in agreement with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). In each analysis, all pairwise differences were significant (Bonferroni corrected 𝑝 ≺ 0.05; following a Mann-Whitney U-Test), with the exception of dizygotic twins compared to non-twin siblings.</p>
<p>Examples of tract reconstructions on individual subjects are shown in Supplementary Figures S6, S7. The figures demonstrate tractography results for subjects corresponding to 10<sup>𝑡ℎ</sup>, 50<sup>𝑡ℎ</sup> and 90<sup>𝑡ℎ</sup> percentile of the distribution of tract correlations to the HCP group average. This ranking was also representative of high, medium and low subject motion across the cohort respectively. Results demonstrate that the expected patterns are preserved for all tracts (𝑀𝐵, 𝐴𝑀𝐹, 𝑈𝐹, 𝐸𝑚𝐶, 𝑆𝑡𝐵 (frontal and parietal parts)). Supplementary Figure S6 shows that even the relative medial-lateral organisation of the StB with respect to the EmC is also maintained across the three individual examples, in agreement with the group average pattern.</p>

<label>2.3</label><title>Identifying homologues in cortex and subcortex using tractography patterns</title>
<p>Based on our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), we used the similarity of areal connectivity patterns with respect to equivalently defined white matter tracts across the two species, to identify homologous grey matter regions between humans and macaques. With the addition of the new subcortical tracts we could perform this task for deep brain structures (subcortical nuclei and hippocampus) with considerably greater granularity than before. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> demonstrates such identification task for five structures in the left hemisphere (caudate, putamen, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus) using cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical tracts (sets of tracts defined in Supplementary Table S1). On the left, the regions in the macaque brain with the lowest divergence (highest similarity) in their connectivity patterns to the connectivity patterns of the corresponding human regions are shown in blue. Using only connectivity pattern similarity, these five structures can be matched almost perfectly across the two species. For instance, human putamen (left hemisphere) has more similar connectivity (lower divergence) to macaque putamen (left hemisphere), human thalamus (left hemisphere) to macaque thalamus (left hemisphere), etc. Since we are mapping structures in the left hemisphere using left hemisphere tracts, we observe a low similarity in the contralateral (right) hemisphere, as expected. On the right of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, this identification is quantified even further, highlighting the value of considering the new tracts. For every human left-hemisphere region (specified on the vertical axis) the boxplot of divergence of connectivity patterns to each of the five macaque deep brain regions (left-hemisphere) is plotted. The best match corresponds to the boxplot with the lowest values (green) and the dashed blue lines show the medians of these boxplots for each case. For reference, the medians of the divergence values when not considering the new subcortical tracts are shown with the red dashed lines, which are overall more flat (with the exception of the hippocampus which has a connectivity pattern strongly driven by the dorsal subsection of the cingulum bundle (𝐶𝐵𝐷), a cortico-cortical tract). It is evident that considering the new tracts provides enhanced contrast between the subcortical structures connectivity patterns, enabling their correct identification. The improvement is thus not in the best match, but in the specificity of the match.</p>

<p>Having shown increased contrast and specificity in the mapping of deep brain structures, we investigated whether we see a similar effect in the cortex. We selected a set of nearby frontal region pairs to map across the human and the macaque (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), since a number of the new tracts connect frontal regions to the subcortex. Specifically, we considered the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (𝑑𝑚𝑃𝐹𝐶), the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (𝑣𝑚𝑃𝐹𝐶), the rostral orbitofrontal cortex (𝑂𝐹𝐶<sub>𝑟</sub>), and the frontal operculum (𝐹𝑂𝑝). These regions were also chosen as they are part of different functional networks (default mode, limbic, and frontoparietal networks), equivalently defined between the macaque and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>).</p>

In each case, we compare the prediction using only cortico-cortical tracts (column 1), using only cortico-subcortical tracts (column 2), and using the full set (column 3) (sets of tracts defined in Supplementary Table S1 - the middle cerebellar peduncle (𝑀𝐶𝑃) was not used in these comparisons). The predicted areas with the highest similarity in connectivity patterns are depicted in blue, while the a priori expected homologue region borders have been outlined in cyan. These results demonstrate benefits when using the subcortical tracts, with mapping of some regions (for instance 𝑣𝑚𝑃𝐹𝐶 and 𝑂𝐹𝐶<sub>𝑟</sub>) being improved more than others. However, in general, we observed an increase in cross-species similarity in the corresponding areas of interest, combined with a decrease in similarity everywhere else in the cortex, when we considered cortico-subcortical tracts (columns 2, 3) compared to when we considered cortico-cortical tracts alone (column 1).</p>
<p><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> provides a further insight into these mappings, by plotting the connectivity patterns of the human regions against the pattern of its identified best match in the macaque brain. As can be observed, despite the relative proximity of these frontal regions, we have distinct patterns across them. With the exception of 𝑑𝑚𝑃𝐹𝐶, the connectivity patterns of all other regions have major contributions from the frontal striatal bundle, the extreme capsule and the amygdalofugal tract (𝐴𝑀𝐹) and connection patterns to these cortico-subcortical bundles enable better separation of these nearby regions. For instance, 𝑣𝑚𝑃𝐹𝐶 and 𝑑𝑚𝑃𝐹𝐶 have both connections through the cingulum bundle, the corpus callosum and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. However, they connect differently to the striatal bundle, the amygdalofugal tract and the anterior thalamic radiation and the addition of these tracts in the connectivity patterns allow the two regions to be better distinguished. The 𝐹𝑂𝑝 and 𝑂𝐹𝐶<sub>𝑟</sub> have both relatively strong connection patterns to the uncinate and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi, but it is their different pattern of connections to extreme and external capsules and the amygdalofugal tract that enable their better separation.</p>

<label>3</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>We introduced standardised dMRI tractography protocols for delineating cortico-subcortical connections between cortex and the amygdala, caudate, putamen and the hippocampus, across humans and macaques. Building upon our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), which already provided protocols for cortico-thalamic radiations, and guided by the chemical tracer literature in the macaque, we devised the new protocols first for the macaque and then extended to humans. We demonstrated that our reconstructed tracts preserve topographical organisation principles, as suggested by tracers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). As outlined in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), tractography reconstructions can be highly accurate if information about where pathways go, and where they do not go is available. This is the philosophy behind the proposed protocols, which provide this type of constraints across different bundles. At the same time these constraints are relatively coarse so that they are species-generalisable. We found that the proposed approaches yield tractography reconstruction across a range of datasets and respect individual similarities stemming from twinship. We further assessed the efficacy of these protocols in performing connectivity-based identification of homologous cortical and subcortical areas across the two species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>).</p>
<p>Mapping white matter tracts that link cortical areas with deep brain structures (subcortical nuclei and hippocampus), as done here, enhances capabilities for studying neuroanatomy in many contexts, from evolution and development, to mental health and neuropathology. As one of the (evolutionarily) older brain structures, the subcortex modulates brain functions including basic emotions, motivation, and movement control, providing a foundation upon which the more complex cognitive abilities of the cortex could develop and evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). This modulatory function is mediated via white matter bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Consequently, their disruption is linked to abnormal function and pathology, in mental health, neurodegenerative, and neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). For example, in depression, fronto-thalamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>), cortico-amygdalar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>), and corticostriatal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>) connectivity changes have been reported, while in schizophrenia there are associated fronto-striatal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>) and hippocampal connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>) changes. In Parkinson’s there is impairment in fronto-striatal connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>), while fronto-thalamic and cingulate connectivity are impaired in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). Connectivity between the frontal lobe and the amygdala, thalamus, and striatum, as well as cingulum connectivity are impaired in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>). Therefore, reconstructing connectivity of these deep brain structures (striatum, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus) in a standardised manner, as enabled by our proposed tools, allows for further investigation into a wide range of disorders.</p>
<p>In addition, tractography of connections linking to/from deep brain structures has been used or proposed for guiding neuromodulation interventions, for example, deep brain stimulation (DBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>) or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). DBS can inherently target subcortical structures and connectivity of subcortical circuits can be used to identify efficacious stimulation targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). rTMS on the other hand modulates subcortical function indirectly by targetting the structurally connected cortical areas. For example, dmPFC has been targetted to modulate the reward circuitry, in cases of anhedonia, negative symptoms in schizophrenia and major depression disorder (MDD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>), while the vmPFC has been used as a target to modulate the prefrontal-striatal network (part of the limbic system) and regulate emotional arousal/anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>). Our results show a good mapping across species of both these cortical regions with specificity in their connectional patterns. Additionally, the motor cortex has been used as target to modulate cortico-striatal connectivity in general anxiety disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>). We thus anticipate that having a standardised set of tracts linking the striatum, the hippocampus, the amygdala and the thalamus (all potential sites for stimulation) to specific cortical areas can assist the planning of interventions.</p>
<p>Our cross-species approach naturally lends itself to the study of evolutionary diversity. A number of comparative studies have revealed differences and similarities when comparing brain connectivity between humans and non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>), including macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) and chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>). Our work naturally extends these efforts and provides new tools for studying this diversity in deeper structures and subcortical nuclei. The ever increasing availability of comparative MRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>) allows the definition of similar protocols in more species, such as the gibbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>) or the marmoset monkey, and even across geometrically diverse brains depicting different stages of neurodevelopment (e.g. neonates vs adults) enabling concurrent studies of phylogeny and ontogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>)).</p>
<p>Our protocols have been developed and tested using FSL-XTRACT, but, in principle, are not specific to FSL. We have not evaluated performance with other tools, but these standard space protocols could be translated into other tractography approaches. As described before, the protocols are recipes with anatomical constraints, including regions to which the corresponding white matter pathways connect and regions they do not, constructed with cross-species generalisability in mind. Caution may be needed, however, if applying such protocols for segmenting whole-brain tractograms, as these can induce more false positives than tractography reconstructions from smaller seed regions and may require stricter exclusions.</p>
<p>Despite the potential demonstrated in this work, our study has limitations. As this is the first endeavour of this scale to map cortico-subcortical connections in a standardised manner and across two species, it is not exhaustive. Tracts linking the cortex to the striatum were prioritised as they are of increased relevance in human development and disease. However, expanding to include more tracts targetting other structures would provide a more holistic view. Our protocols were developed in the adult human brain. Future work will translate them to the infant brain (expanding on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>)) to interrogate cortico-subcortical connectivity across development. Tractography validation is a challenge, as is validation for any indirect and non-invasive imaging approach. We explored and demonstrated generalisability of the proposed protocols, both within and across species. We also showed how the imaging-based reconstructions follow topographical organisation principles suggested by tracers.</p>

<label>4.1</label><title>Tractography protocols</title>
<p>Guided by tract tracing and neuroanatomy literature, we devised tractography protocols for 18 subcortical bundles (nine bilateral - <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) using the XTRACT approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). We also revised protocols for three more bundles (2 bilateral, 1 commissural), compared to their original version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). All protocols followed two principles: i) comprised of seed/stop/target/exclusion regions of interest (ROIs) defined in template space, so that they are standardised and generalisable, ii) ROIs defined equivalently between macaques and humans to enable tracking of corresponding bundles across species. The human protocols were defined in MNI152 space. The macaque protocols were defined in F99 and also in NMT space.</p>
<p>The tracts included the amygdalofugal tract (𝐴𝑀𝐹), the uncinate fasciculus (𝑈𝐹), anterior commissure (𝐴𝐶), sensorimotor, temporal, parietal and frontal parts of the striatal bundle (𝑆𝑡𝐵) / external capsule (𝐸𝐶), Muratoff bundle (𝑀𝐵)/subcallosal fasciculus, as well as the extreme capsule (𝐸𝑚𝐶) parts that run close to the putamen connecting the insula to the frontal, temporal and parietal cortices. All XTRACT tracts (Original, Revised and New) are summarised in Supplementary Table S1.</p>
<p>Detailed protocol definitions are presented below and summarised in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> (for completeness, the previously published thalamic radiations from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) are presented in Supplementary Materials). Briefly, the 𝐴𝑀𝐹 and 𝑈𝐹 protocols are a standard-space generalisation of the individual subjectlevel protocols presented in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). For the remaining protocols, we first devised them in the macaque guided by tract tracer literature. Specifically, the approach we took was to first identify anatomical constraints from neuroanatomy literature for each tract of interest independently, derive and test these protocols in the macaque. Thus, each devised protocol included a unique combination of anatomically defined masks (based on literature descriptions of the tracts), delineated in standard macaque space (F99). We then developed corresponding protocols in the human using correspondingly defined landmarks (delineated in standard MNI space). We optimised in an iterative fashion based on two criteria: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) the protocols generalise well to humans, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) when considering groups of bundles, the generated reconstructions follow topographical principles known from tract tracing literature.</p>

<p>We modified existing XTRACT protocols to improve their specificity in the subcortex. Specifically, we developed a new uncinate fasciculus (𝑈𝐹) protocol based on the protocol presented in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). We also modified the anterior commissure (𝐴𝐶) protocol to improve temporal lobe projections and slightly enhance projections to the amygdala, and modified the fornix (𝐹𝑋) one to reduce amygdala projections by placing an exclusion in the amygdala.</p>
<p>Given the proximity of the newly defined tracts, we evaluated the new protocols against their ability to capture patterns known from the tracer literature. These included relative positioning of each tract with respect to neighbouring tracts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) and topographical organisation of certain bundle terminals within subcortical nuclei (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Amygdalofugal Pathway (𝐴𝑀𝐹)</title>
<p>We derived generalisable template-space protocols to recon-struct the limbic-cortical ventral amygdalofugal pathway, following the subject-specific protocols in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). The amygdalofugal pathway (𝐴𝑀𝐹) courses between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), running alongside the uncinate fasciculus (𝑈𝐹) medially and finally merging with the 𝑈𝐹 in the posterior orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). As in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), the seed included voxels with high fractional anisotropy in an anterior-posterior direction in the sub-commissural white matter. We used a target covering all brain at the level of caudal genu of the corpus callosum (same target as in the revised 𝑈𝐹 protocol, described further below). Exclusions include an axial plane through the 𝑈𝐹, the internal and external capsules, the corpus callosum, the cingulate, the Sylvian fissure, the anterior commissure, the fornix, and a large coronal exclusion covering all brain dorsal to the corpus callosum and extending inferiorly to the frontal operculum and insula at the level of the middle frontal gyrus.</p>

<title>Striatal Bundle (𝑆𝑡𝐵 <sub>𝑓</sub>, 𝑆𝑡𝐵<sub>𝑚</sub>, 𝑆𝑡𝐵<sub>𝑝</sub>, 𝑆𝑡𝐵<sub>𝑡</sub>)</title>
<p>The striatal bundle (𝑆𝑡𝐵), is a bundle system that connects the cortex to the striatum, and joins the external capsule (𝐸𝐶). Although terminations reach both the caudate and the putamen, it primarily terminates in the putamen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Here we defined protocols for bundles that connect the putamen with frontal (including anterior cingulate) lobe, sensorimotor cortex, parietal and temporal lobes. For all parts, we used the putamen as the target. For 𝑆𝑡𝐵 <sub>𝑓</sub>, the OFC, PFC, ACC and frontal pole made up the seed. For 𝑆𝑡𝐵<sub>𝑚</sub>, the primary sensorimotor cortex (M1-S1) were used as seeds. For 𝑆𝑡𝐵<sub>𝑡</sub> and 𝑆𝑡𝐵<sub>𝑝</sub>, the temporal and parietal lobes were respectively used as a seed. The exclusion masks shared many commonalities but also had differences. For all parts, exclusions included a midsagittal plane, the subcortex, except for the putamen, as well as the occipital lobe. For each of the parts, we additionally excluded the seeds for every other 𝑆𝑡𝐵 bundle.</p>

Although terminations reach both the caudate and the putamen, it primarily terminates in the caudate head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). As its cortical projections are challenging to capture and isolate using tractography, we defined a protocol for the major core of the bundle. We used a seed in the white matter adjacent to the caudate head and a target in the white matter adjacent to the caudate tail. A stop mask was used beyond the target in the white matter above the target. Exclusions included the contralateral hemisphere, the subcor-tex (except for the caudate head), the brainstem, the parietal, occipital, frontal and temporal cortices.</p>

It lies between the claustrum and the insula, with the claustrum being considered the boundary between the 𝐸𝑚𝐶 and the external capsule (𝐸𝐶) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). We defined protocols connecting the insula to frontal, parietal and temporal cortices. For all parts we used the insula as the target, while for seeds we used the same seeds as for the corresponding 𝑆𝑡𝐵 parts. Hence, for the 𝐸𝑚𝐶<sub>𝑓</sub>protocol the frontal pole was used as the seed. For 𝐸𝑚𝐶<sub>𝑝</sub>, the parietal lobe was a seed, and for 𝐸𝑚𝐶<sub>𝑡</sub> the temporal lobe was a seed. Exclusions for all 𝐸𝑚𝐶 parts included the contralateral part of the brain, the subcortex, as well as the occipital lobe, and lateral parts of the somatosensory and motor cortices. In addition, for each subdivision, the exclusion mask also included the seed mask for every other subdivision.</p>

<p>The 𝑈𝐹 lies at the bottom part of the extreme capsule, curving from the inferior frontal cortex to the anterior temporal cortex.

Briefly, we used an axial seed in the white matter rostro-laterally to the amygdala in the anterior temporal lobe. A target covered all brain at the level of caudal genu of the corpus callosum. Exclusions included the basal ganglia, a coronal plane posterior to the seed, the corpus callosum, the cingulate, the Sylvian fissure, the anterior commissure, and a large coronal exclusion covering all brain dorsal to the corpus callosum and extending inferiorly to the frontal operculum and insula at the level of the middle frontal gyrus.

<title>Anterior Commissure (𝐴𝐶)</title>
<p>Compared to original XTRACT protocol, we entirely re-worked the 𝐴𝐶 protocol. Previously, the mid-line main body of the 𝐴𝐶 was the seed with targets either side and stops at the amygdala. Now, we use a temporal pole as the seed, the main body of the 𝐴𝐶 as a waypoint and the contralateral temporal pole as the final target. For the human, we use the Harvard-Oxford temporal pole ROI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). For the macaque, we use the CHARM temporal pole ROI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). The temporal pole seed/target pair are flipped and tractography is repeated, taking the average of runs. Compared to the previous version, this protocol provides greater symmetry in resultant reconstructions and greater connectivity to the poles of the temporal cortex, as suggested in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), and slightly enhanced connectivity to the amygdala.</p>

The UK Biobank data are acquired with approximately 6.5 minutes scan time per subject and therefore represent more standard quality datasets, achievable in a clinical scanner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Fifty subjects were randomly drawn from the UK Biobank (UKB) (age range 42-65 years of age, 31/19 females/males).

Specifically, anterograde tracers were injected across 78 cortical locations and their terminations within the putamen were recorded in coronal slices of the NMT template space at 0.5 mm resolution. Specifically, the injection sites were first assigned to one of four cortical ROIs (frontal, parietal, temporal and sensorimotor cortices), obtained from the NMT CHARM v1 parcellation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). For each of these four injection ROIs, we counted all the corresponding terminations within the putamen, and then divided by the total number of termination sites.

<p>To explore robustness against varying data quality, we compared tractography reconstructions for in-vivo human dMRI data of considerably different data resolutions, diffusion contrast and scan time. Specifically, we explored whether tract reconstructions in state-of-the-art HCP data (approximately 55 minutes of scan time) were similar to reconstructions in bog standard data from the UK Biobank (UKB) (approximately 6.5 minutes of scan time), both on group average maps, as well as individual reconstructions.</p>
<p>Inter-subject variability for each tract reconstruction was assessed within and across the HCP and UKB cohorts. Inter-subject Pearson’s correlations were obtained by cross correlating random subject pairs tract-wise. Specifically, for each subject pair, we correlated the normalised path distributions in MNI space for each tract, after thresholding the path distribution at 0.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), and then averaged the correlation across tracts for each subject pair.

<label>4.4.2</label><title>Respecting similarities stemming from twinship</title>
<p>As an indirect way to explore whether the proposed standardised protocols respected individual variability, we tested whether tractography reconstructions reflected similarities stemming from twinship. We used the family structure in the HCP cohort, to explore whether tracts of monozygotic twin pairs were more similar compared to tract similarity in dizygotic twins and non-twin sibling pairs, and to tract similarity in unrelated subject pairs, as would be expected by heritability of structural connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>).

We compared tracts across pairs to assess whether our automated protocols respect the underlying tract variability across individuals. Specifically, for a given subject pair and a given tract, we calculated the Pearson’s correlation between the normalised path distributions (in MNI space and following thresholding at 0.5%). We repeated for all tracts and then calculated the mean correlation and standard deviation across tracts for that subject pair. This was then repeated for each group of subject pairs giving a distribution of average correlations for each group. We subsequently compared these distributions between the different groups. We repeated this process separately for the Original XTRACT tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) and the new cortico-subcortical tracts to ensure that patterns were similar. For each analysis, a pairwise Mann-Whitney U-test was performed for all cohort pairs to determine the significant differences between them. We corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni.</p>

<label>4.5</label><title>Building connectivity blueprints in cortex and subcortex</title>
<p>Connectivity blueprints are 𝐺𝑀 ×𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑠 matrices that have been proposed to represent the pattern of connections of GM areas to a predefined set of WM tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). To do so, the intersection of the core of WM tracts with the WM-GM boundary needs to be identified. For cortical GM, simply obtaining the intersection from the spatial path distribution maps of each tract would be dominated by the gyral bias in tractography near the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">118</xref>). Instead, whole-brain tractography matrices can be used as intermediaries. Specifically a 𝐺𝑀 × 𝑊 𝑀 connectivity matrix can be generated by seeding from each location of the white-grey matter boundary and targetting to a whole WM mask and this can then be multiplied by a 𝑊 𝑀 × 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑠 obtained by collating the path distributions of all tracts of interest.</p>
<p>The cortical blueprints 𝐺𝑀<sub>𝑐𝑡𝑥</sub> × 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑠 were generated using our previously developed tool xtract blueprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). We used the GM-WM boundary surface, extracted using the HCP pipelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>) for the human data and the approach in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) for the macaque. Briefly, a single set of macaque surfaces were derived using a set of high-quality structural data from one of the macaque subjects. The remaining macaque data were then nonlinearly transformed to this space, and the surfaces were nonlinearly transformed to the F99 standard space. All surface data were downsampled to 10,000 vertices prior to tractography. Volume space white matter targets were downsampled to 3 mm isotropic for the human and 2 mm isotropic for the macaque.</p>
<p>We extended the blueprint generation to include the subcortex. For subcortical nuclei we found that using an intermediary 𝐺𝑀 ×𝑊 𝑀 matrix did not help (as gyral bias is not relevant in subcortex - in fact it made patterns less specific). Hence, subcortical 𝐺𝑀<sub>𝑠𝑢𝑏</sub> × 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑠 blueprints were built using the intersection of the path distribution of each tract with the subcortical structures of interest (i.e. through multiplication of white matter tracts and binary subcortical masks, including putamen, caudate, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala). <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>) shows a comparison of the two approaches for various tracts in the human and macaque: i) using an intermediary 𝐺𝑀 × 𝑊 𝑀 matrix to obtain subcortical connection patterns, as done in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) for cortical regions and ii) using directly the tractography path distributions. The latter approach gave more focal and specific patterns and was used here for the subcortical regions. Tracts were downsampled (at 2 mm for human and 1 mm for macaque), thresholded at 0.1%, and multiplied by the subcortical nuclei masks, and then vectorised and stacked to create a 𝐺𝑀<sub>𝑠𝑢𝑏</sub> × 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑠 matrix. These were then row-wise concatenated (i.e vertically) with the cortical blueprints to generate CIFTI-style blueprints with approximately 10,000 cortical vertices and approximately 5,000 subcortical voxels (per left/right hemisphere). Finally, connectivity blueprints were row-wise sum-normalised. Following subjectwise construction of connectivity blueprints, we derived group-averaged blueprints for macaques and humans.</p>

We used the tool xtract divergence to perform all relevant calculations.

<title>Original cortico-thalamic XTRACT protocols</title>
<p>For completeness of presenting all the cortico-subcortical protocols, we include here the previously published protocols of thalamic radiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s8a1">
<title>Acoustic Radiation (𝐴𝑅)</title>
<p>The acoustic radiation connects the medial geniculate nucleus (𝑀𝐺𝑁) of the thalamus to the auditory cortex. The seed was placed in the transverse temporal gyrus and the target covered the 𝑀𝐺𝑁 of the thalamus. The exclusion mask consisted of two coronal planes, anterior and posterior to the thalamus, and an axial plane superior to the thalamus. In addition, the exclusion mask contained the brainstem and a horizontal region covering the optic tract.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s8a2">
<title>Anterior Thalamic Radiation (𝐴𝑇 𝑅)</title>
<p>The anterior thalamic radiation connects the thalamus to the frontal lobe. The seed mask was a coronal mask through the anterior part of the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref>), with a coronal target mask at the anterior thalamic peduncle. In addition, the exclusion mask contained an axial plane covering the base of the midbrain, a coronal plane preventing leakage via the posterior thalamic peduncle and a coronal plane preventing leakage via the cingulum. A coronal stop mask covered the posterior part of the thalamus, extending from the base of the midbrain to the callosal sulcus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s8a3">
<title>Optic Radiation (𝑂𝑅)</title>
<p>The optic radiation consists of fibres from the lateral geniculate nucleus (𝐿𝐺𝑁) of the thalamus to the primary visual cortex. The seed was placed in the 𝐿𝐺𝑁 and the target mask consisted of a coronal plane through the anterior part of the calcarine fissure. Exclusion masks consisted of an axial block of the brainstem, a coronal block of fibres directly posterior to the 𝐿𝐺𝑁 to select fibres that curl around dorsally, and a coronal plane anterior to the seed to prevent leaking into longitudinal fibres.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s8a4">
<title>Superior Thalamic Radiation (𝑆𝑇 𝑅)</title>
<p>The superior thalamic radiation connects the thalamus to the pre-/post-central gyrus respectively. The seed was a mask covering the whole thalamus and the target an axial plane covering the superior thalamic peduncle. An axial plane was used as a stop mask ventrally to the thalamus. The exclusion mask included two coronal planes, anterior and posterior to the target, to exclude tracking to the prefrontal cortex and occipital cortex respectively.</p>

<p>The authors note that it is challenging to perform diffusion MRI tractography consistently in both humans and macaques, particularly when deep subcortical structures are involved. The scientific advance described in this paper is effectively an update to the tracts that the XTRACT software supports. The changes to XTRACT are soundly motivated in theory (based on anatomical tracer studies) and practice (changes in seeding/masking for tractography).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this article, Assimopoulos et al. expand the FSL-XTRACT software to include new protocols for identifying cortical-subcortical tracts with diffusion MRI, with a focus on tracts connecting to the amygdala and striatum. They show that the amygdalofugal pathway and divisions of the striatal bundle/external capsule can be successfully reconstructed in both macaques and humans while preserving large-scale topographic features previously defined in tract tracing studies. The authors set out to create an automated subcortical tractography protocol, and they accomplish this for a subset of specific subcortical connections.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strength of the current study is the translation of established anatomical knowledge to a tractography protocol for delineating cortical-subcortical tracts that are difficult to reconstruct. Diffusion MRI-based tractography is highly prone to false positives; thus, constraining tractography outputs by known anatomical priors is important. The authors used existing tracing literature to create anatomical constraints for tracking specific cortical-subcortical connections and refined their protocol through an iterative process and in collaboration with multiple neuroanatomists. Key additional strengths include 1) the creation of a protocol that can be applied to both macaque and human data; 2) demonstration that the protocol can be applied to be high quality data (3 shells, &gt; 250 directions, 1.25 mm isotropic, 55 minutes) and lower quality data (2 shells, 100 directions, 2 mm isotropic, 6.5 minutes); and 3) validation that the anatomy of cortical-subcortical tracts derived from the new method are more similar in monozygotic twins than in siblings and unrelated individuals.</p>
<p>Overall Appraisal:</p>
<p>This new method will accelerate research on anatomically validated cortical-subcortical white matter pathways. The work has utility for diffusion MRI researchers across fields.</p>
<p>Editors' note:</p>
<p>Both reviewers were satisfied with the responses to their feedback.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Summary:</p>
<p>The authors note that it is challenging to perform diffusion MRI tractography consistently in both humans and macaques, particularly when deep subcortical structures are involved. The scientific advance described in this paper is effectively an update to the tracts that the XTRACT software supports. The claims of robustness are based on a very small selection of subjects from a very atypical dMRI acquisition (n=50 from HCP-Adult) and an even smaller selection of subjects from a more typical study (n=10 from ON-Harmony).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The changes to XTRACT are soundly motivated in theory (based on anatomical tracer studies) and practice (changes in seeding/masking for tractography), and I think the value added by these changes to XTRACT should be shared with the field. While other bundle segmentation software typically includes these types of changes in release notes, I think papers are more appropriate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their assessment and we appreciate the comments for improving our manuscript. We have added new results, sampling from a larger cohort with a typical dMRI protocol (N=50 from UK Biobank), as well as showcasing examples from individual subject reconstructions (Supplementary figures S6, S7). We also demonstrate comparisons against another approach that has been proposed for extracting parts of the cortico-striatal bundle in a bundle segmentation fashion, as the reviewer suggests (see comment and Author response image 1 below).</p>
<p>We would also like to take the opportunity to summarise the novelty of our contribuIons, as detailed in the Introduction, which we believe extend beyond a mere software update; this is a byproduct of this work rather than the aim.</p>
<p>i) We devise for the first Ime standard-space protocols for 21 challenging cortico-subcortical bundles for both human and macaque and we interrogate them in a comprehensive manner.</p>
<p>ii) We demonstrate robustness of these protocols using criteria grounded on neuroanatomy, showing that tractography reconstructions follow topographical principles known from tracers both in WM and GM and for both species. We also show that these protocols capture individual variability as assessed by respecting family structure in data from the HCP twins.</p>
<p>iii) We use high-resolution dMRI data (HCP and post-mortem macaque) to showcase feasibility of these reconstructions, and we show that reconstructions are also plausible with more conventional data, such as the ones from the UK Biobank.</p>
<p>iv) We further showcase robustness and the value of cross-species mapping by using these tractography reconstructions to predict known homologous grey matter (GM) regions across the two species, both in cortex and subcortex, on the basis of similarity of grey matter areal connection patterns to the set of proposed white matter bundles.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(2) The demonstration of the new tracts does not include a large number of carefully selected scans and is only compared to the prior methods in XTRACT. The small n and limited statistical comparisons are insufficient to claim that they are better than an alternative. Qualitatively, this method looks sound.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the suggestion for larger sample size, so we performed the same analysis using 50 randomly drawn UK Biobank subjects, instead of ON-Harmony, matching the N=50 randomly drawn HCP subjects (detailed explanation in the comment below, Main text Figure 4A; Supplementary Figures S4). We also generated results using the full set of N=339 HCP unrelated subjects (Supplementary Figure S5 compares 10, 50 and 339 unrelated HCP subjects). We provide further details in the relevant point (3) below.</p>
<p>With regards to comparisons to other methods, there are not really many analogous approaches that we can compare against. In our knowledge there are no previous cross-species, standard space tractography protocols for the tracts we considered in this study (including Muratoff, amygdalofugal, different parts of extreme an external capsules, along with their neighbouring tracts). We therefore i) directly compared against independent neuroanatomical knowledge and patterns (Figures 2, 3, 5), ii) confirmed that patterns against data quality and individual variability that the new tracts demonstrate are similar to patterns observed for the more established cortical tracts (Figure 4), iii) indirectly assessed efficacy by performing a demanding task, such as homologue identification on the basis of the tracts we reconstruct (Figures 6, 7).</p>
<p>We need to point out that our approach is not “bundle segmentation”, in the sense of “datadriven” approaches that cluster streamlines into bundles following full-brain tractography. The latter is different in spirit and assigns a label to each generated streamline; as full-brain tractography is challenging (Maier-Hein, Nature Comms 2017), we follow instead the approach of imposing anatomical constraints to miIgate for some of these challenges as suggested in (MaierHein, 2017).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we used TractSeg (one of the few alternatives that considers corticostriatal bundles) to perform some comparisons. The Author response image below shows average path distributions across 10 HCP subjects for a few bundles that we also reconstruct in our paper (no temporal part of striatal bundle is generated by Tractseg). We can observe that the output for each tract is highly overlapping across subjects, indicating that there is not much individual variability captured. We also see the reduced specificity in the connectivity end-points of the bundles.</p>

<title>Comparison between 10-subject average for example subcortical tracts using TractSeg and XTRACT.</title>
<p>We chose example bundles shared between our set and TractSeg. Per subject TractSeg produces a binary mask rather than a path distribution per tract. Furthermore, the mask is highly overlapping across subjects. Where direct correspondence was not possible, we found the closest matching tract. Specifically, we used ST_PREF for STBf, and merged ST_PREC with ST_POSTC to match StBm. There was no correspondence for the temporal part of StB.</p>

</fig>
<p>We subsequently performed the twinness test using both TractSeg and XTRACT (Author response image 2), as a way to assess whether aspects of individual variability can be captured. Due to heritability of brain organisation features, we anticipate that monozygotic twins have more similar tract reconstructions compared to dizygoIc twins and subsequently non-twin siblings. This pattern is reproduced using our proposed approach, but not using TractSeg that provides a rather flat pattern.</p>

<p>About 12 cortico-subcortical tracts were considered, as closely matched as possible between the two approaches. For Tractseg we considered: 'CA', 'FX', 'ST_FO', 'ST_M1S1' (merged ‘ST_PREC’ and ‘ST_POSTC’ to approximate the sensorimotor part of our striatal bundle), 'ST_OCC', 'ST_PAR', 'ST_PREF',  'ST_PREM', 'T_M1S1' (merged ‘T_PREC’ and ‘T_POSTC’ to approximate the sensorimotor part of our striatal bundle), 'T_PREF', 'T_PREM', 'UF'. For XTRACT we considered: 'ac', 'fx', 'StB<sub>f</sub>', 'StB<sub>m</sub>', 'StB<sub>p</sub>', 'StB<sub>t</sub>, 'EmC<sub>f</sub>', 'EmC<sub>p</sub>', 'EmC<sub>t</sub>', 'MB', 'amf', 'uf'.

<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-107012-sa3-fig2.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Taken together, these results indicate as a minimum that the different approaches have potentially different aims. Their different behaviour across the two approaches can be desirable and beneficial for different applications (for instance WM ROI segmentation vs connectivity analysis) but makes it challenging to perform like-to-like comparisons.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) “Subject selection at each stage is unclear in this manuscript. On page 5 the data are described as &quot;Using dMRI data from the macaque (𝑁 = 6) and human brain (𝑁 = 50)&quot;. Were the 50 HCP subjects selected to cover a range of noise levels or subject head motion? Figure 4 describes 72 pairs for each of monozygotic, dizygotic, non-twin siblings, and unrelated pairs - are these treated separately? Similarly, NH had 10 subjects, but each was scanned 5 times. How was this represented in the sample construction?”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the suggestions and we agree that some of the choices in terms of group sizes may have been confusing. Short answer is we did not perform any subject selection, subjects were randomly drawn from what we had available. The 72 twin pairs are simply the maximum number of monozygotic twin pairs available in the HCP cohort, so we used 72 pairs in all categories to match this number in these specific tests. The N=6 animals are good quality post-mortem dMRI data that have been acquired in the past and we cannot easily expand. For the rest of the points, we have now made the following changes:</p>
<p>We have replaced our comparison to the ON-Harmony dataset (10 subjects) with a comparison to 50 unrelated UK Biobank subjects (to match the 50 unrelated HCP subject cohort used throughout). Updated results can be seen in Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S4. This allows a comparison of tractography reconstruction between high quality and more conventional quality data for the same N.</p>
<p>We looked at QC metrics to ensure our chosen cohorts were representaIve of the full cohorts we had available. The N=50 unrelated HCP cohort and N=50 unrelated UKBiobank cohorts we used in the study captured well the range of the full 339 unrelated HCP cohort and N=7192 UKBiobank cohort in terms of absolute/relative moion (Author response image 3A and 3B respectively). A similar pattern was observed in terms of SNR and CNR ranges Author response image 4).</p>
<p>We generated tractography reconstructions for single subjects, corresponding to the 10th percentile (P<sub>10</sub>), median and 90th percentile (P90) of the distributions with respect to similarity to the cohort average maps. These are now shown in Supplementary Figures S6, S7. We also checked the QC metrics for these single subjects and confirmed that average absolute subject moIon was highest for the P<sub>10</sub>, followed by the P<sub>50</sub> and lowest for the P<sub>90</sub> subject, capturing a range of within cohort data quality.</p>
<p>We generated reconstructions for an even larger HCP cohort (all 339 unrelated HCP subjects) and these look very similar to the N=50 reconstructions (Supplementary Figure S5).</p>

<p>(4) In the paper, the authors state &quot;the mean agreement between HCP and NH reconstructions was lower for the new tracts, compared to the original protocols (𝑝 &lt; 10^−10). This was due to occasionally reconstructing a sparser path distribution, i.e., slightly higher false negative rate,&quot; - how can we know this is a false negative rate without knowing the ground truth?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for the terminology, we have corrected this, as it was confusing. Indeed, we cannot call it false negaIve, what we meant is that reconstructions from lower resolution data for these bundles ended up being in general sparser than the ones from the high-resolution data, potentially missing parts of the tract. We have now revised the text accordingly.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 Public Review:</bold></p>
<p>(5) Summary:</p>
<p>In this article, Assimopoulos et al. expand the FSL-XTRACT software to include new protocols for identifying cortical-subcortical tracts with diffusion MRI, with a focus on tracts connecting to the amygdala and striatum. They show that the amygdalofugal pathway and divisions of the striatal bundle/external capsule can be successfully reconstructed in both macaques and humans while preserving large-scale topographic features previously defined in tract tracing studies. The authors set out to create an automated subcortical tractography protocol, and they accomplished this for a subset of specific subcortical connections for users of the FSL ecosystem.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A main strength of the current study is the translation of established anatomical knowledge to a tractography protocol for delineating cortical-subcortical tracts that are difficult to reconstruct. Diffusion MRI-based tractography is highly prone to false positives; thus, constraining tractography outputs by known anatomical priors is important. Key additional strengths include 1) the creation of a protocol that can be applied to both macaque and human data; 2) demonstration that the protocol can be applied to be high quality data (3 shells, &gt; 250 directions, 1.25 mm isotropic, 55 minutes) and lower quality data (2 shells, 100 directions, 2 mm isotropic, 6.5 minutes); and 3) validation that the anatomy of cortical-subcortical tracts derived from the new method are more similar in monozygotic twins than in siblings and unrelated individuals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for the globally posiIve evaluaIon of this work and the perInent comments that have helped us to improve the paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(6) Although this work validates the general organizational location and topographic organization of tractography-derived cortical-subcortical tracts against prior tract tracing studies (a clear strength), the validation is purely visual and thus only qualitative. Furthermore, it is difficult to assess how the current XTRACT method may compare to currently available tractography approaches to delineating similar cortical-subcortical connections. Finally, it appears that the cortical-subcortical tractography protocols developed here can only be used via FSL-XTRACT (yet not with other dMRI software), somewhat limiting the overall accessibility of the method.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that a more quanItative comparison against gold standard tracing data would be ideal. However, there are practical challenges that prohibit such a comparison at this stage: i) Access to data. There are no quantifiable, openly shared, large scale/whole brain tracing data available. The Markov study provided the only openly available weighted connectivity matrices measured by tracers in macaques (Markov, Cereb Cortex 2014), which are only cortico-cortical and do not provide the white matter routes, they only quantify the relative contrast in connection terminals. ii) 2D microscopy vs 3D tractography. The vast majority of tracing data one can find in neuroanatomy labs is on 2D microscopy slices with restricted field of view, which is also the case for the data we had access to for this study. This complicates significantly like-to-like comparisons against 3D whole-brain tractography reconstructions. iii) Quantifiability is even tricky in the case of gold standard axonal tracing, as it depends on nuisance factors, e.g. injection site, injection size, injection uniformity and coverage, which confound the gold-standard measurements, but are not relevant for tractography. For these reasons, a number of high-profile NIH BRAIN CONNECTS Centres (for instance <ext-link>hXps://connects.mgh.harvard.edu/</ext-link>, <ext-link>hXps://mesoscaleconnecIvity.org/</ext-link>) are resourced to address these challenges at scale in the coming years and provide the tools to the community to perform such quantitative comparisons in the future.</p>
<p>In terms of comparison with other approaches, we have performed new tests and detail a response to a similar comment (2) from Reviewer 1.</p>
<p>Finally, our protocols have been FSL-tested, but have nothing that is FSL specific. We cannot speak of performance when used with other tools, but there is nothing that prohibits translation of these standard space protocols to other tools. In fact, the whole idea behind XTRACT was to generate an approach open to external contributions for bundle-specific delineation protocols, both for humans and for non-human species. A number of XTRACT extensions that have been published over the last 5 years for other NHP species (Roumazeilles et al. (2020); Bryant et al. (2020); Wang et al. (2025)) and similar approaches have been used in commercial packages (Boshkovski et al, 2106, ISMRM 2022).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations To the Authors:</bold></p>
<p>(7) Superiority of the FSL-XTRACT approach to delineating cortical-subcortical tracts. The Introduction of the article describes how &quot;Tractography protocols for white matter bundles that reach deeper subcortical regions, for instance the striatum or the amygdala, are more difficult to standardize&quot; due to the size, proximity, complexity, and bottlenecks associated with corticalsubcortical tracts. It would be helpful for the authors to better describe how the analytic approach adopted here overcomes these various challenges. What does the present approach do differently than prior efforts to examine cortical-subcortical connectivity?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There have not been many prior efforts to standardise cortico-subcortical connecIvity reconstructions, as we overview in the Introduction. As outlined in (Schilling et al. (2020),  <ext-link>hXps://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-020-02129-z</ext-link>), tractography reconstructions can be highly accurate if we guide them using constraints that dictate where pathways are supposed to go and where they should not go. This is the philosophy behind XTRACT and all the proposed protocols, which provide neuroanatomical constraints across different bundles. At the same time these constraints are relatively coarse so that they are species-generalisable. We have clarified that in Discussion. The approach we took was to first identify anatomical constraints from neuroanatomy literature for each tract of interest independently, derive and test these protocols in the macaque, and then optimise in an iterative fashion until the protocols generalise well to humans and until, when considering groups of bundles, the generated reconstructions can follow topographical principles known from tract tracing literature. This process took years in order to perform these iterations as meticulously as we could. We have modified the first sections in Methods to reflect this better (3rd paragraph of 1st Methods section), as well as modified the third and second to last paragraphs of the Introduction (“We propose an approach that addresses these challenges…”).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Relatedly, it is difficult to fully evaluate the utility of the current approach to dissecting cortical-subcortical tracts without a qualitative or quantitative comparison to approaches that already exist in the field. Can the authors show that (or clarify how) the FSL-XTRACT approach is similar to - or superior to - currently available methods for defining cortical-striatal and amygdalofugal tracts (e.g., methods they cite in the Introduction)?”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>From the limited similar approaches that exist, we did perform some comparisons against TractSeg, please see Reply to Comment 2 from Reviewer 1. We have also expanded the relevant text in the introduction to clarify the differences:</p>
<p>“…However, these either uIlise labour-intensive single-subject protocols (22,26), are not designed to be generalisable across species (42, 43), or are based mostly on geometrically-driven parcellaIons that do not necessarily preserve topographical principles of connecIons (40). We propose an approach that addresses these challenges and is automated, standardised, generalisable across two species and includes a larger set of cortico-subcortical bundles than considered before, yielding tractography reconstructions that are driven by neuroanatomical constraints.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Future applications of the tractography protocol:</p>
<p>It would be helpful for the authors to describe the contexts in which the automated tractography approach developed here can (and cannot) be applied in future studies. Are future applications limited to diffusion data that has been processed with FSL's BEDPOSTX and PROBTRACKX? Can FSL-XTRACT take in diffusion data modelled in other software (e.g., with CSD in mrtrix or with GQI in DSI Studio)? Can the seed/stop/target/exclusion ROIs be applied to whole-brain tractography generated in other software? Integration with other software suites would increase the accessibility of the new tract dissection protocols.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added some text in the Discussion to clarify this point. Our protocols have been FSLtested, but have nothing that is FSL specific. We cannot speak of performance of other tools, but there is nothing that prohibits translaIon of these standard space protocols to other tools. As described before, the protocols are recipes with anatomical constraints including regions the corresponding white matter pathways connect to and regions they do not, constructed with cross-species generalisability in mind. In fact a number of other packages (even commercial) have adopted the XTRACT protocols with success in the past, so we do not see anything in principle that prohibits these new protocols to be similarly adopted.</p>
<p>We cannot comment on the protocols’ relevance for segmenIng whole-brain tractograms, as these can induce more false posiIves than tractography reconstructions from smaller seed regions and may require stricter exclusions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) It was great to see confirmation that the XTRACT approach can be successfully applied in both high-quality diffusion data from the HCP and in the ON-Harmony data. Given the somewhat degraded performance in the lower quality dataset (e.g., Figure 4A), can the authors speak to the minimum data requirements needed to dissect these new cortical-subcortical tracts? Will the approach work on single-shell, low b data? Is there a minimum voxel resolution needed? Which tracts are expected to perform best and worst in lower-quality data?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for these comments, even if we have not really tried in lower (spaIal and angular) resolution data, given the proximity of the tracts considered, as well as the small size of some bundles, we would not recommend lower resolution than those of the UK Biobank protocol. In general, we would consider the UK Biobank protocol (2mm, 2 shells) as the minimum and any modern clinical scanner can achieve this in 6-8 minutes. We hence evaluated performance from high quality HCP to lower quality UK Biobank data, covering a considerable range (scan Ime from 55 minutes down to 6 minutes).</p>
<p>In terms of which tract reconstructions were more reproducible for UKBiobank data, the tracts with lowest correlations across subjects (Figure 4) were the anterior commissure (AC) and the temporal part of the Extreme Capsule (EmC<sub>t</sub>), while the highest correlations were for the Muratoff Bundle (MB) and the temporal part of the Striatal Bundle (StB<sub>t</sub>). Interestingly, for the HCP data, the temporal part of the Extreme Capsule (EmC<sub>t</sub>) and the Muratoff Bundle were also the tracts with the lowest/highest correlations, respectively. Hence, certain tract reconstructions were consistently more variable than others across subjects, which may hint to also being more challenging to reconstruct. We have now clarified these aspects in the corresponding Results section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) Anatomical validation of the new cortical-subcortical tracts</p>
<p>I really appreciated the use of prior tract tracing findings to anatomically validate the corticalsubcortical tractography outputs for both the cortical-striatal and amygdalofugal tracts. It struck me, however, that the anatomical validation was purely qualitative, focused on the relative positioning or the topographical organization of major connections. The anatomical validation would be strengthened if profiles of connectivity between cortical regions and specific subcortical nuclei or subcortical subdivisions could be quantitatively compared, if at all possible. Can the differential connectivity shown visually for the putamen in Figure 3 be quantified for the tract tracing data and the tractography outputs? Does the amygdalofugal bundle show differential/preferential connectivity across amygdala nuclei in tract tracing data, and is this seen in tractography?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the comment, please see Reply to your comment 6 above. In addiIon to the challenges described there, we do not have access to terminal fields other than in the striatum and these ones are 2D, so we make a qualitaIve comparison of the relevant connecIvity contrasts. We expect that a number of currently ongoing high-profile BRAIN CONNECTS Centres (such as the LINC and the CMC) will be addressing such challenges in the coming years and will provide the tools and data to the community to perform such quanItaIve comparisons at scale.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) I believe that all visualizations of the macaque and human tractography showed groupaveraged maps. What do these tracts look like at the individual level? Understanding individual-level performance and anatomical variation is important, given the Discussion paragraph on using this method to guide neuromodulation.</p>

<p>We now demonstrate some representative examples of individual subject reconstructions in Supplementary Figures S6, S7, ranking subjects by the average agreement of individual tract reconstructions to the mean and depicting the 10th percentile, median and 90th percentile of these subjects. We have also shown more results in Author response images 1-2, generated by TractSeg, to indicate how a different bundle segmentation approach would handle individual variability compared to our approach.</p>

<p>(13) Connectivity-based comparisons across species:</p>
<p>Figures 5 and 6 of the manuscript show that, as compared to using only cortico-cortical XTRACT tracts, using the full set of XTRACT tracts (with new cortical-subcortical tracts) allows for more specific mapping of homologous subcortical and cortical regions across humans and macaques. Is it possible that this result is driven by the fact that the &quot;connectivity blueprints&quot; for the subcortex did not use an intermediary GM x WM matrix to identify connection patterns, whereas the connectivity blueprints for the cortex did? I was surprised that a whole brain GM x WM connectivity matrix was used in the cortical connectivity mapping procedure, given known problems with false positives etc., when doing whole brain tractography - especially aHer such anatomical detail was considered when deriving the original tracts. Perhaps the intermediary step lowers connectivity specificity and accuracy overall (as per Figure 9), accounting for the poorer performance for cortico-cortical tracts?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The point is well-taken, however it cannot drive the results in Figures 5 and 6. Before explaining this further, let us clarify the raIonale of using the GMxWM connecIvity matrix, which we have published quite extensively in the past for cortico-cortical connecIons (Mars, eLife 2018 - Warrington, Neuroimage 2020 - Roumazeilles, PLoS Biology 2020 - Warrington, Science Advances 2022 – Bryant, J Neuroscience 2025).</p>
<p>Having established the bodies of the tract using the XTRACT protocols, we use this intermediate step of multiplying with a GM x WM connectivity matrix to estimate the grey matter projections of the tracts. The most obvious approach of tracking towards the grey matter (i.e. simply find where tracts intersect GM) has the problem that one moves through bottlenecks in the cortical gyrus and after which fibres fan out. Most tractography algorithms have problems resolving this fanning. However, we take the opposite approach of tracking from the grey matter surface towards the white matter (GMxWM connectivity matrix), thus following the direction in which the fibres are expected to merge, rather than to fan out. We then multiply the GMxWM tractrogram with that of the body of the tract to identify the grey matter endpoints of the tract. This avoids some of the major problems associated with tracking towards the surface. In fact, using this approach improves connectivity specificity towards the cortex, rather than the opposite. We provide some indicative results here for a few tracts:</p>

<title>Connectivity profiles for example cortico-cortical tracts with and without using the intermediary GMxWM matrix.</title>
<p>Tracts considered are the Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus 1 (SLF<sub>1</sub>), Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus 2 (SLF<sub>2</sub>), the Frontal Aslant (FA) and the Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus (IFO). We see that the surface connectivity patterns without using the GMxWM intermediary matrix are more diffuse (effect of “fanning out” gyral bias), with reduced specificity, compared to whenusing the GMxWM matrix</p>

</fig>
<p>Tracking to/from subcortical nuclei does not have the same tractography challenges as tracking towards the cortex and in fact we found that using the intermediary GMxWM matrix is less favourable for subcortex (Figure 9), which is why we opted for not using it.</p>
<p>Regardless of how cortical and subcortical connectivity patterns are obtained, the results in Figures 5 and 6 utilise only cortical connectivity patterns. Hence, no matter what tracts are considered (cortico-cortical or cortico-subcortical) to build the connectivity patterns, these results have been obtained by always using the intermediate step of multiplying with the GMxWM connectivity matrix (i.e. it is not the case that cortical features are obtained with the intermediate step and subcortical features without, all of them have the intermediate step applied, as the connectivity patterns comprise of cortical endpoints). Figure 9 is only applicable for subcortical endpoints that play no role in the comparisons shown in Figures 5 and 6. We hope this clarifies this point.</p>

<p>(14) Methodological clarifications:</p>
<p>The Methods describe how anatomical masks used in tractography were delineated in standard macaque space and then translated to humans using &quot;correspondingly defined landmarks&quot;. Can the authors elaborate as to how this translation from macaques to humans was accomplished?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For a given tract, our process for building a protocol involved looking into the wider anatomical literature, including the standard white matter atlas of Schmahmann and Pandya (2006) and numerous anatomy papers that are referenced in the protocol description, to determine the expected path the tract was meant to take in white matter and which cortical and subcortical regions are connected. This helped us define constraints and subsequently the corresponding masks. The masks were created through the combination of hand-drawn ROIs and standard space atlases. We firstly started with the macaque where tracer literature is more abundant, but, importantly, our protocol definitions have been designed such that the same protocol can be applied to the human and macaque brain. All choices were made with this aspect in mind, hence corresponding landmarks between the two brains were considered in the mask definition (for instance “the putamen”, “a sub-commissural white matter mask”, the “whole frontal pole” etc, as described in the protocol descriptions).</p>
<p>The protocols have not been created by a single expert but have been collated from multiple experts (co-authors SA, SW, DF, KB, SH, SS drove this aspect) and the final definitions have been agreed upon by the authors.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(15) The article heavily utilizes spatial path distribution maps/normalized path distributions, yet does not describe precisely what these are and how they were generated. Can the authors provide more detail, along with the rationale for using these with Pearson's correlations to compare tracts across subjects (as opposed to, e.g., overlap sensitivity/specificity or the Jaccard coefficient)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now clarified in text how these plots are generated, particularly when compared using correlation values. We tried Jaccard indices on binarized masks of the tracts and these gave similar trends to the correlations reported in Figure 4 (i.e. higher similarities within that across cohorts). We however feel that correlations are better than Jaccard indices, as the latter assume binary masks, so they focus on spatial overlap ignoring the actual values of the path distributions, we hence kept correlations in the paper.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Please see Reply to Comment 9 of Reviewer 2. Our protocols can be used to guide tractography using other types of data as they comprise of guiding ROIs for a given tract. So, although we have not tested them beyond FSL-XTRACT, we believe they can be useful with other tractography packages as well, as there is nothing FSL-specific in these anatomically-informed recipes.</p>

<p>“Comparisons with tract tracing. To the degree possible, quantitative comparisons with tract tracing data would bolster confidence in the method.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see Replies to Comments 6 and 11 of Reviewer 2. Briefly, we appreciate the comment and it is something we would love to do, but there are no data readily available that would allow such quanItaIve comparison in a meaningful way. This is a known challenge in the tractography field, which is why NIH has invested in two 5 year Centres to address it. Our approach will provide a solid starIng point for opImising and comparing further cortico-subcortical tractography reconstructions against microscopy and tracers in the same animal and at scale.</p>
