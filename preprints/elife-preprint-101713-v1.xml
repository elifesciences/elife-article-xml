<title>Abstract</title><p>To perceive and navigate complex sensory environments, animals combine sensory information from multiple modalities in specialized brain circuits. Known as multisensory integration, this process typically depends on the existence of co-aligned topographic connections from several sensory areas to downstream circuits exhibiting multimodal representations. How such topographically co-aligned connectivity necessary for multisensory integration gets set up in early stages of development is still unknown. Inspired by the role of spontaneous activity in refining topographic connectivity between early sensory circuits, here we investigated the potential of such spontaneous activity to also guide the co-alignment of multiple sensory modalities in RL, a higher-order associative cortical area rostro-lateral to V1. Analyzing spontaneous activity simultaneously recorded in primary visual and somatosensory cortex and area RL at different developmental ages before sensory experience, we identify candidate features of this activity to guide the emergence of co-aligned topographic multisensory projections with somatosensory leading the visual projection. We confirm this hypothesis using a computational model of activity-dependent circuit refinement, and show that the correlation of spontaneous activity between the visual and somatosensory primary cortex can establish an optimal fraction of multisensory neurons in RL for stimulus decoding. Our model provides an exciting new computational perspective of the role of spontaneous activity in the emergence of topographically co-aligned multimodal sensory representations in downstream circuits, specialized for the processing of rich sensory environments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sensory environments are complex – rich with objects and events that specific brain circuits must decipher to ensure their accurate perception and to guide appropriate behavior. To efficiently perceive and navigate sensory environments, these brain circuits combine information from multiple sensory modalities, including vision, somatosensation, or hearing, a process known as multisensory integration. Several brain regions have been shown to generate multimodal representations, typically by aligning connections from the sensory periphery where specific sensory features are first encoded to downstream projection areas. In the rodent, whiskers transmit tactile sensations which are combined with visual information to guide many behaviors including goal-directed behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], gap crossing and food source detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], navigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], prey-capture behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], and recognizing object features and shapes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Multisensory integration has been reported in subcortical areas such as the superior colliculus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] and the striatum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Higher-order areas (HOAs) situated between primary sensory areas have also been found to play a critical role in multisensory integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. HOAs receive excitatory feedforward input via long-range axonal projections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] and inherit and match cortical maps from primary sensory areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Moreover, connectivity is organized in a topographic manner across the modalities, whereby sensory neurons converge onto higher-order cortex while preserving space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Specifically, visual and tactile stimuli have overlapping representations in a higher order association area, area RL, that lies between the primary visual (V1) and the primary somatosensory (S1) cortices. There is significant spatial alignment between V1 and S1 in area RL; e.g. the lower whisker pad aligns to the lower visual field of view and can elicit responses in the same neurons, called bimodal neurons, in RL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Additionally, this multisensory integration allows for cross-modal generalization. For example, rodents can adapt to changing sensory environments and can generalize sensorimotor tasks to a different modality, i.e. visual, after learning a task from only tactile stimulus, due to aligned abstract representations of these modalities in RL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Finally, evidence shows that rats combine and integrate visual and tactile signals in a supralinear manner, significantly enhancing sensory processing efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Although full functional maturation of visual HOAs occurs only after eye opening, basic properties such as responsiveness to stimuli and topographic organization between V1 (as well as S1) and RL are already present at eye opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Before the onset of sensory experience, primary sensory cortices generate spontaneous activity, which plays a pivotal role in their proper maturation in terms of cellular properties and activity-dependent connectivity refinements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Across the sensory areas, a general developmental profile of spontaneous activity can be observed: early global and dense spontaneous events transition to more localized and sparse patterns, typical of adult networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. By promoting the refinement of appropriate connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], these spontaneous activity patterns prepare the developing cortex for future sensory input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], but at the same time are affected by changing circuitry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Spontaneous activity has been characterized and shown to guide the establishment of hierarchical architectures in HOAs in the visual system before eye opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], but much less is known about its role in the development and topographic co-alignment of multiple sensory modalities in multisensory HOAs.</p>
<p>Whereas activity-independent mechanisms are known to set up the first cues instructing axons where to go [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], activity-dependent synaptic plasticity mechanisms instructed by either spontaneous activity or sensory experience, are crucial in refining this initial imprecise connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Indeed, various forms of Hebbian synaptic plasticity, which promotes the potentiation of synaptic strength as a result of correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity, have been proposed to guide the activity-dependent refinement of circuit connectivity in development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Some experimental work has also measured Hebbianlike learning rules specific to development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Activity-dependent mechanisms likely also contribute to the establishment and alignment of maps from different sensory modalities to downstream circuits, which has been mainly investigated in the rodent superior colliculus and avian optic tectum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. For example, how visual experience aligns the auditory and visual maps during development has been mainly studied by manipulations that cause the two maps to misalign [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. This suggests that these same principles might apply not only to realign and maintain maps after manipulation, but also to the activity-dependent emergence of aligned representations in developing circuits.</p>
<p>Here, we combine computational modeling and calcium imaging experiments to investigate the role of spontaneous activity in the emergence of aligned topographic maps from two primary sensory cortices (visual, V1 and somatosensory, S1) to RL, an associative cortical area rostro-lateral to V1, and the emergence of bimodal responses in RL. We find that spontaneous activity in V1, S1, and RL sparsifies during development, but S1 exhibits more mature activity patterns compared to V1, which desynchronize as early as postnatal day eight. Using these experimental insights, we expand a computational model of activity-dependent connectivity refinement between primary sensory areas (V1 and S1) and RL using biologically plausible Hebbian synaptic plasticity which was previously used to study topographic map-formation and receptive field refinement between the thalamus and V1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Our model predicts that aligned topographic connectivity refinement and the emergence of bimodal neurons requires an intermediate amount of correlation between the primary sensory cortices (V1 and S1), which we investigate in our data. This connectivity refinement through spontaneous activity between the primary sensory areas and RL is sufficient to explain the developmental sparsification in RL whereby RL neurons become responsive to either or both primary sensory cortices in a ratio that ensures optimal information processing.</p>

<title>Spontaneous activity in V1, S1 and RL during development</title>
<p>To investigate how spontaneous activity matures differentially across the mouse’s developing primary visual (V1), somatosensory (S1), and higher-order areas, specifically area RL, we performed two-photon imaging with one field of view per developing cortex in unanesthetized mouse pups at postnatal days (PN) 8-16 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Spontaneous activity was observed across all three cortical areas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). We used a linear mixed model analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>] to estimate the differential effect of age on different aspects of spontaneous activity. As described in previous experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], we found that spontaneous activity in V1, sparsifies throughout development, i.e. the average amplitude, duration, and participation rate of spontaneous activity decrease with age, as reflected in the significant negative effect of age on these properties (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-F, H</xref>, see Methods). In contrast, the frequency of events increases with age, as reflected in the significant positive relationship between age and event rate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G, H</xref>). Similar trends of activity sparsification were also observed in S1 and RL. There were no differences between participation rate across areas, with all areas following a similar decreasing trend over time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F,H</xref>). Furthermore, comparing area RL to V1 also showed no significant differences in duration of events and event rate between these two areas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E,G,H</xref>), although amplitudes were slightly higher in RL compared with V1. However, we observed some significant differences, especially in S1. Specifically, spontaneous events in S1 have significantly lower amplitudes, lower durations, and higher rates compared to the other regions, at younger ages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D,E,G,H</xref>). Together, this suggests that spontaneous activity in S1 has more mature amplitudes, duration, and event rates earlier in development, whereas RL and V1 develop more similarly during the second postnatal week. RL was found to slightly lag behind V1 and S1.</p>

<title>The primary somatosensory and visual cortex exhibit correlated spontaneous activity</title>
<p>Because RL needs to integrate activity from both V1 and S1 simultaneously, we hypothesized that there could be correlated activity between the primary sensory cortices to guide the emergence of this multisensory integration via some activity-dependent mechanism. To this end, we reanalyzed our published wide-field calcium imaging recordings from both V1 and S1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] to assess the temporal relationship between spontaneously occurring activity in these two primary sensory cortices (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that activity between the visual and the somatosensory cortex is often, but not always, temporally synchronized (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Indeed, analyzing the average activity between V1 and S1 of several animals at postnatal days PN9-PN12 revealed a range of Pearson correlation coefficients, with a mean of ∼0.5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Previous work has shown that connectivity between V1 and RL as well as S1 and RL is topographically organized in mature animals to preserve space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, this organization is also aligned across the modalities, i.e. stimuli in the same region of sensory space tend to converge onto the same cells in RL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Hence, in addition to temporal correlations, we evaluated whether spontaneous activity also carries information about spatial topography between the two primary sensory cortices and RL. We computed functional correlation maps for three distinct locations in V1 and RL, as well as three other locations in S1 and RL, showing that spontaneous activity in RL is coordinated topographically relative to both V1 and S1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Thus, spontaneous activity between V1 and RL and between S1 and RL is also spatially correlated and carries topographic information. This suggests that some activity-dependent mechanism might be using these temporal and spatial correlations during development to establish topographic connectivity maps between the primary sensory areas and RL, and hence enable multisensory integration in the adult animal.</p>

<title>Correlated spontaneous activity can generate topographic connectivity between the primary sensory cortex and RL and bimodal cells in RL</title>
<p>To test the hypothesis that an activity-dependent mechanism may use the spatio-temporally structured spontaneous activity in the primary sensory cortices to set up topographic connectivity from each area into RL and generate bimodal cells, we built and analyzed a computational model with three populations of neurons for V1, S1, and RL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. We modeled the activity-dependent synaptic plasticity of feedforward connections between V1 and RL, and S1 and RL, with each area subject to spontaneous activity as characterized before (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). While we initialized the connectivity as random, we included a slight bias for neighboring cells in the primary sensory cortices to project onto neighboring cells in RL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This bias incorporates activity-independent effects like molecular gradients that are known to set up a coarse topography before the onset of activity-dependent plasticity, at least for connectivity between the sensory periphery and subcortical or primary cortical areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Activity-dependent plasticity was implemented through a synaptic plasticity rule involving Hebbian and heterosynaptic terms. The Hebbian term potentiates synaptic weights based on coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity. The additional heterosynaptic term was implemented to depress synaptic weights, but only in the presence of presynaptic activity (see Methods)

<p>This rule was previously derived from interacting molecular neurotrophins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>] and shown to produce selectivity to correlated inputs from random initial connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. We then implemented spatiotemporally correlated spontaneous activity in areas V1 and S1 as measured experimentally (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) which this synaptic plasticity rule used to modify the synaptic weights in the network. Specifically, to implement temporal correlations, S1 and V1 neurons were driven by a combination of events, independent and shared in each V1 and S1. To implement spatial correlations within a given area (V1 or S1), each independent event activated a randomly chosen, contiguous set of neurons, which we have previously shown can establish topographic connectivity between two areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. To implement spatial correlations between V1 and S1, the same set (in terms of topographic identity) of neurons in both S1 and V1 were activated. The common inputs giving rise to shared events might reflect shared inputs from the subcortical areas such as the thalamus or superior colliculus into the primary sensory cortices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>] or correlation induced by direct connections between V1 and S1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>].</p>
<p>Using this spatiotemporally correlated spontaneous activity in the primary sensory cortices, the Hebbian plasticity rule (<xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 1</xref>) refined and stabilized connectivity between V1/S1 and RL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), as shown before in a two-layer network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. We investigated the emergent connectivity properties for a range of V1 and S1 temporal correlations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). To quantify the topographic organization of connectivity between V1 and RL, and S1 and RL, and the alignment of maps from V1/S1 to RL, we defined two mathematical measures, topography and alignment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, see Methods). Weak temporal correlations (where independent events dominate over shared events) resulted in strong competition between the primary sensory cortices with dominant synaptic weight depression. The strong competition generated sparse connectivity matrices to RL, with many RL neurons decoupling from the primary sensory cortices (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, left). This resulted in poor topography and map alignment of the maps between V1/S1 and RL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G,H</xref>). RL had almost no bimodal cells, i.e. neurons that receive input from both primary sensory cortices, in contrast to what is found in mature RL experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). Increasing temporal correlations between the primary sensory cortices increased alignment of the V1/S1 to RL maps (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). However, very strong correlations were detrimental to V1/RL and S1/RL topography (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E,G</xref>). Strong temporal correlation between V1 and S1 rendered many RL neurons selective to visual and somatosensory inputs at the same topographic location as reflected in the identical connectivity matrices (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, right), overriding the initial topographic bias (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Only a medium-strength temporal correlation between V1 and S1, as found experimentally (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), generated a connectivity profile which prevented RL cells to decouple from V1 and S1, while preserving topography (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, middle).</p>
<p>We quantified the percentage of bimodal neurons in our model as a function of the temporal correlation between V1 and S1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). By performing a steady-state analysis of our model (see Methods), we derived the critical amount of temporal correlation, <italic>c</italic>∗, between S1 and V1 required for the emergence of bimodal neurons. This parameter depends solely on two parameters of the model, i.e. the average firing rate of cells in the sensory cortices, ⟨pre⟩, and the heterosynaptic offset from <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 1</xref>,

With these connectivity refinements, the generated activity in RL became sparser in terms of amplitude and participation rate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>), consistent with the sparsification observed in the experimental data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C,D,F</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, our proposed computational model can account for the developmental sparsification of spontaneous activity in higher-order cortical area RL through the refinement of feedforward connectivity between two primary sensory cortices, V1 and S1, and RL. Furthermore, the model predicts that only medium-strength correlations between primary cortices produce topographically organized and aligned connectivity in V1/RL and S1/RL, and a mixture of bimodal and unimodal neurons in RL consistent with experimental data.</p>

<title>More mature spontaneous events in S1 can guide map alignment between V1 and RL</title>
<p>Having established that the spatio-temporal correlations between V1 and S1 can set up topographic and aligned connectivity to RL as well as generate bimodal cells in RL, we next turned to investigate a possible role of the differentially more mature spontaneous activity in S1 compared to V1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). To examine this, we systematically increased the bias of the topographic connectivity between S1 and RL (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). While unsurprisingly a stronger bias improved the topographic connectivity between S1 and RL (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, right), it also improved the topographic organization of connectivity between V1 and RL (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, left, and C). Therefore, spontaneous activity in S1, which matures more rapidly than V1, can guide the refinement of connectivity between V1 and RL.</p>

<title>A mixture of bimodal and unimodal neurons in RL performs optimal decoding of activity</title>
<p>RL is involved in integrating information from different sensory modalities to obtain a more accurate representation of statistically rich sensory environments. In particular, an area that integrates visual and tactile stimuli is able to more accurately infer such information; e.g. when rats use both tactile and visual information, their performance in a task involving determining object orientation is better than the sum of the performance of each modality individually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. To investigate how the topographically aligned cortical connectivity between V1 and RL, and S1 and RL, might facilitate the integration of information from different sensory modalities, we quantified how much information about the activity of each primary sensory cortex can be decoded from the activity in RL. We quantified the amount of decoded information as the coefficient of determination, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>, which can be interpreted as the fraction of variance in V1 or S1 that can be reconstructed from activity in RL. To do this, we fitted a linear regression model using RL activity and both V1 and S1 activity, and calculated <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> from the error between our fitted linear model and each sensory area individually, which we refer to as the ‘V1 or S1 reconstruction’ (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>] (See Methods). <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> is naturally affected by how much activity in V1 or S1 is propagated into RL. In our model (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) and in biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>], some regions of the primary sensory cortices are not connected to RL; for example, RL contains only a partial representation of the visual field, hence V1 cells outside of that region do not project to RL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. Consistently, we found that the fraction of variance reconstructed, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>, for either V1 or S1 independently increased with the percentage of connected neurons from the respective cortex into RL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, see Methods). We showed analytically that a locally connected network, where every primary sensory cortical neuron makes at least one connection to RL and every RL neuron receives at least one connection from the primary sensory cortices, can maximize the total fraction of variance reconstructed for both V1 and S1 if the activity in V1 or S1 is perfectly temporally correlated (correlation = 1) (see Methods). These conditions translate to the scenario where all neurons in RL are bimodal. However, when activity across V1 and S1 is moderately correlated, having some unimodal RL neurons can achieve a higher total maximum fraction of variance for both V1 and S1 compared to the purely bimodal case (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, see Methods). Having unimodal neurons increases variance explained when activity is not perfectly correlated because incomplete information from one modality can be completed with information from the other modality. Furthermore, the activity of unimodal neurons provides unambiguous information about whether only one or both of the primary sensory cortices is active, whereas in the case with all bimodal neurons this is indistinguishable. This suggests that the mixture of unimodal and bimodal neurons in RL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] is the optimal solution for encoding the maximum amount of information from the activity in V1 and S1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We investigated the role of spontaneous activity in the maturation of connectivity from two primary sensory cortices, V1 and S1, to RL, a higher-order association area, by combining computational modeling with experiments. We found that while spontaneous activity sparsifies during development in all investigated areas, S1 exhibits relatively mature, desynchronized activity patterns as early as postnatal day eight. Using these experimental insights, we constructed a computational model of activity-dependent connectivity refinement from each V1 and S1 to RL. To generate topographic connectivity from V1 and S1 to RL, aligned connectivity maps for the two sensory projections and a mixture of unimodal and bimodal neurons in RL, our model predicts that spontaneous activity between V1 and S1 should exhibit moderate temporal correlations, which we also found experimentally. Furthermore, we demonstrated how a more mature somatosensory cortex can guide the refinement of visual cortex connectivity to RL, suggesting that inter-cortical influence plays a central role in the establishment of refined and topographically aligned connectivity during development. Finally, we found that moderate correlations between V1 and S1 result in a mixture of bimodal and unimodal neurons in RL which can optimize information processing in RL when either one modality or both are active. Thus, by combining modeling with experiments, we found that activity-dependent plasticity can instruct the formation of refined and topographically aligned connectivity between primary sensory and high-order cortices in development to produce efficient information integration from multiple modalities.</p>

<title>Origin of correlated events in the primary sensory cortices</title>
<p>We find that early spontaneous activity with medium correlations can lead to the optimal amount of bimodal neurons and alignment of these sensory maps before sensory experience, which is crucial for effective multisensory integration in higherorder cortical areas. Such medium correlations indeed exist in the experimental data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This result makes the prediction that alterations in the correlations in early spontaneous activity might affect later multisensory integration, which can be empirically tested. For instance, spontaneous activity in V1 has been shown to have different correlation properties in a mouse model of Fragile X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>] and in cases of disrupted inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]; our model therefore suggests that multisensory integration in RL may be perturbed in these cases.</p>
<p>What might be the origin of the correlated activity we observed in the visual and somatosensory cortex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>)? One possibility is that the source is external to the animal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>], i.e. a single stimulus with both visual and somatosensory aspects. Indeed, while a substantial portion of activity in the developing cortex occurs independently of sensory stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], both the immature visual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>] and somatosensory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>] cortices exhibit some degree of sensory-driven activity. Although it is unlikely that this external stimuli gives any topographic information before eye opening, it could help to correlate the activity between sensory cortices. Alternatively, subcortical areas like the (primary or higher-order) thalamus are in an ideal position for coordinating activation across distinct regions of the cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. The developing thalamus exhibits spontaneous propagating waves, which have been shown to guide the formation of sensory maps to the cortex and support circuit plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. Spontaneous calcium waves propagate among the different sensory-modality thalamic nuclei up to the cortex and hence provide a means of communication among sensory systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. Finally, correlated events in V1 and S1 could also originate from lateral long-range connections between the visual and somatosensory cortex. These types of connections emerge during the first two postnatal weeks in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>] and potentially directly propagate activation from one area to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. More specifically, it has been shown that postsynaptic excitatory neurons in a subregion near the anterior border of V1, situated in close proximity to S1, receive input from local fast spiking inhibitory neurons that have direct cortico-cortical input from the posterior area of S1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]. This cross modal suppression may contribute to these medium level correlations during development.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Precise timing of map formation</title>
<p>We have shown that the somatosensory cortex’s early maturation is able to drive the aligned topographic development of the visual cortex <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. This agrees with previous work showing earlier development of somatosensory cortex. For example, layer 4 (L4) to L2/3 excitatory synapses in somatosensory cortex were shown to mature 2 weeks earlier than those in visual cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. A similar template for the maturation of one map provided by another is observed in the refinement of cortico-collicular connections. Projections from S1 to the superior colliculus arrive as early as postnatal day 2 while projections from V1 enter the colliculus around postnatal day 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>], giving more time for S1 maps to refine. The precise timing of connectivity refinement between S1 and the superior colliculus likely guides the later developmental connectivity refinement between V1 and the colliculus and helps align the two maps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. Moreover, this process of visual and somatosensory map alignment in the superior colliculus seems to be activity-dependent, with spontaneous activity in the retina playing an important role by driving the alignment of cortico-collicular connections from V1 to a genetically-induced duplicated retino-collicular map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. This modality difference in map refinement with the somatosensory leading the visual map seems to be present also in the refinement of connections between S1 vs. V1 and RL as we have shown earlier. Although the activity-dependent plasticity mechanisms behind this are experimentally unknown, inspired by earlier works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>], our models suggest that similar activity-dependent plasticity involving Hebbian and heterosynaptic terms are sufficient.</p>

<title>Uni- and bimodal neurons in other species</title>
<p>Neurons responding to only a single or to multiple modalities are common in other animals apart from mice, like macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>], cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>], or ferrets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>].

Close examination of the receptive fields of neurons in the associative cortex of the cat revealed that stimulus location is likely represented in a distributed population code and that unimodal neurons could contribute by improving the accuracy of the encoded stimulus location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>]. Furthermore, the response patterns of unimodal neurons in the cat extrastriate cortex revealed that while these neurons do not respond to their non-preferred modality, their activation is nonetheless modulated when non-preferred and preferred stimulus occur at the same time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>], further suggesting that unimodal neurons contribute to a population code. Varying the proportion of uni- and bimodal neurons might thus contribute to a continuum of multisensory responses across different cortical areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>].

A CCD camera (Evolution QEi, QImaging) was controlled by custom-made LabVIEW (National Instruments) based software and images were acquired at a frame rate of 20 Hz.</p>

<title>Image processing</title>
<p>Images were processed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. For two-photon image processing, drift and movement artifacts were removed from each recording using NoRMCorre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>]. Each recording was aligned to the first recording in the series to remove any movements between recording sessions. Delta F stacks were made using the mean fluorescence per pixel as baseline, F<sub>0</sub>. ROIs were hand-drawn using ImageJ (NIH). Automated transient detection and further data processing was performed using custom-made MATLAB software (MathWorks).</p>
<p>Epifluorescence image processing: Delta F stacks were made using the average fluorescence per pixel as baseline.

<p>In two-photon recordings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), activations within each cell were detected as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>] as a peak with both an absolute height and relative prominence of at least 5% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>. When more than 20% of recorded cells were active simultaneously, the activation was considered an event. In wide-field calcium imaging (we re-analyzed data from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>)), events were detected as calcium peaks with an amplitude above 2x the standard deviation.</p>

<title>Functional correlation maps</title>
<p>Functional correlation maps were generated as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] as follows: Three seed areas were chosen (10x10 pixels each) within V1 or S1 and their time courses across a recording were determined by averaging the pixel values in each seed area for each frame of the recording. Next, the Pearson coefficient of correlation between the time courses of each seed area and those of all pixels in the field of view were determined and represented in one image for each seed area. Finally, the three images of each seed area were combined into one RGB image, such that each channel represents one functional correlation map. The actual color of each pixel represents the highest coefficient of correlation value across the three channels. The final RGB map reflects the topographic organization of the recorded spontaneous activity patterns.</p>

<title>Linear mixed model</title>
<p>To correctly account for the nested data structure commonly encountered in neuroscience research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], we fit a linear mixed-effects model that treats animal and sample identity as random factors. We included interaction effects between age and region within our fixed effects. No transformations of the data were performed. Estimated effect sizes are shown in (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Effect sizes on cortical region affect the intercept, but age and age-region interaction estimates affect the slope of the regression line. One-hot encoding was used because the regions are categorical variables. This means that one region, i.e. V1, is chosen as baseline and every other region is compared to this baseline. Any differences due to region are added/subtracted from the intercept for V1. Age and age-region interaction effects change the slope and should therefore be added or subtracted from the estimated slope for region V1. Since PN8 was the earliest age used in our data, 8 was subtracted from all ages so that PN8 is the estimated intercept. Our linear model may not be valid outside of the ages used (PN8-PN16) and no extrapolation should be done without experimental confirmation. This multilevel analysis allowed us to examine the effects of age and cortical region on four response variables: amplitude, event rate, participation rate, and duration. To obtain p-values, we used the Satterthwaite’s degrees of freedom method, as implemented in the <italic>lmerTest</italic> package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>] in R. The linear mixed model formula is:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">

where <italic>y</italic> is one of the response variables, i.e. amplitude, event rate, participation rate, or duration and age is postnatal day. <italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub> is the intercept for V1 at age PN8, and <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub> are the differences in intercept for cortical region (S1 and RL are dummy variables set to 0 if not predicting that region or 1 if predicting that region). <italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub> is the slope for V1 over age and <italic>β</italic><sub>4</sub> and <italic>β</italic><sub>5</sub> are the differences in slope (age-region interaction effects) from V1 over age for the cortical region of interest. <italic>ɛ<sub>ij</sub></italic> is the error from both random effects (mouse ID and sample ID) and residual error.</p>

<title>Rate-based network model</title>
<p>Extending the model introduced by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], we studied a feedforward, rate-based network with two onedimensional input layers, <bold>v</bold> and <bold>s</bold>, and one output layer <bold>r</bold> with <italic>N <sup>v</sup>, N <sup>s</sup></italic>, and <italic>N <sup>r</sup></italic> neurons each. We used periodic boundary conditions in each layer to avoid edge effects. The initial connectivity between <italic>v</italic> and <italic>r</italic>, <italic>W<sub>v</sub></italic>, and <italic>s</italic> and <italic>r</italic>, <italic>W<sub>s</sub></italic>, is initially all-to-all with uniformly distributed weights in the range <italic>w<sub>ini</sub></italic> ∈ [<italic>a, b</italic>]. In addition, a topographic bias was introduced by modifying the initially random connectivity matrix to have the strongest connections between neurons at the matched topographic location. These biased weights decay with a Gaussian profile with increasing distance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>)), with amplitude <italic>a</italic> and spread <italic>s</italic>. During the evolution of the weights, soft bounds were applied on the interval [0<italic>, W<sub>max</sub></italic>].</p>
<p>The input populations <italic>v</italic> and <italic>s</italic> receive spontaneous activation from a homogeneous Poisson process with an inter-event interval of 150s, implemented using a Binomial random variable with sufficiently small time steps. A spontaneous event increased the firing rate of a fraction of neighboring neurons to 1 for <italic>L<sub>dur</sub></italic> seconds. The activity of the output layer <bold>r</bold> is given as a leaky integrator of the input populations,

</disp-formula>
We studied the weight evolution under activity-dependent learning rules. In particular, following [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] we chose a rule that combines Hebbian and heterosynaptic effects that can produce selectivity,
<disp-formula id="eqn5">

</disp-formula>
where <italic>θ</italic> is a heterosynaptic offset constant that defines a distance-dependent heterosynaptic depression. Heterosynaptic plasticity occurs when a nearby unstimulated synapse stabilizes or depresses due to the plasticity in a stimulated one. This helps to stabilize the Hebbian plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> lists all parameters. For simulations with varying correlation values, the % of correlated events is chose from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, U[0,1]. For simulations with varying S1 bias, a Gaussian spread of 4 and a random bias from a uniform distribution between 0.05 to 0.6 was chosen. Simulation time of 500,000 ms was used.</p>

<disp-formula id="eqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="603239v2_eqn7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
This allowed us to write the expected change in weight between (e.g.) the <bold>v</bold> and <bold>r</bold> populations as a function of the input statistics of the <bold>v</bold> and <bold>s</bold> population,
<disp-formula id="eqn8">

This formulation allowed us to investigate the critical required amount of correlation between cells in <bold>v</bold> and <bold>s</bold> that allows for the formation of stable bimodal cells in <bold>r</bold>. In particular, we investigated the expected change of weight in the configuration where all connections between <bold>v</bold> and <bold>r</bold> are fully depressed and only one connection between <bold>s</bold> and <bold>r</bold> is potentiated:

where Cov is the covariance and <italic>µ<sub>v</sub></italic>, <italic>µ<sub>s</sub></italic> are the average firing rates. The critical amount of correlation, where potentiation and depression balance each other out, is characterized by the condition

<title>Optimal weight matrix for correlated input populations</title>
<p>We considered a concatenation of the two “input” populations, <bold>X</bold> = [<bold>v</bold>; <bold>s</bold>] of size <italic>M</italic> × 1, that drive activation in the “output” population, <bold>r</bold> = <italic>ϕ</italic>(<bold>WX</bold>), where <italic>ϕ</italic> is a (possibly non-) linear transfer function, <bold>r</bold> is size <italic>N <sup>r</sup></italic> × 1 and <italic>M</italic> = <italic>N <sup>v</sup></italic> + <italic>N <sup>s</sup></italic>. The decoding problem introduced in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> can be phrased as inferring activity of the input populations from the output population, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603239v2_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> = <bold>A</bold><italic>ϕ</italic>(<bold>WX</bold>), where <bold>A</bold> is the pseudoinverse of <bold>W</bold>, <bold>A</bold> = (<bold>W</bold><italic><sup>T</sup></italic> <bold>W</bold>)<italic><sup>−</sup></italic><sup>1</sup><bold>W</bold><italic><sup>T</sup></italic>. We then searched for the optimal weight matrix, <bold>W</bold><italic><sub>opt</sub></italic> = [<bold>W</bold><italic><sup>v</sup>,</italic> <bold>W</bold><italic><sup>s</sup></italic>] of size <italic>N <sup>r</sup></italic> × <italic>M</italic>, where <bold>W</bold><italic><sup>v</sup></italic> represents the weights from <bold>v</bold> to <bold>r</bold>, and <bold>W</bold><italic><sup>s</sup></italic> represents the weights from <bold>s</bold> to <bold>r</bold>, that minimizes the squared error between <bold>X</bold> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603239v2_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, <bold>E</bold> = (<bold>X</bold> − <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603239v2_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>)<sup>2</sup> and therefore maximizes <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>As the dimension of <bold>r</bold> is substantially smaller than the dimension of <bold>X</bold>, dim(<bold>r</bold>) ≪ dim(<bold>X</bold>), the optimal weight matrix needs to preserve the largest possible amount of variability of the input while projecting it into a lower dimensional space. Using insights from principal component analysis theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>], we can demonstrate that the optimal weight matrix is composed of eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of <bold>X</bold> with the largest eigenvalues,
<disp-formula id="eqn15">
<graphic xlink:href="603239v2_eqn15.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
To better understand the structure of the eigenvectors, we can exploit the fact that in our set-up the covariance matrix, <italic>C</italic> is circular, i.e. every row of <bold>X</bold><italic><sup>T</sup></italic> <bold>X</bold> can be obtained by a cyclic shift of the generating vector, <italic>c</italic> = [<italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub><italic>, c</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>, …, c<sub>M−</sub></italic><sub>1</sub>]:
<disp-formula id="eqn16">
<graphic xlink:href="603239v2_eqn16.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Eigenvectors and eigenvalues of circulant matrices have well-known closed form solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>]. The eigenvectors are the Fourier modes:
<disp-formula id="eqn17">
<graphic xlink:href="603239v2_eqn17.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>ω</italic> = <italic>e</italic><sup>2</sup><italic><sup>πi/M</sup></italic>, a primitive <italic>M</italic> -th root of unity. The corresponding eigenvalues can be computed as
<disp-formula id="eqn18">
<graphic xlink:href="603239v2_eqn18.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Since the covariance matrix is symmetric, i.e. <italic>c<sub>j</sub></italic> = <italic>c<sub>M−j</sub></italic> for all <italic>j</italic> and all values are real in the covariance matrix we can rewrite the eigenvalues in terms of their real parts:
<disp-formula id="eqn19">
<graphic xlink:href="603239v2_eqn19.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
For a real-symmetric circulant matrix, the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvectors are themselves eigenvectors:
<disp-formula id="eqn20">
<graphic xlink:href="603239v2_eqn20.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<disp-formula id="eqn21">
<graphic xlink:href="603239v2_eqn21.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>The first <italic>M/</italic>2 eigenvectors with nonzero eigenvalues from <bold>v</bold> and <bold>w</bold> will comprise <bold>W</bold><italic><sub>opt</sub></italic> which maximizes <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>. Only the first <italic>M/</italic>2 are used since the dimension of <bold>r</bold> is <italic>M/</italic>2 in our case where <italic>N <sup>v</sup></italic> = <italic>N <sup>s</sup></italic> and can have a maximum of <italic>M/</italic>2 eigenvectors.</p>
<p>Our experimental set-up with correlated input populations translates into a generating vector <italic>c</italic> that has nonzero terms around the diagonal and offset from the diagonal by <italic>M/</italic>2. If the inputs between V1 and S1 are fully correlated, then <italic>c<sub>k</sub></italic> = 1 for <italic>k</italic> ∈ {0<italic>, . . . , W/</italic>2, (<italic>M</italic> − 1)<italic>/</italic>2 − <italic>W/</italic>2<italic>, . . . ,</italic> (<italic>M</italic> − 1)<italic>/</italic>2 + <italic>W/</italic>2, (<italic>M</italic> − 1) − <italic>W/</italic>2<italic>, . . . , M</italic> − 1} and <italic>c<sub>k</sub></italic> = 0 else, where <italic>W</italic> is the extent of spatial correlation of the neurons. Taking this into consideration and removing any terms that simplify to zero due to the periodicity of the cosine function gives us the eigenvalues:
<disp-formula id="eqn22">
<graphic xlink:href="603239v2_eqn22.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Hence, the eigenvectors with nonzero eigenvalue of the covariance matrix are exactly the first half of the eigenvectors of the sin and cos functions with an even-numbered period. Due to this simplification of the odd <italic>j</italic>’s leading to <italic>λ<sub>j</sub></italic> = 0 and even numbered periods, this results in eigenvectors that are identical on the indices {0<italic>, . . . , M/</italic>2 − 1} and {<italic>M/</italic>2<italic>, . . . , M</italic> } which is the definition of a bimodal cell and therefore all cells must be bimodal to maximize the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> when input correlation = 1 between V1 and S1.</p>

<p>Dwulet et al. combined experimental and modeling approaches to investigate how correlated spontaneous activity in the mouse's primary visual (V1) and primary somatosensory (S1) areas drives the development of multisensory integration in area RL. Notably, they focused on early developmental stages, before sensory experience occurs. Consistent with previous experimental findings, the authors first demonstrated that spontaneous activity becomes more sparse across development in all three areas, as measured by event amplitude, event duration, and participation ratio. Using a linear mixed model analysis to compare the maturation of this spontaneous activity, they found evidence that S1 matured the fastest. The authors then presented experimental evidence suggesting that these spontaneous events were moderately correlated both spatially and temporally.</p>
<p>They hypothesized that activity-dependent mechanisms use these correlations to establish connectivity across these regions. To test this hypothesis, the authors modeled a feedforward network with connections from S1 to RL and from V1 to RL, where the strength of connections depended on a Hebbian term for potentiation and a heterosynaptic term for depression. By investigating different levels of V1-S1 correlations, they found that moderate levels of correlation led to the significant development of topographically organized connectivity while maintaining a mix of bimodal and unimodal cells in RL. Additionally, when simulating a network with a more mature S1, they observed that topographical maps improved not only between S1 and RL but also between V1 and RL. Finally, the authors use linear regression to suggest that the mixture of bimodal and unimodal cells in RL is optimal for encoding the maximum amount of information from both V1 and S1.</p>
<p>However, there are significant gaps between the experimental data and the modeling setup, which weaken the paper's conclusions. Additionally, some key details are omitted, making it difficult to fully assess their analysis and interpret some of their figures.</p>
<p>(1) Some of the statistical measures and techniques in Figure 1 could benefit from clearer definitions. While the thresholds for activation (peak with at least 5% dF/F0) and events (20% of recorded cells activated simultaneously) are provided, event duration and participation rate are not clearly defined. Based on this definition of event alone, it is unclear why the minimum participation rate in Figure 1F is not 20%. Additionally, the conclusion that S1 matures earlier than RL and V1 could be strengthened by including a direct comparison between S1 and RL, as the current analysis only compares these areas to V1.</p>
<p>(2) The wide-field experiments in Figure 2 could be expanded to support the feedforward modeling assumptions. Currently, the spatial and temporal correlations presented leave open the possibility that these spontaneous events are traveling waves propagating from V1 to RL to S1 (or vice versa). This scenario would suggest a different connectivity scheme for the model. Clarifying this point with additional data analysis, specifically including temporal correlations involving RL, could provide stronger support for the model's assumptions.</p>
<p>(3) The functional correlation map in Figure 2D appears contradictory to the authors' modeling assumption that inputs are correlated spatially in V1 and S1. While V1 seed points align topographically with RL, this organization breaks down when extended into S1. In contrast, and in support of the modeling assumption, Figure 2E shows clearer topography across all three regions. A discussion of this discrepancy would be helpful, as it's a key conclusion of the figure. Additionally, it is unclear when this data was collected during development. Clarifying the developmental stage and analyzing how this map changes over time could strengthen the results.</p>
<p>(4) The modeling of spontaneous events with fixed amplitude and duration seems inconsistent with the experimental data in Figure 1, which shows variability in these parameters. This is particularly confusing in Figure 4, where S1 maturation is modeled as a stronger topographical alignment with RL, but the experimental data defines maturation based on amplitude, duration, and event rates. Justifying these modeling choices or adapting the model to reflect experimental variability would create a better connection between the theory and data.</p>
<p>(5) Several important details of the mathematical model are missing or unclear, partly due to typos. The Results section mentions the general framework of the input correlation matrix (e.g., &quot;S1 and V1 neurons were driven by a combination of events, independent and shared in each V1 and S1&quot; and &quot;each independent event activated a randomly chosen, contiguous set of neurons&quot;), but the specifics are not fully explained. Additionally, the caption of Figure 5 refers to a non-linear transfer function (a sigmoid), but these details are not provided in the Methods section, which instead suggests a linear model was used. A careful review of the main text and Methods section would help ensure that all the necessary details are included and that the story is both complete and accurate.</p>
<p>(6) While Figure 5 supports the paper's conclusion that a mixture of unimodal and bimodal neurons in RL optimizes information encoding, the authors missed an opportunity to strengthen the connection between the model and experimental data. Specifically, they could apply this reconstruction method to the experimental data and examine how RL's ability to reconstruct V1/S1 activity changes across development. Their model predicts that this performance would improve over time, and if this trend is observed in the experimental data, it would provide strong validation that these feedforward connections are developing in line with the model's predictions.</p>

<p>The authors aim to investigate the role of spontaneous activity in shaping the development of multisensory integration in the brain, specifically focusing on the connections between primary visual and somatosensory sensory areas (V1 and S1) and a higher-order cortical area rostro-lateral to V1 (RL). They seek to understand how spontaneous activity guides the formation of aligned topographic maps and the emergence of bimodal neurons in RL.</p>
<p>First, the authors found that spontaneous activity in all three areas sparsifies over time, but S1 exhibits more mature patterns earlier than V1 and RL. They claimed that correlated activity among neighboring regions of these areas during development carries topographic information. These data were used to implement a computational model that employed Hebbian rules of synaptic plasticity. The model indicated that correlated spontaneous activity can generate topographic connectivity between S1/V1 and RL and bimodal neurons in RL. The model suggested that the more mature spontaneous activity in S1 can guide map alignment between V1 and RL. In addition, the model also suggested that a mixture of bimodal and unimodal neurons in RL is optimal for decoding information from V1 and S1.</p>
<p>While the data presented in the manuscript is promising and provides preliminary insights into the role of spontaneous activity in multisensory integration, it would be beneficial to strengthen the experimental foundation regarding the correlation between V1, S1, and RL. Incorporating more rigorous spatio-temporal analyses of spontaneous activity could enhance the robustness of these findings.</p>
<p>Here are some important concerns:</p>
<p>(1) The analysis of how spatial topography influences activity correlations in Figure 2 has several issues.</p>
<p>
1a. While squares in V1 and S1 covered a small area of these sensory areas, the correlated territories in RL covered the entire area of RL. The topographic map in V1 continues caudally, so where is the rest of the map in RL? Something similar applies to the relationship between S1 and RL.</p>
<p>
1b. It is essential to know how areas were drawn. High precision is required.</p>
<p>
1c. It is not clear if correlated activity means different events in sync or large events that cover 2 or all 3 cortical areas of interest. The figure points to the second option, which contradicts the size of events at these stages, mainly in the oldest mice analyzed here.</p>
<p>
1d. It is fundamental to know in detail and provide examples of how the detection of events was performed. For instance, could the dispersion of light from an event in V1 close to RL cause the detection of activity in RL?</p>
<p>(2) For the correlations among V1, S1, and RL, it is crucial to have a consistent method to delineate the borders of cortical areas. The authors mention in one sentence that areas were drawn according to a reference map. More details are needed to convince the reader that the borders are accurate, especially because their shape and position change with age.</p>
<p>(3) The results from the model seem to be based on the initial bias in connectivity between neighboring cells from the different areas. Then, it seems straightforward that implementing correlated activity with Hebbian and synaptic depression rules will force the strengthening of connections between spatially close cells. Despite this apparent predisposition of the model towards a defined outcome, the flaws in the experimental data used prevent a rigorous interpretation of the computational model.</p>
<p>(4) In the Introduction, the authors nicely and briefly explain the role of primary and higher-order sensory cortices in information processing. They also explain how spontaneous activity during development helps to build these circuits by refining connections or establishing hierarchies. They continue explaining the relevance of aligning different topographic maps to allow multisensory integration. Then they provide some examples of sites of multisensory integration. This provides a general context for the data presented in the Results section; however, and importantly, there is no specific introduction of why they are interested in RL and its interaction with V1 and S1. The authors should introduce the RL area and explain why it is an interesting site for multisensory processing.</p>
<p>(5) The results shown in Figure 1 corroborate published data from Golshani et al, Rochefort et al, Murakami et al. While the reproduction of data is more than welcome, the authors should specify which part of the data is completely new and acknowledge clearly the rest as corroboration of previous data. The sentence &quot;As described in previous experiments ...&quot; partially acknowledges this fact but is not clear enough. In addition, the transition between this part of the manuscript and the next data is not smooth. Data seems to be used to feed the model so perhaps the organization of the manuscript leaves room for improvement.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study by Dwulet et al. explores how the development of spontaneous neural activity in primary sensory cortices influences the co-alignment of multiple sensory modalities in higher-order brain areas (HOAs). To address this question, they focus on connectivity between the primary visual (V1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices and an associative cortical area (RL) in mice. The authors combine experimental (wide-field and two-photon calcium imaging) and computational approaches to show that spontaneous activity matures at a different pace across these brain regions. Their data indicate that S1 develops more rapidly than V1, which is possibly beneficial for RL's integration of visual and somatosensory inputs through correlated spontaneous activity. Using a computational model, they demonstrate that a moderate correlation between V1 and S1 activity can optimally guide the formation of bimodal neurons in RL, which are crucial for maximizing the decodability of multisensory stimuli. This finding highlights the role of correlated spontaneous activity in primary sensory cortices in establishing co-aligned topographic multimodal sensory representations in downstream circuits.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written and it provides strong enough evidence to support the main claim of the authors. The insights on the role of correlated activity on instructing co-aligned multisensory maps in HOAs are not trivial and are an important advancement for the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In the opinion of this reviewer, the study has no major weaknesses. A drawback of the work is that none of the predictions of the computational modeling have been corroborated through mechanistic experimental manipulations of early brain activity.</p>
