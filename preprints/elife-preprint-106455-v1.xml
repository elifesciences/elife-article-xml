<title>Abstract</title><p>Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) allows to visualize the molecular architecture of pristinely preserved cells and tissues. The workflow of sample preparation for cryo-ET is rather complex; it involves vitrification by rapid freezing followed by cryo-Focused Ion Beam (FIB) milling rendering the volumes of interest thin enough for cryo-ET data acquisition. The established protocols for single cells grown on or deposited on EM-grids are not suitable for multicellular plant tissues. Plunge-freezing does not yield vitrified samples in most cases and must be replaced by high-pressure freezing. This, in turn, necessitates extensive modifications of the subsequent FIB milling procedures. In this communication we describe procedures for sample screening, targeted FIB milling guided by cryo-fluorescence microscopy and a novel lamella trimming step that allows to obtain homogenously thin lamellae suitable for cryo-ET. We have tested all the steps along the workflow with a variety of plant tissues including the moss <italic>Physcomitrium patens</italic> and tissues of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Limonium bicolor</italic>. We could demonstrate that the workflow optimized for plant tissues allows to attain subnanometer resolution in cases where subtomogram averaging is applicable.</p>

<title>Main text</title>
<p>New imaging modalities in conjunction with advances in sample preparation can pave the way for unprecedented insights into the structural organization of cells and tissues. Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET), i.e. the application of tomographic principles of image acquisition and reconstruction to biological materials in a frozen-hydrated state, allows to visualize the molecular architecture of unperturbed cellular environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. It combines the power of high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging with close-to-life structural preservation and provides faithful representations of the physiological state of cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Instead of disrupting cells, fractioning their molecular inventory, and studying its components in isolation, cryo-ET allows to visualize them <italic>in situ</italic> embedded in their functional environments. Thereby, the network of interactions underlying cellular physiology is preserved and can be revealed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Moreover, many supramolecular assemblies cannot be isolated without compromising their structural integrity. Advances in technology and methodology have established structural biology in cells or <italic>in situ</italic> as a viable alternative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Today, cryo-ET is widely deployed and increasingly popular at the interface of molecular biology and cell biology – with exception of the plant sciences, where technical issues have hampered its use.</p>
<p>The critical part of the process is the vitrification of plant tissues by rapid freezing. Typically, plant cells are larger (diameter 10 – 100 µm) than yeast, algae or mammalian cells and they often contain solute depleted vacuoles occupying up to 90 % of their cellular volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Plunge-freezing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, the most convenient way to achieve vitrification, works reliably only for cells smaller than 10 µm. While cryoprotectants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> may be used to increase vitrification depth, for larger cells and tissues, High-Pressure Freezing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> (HPF) must be applied and still not always guarantees full vitrification. Moreover, it is challenging to make HPF compatible with the subsequent step of the cryo-ET workflow: thinning the sample to make it suitable for electron tomography data acquisition. This is achieved by Focused Ion-Beam (FIB) milling, where material is ablated from the ice-embedded sample until thin sheets (lamellae) with thicknesses of 100 - 300 nm are obtained<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. To ensure that features of interest are included in the lamella, FIB milling is often guided by cryo-Fluorescence Light Microscopy (FLM), pinpointing the spatial location of structures of interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Recently, progress has been made in the preparation lamellae from HPF samples for cryo-ET<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. These new procedures, however, have not yet been put into practice for plant tissue.</p>
<p>Therefore, almost all structural studies of plant systems have opted for an alternative route, namely HPF followed by freeze substitution. In this process, high-pressure frozen samples are dehydrated, metal-impregnated and embedded in a resin allowing sectioning and imaging at room temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. While this approach generally preserves cellular ultrastructure better than chemical fixation followed by metal staining and resin embedding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, it is impossible to ascertain that vitrification has been adequately achieved in the first instance. To visualize and interpret structures at the molecular level, the only suitable method is cryo-ET, with samples unadulterated by dehydration and chemical modifications.</p>
<p>In this study, we describe workflows suitable for the preparation of plant tissues for cryo-ET. First, we applied them to protonemata and phyllids of the moss <italic>Physcomitrium patens</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> forming one-dimensional chains and two-dimensional sheets, respectively, of cylindrical cells with diameters of 15-30 µm. We employed FIB-milling guided by FLM, specifically targeting cell junctions, to show that features small compared to the size of whole cells can be addressed. Later we adapted the methods to several other species including more challenging tissues to demonstrate the potential of the workflows, which we believe are not limited to plants but widely applicable also to other, multicellular systems.</p>

<title>Plunge-freezing does not vitrify <italic>Physcomitrium patens</italic> tissues</title>
<p>First, we applied the standard plunge-freezing and FIB milling workflow to <italic>P. patens</italic> protonemata and phyllids. As the cells were exposed on the surface of grids, the identification of cell junctions was possible using secondary electron images derived with the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and FIB, without the need for fluorescence targeting by correlation to FLM data (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). Overviews of lamellae recorded in a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), however, revealed that the cells were not vitreous (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, N = 15). The formation of large ice crystals during plunge-freezing resulted in distortion of the cellular architecture and the generation of severe TEM imaging artefacts.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="638237v1_fig1.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>We also performed plunge-freezing with glycerol, sucrose and proline additives serving as cryoprotectants (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These, however, did either not prevent crystalline ice formation or induce plasmolysis (data not shown). In some cases, the tissue was even severely dehydrated (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1f</xref>). Thus, we concluded that it is challenging to vitrify <italic>P. patens</italic> tissues by plunge-freezing. While the success of plunge-freezing is sample dependent, we anticipate similar vitrification problems for vascular plants and mosses with cells of similar or larger size.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>The “Waffle” Method utilized for <italic>P. patens</italic></title>
<p>Next, we tested the “Waffle” Method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> to vitrify protonemata. The tissue was placed on the back of an EM-grid, i.e. on the reverse side of a continuous support film and squeezed into the buffer-filled wells formed by the EM-grid bars and support film prior to HPF. While this approach damages cells on top of grid bars, the cells within grid squares remain intact. Hence, using EM-grids with large squares (50-100 mesh) maximizes the area of intact, vitreous tissue.</p>
<p>In contrast to plunge-frozen samples, the cells on “waffle” grids are embedded in a layer of vitreous buffer and not exposed at the sample surface (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). Therefore, we screened “waffle” grids in a cryo-FLM recording the green cellular autofluorescence to identify single layers of intact protonemata tissue with cell junctions in the center of grid squares (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Furthermore, squares with multiple cell layers were ignored as only a single layer of protonemata fits into the 25 µm high well of the used grids without mechanical damage caused by compression (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3b-c</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="638237v1_fig2.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Subsequently, we loaded the samples into a FIB/SEM instrument equipped with an integrated Fluorescence Light Microscope (int-FLM) for lamella preparation. While lamella milling of plunge frozen samples can be done by ablating material with the FIB from a shallow angle, milling “waffle” grids requires additional steps. First, the target area must be located laterally, i.e. parallel to the sample surface. Then holes, referred to as trenches, are milled around the target area with the FIB axis perpendicular to the sample surface (trench milling orientation, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Afterwards, the axial position of the target area is determined followed by thinning the sample from a shallow angle to obtain a lamella (lamella milling orientation, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Correlating the FLM images with FIB images is difficult due to the near-featureless surface of “waffle” grids. For lateral targeting, a marker hole was milled in trench milling orientation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) into a grid square containing a target area identified previously in the FLM. Marker and target area were then localized in sample top views recorded with the int-FLM (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>) and the measured distance between them was used to guide trench milling (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2e</xref>). To ensure that the cell junction is contained within the final lamella with a thickness of only a few hundred nanometers, it must also be targeted in the axial dimension, i.e. within the thickness of the sample. For plunge frozen samples, 3D-correlative light microscopy and FIB milling allows axial targeting by using cryo-FLM z-stacks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. This approach, however, is difficult to apply to thick samples, because of poor axial resolution, depth dependent aberrations and difficulties in registration between 3D-stacks and FIB images of HPF samples. We applied two different imaging modalities for axial targeting. First, cellular components like cell walls, membranes or organelles can be visualized by SEM block-face imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, if they are exposed at the FIB milled surface after trench milling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). Second, when the target area is buried beyond the surface, the int-FLM can be used in the “FIB-view” mode (Capitanio <italic>et al</italic>., will soon be described in a manuscript). Here, int-FLM images are not acquired as top views but with the stage in lamella milling orientation (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>) from the same shallow angle at which the lamella is thinned to its final thickness (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, the lamella was further thinned in several successive steps (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). At a thickness of 6 µm a notch similar to reference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> but larger was milled to allow for movements of more than 1 µm to prevent lamella bending in the type of samples studied here (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>). Afterwards, the lamella was thinned to its final thickness of 100-300 nm (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>) and imaged in a TEM.

<title>Optimization of Serial Lift-Out for lamella quality</title>
<p>The cell junctions we targeted in this work have a diameter of 15-25 µm. The process of “waffle” milling results in a single lamella of a few hundred nanometers in thickness. Thus, about 98% of the targeted volume is lost. Additionally, as targeting and trench milling are time-consuming processes, the yield of a single lamella per site renders the technique low throughput. An alternative to “waffle” milling is Serial Lift-Out<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Here, the entire target area is extracted by lift-out (Supplementary Movie 1 and 2) and cut into several sections that are attached to a receiver grid. Those sections are then fine milled, resulting in multiple lamellae sampling the target area, increasing the throughput and the contextual information obtained<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We explored both attachment methods proposed in the original paper: single-sided and double-sided attachment. For the single sided attachment, redeposition milling was used to attach only one side of a section to a pin (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>, Supplementary Movie 3). In our hands, this was the simplest attachment method as it required less precise maneuvering of the lift-out system, but the resulting lamellae often bent during fine milling (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6f</xref>), especially when thinned below 200 nm as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Lamella loss during the transfer between microscopes was also more frequent (Supplementary Figure 6). Furthermore, lamellae were unstable during data acquisition, often resulting in poor data quality.</p>
<p>For the double-sided attachment, the width of the lift-out block was adjusted to fit precisely between two grid bars of a 400×100 mesh grid. Attachment of the section on both sides (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>, Supplementary Movie 4) prevents bending during fine milling and results in lamellae which are stable during microscope transfers and data acquisition. This approach, however, requires more precision with the micromanipulator system and user experience.</p>
<p>In the context of the present study, we adapted the double-sided attachment method to focus on lamella quality rather than quantity. To this end, we milled plateaus into grid bars onto which the lift-out block could then be placed. The sections were then attached to the plateaus from below (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>, Supplementary Movie 5). While milling the plateaus increases the expenditure of time (15-25 min per section), it leads to robust attachment and is easier to learn for lift-out beginners because it requires less precision concerning the dimensions of the lift-out block. The reduced precision requirement also allows Serial Lift-Out to be performed on FIB systems with stage instabilities or with imperfections in the FIB optics. For all three attachment methods, we obtained vitreous lamellae (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>) and recorded tomograms revealing the subcellular organization of <italic>P. patens</italic> with an unprecedented level of detail (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, Supplementary Movie 6).</p>
<p>Generating homogeneously thin lamellae is challenging, especially if they are larger than 10-20 µm along the milling direction. To improve lamella quality, we included an additional step to the Serial Lift-Out workflow, namely section trimming. After the attachment, int-FLM top views were acquired for all sections to check which of them contained the target area (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). This also allowed to identify regions of the sections with no features of interest which were removed by FIB milling in trench milling orientation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>), minimizing the depth of the lamella in the thinning direction. During the lift-out process, the front of the lift-out block becomes damaged and uneven due to repeated ion exposures. At least 2 µm of the section front were also removed to create a new, smooth front. This trimming step makes fine milling faster because less material must be ablated and allows to generate homogeneously thin lamellae as the smooth front prevents curtaining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Lift-out in different stage orientations</title>
<p>On “waffle” grids of <italic>P. patens</italic>, the axis of the cylindrical protonemata cells is always roughly parallel to the grid surface. Thus, on-grid “waffle” milling and lift-out with the stage in the lamella milling orientation (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref> left panel, Supplementary Movie 1) will inevitably yield sections roughly parallel to this axis (longitudinal sections). Performing lift-out in the trench milling orientation on cells with the protonemal axis oriented roughly parallel to the lift-out direction, cross-sections can be obtained (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref> right panel, Supplementary Movie 2), analogous to <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> L1 larval cross-sections in reference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Thus, it is possible to address samples which can only be frozen in distinct orientations from different directions, which is crucial to study subcellular structures with defined orientation within cells.</p>

<title>In-carrier high-pressure freezing</title>
<p>During “waffle” freezing, <italic>P. patens</italic> protonemata can be damaged for two reasons. First, the filaments are larger than the squares of the EM-grids used and cells running across grid bars will be squeezed. Second, often multiple cell layers were pressed into the 25 µm high well formed by the grid bars which is not high enough to accommodate them without compression. To avoid this mechanical damage, we high-pressure froze protonemata directly in HPF carriers with a 2 mm wide and 100 µm deep cavity.</p>
<p>While the procedure of in-carrier high-pressure freezing is fast, it comes with additional challenges. First, samples cannot be screened easily in a FLM because carriers do not fit into the commercial shuttle. Thus, montage overviews were recorded with the int-FLM (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). In our systems, this takes longer and yields poorer quality images due to widefield imaging and the low numerical aperture of the objective. Nevertheless, the obtained montage overviews were sufficient to identify target areas. Trench milling aided by int-FLMs was then performed as described in the previous section (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9b</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, lamellae must be prepared by lift-out methodologies as trench milling through the carrier is impractical. Additionally, the lift-out block must be detached from the bulk also from below and not only on all four sides as for “waffle” grids. This requires milling an undercut after trench milling in lamella milling orientation (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9c</xref>, Supplementary Movie 7 and 8).</p>
<p>Third, in-carrier HPF samples are thicker than typical “waffle” grids. Thus, the axial targeting via SEM block-face imaging or FIB-view imaging with the int-FLM is crucial to ensure that the undercut is milled below the target area and that it is extracted completely (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9c</xref>). Apart from these technical complications, lift-out and sectioning was then performed as for “waffle” samples, with the added benefit that in-carrier HPF potentially allows to vitrify thicker samples.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Compared to the “standard” cryo-ET workflow, comprising plunge-freezing, on-grid lamella milling and data acquisition, working with high-pressure frozen samples is technologically more demanding and has a lower throughput and success rate. Hence, if a sample can be vitrified by plunge-freezing, it still is the method of first choice. We must assume, however, that most plant tissues are too thick to be vitrified by plunge-freezing and must instead be high-pressure frozen.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of the sample, there are several high-pressure freezing variants. For the “Waffle” Method without spacer ring, the thickness of the EM-grid defines the maximum thickness of the sample. While standard EM-grids have a thickness of 20-25 µm, thicknesses between 8-100 µm are commercially available. Additionally, the shape (e.g. square, hexagon, hole and slot) and the size of the mesh can be chosen to match the shape of the tissue. For samples exceeding 100 µm thickness, spacer rings can be added, as exemplified here on <italic>A. thaliana</italic> embryos. The advantage of “waffle” grids is that they allow on-grid lamella preparation and no undercut is required when performing lift-out. Samples with diameters of up to 2 mm and a maximum thickness of 200-300 µm can potentially be high-pressure frozen in HPF carriers without risking squeezing damage by grid bars. In this case, on-carrier lamella preparation is currently technologically impractical and lift-out methodologies are required.</p>
<p>Vitrification is fundamental for preserving the sample in a near-native state and has a strong impact on the cryo-ET data quality and subsequently subtomogram averaging. We obtained data from clearly vitrified, thus apparently structurally intact samples in many cases. The success rate, however, was very sample-dependent. All our <italic>A. thaliana</italic> embryo and <italic>L. bicolor</italic> samples were vitreous (N = 4 and N = 1, respectively), perhaps due to the cells, which are densely packed with cellular components and the absence of large vacuoles. For <italic>P. Patens</italic>, the success rate was 47% (N = 45, Supplementary Figure 6a). Occasionally, even cells from within the same grid square differed in their vitrification state. We applied similar methods to the trichomes of <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> and observed large ice crystals in all of them (N = 10). This illustrates that obtaining consistent vitrification results with high-pressure freezing can still be a major challenge for some samples. Moreover, certain samples require harvesting or dissection before being manually mounted in HPF carriers, which inevitably damages or stresses the cells and may result in artifacts. Hence, the preparation of samples for HPF should be as sift as possible while minimizing the perturbation of the system under investigation. It would therefore be beneficial to develop new protocols or even methods, that are largely user independent or completely automated, highly reproducible and capable of even vitrifying larger and thicker tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Additionally, HPF samples demand a targeted approach, since the cells are not exposed on the sample surface but submerged in a layer of vitreous buffer. The localization of target areas requires fluorescent markers or autofluorescence. For lateral targeting in the x-y-plane of the sample, grids were screened in a stand-alone cryo-FLM to identify suitable grid squares. Next, int-FLMs proved practical to guide trench milling. To ensure that the target area is contained within the final lamella or lift-out block, its axial position (location within sample thickness) must be determined. SEM block-face imaging after trench milling is one option. It is only applicable, however, if sufficiently contrast-rich features, like membranes, in the vicinity of the target area are exposed at the block-face. The second option is FIB-view imaging which can be applied if a fluorescently labelled or autofluorescent target is discernible in int-FLM images.</p>
<p>On-grid “waffle” milling has the lowest methodological entry barrier and does not require lift-out. It is faster for screening several locations per grid and assessing the sample quality than Serial Lift-Out. At the same time, it exhibits a lower throughput by obtaining only a single lamella per targeted area. Additionally, fine milling for our “waffle” samples must be done at relatively high stage tilts (20°) to fully access the target area and it is often difficult to remove all material below lamellae. Both factors restrict the angular range for tomographic data acquisition and, in turn, compromises data quality. For large target areas, like in our case the junction between cells, Serial Lift-Out is the preferred method. While it requires some training and a lift-out system, after sectioning, fine milling is faster and more straightforward than for “waffle” milling and can be performed at shallow angles. The full ±60° tilt range for cryo-ET, can therefore be accessed.</p>
<p>For plant samples, single-sided attachment is the fastest lift-out approach requiring least user precision. But smaller lamella dimensions, potential bending and instabilities during data collection must be considered. In comparison, double-sided attachment yields lamellae that are easier to thin homogeneously without bending and produce higher quality data. For the double-sided attachment, we tested two methods. The side-attachment (i), as described originally in reference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> needs little modifications of the receiver grid and consequently requires less expenditure of time. Yet, fitting the lift-out block precisely between the grid bars allows only for an error of a few hundred nanometers. Hence, it requires most user expertise, a mechanically very stable stage and lift-out system as well as well-aligned ion optics. The attachment from below (ii) is more time-consuming due to the additional generation of plateaus but adjusting the size of the lift-out block and placing it on the plateaus tolerates manipulation errors of a few micrometers. Therefore, the attachment from below is likely easier to adopt for lift-out novices.</p>
<p>The additional trimming step introduced here focuses on obtaining highest lamella quality over quantity. First, int-FLM top views of Serial Lift-Out sections confirm that the target area is captured within followed by removal of regions that do not contain material of interest in trench milling orientation. This minimizes the lamella size in the fine milling direction and centers the target between smooth fronts which is important to obtain homogeneously thin lamellae during the subsequent fine milling in lamella milling orientation.</p>
<p>To further increase the throughput and reduce the experience defined entry barrier, automation is important. Since we explored multiple samples which all behaved differently, all milling steps were performed manually. The whole lamella preparation workflow, however, is per-se very repetitive and time-consuming. Several software tools already exist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> which can be used for on-grid “waffle” milling and fine milling of lift-out sections. Yet, robust automated protocols for targeted trench milling, lift-out and sectioning must still be developed.</p>
<p>In summary, we applied various HPF and lamella preparation methods to different plant species and tissues. We discuss their advantages and disadvantages and provide detailed descriptions of the procedures that worked best for plant tissues. We demonstrate that subnanometer structural details are preserved in the process and that meaningful spatial information can be retrieved using rubisco as a model case. Hence, the presented toolbox allows for the first time to do <italic>in situ</italic> structural biology in plant tissues and can likely be adapted to other multicellular systems.</p>

Fine milling was performed at 50 pA, aiming for a final lamella thickness of 200-250 nm. Finally, the lamella was polished at 30 pA at a stage tilt of 14° and 16° only from the bottom and the top, respectively (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a-d</xref>).</p>

<title>High-pressure freezing of “waffle” grids</title>
<p>As described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, before the experiment, 6mm Type B carriers (300 µm cavity on one side and flat on the other, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) were incubated overnight in a 1:1 mixture of 4 M NaOH and commercial bleach, rinsed 3x with water, 1x with Acetone and dried. Next, the carriers were dipped into a cetyl palmitate solution (0.5-1% (m/v) in diethyl ether), excess of liquid was removed with a filter paper and the carriers were dried on a filter paper with the flat side facing up. Commercially available Copper 50, 75 or 100 mesh grids with continuous support film (Carbon coated Formvar, Graticules Optics Ltd, Tonbridge, UK) were used to support the sample. As freezing buffer, a 1:1 mixture of growth medium and 40% (m/v) Ficoll 400 (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) was prepared. A 2 µL droplet was applied to the flat side of a carrier, a grid with the support film facing down placed on it and the excess of buffer removed with a small piece of Whatman No 1 filter paper (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) until the grid was lying flat on the carrier with a thin layer of buffer between them. 3 µL buffer were added onto the grid and distributed with the pipet tip until the whole grid surface was covered. Air bubbles were removed with tweezers. Next, a small patch of <italic>P. Patens</italic> protonemata was picked from a plate and placed in the center of the grid. A second carrier was placed on top, flat side down, and the whole sandwich tightly squeezed together for 10 s followed by immediate high-pressure freezing. The resulting “waffle” grids were separated from the carriers, clipped into cartridges with cutouts (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored until use in liquid nitrogen (LN<sub>2</sub>).</p>

<title>Cryo-fluorescence light microscopy</title>
<p>“Waffle” grids have a near featureless surface in SEM and FIB images (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). Fluorescence microscopy is therefore vital for targeted lamella preparation. For initial screening, clipped grids were loaded into a confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with cryo-stage (Leica TFS SP8, Leica Microsystems, 50x Air objective: Leica Objective No. 506520, NA 0.9, two hybrid detectors and one photomultiplier tube). We always detected the reflected light (excitation wavelength: 488 nm; emission filter: 480-496 nm), the green autofluorescence of the tissue (excitation wavelength: 488 nm; emission filter: 500-750 nm) and the transmitted light. Dependent on the sample thickness, we adjusted the laser power to have enough signal while not overexposing the detectors. Initially, a grid map was acquired (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>) with a spiral scan (512×512 pixel per tile image, pin hole size = 600 µm, pixel size = 580 nm). Promising grid squares containing cell junctions were subsequently imaged by acquiring z-stacks encompassing the whole sample thickness (2048 x 2048 pixel per image, pin hole size = 125 µm, pixel size = 140 nm, z step size = 1 µm, 25-50 steps). Images were recorded using the LAS X software (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The FLM images displayed in the figures are exclusively single slices of z-stacks and no maximum intensity projections. Squares with several layers of protonemata were ignored because the ∼25 µm high wells of the used grids can only accommodate a single cell layer risking squeezing damaged during freezing (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>). Here we used a confocal laser scanning microscope, but a standard widefield system equipped with a cryo-stage could also be used for this screening step.</p>

<title>Lateral targeting and trench milling</title>
<p>Grids were loaded into a FIB/SEM instrument with integrated fluorescence light microscope (int-FLM). A protective layer of metal-organic platinum was applied for 45 s using the GIS with the stage in trench milling orientation (stage tilt = 7°, stage rotation = 180°, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). With the stage in trench milling orientation the coincidence point of FIB and SEM was found on a grid square which contained a target area and a marker pattern (cross-section, xyz: 8 x 8 x 0.5 µm) was milled at a safe distance from the target area. For lateral targeting, sample top views (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref> top panel) were recorded with the int-FLM using a reflected light channel (excitation wavelength = 485 nm, no emission filter) to focus on the surface and to find the marker and a green-fluorescence channel (excitation wavelength = 485 nm, emission wavelength = 525 nm). The junctions between <italic>P. patens</italic> cells could be detected based on the green cellular autofluorescence without additional labelling. Z-stacks were acquired (pixel size = 168 nm, 20-25 z-slices, z-step = 1 µm).

<p>Based on the measured distance of the target area from the marker, the position of trench milling patterns were defined. The drift suppression function of the instrument was activated during all trench milling steps. First, two cross-sections with an xy-size of 40×30 µm were milled above and below the target area with a distance of 40 µm at an ion current of 7 nA (step I in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3e</xref>). Next, the trenches were elongated at 15 nA to a height of 50 µm and 80-120 µm (step II in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3e</xref>), on bottom and top, respectively. The target area containing block was further thinned in two steps to an xy-size of 35×30 µm and 30×20 µm at 5 nA and 3 nA, respectively (step III and IV in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3e</xref>). Top views were acquired with FIB and int-FLM after each milling step to adjust the positioning of the patterns, assuring that the targeted area was centered after trench milling (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3g-h</xref>). Then the block-face on top was polished at 1 nA.</p>

<sec id="s4c4">
<title>Axial targeting</title>
<p>The images of the int-FLM allow to reliably localize the target area laterally, i.e. in parallel to the sample surface. Due to the limited numerical aperture of the objective, the wide-field epifluorescence optical setup of the int-FLM and depth dependent aberrations, the axial resolution is limited. The axial localization of the target area within the thickness of the sample is crucial to place the patterns for lamella fine milling. Two methods were used for the axial targeting: (i) SEM block-face imaging and (ii) FIB-view imaging with the int-FLM.</p>
<p>After trench milling, with the stage still in trench milling orientation, the SEM images the side surface of the block (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>, top panel). Cellular structures, like membranes, exposed at the FIB milled front of the block, can be visualized with by SEM imaging, even for non-metal stained, vitrified samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Before the image was recorded, the auto-stigmator function was run on a nearby spherical contamination. The whole block-face was then centered in the SEM field-of-view, the SEM focused on the edge between grid surface and block-face and the auto brightness-contrast function run on the block-face itself. SEM images were acquired with a dwell time of 50 ns, 100 line integrations at U = 3 kV, I = 13 pA with an image size of 3072 x 2048 pixel (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). If inherent material contrast is sufficiently strong, the approximate distance of the target area from the sample surface can then be measured in the SEM image using the FIB/SEM user interface.</p>
<p>For FIB-view imaging, the int-FLM was used to image the side of the block after trench milling in lamella milling orientation (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>, bottom panel) at the angle at which the lamella will be milled. For optimal imaging, the lamella front has to be normal to the optical path of the int-FLM (Capitanio <italic>et al</italic>., will soon be described in a manuscript). This allows to avoid major depth-dependent refractive-index-mismatch-induced aberrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Normal incidence is achieved by changing the stage tilt angle during trench milling steps III-IV (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3e</xref>). The required stage tilt depends on the stage tilt required for FIB-view imaging which, in turn, is dependent on the stage tilt for lamella fine milling. For waffle milling, FIB-view images were recorded at a stage tilt of 20° in lamella milling orientation, requiring trench milling steps III-IV at - 6° stage tilt. The required stage tilt for trench milling steps III-IV (α<sub>Trench milling</sub>) as a function of the stage tilt for FIB-view imaging (α<sub>FIB-view</sub>) can be calculated according to this equation:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="638237v1_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
This equation is only valid for the standard geometry used in FIB/SEM instruments employing a shuttle with a pre-tilt of 45°. Care must be taken that the difference between trench milling and FIB-view imaging is not only the stage tilt but also the stage rotation. Trench milling is performed with a stage rotation of 180° and FIB-view imaging with a stage rotation of 0° (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p>First, the lamella front and the target area were identified in the reflected light channel (excitation wavelength = 485 nm, no emission filter) and the green-fluorescence channel (excitation wavelength = 485 nm, emission wavelength = 525 nm), respectively and z-stack recorded (pixel size = 168 nm, 20 z-slices, z-step = 1 µm) using the Odemis software (Delmic). To target the junction between cells, it was sufficient to roughly measure its distance from the sample surface in the Odemis software. For smaller targets, the lamella front can be protected by a layer of metal organic platinum using the GIS and reference marker milled as described (Capitanio <italic>et al</italic>., will soon be described in a manuscript)</p>

<p>The surfaces of the block after trench milling were coated with a thick layer of metal organic platinum using the GIS in trench milling orientation and in lamella milling orientation for 15 s and 3 times 20 s, respectively. Fine milling was performed at a stage tilt of 20° in lamella milling orientation (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). First, all material below the target area was removed at an ion current of 3 nA.

<p>The EasyLift system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) installed on a Scios and an Aquilos 2 was used for the lift-out experiments. Prior to the lift-out, a copper adapter was attached to the needle of the EasyLift system as described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<sec id="s4d1">
<title>Lift-out</title>
<p>The first step of the lift-out experiment was targeted trench milling, as described for “waffle” milling in the previous sections. The width of the block between the trenches depends on the size of the target area. The trenches, however, should be roughly 10 µm wider than the desired width of the final lift-out block as it must be detached from the bulk sample on both sides.</p>
<p>We use redeposition milling to attach a copper adapter to the needle of the micromanipulator, the lift-out block to the copper adapter and the sections to the receiver grid. The pattern used for redeposition milling is an array of regular cross-section with lateral dimensions of 0.5 x 2.5 µm at a distance of 0.25 µm with the multi-pass option set to one. The cross-section patterns are placed along the whole interface of the surfaces that are being attached, on the copper face and the 2.5 µm long dimension is always perpendicular to the attached surface. The milling direction is always away from the interface and the z-dimension of all cross-sections set to 4 µm. On FIB/SEM instruments with imperfect ion beam optics alignment, it can be beneficial to make increase the size of the cross-sections and the distance between them by 40 – 60 % in all directions. A more detailed description of the milling patterns and the whole workflow can be found in the step-by-step protocol (Pöge <italic>et al</italic>., will soon be published as a protocol).</p>
<p>We used two distinct lift-out orientations: (i) from the trench milling orientation, the lift-out direction is roughly in the plane of the sample surface or (ii) from the lamella milling orientation where it is roughly perpendicular to the sample surface (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>). For (i) the copper adapter was positioned in the center of the block-face directly after trench milling (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). Afterwards, the lift-out was performed as described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. For (ii), after trench milling the stage was moved to the lamella milling orientation and a thick layer of metal organic platinum applied by opening the GIS for 3×20 s. Next, all material above and below the target area was removed at 3 nA and the top of the block polished at 1 nA. Then, the copper adapter was positioned in the center on top of the lift-out block and redeposition milling was used to attach it to the lift-out block (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). Only then was the lift-out block detached from the bulk sample on both sides and subsequently extracted.</p>

<p>For the single-sided lift-in attachment, copper 4-pin half-moon grids (Pelco FIB-Lift-Out-Grids, Plano GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) were used as receiver grids. After loading, the grid was rotated into trench milling orientation and marker lines milled on either side at the tip of each pin. After rotating back to lamella milling orientation, the needle, with the lift-out block attached, was reinserted and the lower front edge of the lift-out block was aligned to the marker line (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>).

A horizontal line pattern was milled to section the lowest 3-4 µm of the lift-out block and a vertical line pattern above the attachment patterns at the interface between lift-out block and pin used to fully detach the remaining lift-out block.

Next, the GIS was used for 20 s in trench milling orientation.

To protect the new lamella front, the GIS was used for 15 s and 3×20 s in trench milling and lamella milling orientation, respectively.

<title>Fine milling of lamellae with single-sided atatchment</title>
<p>The sections were thinned in lamella milling orientation (stage tilt = 15°) at 1 nA to 2.5 µm and at 0.3 nA to 1.5 µm using regular cross-section patterns. Opposite of the attachment site, a 1.5×1.5 µm block was left which prevents folding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> of the lamella (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6e</xref>). Fine milling was done at 50 pA using rectangle patterns milled in parallelset at a distance of 250 nm from one another, followed by tilting to 14° and 15.5°-16° while milling only on bottom and top, respectively, at 30 pA. Lamellae with single-sided attachment had the tendency to bend (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6f</xref>) making fine milling difficult. Additionally, they often broke during transfers into the TEM and displayed sample movement during data acquisition. By reducing the width of the lamella from the attachment site and increasing its depth along the attachment site, this could be reduced but not completely prevented, especially for lamellae thinner than 200 nm. Thus, we strongly recommend using the double-sided attachment procedure as described below.</p>

<title>Lift-in using double-sided attachment from the sides</title>
<p>For the double-sided attachment, as described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, the lift-out block must fit precisely between two neighboring 400 mesh bars of a 400×100 mesh grid (∼40 µm).

<p>Redeposition milling at 1 nA was used to attach the lower part of the lift-out block to the grid bars on both sides (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7c</xref>). Then, the needle was moved up in z by 200 nm. A horizontal line pattern was milled to detach the lower 4 µm of the lift-out block and two vertical line patterns were milled on both sides above the attachment patterns at the interface between lift-out block and grid bars to fully detach the remaining lift-out-block. This process of attachment and sectioning was repeated until the whole lift-out block was sliced up. More details about the exact milling patterns can be found in the step-by-step protocol (Pöge <italic>et al.</italic>, will soon be published as a protocol).</p>
<p>Similar to single sided attachment, after sectioning, top views were recorded for each lamella precursor with the int-FLM in trench milling orientation. Regions that did not contain the target area were removed at 3 nA and the front edge on top was polished at 1 nA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). To protect the new lamella front, the GIS was used for 15 s and 3×20 s in trench milling in lamella milling orientation, respectively.</p>
<p>Fine milling was performed in lamella milling orientation (stage tilt = 15°) in several steps. First, the top of the section was removed at 1 nA. Subsequently, the lateral location of the target area was determined based on either the int-FLM top views recorded prior to section trimming or an SEM block-face image (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7e</xref>). Using this information, the milling patterns were centered around the target area to reduce the width of the lamella to a minimum. Afterwards, sections were thinned at 1 nA to 2.5 µm, 0.3 nA to 1.5 µm and 0.1 nA to 0.8 µm using regular cross-section patterns. Fine milling was done at 50 pA using rectangle patterns with a distance of 250 nm milled in parallel, followed by tilting to 14° and 15.5°-16° while milling only on bottom and top, respectively, at 30 pA.</p>

<title>Lift-in using double-sided attachment from below</title>
<p>The idea of the attachment from below is to mill two plateaus into neighboring grid bars, both at the same height and parallel to the bottom of the lift-out block. Thus, the lift-out block can be placed on the plateaus instead of being placed between grid bars. Before the lift-out experiment, a 400×100 mesh grid was loaded into the FIB at room temperature and modified. In trench milling orientation, with an ion current of 64 nA, 8×90 µm wide (xy-size) rectangular cavities were milled into the neighboring 400 mesh bars with the lower end of the patterns in the middle of rectangle (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>). The modified grids can be stored until further use.</p>
<p>For the lift-out experiment, a modified 400×100 mesh grid was loaded with the 100 mesh bars aligned horizontally in lamella milling orientation (stage tilt 15°). Before the first Serial Lift-Out sections could be attached, the actual plateaus were milled in the back of the cavities (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8b</xref>). First, regular cross-section patterns were milled, preparing the rough plateaus, followed by two rectangle patterns milled in parallel on either side to assure that the plateaus have the same height. The width of the resulting attachment site is between 50-55 µm. The lift-out block must be 1-2 µm slimmer to fit in the gap but must still overlap several micrometers with the plateaus on both sides. This was achieved by adjusting the width of lift-out block during trench milling.</p>
<p>After the lift-out, the bottom of the lift-out block was polished resulting in a surface parallel to the plateaus. Next, the center of the lift-out block was aligned to the front edge of the plateaus (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8c</xref>). Redeposition milling was used to attach the lower part of the lift-out block on both sides to the plateaus (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8d</xref>). After the attachment, the needle was moved up in z by 200 nm and a line pattern was used to detach the lowest 3 µm of the lift-out block. This process of attachment and sectioning was repeated until the whole lift-out block was sliced up. Afterwards, top views were recorded with the int-FLM for each section followed by trimming and fine milling as described in the previous section.</p>

<title>In-carrier high-pressure freezing for <italic>P. patens</italic></title>
<p>Commercially available 3mm Type A and Type B carriers (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) were used for in-carrier HPF. Type A has a 100 µm deep well on one side and a 200 µm well on the other. Type B has only a single 300 µm deep well and is flat on the other side. Carriers were incubated overnight in a 1:1 mixture of 4 M NaOH and commercial bleach, rinsed 3x with water, 1x with Acetone and dried. Subsequently, the type only B carriers were coated by dipping them into cetyl palmitate solution (0.5 (m/v) in diethyl ether), removing excess of liquid with filter paper and drying carriers with the flat side facing up on filter paper. As freezing buffer, a 1:1 mixture of growth medium and 40% Ficoll 400 was used. The 100 µm well of the type A carrier was filled with 2 µL freezing buffer and the droplet spread over the entire well with the pipet tip. A small patch of <italic>P. patens</italic> tissue was placed in the droplet, air bubbles were removed with tweezers and the excess of buffer removed with filter paper until the meniscus of the droplet almost vanished. The type B carrier was placed on top with the flat side down, the sandwich squeezed together and immediately high-pressure frozen. Afterwards, the sample containing type A carriers were recovered and stored until further use.</p>

<p>In-carrier HPF samples were not screened in our FLM as they don not fit into the commercial shuttle. Hence, they were screened using the int-FLM. After loading the samples into the FIB, the sample surface was protected by a layer of metal organic platinum for 45 s by using the GIS with the stage in trench milling orientation. Afterwards, marker patterns were milled (xy-dimensions: 6 x 16 µm and 8 x 8 µm at a distance of ∼10 µm with z-dimension = 0.5 µm) and top view images were recorded with the int-FLM, covering area of 1000 µm x 1000 µm around the marker pattern (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). Targeted trench milling was performed as described for “waffle” grids (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9b</xref>) with the exception that target areas were also selected based on their proximity to the sample surface, which could be roughly estimated based on where the fluorescence was localized within the acquired int-FLM z-stacks.</p>
<p>To fully detach the lift-out block from an in-carrier HPF sample, an additional undercut is necessary. First, the axial location of the target area was determined either by FIB-view imaging with the int-FLM (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9c</xref>) or SEM block-face imaging (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). With the stage in lamella milling orientation, the front of the lift-out block protected by metal organic platinum and the undercut milled below the target area at 3 nA. Afterwards, the lift-out was performed as described in the previous section either from the trench milling or the lamella milling orientation.</p>

<title>Lamella sputter coating after fine milling</title>
<p>Lamellae were sputter coated after fine milling. The sputtering systems on the used Aquilos 1 and Aquilos 2 introduce 5-15 nm sized spheroidal platinum particles onto the lamella surfaces. The sputtering conditions were set to U = 1 kV, p = 0.1-0.2 mbar, I = 10-15 mA, t = 2-4 s. These particles aid frame and tilt-series alignment during TEM data processing. The fiducial based tilt-series alignment resulted in higher quality tomograms than patch tracking approaches.</p>

<title>“Waffle” workflow for <italic>P. patens</italic> phyllids</title>
<p>The “waffle” grids of <italic>P. patens</italic> phyllids were prepared similar to protonemata. A cleaned and cetyl palmitate coated 6 mm type B carrier was placed with the flat side facing up on filter paper and a 3 µL droplet of freezing buffer placed on it. Next, a 50 mesh EM-grid with continuous support film (Carbon coated Formvar, Graticules Optics Ltd, Tonbridge, UK) was placed on the droplet with the support side facing down and excess of buffer removed until the grid was resting flat on the carrier. A 3 µL droplet of freezing buffer was added on top of the grid and distributed to fill all wells formed by support film and grid bars and air bubbles removed with sharp tweezers. A small piece of phyllid was cut from the gametophore with fine surgical tools and placed in the center of the grid. A second coated 6 mm type B carrier was placed with the flat side facing down on top, the sandwich squeezed together and excess of buffer removed with a filter paper. Next the sandwich was mounted for HPF and squeezed tightly for 10 s right before freezing. Areas of tissue that were damaged in the process could be identified in the FLM (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10a-c</xref>).

Fully filled seeds were selected and planted in MS culture medium plates. These plates were incubated in a plant tissue culture room at a temperature of 26/22°C (day/night), a photoperiod of 16/8 h (day/night) and a light intensity of 600 μmol·m-2·s-1.

<p>One part of the TEM data was collected on a Titan Krios G2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with BioQuantum energy filter (Gatan, Pleasanton, California, USA) and K2 summit camera (Gatan). Automated data acquisition was performed in SerialEM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> (version 4.1). Lamella montages were recorded at 8700x magnification (pixel size = 2.6 nm). Tomograms were acquired at 42000x, 53000x or 64000x magnification (pixel sizes of 3.52 Å, 2.62 Å and 1.98 Å, respectively), at target defoci of −4 µm to −6 µm, using a dose symmetric tilt scheme between ±50°to ±60° with an angular increment of 2° or 3°, taking the pretilt of the lamellae into account. The exposure time was kept constant for all tilt images resulting in total doses per tilt-series of 80-125 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>.

<title>Data preprocessing</title>
<p>Tilt-series were processed using the TOMOMAN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> (version 0.6.9) pipeline. Movie frames were motion corrected in MotionCor2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> (version 1.4.7). EER frames were grouped to obtain between 8 and 20 frames per movie. Bad tilt images, i.e. improperly tracked images or blurry images due to lamella instabilities, were removed after manual inspection and dose-weighting was performed according to<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> using the corresponding TOMOMAN scripts. If tilt-series contained at least 5 platinum fiducials introduced by sputtering evenly distributed over the field-of-view, IMOD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> (version 4.11.25) fiducial tracking was employed for tilt-series alignment. Otherwise, AreTomo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> version 1.3.3 was used for tilt-series alignment. Afterwards, 4x binned tomograms were reconstructed with the weighted back projection algorithm implemented in IMOD.</p>
<p>For denoising, tilt series containing only the information of odd or even frames were obtained during motion correction.

<p>Thick multicellular plant samples provide unique challenges when it comes to cryo-preservation, which has resulted in limited successful examples for structural studies using in situ cryo-electron tomography. To address this deficiency, this <bold>important</bold> study describes procedures for high-pressure-freezing, focused ion-beam milling, and cryo-electron tomography imaging of certain plant types. The results described in the paper provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence for the usefulness of the methods described, although some reservations remain about the applicability of the methods to a wider range of plant cell types.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This in situ cryo-ET workflow of selected plant structures provides several detailed strategies using plunge-freezing and the HPF waffle method and lift-out for notoriously difficult samples (compared to cell culture, yeast, and algae, which are far more prevalent in the literature).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A very difficult challenge whereby the authors demonstrate successful vitrification of selected plants/structures using waffle and lift-out approaches for cryoET. Because there are relatively few examples of multi-cellular plant cryo-ET in the literature, it is important for the scientific community to be motivated and have demonstrated strategies that it is achievable. This manuscript has a number of very helpful graphics and videos to help guide researchers who would be interested in undertaking that would help shorten the learning curve of admittedly tedious and complex workflows. This is a slow and tedious process, but you have to start somewhere, and I applaud the authors for sharing their experiences with others, and I expect will help other early adopters to come up to speed sooner.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While important, the specific specimen and cell-types selected that were successful (perhaps other plant specimen and tissues tried were unsuccessful and thus not reported) in this approach did not demonstrate success to broadly applicable to other much more prevalent and interesting and intensive areas plant biology and plant structures (some mentioned in more detail below).</p>
<p>This manuscript is essentially a protocol paper and in its paragraph form, and even with great graphics, will definitely be difficult to follow and reproduce for a non-expert. Also considering the use of 3 different FIB-SEM platforms and 2 different cryo-FLM platforms, I wonder if a master graphic of the full workflow(s) could be prepared as a supplementary document that walks through the major steps and points to the individual figures at the critical steps to make it more accessible to the broader readership.</p>
<p>Multiple times in the manuscript, important workflow details seemed to point to and be dependent on two &quot;unpublished&quot; manuscripts:</p>
<p>(1) Line 583, 755, 790, 847-848, (Poge et al., will soon be published as a protocol).</p>
<p>(2) Lines 140, 695, 716 (Capitanio et al., will soon be described in a manuscript).</p>
<p>It is not clear if/when these would be publicly available. It may be important to wait until these papers can be included in published form.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Poge et al. present a workflow for studying plant tissue by combining high-pressure freezing, cryo-fluorescence microscopy, FIB milling, and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). They tested various plant tissues, including Physcomitrium patens, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Limonium bicolor. The authors successfully produce thin lamellae suitable for cryo-ET studies. Using sub-tomogram averaging, they determined the Rubisco structure at subnanometer resolution, demonstrating the potential of this workflow for plant tissue studies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript is likely the first to systematically apply FIB milling and cryo-ET to plant tissue samples. It provides a detailed methodological description, which is not only valuable for plant tissue studies but also adaptable to a broader range of biological tissue samples. The study compares the plunge freezing method with a high-pressure freezing method, demonstrating that high-pressure freezing can vitrify thick tissues while preserving their native state. Additionally, the authors explore two methods for plant tissue sample preparation, the &quot;waffle&quot; method and in-carrier high-pressure freezing combined with the &quot;lift-out&quot; approach. The &quot;waffle&quot; method is suitable for samples less than 25um, while the in-carrier high-pressure freezing method can process samples up to 100um.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The described workflow is very complicated and requires special expertise. The success rate of this workflow is not very high, particularly for high-pressure freezing and life-out technology. Further improvements are needed for automation and increasing throughput.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to improve cryo-TEM workflows for plant cells. The authors present details on high-pressure-freezing protocols to vitrify, ion-mill, and image certain plant cell types.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Clear step-by-step outline on how to preserve and image cryo samples derived from plants.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A general current weakness of cryo-TEM is the problem of vitrifying cells that are embedded in tissues. The vast majority of cells in the plant body are currently not accessible to this technology. This is not a weakness of this specific manuscript but a general problem.</p>
<p>The manuscript is well organized and well written, and the discussion covers practically all questions I had while reading the results section. I only have a few comments, all of which I consider minor.</p>
