<abstract>
<p>The human AAA+ protease LONP1 plays a central role in maintaining mitochondrial proteostasis. LONP1 processes a vast array of substrates, ranging from damaged or unfolded proteins to specific subunits stably integrated into respiratory complexes. Previous cryo-EM studies of LONP1 uncovered two distinct conformational states corresponding to inactive or active forms of the enzyme. While these states have shed light on the intricacies of LONP1 substrate translocation and proteolytic processing, little is known about the decision-making involved in LONP1 substrate engagement and subsequent initiation of its unfoldase activity. Here, we use cryo-EM to determine a novel ADP-bound, C3-symmetric intermediate state of LONP1 (LONP1<sup>C3</sup>) with putative substrate “fold-sensing” capabilities. Our biochemical and structural data indicate that LONP1<sup>C3</sup> is an on-pathway intermediate and that is stabilized by interaction with folded substrates. Moreover, we identify additional symmetric and asymmetric conformational states, including a two-fold symmetric split-hexamer conformation, that we associate with the transition from LONP1<sup>C3</sup> to LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup>. We propose that the C3-state regulates substrate selection and enables LONP1 to efficiently surveil the matrix proteome to ensure selective removal of damaged and dysfunctional proteins as well as privileged LONP1 substrates. These findings collectively provide further mechanistic insights into LONP1 substrate recruitment and engagement and inform on its diverse roles in maintaining homeostasis within the mitochondria.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mitochondria import 99% of their proteins from nuclear encoded genes using a complex, tightly regulated protein import system that facilitates the translocation of nascent polypeptide chains across one or two lipid bilayers prior to maturation and folding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Once assembled, these proteins and protein complexes are subjected to high levels of reactive oxygen species produced from oxidative phosphorylation and biosynthetic pathways, such as heme biosynthesis and iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Consequently, the mitochondrial matrix is under considerable levels of basal proteotoxic stress. To mitigate this stress, mitochondria possess their own protein quality control network to rectify proteotoxic insults and maintain proteostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> A key player in this process is the AAA+ protease LONP1, which is responsible for the removal of oxidized, damaged, and unfolded proteins from the mitochondrial matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> In addition to proteostasis, LONP1 plays a critical role in diverse mitochondrial processes such as metabolism, genome stability, and responses to hypoxic and oxidative stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Knockouts of LONP1 are embryonically lethal, and mutations mapped to the LONP1 gene locus have been identified as causal for cerebral, ocular, dental, auricular, skeletal (CODAS) syndrome, a rare multisystem developmental disorder characterized by diverse clinical manifestations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Due to its central role in stress response, LONP1 is upregulated in most cancers and is implicated in aggressive late-stage malignancies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> Therefore, LONP1 is emerging as a master regulator of diverse mitochondrial functions and is of growing interest as therapeutic target.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>LONP1 assembles as a 600 kDa homohexameric ring from a single polypeptide chain encoding all essential catalytic functions. This assembly consists of an N-terminal substrate binding domain (NTD), a central AAA+ ATPase domain, and a C-terminal protease domain (PD). The NTD can be further subdivided into the NTD globular domain (NTD<sup>GD</sup>), coiled-coil domain (CCD), and a 3-helical bundle (NTD<sup>3H</sup>), which is integrated into the AAA+ domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> Recent cryogenic electron microscopy studies (cryo-EM) on bacterial and eukaryotic systems show that Lon proteases adopt two prominent conformations: a proteolytically inactive open conformation or a substrate-bound proteolytically active closed conformation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B,C</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> To adopt the active conformation, the NTD must first engage substrates and facilitate their initial unfolding and transfer to the AAA+ domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Once substrate is coordinated by conserved pore loops, the ATPase domains utilize ATP-driven conformational rearrangements to translocate substrate to the PD for subsequent degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>Despite numerous recent studies enhancing our understanding of LONP1 structure-function relationships,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> the processes regulating substrate selection and transition from the open to closed conformation are largely undefined. While it is generally known that the NTD plays a critical role in substrate selection, this domain is conformationally dynamic and difficult to characterize structurally. Numerous low to medium resolution reconstructions of the NTD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D,E</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> show how six copies of this domain adopts an interconnected “trimer of dimers” arrangement, which positions three alternating CCD helices to form a triangular motif (CCD pore) above the central axis of the ATPase domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D,E</xref>). Substrate-bound structures show continuous polypeptide density traversing this pore and extending to the AAA+ domain where it is coordinated by the conserved pore loops. These observations, along with biochemical analysis, have led to the proposal that the NTD functions as a molecular ratchet coupled to conformational changes in the ATPase domains during substrate translocation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> Additionally, we recently demonstrated that the NTD also possess additional allosteric binding sites, distinct from the main substrate binding channel, that serve to allosterically regulate function and enhance proteolytic activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> These findings confirm that the NTD is critical for substrate processing, but do not explain its capacity to regulate substrate recruitment and processing in a complex cellular environment.</p>
<p>In our previous study, we structurally characterized wild type (wt) LONP1 actively processing a model substrate, β- casein, using ATP instead of slowing hydrolysis using ATP analogs or by introducing a Walker B mutation. However, casein has little to no secondary structure and is not a native LONP1 substrate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> To better inform on the underlying regulatory mechanisms employed by LONP1 to selectively degrade structured, or partially structured substrates, we used cryo-EM to visualize LONP1 degrading bona fide human matrix localized protein substrates: steroid acute regulatory protein (StAR) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> These experiments led to the discovery of a novel ADP-bound C3-symmetric conformation of LONP1, LONP1<sup>C3</sup>, that integrates structural motifs from the NTD and ATPase domains to regulate substrate access to the AAA+ motor. We demonstrate that the C3-symmetric conformation is an on-pathway intermediate critical for function and that it is preferentially stabilized by substrates with higher-order structure. Additionally, we identify a C2-symmetric split-hexamer conformation and an asymmetric right-handed spiral conformation that represent plausible conformational intermediates spanning the transition from LONP1<sup>C3</sup> to the active substrate-bound conformation, LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup>. Importantly, LONP1<sup>C3</sup> provides a mechanism to regulate substrate selection and processing at early stages of recruitment prior to peptide engagement and unfolding by the ATPases. We propose that the C3-state operates as checkpoint to ensure the selective removal of damaged/unfolded and privileged LONP1 substrates from the mitochondrial matrix. The findings in this study provide much-needed insight into LONP1 regulation and provide the groundwork to inform LONP1’s role in other critical mitochondrial processes.</p>

<title>A Novel C3-Symmetric ADP-bound Regulatory State of LONP1</title>
<p>In our previous study, we observed LONP1 actively degrading a model substrate, β-casein, in the presence of ATP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> However, casein is not a native substrate of LONP1 and has little to no secondary structure. Therefore, we sought to visualize early stages of substrate recruitment and selection by evaluating LONP1 degrading StAR, a verified, folded LONP1 substrate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> To visualize LONP1 actively processing substrate, we preincubated LONP1 and StAR at equimolar ratios and rapidly plunge froze samples after adding ATP. Image analysis of our LONP1+StAR dataset showed the presence of the open- and closed-forms of LONP1, although 3D-classification of the closed-form yielded two classes with distinct conformational states (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). The first class, resolved to ∼ 3.3 Åresolution, is nearly identical to our previous LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup> structures (PDB ID) representing the fully activated LONP1 holoenzyme (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). Further refinement of the second class surprisingly yielded a previously unobserved conformation of LONP1 bearing C3-symmetry (LONP1<sup>C3</sup>). The overall conformation of this symmetric state is distinct from both LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup> and LONP1<sup>OFF</sup>, with a better resolved CCD subdomain of the NTD positioned above the pore (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Refinements using C1-symmetry resulted in a ∼3.2 reconstruction while application of C3-symmetry increased the nominal resolution to ∼2.9 Å.</p>

</fig>
<p>Similar to other observed conformations of LONP1, the NTD<sup>GD</sup> subdomains of LONP1<sup>C3</sup> were poorly resolved. However, the rest of the structure, including the triangular CCD of the NTD positioned above the central pore, was sufficiently resolved for atomic modeling. While LONP1<sup>C3</sup> exhibited the same catalytically active C6-symmetric PD conformation as LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup> (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>), the ATPase domains of LONP1<sup>C3</sup> adopt a conformation that differs from all previously characterized LONP1 conformers. The ATPases are a defining feature of the three-fold symmetric state, adopting an alternating up- and-down arrangement around the ring, with three subunits tilted up and away from the central axis and the other three gathered together at the central pore (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). Notably, Åwe were able to confidently discern the helical register and position relevant side chains of the CCD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,B</xref>), which is in a more tightly compact conformation than our previous substrate-bound reconstructions.</p>
<p>Whereas the CCD of LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup> positions a conserved tyrosine residue at the central pore for interaction with a bound substrate, the triangular CCD of LONP1<sup>C3</sup> is arranged to prohibit transfer of substrates from the NTD to the AAA+ motor. Viewed along the symmetry axis from above, residues His391 and Leu395 from each central CCD helix tightly pack together and sterically block incoming substrate from accessing the ATPase channel (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3</xref>). Directly below the CCD, the NTD<sup>3H</sup> helical bundles of the down-subunits are positioned in proximity of one another to form an electrostatic interaction network at the central axis that further limits access to the AAA+ channel (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). The conserved pore loops of the AAA+ domains within the channel are intercalated in an alternating up-and-down configuration, creating a rigid network unable to coordinate with substrate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Finally, all six ATPase active sites are bound to ADP, despite the up-subunits being in a conformation that is consistent with previously observed ATP-bound subunits (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2F-H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">S4</xref>). This observation that the nucleotide binding pocket of the up-conformation is nearly identical to the ATP-bound form suggests that ADP-bound subunits can adopt diverse conformations to facilitate function or regulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). The series of vertically layered structural elements, in concert with ADP-bound AAA+ domains, present an assembly that is incompatible with substrate engagement and translocation. Given that LONP1 must make molecular decisions to degrade, chaperone, or release mitochondrial matrix proteins, we posit that the LONP1<sup>C3</sup> conformation serves as a checkpoint or fold-sensing state by blocking access to the AAA+ and PDs, prohibiting processing of off-target substrates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>The C3-state is important for function</title>
<p>To evaluate the relevance of the LONP1<sup>C3</sup> conformation in enzymatic function, we prepared a panel of mutations that we expect to perturb interactions stabilizing the CCD and NTD3H in the C3-state. Mutants were subjected to both an NADH-coupled ATPase assay and a FITC-casein degradation assay. Importantly, LONP1 exhibits both basal and stimulated ATPase rates in the absence or presence of added substrate, respectively. We surmise that the basal rate represents LONP1’s ability to degrade partially unfolded LONP1 particles or contaminants present in the in the sample. Addition of a suitable substrate leads to higher levels of engagement, resulting in an increase in the total population of particles actively consuming ATP and degrading substrate.</p>
<p>We first mutated both CCD residues, His391 and Leu395, to alanine, and found that the double mutant had little effect on proteolytic degradation and ATP consumption (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). However, mutating these residues to either a charged residue (glutamate) or a bulky residue (tryptophan), which would likely hinder adoption of the C3-conformation, substantially altered LONP1 activity. The H391E mutation nearly abolishes activity, and H391W shows a ∼ 15-fold reduction in both ATPase and FITC-casein degradation activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). These results suggest that transitions through the LONP1<sup>C3</sup> conformation are important for substrate processing.</p>

</fig>
<p>We next characterized interactions at the NTD<sup>3H</sup>. In all prior cryo-EM structures of nucleotide-bound LONP1, Asp449, His451 and Ser453 are not observed to interact with substrate or nucleotide. Further, unlike the CCD, this region has no prior implications in substrate recruitment or processing. Thus, we expected that mutating these residues would inform on their specific role in adopting the C3-state. A single point mutant, D449A, showed nearly wt activity for stimulated ATPase and FITC-casein degradation rates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), but the D449A/H451A mutant showed a ∼5-fold reduction in FITC-casein degradation activity and ∼6-fold reduction in stimulated ATPase rate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). To more intensely disfavor the C3-state, we introduced a S453D mutation, which would increase the bulkiness of this position and lead to an overabundance of negative charge, thereby preventing the three NTD3H domains from coming together at the central channel. Accordingly, we observed the S453D mutant to be inactive in our assay conditions for both FITC-casein and ATPase activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that perturbing the LONP1<sup>C3</sup> conformation negatively impacts function.</p>

<title>LONP1<sup>C3</sup> represents an on-pathway intermediate</title>
<p>Structurally, the C3-state blocks substrates from accessing the protease sites through the ATPase domains, and could therefore serve as an important regulatory step in holoenzyme activation. Our assay results suggest that adopting the C3-state plays a role in proteolytic and ATPase activity, although it is unclear if the C3-state is an on-pathway intermediate adopted as LONP1 progresses from the inactive open form to the active closed form. We know that LONP1 exists as an ensemble of conformations where the open, closed, and now C3-state are present during substrate processing. Therefore, the ATPase and proteolytic degradation rate are likely determined by the percentage of LONP1 particles in the active closed form, as the open-form and C3-state are unable to participate in ATP hydrolysis or substrate translocation. If the C3-state serves as a checkpoint during substrate processing, disrupting transition through the C3-state should manifest as a lower population of actively translocating LONP1 particles. In this case, ATPase kinetic parameters would have a lower k<sub>cat</sub> but little or no change in the K<sub>M</sub>.</p>
<p>To evaluate this hypothesis, we determined the catalytic parameters of stimulated ATPase activity for wt LONP1 and the D449A/H451A mutant. Intriguingly, the D449A/H451A mutant had a 4.7-fold reduction in k<sub>cat</sub> while the K<sub>M</sub> slightly decreased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), suggesting that disrupting the LONP1<sup>C3</sup> conformer hinders adoption of the proteolytically competent closed-form, thereby decreasing LONP1’s ability to hydrolyze ATP. This conclusion is further supported by the nearly equivalent drop in FITC-casein degradation rate and ATPase rate for the D449A/H451A mutant, suggesting these activities are coupled (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Therefore, we propose that destabilizing the LONP1<sup>C3</sup> conformation disrupts LONP1’s capacity to adopt the active form and process proteolytic substrates.</p>

<title>The CCD conformation of LONP1<sup>OFF</sup> resembles LONP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup></title>
<p>We next sought to determine the structural arrangement of the CCD in the LONP1<sup>OFF</sup> conformation to determine its relationship to LONP1<sup>C3</sup> and LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup>. We identified a subset of particles within a large stack of open-conformation particles in our LONP1+StAR dataset bearing improved density for the sixth subunit and CCD domain (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). Although the resolution of this region was lower than observed in the LONP1<sup>C3</sup> and LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup> reconstructions, it was sufficient to rigid-body fit atomic models into the density for a structural comparison of the three states. The CCD adopts a notably tighter conformation in LONP1<sup>OFF</sup> than in LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup>, more closely matching that of the LONP1<sup>C3</sup> conformation, suggesting that in the absence of substrate the CCD conformation is consistent with a narrowed CCD pore (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Based on their structural similarity, it is reasonable that the NTD of LONP1<sup>OFF</sup> could transition to the C3-state as an on-pathway intermediate as LONP1 progresses to the substrate-engaged closed conformation.</p>

<title>Stabilization of LONP1<sup>C3</sup> is substrate-dependent</title>
<p>Our data suggest that the LONP1<sup>C3</sup> state represents a functionally relevant point on the conformational landscape associated with holoenzyme activity. We speculate that this symmetric organization could serve as a checkpoint involved in determining the fate of an encountered substrate. In our previous studies using β-casein, we did not observe the LONP1<sup>C3</sup> conformer, suggesting that the substrate “foldedness” could be a factor in stabilizing this conformation. To determine if the formation of LONP1<sup>C3</sup> is substrate dependent, we performed an additional cryo-EM experiment using the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) instead of StAR. TFAM is a known <italic>in vivo</italic> LONP1 substrate and fits a molten globule model with predominantly helical secondary structure in the absence of DNA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> serving as a model substrate exhibiting an intermediate degree of foldedness as compared to β-casein (unstructured) or StAR (structured) (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>
<p>Analysis of the TFAM+LONP1 dataset revealed a mixture of LONP1<sup>OFF</sup>, LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup>, and LONP1<sup>C3</sup> states (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>), suggesting that LONP1 processing of intermediate- or well-folded substrates leads the enzyme to adopt a C3-state (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). In addition to the active form and C3-state, we also identified two additional ADP-bound states that resemble LONP1<sup>C3</sup> but do not fully adhere to 3-fold symmetry. These asymmetric intermediates have reduced density for the CCD and greater heterogeneity in the NTD<sup>3H</sup> subdomain and pore loops (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Figs.

<p>In our previous study where LONP1 was incubated with the unstructured model substrate β-casein, we did not identify the C3-state in our cryo-EM dataset. However, reprocessing this data using the workflow we established for LONP1+TFAM revealed a subset of particles consistent with the LONP1<sup>C3</sup> conformation, which we resolved to ∼ 3.2 Åresolution (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6B</xref>). While the overall structure of this β-caseinassociated LONP1<sup>C3</sup> was consistent with those observed in the presence of StAR or TFAM, the CCD and NTD<sup>3H</sup> sub-domains are not as well ordered (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). This finding is consistent with LONP1 adopting the C3-state during substrate processing, and that the stability of the CCD domain correlates with the foldedness of the substrate. Therefore, transitions through the C3-state may occur rapidly with unstructured or unfolded substrates but persist with more folded substrates such as TFAM and StAR. Thus, we posit that the CCD serves as a structural checkpoint, giving LONP1 the ability to sense substrate foldedness and specifically target proteins that present suitable degrons for proteolysis.</p>
<p>To support this hypothesis, we evaluated the degradation of folded substrates by wt LONP1 and our D449A mutant, which we expect to disrupt the C3 state, but observed to maintain wt levels of casein-stimulated ATPase activity and FITC-casein degradation activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). wt LONP1 degrades StAR or TFAM to completion in under 15 minutes in a time-course degradation assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). The D449A mutant, however, showed a notable reduction in degradation activity for both StAR and TFAM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). We also observed the same substrate-dependent trend in ATPase activity for the D449A and D449A/H451A mutants, where the mutations that putatively disrupt the C3-state showed reduced ATP hydrolysis for StAR and TFAM relative to casein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). These findings collectively support a model where the LONP1<sup>C3</sup> conformation operates as a checkpoint to regulate substrate selection and processing (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), and that transitioning through this C3-symmetric conformation aids in processing folded substrates.</p>

<p>In the LONP1<sup>C2</sup> conformation, the fully ADP-bound ATP-ase hexamer is split into two symmetric half-spirals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6A-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">S8B,F</xref>), each of which is superimposable with the three lowermost ATPase domains that form the right-handed spiral in LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup> (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8C</xref>). This organizational similarity is evident when comparing the pore loop residues of the LONP1<sup>C2</sup> and LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup> structures (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8C</xref>). The presence of a right-handed staircase organization in the LONP1<sup>C2</sup> conformation is somewhat surprising, as this structure lacks any appreciable bound substrate density in the central pore (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8B,D</xref>), yet substrate has been proposed to play a role in organizing the right-handed staircase organization of ATPase domains in AAA+ proteases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> The LONP1<sup>C2</sup> conformer also bears a structural consistency with the LONP1<sup>C3</sup> conformation, as the subunits at the interface of each half-spiral maintains the “up-down” configuration of the neighboring ATPase domains observed in the LONP1<sup>C3</sup> conformation. We note that the only structural difference between the LONP1<sup>C3</sup> and LONP1<sup>C2</sup> conformations is that two of the protomers at one of the half-spiral interfaces have flipped their orientation from down-up to an up-down arrangement (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8E</xref>, Movie 1). Thus, by undergoing a relatively minor conformational rearrangement of two subunits, LONP1 can switch from the C3-to the C2-symmetric arrangement. In the context of the emerging LONP1 conformational landscape, the LONP1<sup>C2</sup> conformer represents an intermediate conformation that bridges the transition from LONP1<sup>C3</sup> to LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup>. Such sequential symmetric rearrangements would allow redundancy in substrate engagement through interaction with symmetrically equivalent subunits, enhancing efficiency of the activation process.</p>
    <p>Further analysis identified two asymmetric intermediate states whose ATPases are arranged in sequential conformational steps representing the transition from the LONP1<sup>C2</sup> split-hexamer state to the LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup> full right-handed spiral (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>). For LONP1<sup>INT3</sup>, we observe a notable break in the symmetry where the ATPase domain that is counter-clockwise adjacent to the three-subunit right-handed spiral adopts a higher position (dark blue in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>), beginning the formation of a four-subunit right-handed spiral (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>). LONP1<sup>INT4</sup> continues this process by fully establishing the four-subunit spiral, where the subunits are positioned as they would be in the context of the canonical five-subunit AAA+ spiral (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs 6D-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">S9</xref>). Notably, this integration of the fourth subunit into the LONP1<sup>INT4</sup> spiral is consistent with the movement of this subunit during the canonical hand-over-hand conformational rearrangements thought to be used by AAA+ domains to facilitate substrate translocation. However, despite adopting a staircase arrangement, the pore loops are not engaged with substrate in either of these structures (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>, <xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">S10</xref>). Further, all subunits contain nucleotide densities consistent with ADP, with the exception of the uppermost subunit of LONP1<sup>INT4</sup>, which contains ATP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS11">S11</xref>). This ATP occupancy may indicate that the step-wise activation from LONP1<sup>C2</sup> to LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup> is encouraged by nucleotide exchange to fully stabilize the right-handed spiral for substrate engagement. Finally, the LONP1<sup>INT4</sup> conformation can readily transition to the canonical right-handed spiral through an additional subunit rearrangement to position a fifth protomer atop the right-handed spiral (purple in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>), completing formation of the LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup> conformation compatible with substrate translocation (Movie 1). Based on these structural analyses, we propose that the activation mechanism of LONP1 begins with substrate engagement at the NTD’s in the lefthanded asymmetric LONP1<sup>OFF</sup> state, which then progresses through a series of symmetric and then asymmetric rearrangements to ultimately establish the right-handed asymmetric substrate-bound active-form, LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>, Movie 1).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A critical aspect of mitochondrial protein quality control is the selective degradation of damaged, unfolded, or aggregated proteins, which if not removed, perturb mitochondrial fitness and function. To remove damaged proteins, mitochondria harbor four distinctly targeted AAA+ proteases. Two of these AAA+ proteases, AFGL32 and YME1L, are membrane-bound and face either the matrix or the intermembrane space, respectively, while LONP1 and CLPXP are soluble matrix localized proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Both LONP1 and CLPXP are responsible for the removal of damaged and misfolded matrix localized proteins, but knockouts of CLPP are tolerated while LONP1 knockouts are embryonically lethal.<sup>12,37-40</sup> Moreover, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, ClpP is absent from the genome, leaving LONP1 as the sole AAA+ protease surveilling the mitochondrial matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> Therefore, CLPXP, while important for metabolism and stress response, appears to play a secondary role in maintaining proteostasis in the matrix, whereas LONP1 is required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> This raises an important question: How is LONP1 able to selectively remove the bulk of damaged and unfolded proteins while also recognizing privileged folded substrates, such as TFAM and StAR?</p>
<p>To address this question, we used cryo-EM to characterize LONP1 actively degrading folded substrates at physiologically relevant temperatures. With this approach, we identified and biochemically characterized a novel C3-symmetric state of LONP1 that integrates structural components from the NTD and AAA+ domains to regulate substrate engagement by the ATPase. Importantly, this mode of regulation is different than the previously reported LONP1<sup>OFF</sup> state, where the proteolytic domains adopt an inactive conformation to limit off-target degradation when LONP1 is not engaged with substrates. Therefore, LONP1<sup>C3</sup> regulates function at a more critical stage in the decision-making process by preventing translocation rather than proteolysis. We propose that a core function of LONP1<sup>C3</sup> is to serve as checkpoint to determine whether to degrade or release a bound substrate. Such a checkpoint would allow LONP1 to evaluate the state of matrix proteins and only use ATP to unfold damaged proteins or privileged substrates. In support of this notion, we demonstrate that the adoption of LONP1<sup>C3</sup> is critical for substrate processing, and that it is preferentially stabilized in the presence of folded substrates. Moreover, our D449A mutant presents wt levels of proteolytic activity with casein but has reduced activity against more challenging substrates like TFAM and StAR. Taken together, these findings indicate that less structured substrates, such as unfolded matrix proteins, would rapidly transition through the C3-state, while more structured substrates persist in the C3-state until a suitable degron is engaged, or the protein is instead released.</p>
<p>In addition to identifying and biochemically evaluating LONP1<sup>C3</sup>, we also elucidated additional intermediate states that are present during the active degradation of all three tested substrates. Specifically, our LONP1<sup>C2</sup> conformation, along with LONP1<sup>INT3</sup> and LONP1<sup>INT4</sup>, provide a full perspective on the transitions required to adopt the canonical active closed-form, LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup>. These data lead us to propose a reaction scheme where LONP1<sup>C3</sup>, and the additional intermediate states, are on-pathway between LONP1<sup>OFF</sup> and LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup>. We propose a mechanism where substrate binding to the NTD of LONP1<sup>OFF</sup> triggers the adoption of the LONP1<sup>C3</sup> conformation, which performs the initial unfolding events to facilitate degron engagement. If the NTD is unable to engage a suitable degron on the bound substrate, it dissociates and LONP1<sup>C3</sup> transitions back to LONP1<sup>OFF</sup>. If the bound substrate is to be degraded, there is a progressive relaxation of symmetry from LONP1<sup>C3</sup> to LONP1<sup>C2</sup>, where each asymmetric unit is composed of a three-subunit right-handed spiral. At this stage, a series of hand-over-hand-like rearrangements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> establish the asymmetric right-handed spiral, transitioning through LONP1<sup>INT3</sup> and LONP1<sup>INT4</sup>, to finally arrive at LONP1<sup>ENZ</sup>. In this way, LONP1 can transition from an asymmetric, inactive left-handed conformation to an asymmetric, active right-handed conformation through a series of symmetric intermediates. Importantly, these transitions are seemingly mediated by the largely unresolved NTD, which similarly to other structures, is only visible at low-resolution for LONP1<sup>C3</sup>.</p>
<p>While we were unable explicitly identify bound substrate in our activation intermediates, these transitions are likely coupled to the substrate recognition and engagement process, as demonstrated by our biochemical assays. Therefore, the question remains as to how these rearrangements are coordinated across the assembly. Interestingly, the NTD<sup>3H</sup>, which is unique to LONP1, appears to function as a signal transducer to facilitate allosteric communication from the NTD to the ATPase domains below. The NTD<sup>3H</sup> is integrated into the ATPase cassette by a significant hydrophobic interface, which we propose couples the movement of the ATPase domains with rearrangements occurring in CCD domain above (<xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">Fig. S12</xref>). LONP1 thus employs a sophisticated allosteric mechanism to select for specific substrates in a complex cellular environment in an ATP-independent manner, simultaneously optimizing energy consumption and enforcing substrate selectivity. Additionally, these newly reported conformational intermediates, particularly the LONP1<sup>C3</sup> conformation, could serve additional roles in other reported LONP1 activities, such as DNA binding or chaperone activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> In such cases, regulating access to the AAA+ motor could be critical to prevent unintended off-target degradation of client proteins or DNAbound protein assemblies. Therefore, we are hopeful that the discovery and validation of a novel regulatory state, and our proposed activation mechanism, will provide avenues for future studies to determine LONP1’s role in regulating diverse aspects of mitochondrial biology in human health and disease.</p>

<title>Coupled ATPase assay</title>
<p>ATPase activity was assessed using an enzyme-coupled assay that links ATP hydrolysis to NADH oxidation via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In this setup, pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes the regeneration of ATP from ADP by converting phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate. The resulting pyruvate is then reduced to lactate by LDH, consuming NADH in the process. The depletion of NADH was tracked by monitoring fluorescence loss (excitation at 340 nm, emission at 465 nm), which corresponds to its conversion to NAD<sup>+</sup>. Assay reactions began with the preparation of a 2X mastermix containing 2.0 mM PEP (1PlusChem), 0.4 mM NADH (Cayman Chemical), 60 U/ml LDH (Worthington Chemical), and 20 U/ml PK (Sigma). For kinetic analysis, the mastermix was diluted to 1X in reaction buffer consisting of 100 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, followed by a 10-minute pre-incubation at 37 <sup><italic>°</italic></sup>C with the desired ATP concentration.

This preincubation was carried out at 37 <sup><italic>°</italic></sup>C for 10 minutes prior to initiating proteolysis through the addition of ATP to a final concentration of 5 mM, bringing the total reaction volume to 100 µl. At designated timepoints (0, 2, 5, 10, and 15 minutes), 10 µl aliquots were withdrawn and immediately mixed with 20 µl of Laemmli sample buffer, followed by heating at 95 <sup><italic>°</italic></sup>C for 3 minutes. Samples were briefly centrifuged and 20 µl of each was loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, which was run at 160 V for 1 hour. Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie staining using a standard solution containing 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and 0.25% Brilliant Blue R250.</p>

<title>Sample preparation for Cryo-EM</title>
<p>Samples of LONP1 actively degrading substrate were made by diluting LONP1 to 30 µM with or without 5 µM of StAR, TFAM, or β-casein (Sigma) before incubating at 37 <sup><italic>°</italic></sup>C for 10 minutes. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 2 mM ATP and immediately applied to grids and plunge frozen (∼ 30 seconds from reaction initiation to plunging) using a Vitrobot Mark IV system (blot time 5 seconds, blot force 1, 100% humidity, room temperature, Whatman No. 1 filter paper). All samples were applied to 300 mesh R1.2/1.3 UltrAuFoil Holey Gold Films (Quantifoil) that were glow discharged for 25 seconds at 15 mA with a Pelco Easiglow 91000 (Ted Pella, Inc.) in ambient vacuum.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM data acquisition</title>
<p>Data acquisition was carried out on a ThermoFisher Talos Arctica transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 keV and equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector. Parallel beam illumination was established prior to imaging. Exposures were collected in counting mode, each lasting approximately 10 seconds at an electron dose rate of ∼7 e<sup>-</sup>/pixel/sec, and subdivided into ∼50 individual frames, yielding a total accumulated dose of 50 e-/Å<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Automated data collection was performed using the Leginon software suite,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> with images captured at a nominal magnification of 36,000x, corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 1.15 Åat the specimen plane. The defocus range was set between 0.9 µm and 1.6 µm. Stage shifts were used to position the microscope over the center of 16 grid holes, followed by high-magnification image acquisition via comacompensated image-beam-shift targeting the center of each hole. A total of 1,964 micrographs were obtained. During collection, movie frames were aligned using MotionCor2, and contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were determined using CTFFind4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> within the Appion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> processing environment to assess image quality in real time.

    <p>The general processing strategy for all datasets is described here. Details are provided in the processing workflows in <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figs. S1</xref>, <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>, <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>, and <xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>. Movie frames were motion-corrected and dose-weighted using MotionCor2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> and the summed and dose weighted micrographs were imported into cryoSPARC v2.1-v3.3.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> for patch CTF correction. Micrographs with defocus values greater than 3.3 µm or with estimated resolutions worse than 7 Åresolution were discarded. Initial picking was performed using a blob picker with a lower radius of 125 and an upper radius of 225. Particles were extracted in a 320-pixel size box without Fourier cropping. 2D classification was used to generate templates that were then used for template picking with default settings and a particle diameter of 175 Å. Template-picked particles were extracted and only the obvious non-particles consistent with ice contamination or false picks were removed using 2D classification. The initial open and closed volumes were generated using the ab initio job type with default settings and three output volumes. These were then used in subsequent heterogeneous refinement jobs to separate out the open and closed conformations and remove bad picks or damaged particles. The closed-form particle classes were then used for 3D classification using PCA initialization with default parameters except for an O-EM learning rate initialization of 0.2 and two O-EM epochs. Classes were then refined using NU-refinement refinement and the resulting models were evaluated and selecting using their resulting resolution, determined by an FSC of 0.143, and by visual interpretation of the refined maps. Final refinements were performed using NU-refinement with per particle defocus and CTF refinements enabled with standard settings. Reported resolutions were determined using the 3DFSC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> Further details for the processing of each dataset can be found in the supplementary information.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study presents EM structures of new conformational states of the LONP1 AAA+ protease in conjunction with the mitochondrial protein substrates (StAR, TFAM), along with biochemical functional assays. The EM structures revealed new conformational states in a closed configuration. The structures and associated functional results are <bold>solid</bold>. However, a notable weakness is the absence of substrates found threaded through the ATPase pores.</p>

<body>
<p>The remodeling of macromolecular substrates by AAA+ proteins is an essential aspect of life at the molecular scale, and understanding conserved and divergent features of substrate recognition across the AAA+ protein family remains an ongoing area of research. AAA+ proteins are highly modular and typically combine N-terminal recognition domain(s) with ATPase domain(s) to recognize and unfold some macromolecular target, such as dsDNA or protein substrates. This can be coupled to activity by additional C-terminal domains that further modify the substrate, such as a protease domain that hydrolyzes the extended, unstructured protein chain that emerges from the ATPase domain during substrate processing.</p>
<p>This work focuses on one such AAA+ protease, LONP1. LONP1 is an essential AAA+ protein involved in mitochondrial proteostasis, and disruption of its function in vivo has serious developmental consequences. This work explores the processing of two new mitochondrial protein substrates (StAR, TFAM) by LONP1 and presents new conformational states of LONP1 with closed configurations and no substrate threaded through the ATPase pores. The quality of the reconstructions and models is very good. Critically, one of these states (LONP1C3) has a completely occluded ATPase pore from the N-terminal side of the ATPase ring, where three of the six NTDs/CCDs interact tightly to form a C3-symmetric substructure preventing substrate ingress. The authors note several key interactions between amino acids forming these substructures, and perform ATPase assays on mutant LONP1 proteins to determine hydrolysis rates in the absence or presence of substrate. These patterns are recapitulated in casein disassembly assays as well. Based on these results, the authors note that the mutants have differential effects depending on the &quot;foldedness&quot; of the substrate, and surmise that disruption of the C3-symmetric substructure from the EM experiments is responsible for these effects - an intriguing idea. In addition to the C3 state, the authors observe additional intermediates which they place on the same conformational coordinate. One such structure is the LONP1C2 state with two splits, hinting at a conformational transition from LONP1C3 to the closed/active state.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results form the basis of an interesting story. However, I feel that more experimentation and analysis are needed to address several key points, or that the conclusions should be toned down. First and foremost, I note that while the hypothesis that the LONP1C3 state is a critical step in recognizing substrate &quot;foldedness&quot; is an interesting one, the claim is made solely on the basis of biochemical experiments with mutant LONP1, and that there is no substrate density associated with LONP1C3. In the absence of substrate density and/or structural data for the mutants, this seems like a very strong claim. More generally, the manuscript invokes the conformational landscape of LONP1C3 in multiple instances, but no such landscape is presented to show how LONP1C3 and the other states are quantitatively linked. Finally, I note the prevalence of ADP-only active sites in these intermediates, and am concerned that this might be related to the depletion of ATP under the on-grid reaction conditions. The inclusion of an ATP regeneration system may be a useful way to ensure that ATP/ADP concentrations are more physiological and that excessive ADP will not bias the conformations of the ring systems.</p>
<p>In summary, I believe this manuscript is exciting but would benefit from a paring back of claims, or the inclusion of some additional data to fill in some of the conceptual gaps outlined above.</p>

<p>This paper by Mindrebo et al. reveals multiple novel conformations of the human LONP1 protease. AAA+ proteases, like LONP1, are needed for maintaining proteostasis in cells and organelles. While structures of fully active (closed) and fully inactive (open) conformations of LONP1 are now established, the dynamics between these states and how changes in conformations may contribute to or be triggered by substrates and nucleotides are unclear. In this work, the authors characterize a novel C3-symmetric state of LONP1 bound to TFAM (a native substrate), suggesting that this C3-state is an intermediate in the open to closed cycle, and make mutations to test this model biochemically. Deeper inspection of their TFAM-bound LONP1 dataset reveals additional conformations, including a C2-symmetric and two asymmetric intermediates. All these conformations are synthesized by the authors to propose a model for how LONP1 transitions from an inactive OFF state to an active ENZ state. There are clear, interesting structural aspects to this work, revealing alternate conformations to shed light on the dynamics of LONP1. However, some of the conclusions interpret well beyond the scope of the experiments shown, and this is discussed below.</p>
<p>Overall, there are two major comments with the work as written that, if addressed, would make the results more compelling. First, the order of events and existence of intermediate states is primarily from static structural snapshots and fitting these structures to a possible mechanism. It would be ideal to have some biochemical or kinetic data supporting these steps and the existence of these intermediates. For example, the model is that the C3-state is an ADP-bound intermediate that blocks access and acts as a checkpoint for progression to the ENZ state of LONP1. The major evidence for this comes from a mutation (D449A) that fails to degrade TFAM as well as StAR or casein, which is taken as evidence that failure to form the C3 state reduces the ability to degrade more 'folded' substrates. A prediction of this model would be that destabilizing TFAM through mutation should improve D449A degradation. Ideally, other measures of conformational changes, such as FRET or HDX-MS, could be used to visualize this C3-state in unmutated LONP1 during the process of substrate engagement and degradation. At a minimum, using ATP hydrolysis as a proxy for forming the ENZ state and the assumption that different substrates will differentially promote formation of the C3-state means that measuring ATP hydrolysis of wt LONP1 with different substrates will be informative.</p>
<p>The second major comment is that the primary evidence for the importance of the C3 state is a mutation (D449A) that, based on the cryoEM structure, is incompatible with this conformation but should not affect any other state. A concern that arises is whether this mutation is doing more than simply destabilizing the C3 state and affecting substrate recognition/enzymatic activity in some other manner. To address this point, the authors could perform cryoEM characterization of the D449A mutant, which should show reduced or no presence of the C3-state, but still an intact ability to form the closed ENZ state.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The AAA+ protease LON1P is a central component of mitochondrial protein quality control and has crucial functions in diverse processes. Cryo-EM structures of LON1P defined inactive and substrate-processing active states. Here, the authors determined multiple new LON1P structural states by cryo-EM in the presence of diverse substrates. The structures are defined as on-pathway intermediates to LON1P activation. A C3-symmetry state is suggested to function as a checkpoint to scan for LON1P substrates and link correct substrate selection to LON1P activation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The determination of multiple structures provides relevant information on substrate-triggered activation of LON1P. The authors support structural data by biochemical analysis of structure-based mutants.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>How substrate selection is achieved remains elusive, also because substrates are not detectable in the diverse structures. It also remains in parts unclear whether mutant phenotypes can be specifically linked to a single structural state (C3). Some mutant phenotypes appear complex and do not seem to be in line with the model proposed.</p>
