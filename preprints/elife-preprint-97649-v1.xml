<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Severe congenital malformations are a frequent cause of premature death and morbidity in children worldwide. Malformations can originate from numerous genetic or non-genetic factors but in most cases the underlying causes are unknown. Genetic disruption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis drives the formation of multiple congenital malformations, collectively termed Congenital NAD Deficiency Disorder (CNDD), highlighting the necessity of this pathway during embryogenesis. Previous work in mice shows that NAD deficiency perturbs embryonic development specifically during a critical period when organs are forming. While NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis is predominantly active in the liver postnatally, the site of activity prior to and during organogenesis is unknown. Here, we used a mouse model of human CNDD and applied gene expression, enzyme activity and metabolic analyses to assess pathway functionality in the embryonic liver and extraembryonic tissues. We found that the extra-embryonic visceral yolk sac endoderm exclusively performs NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis during early organogenesis before the embryonic liver takes over this function. Furthermore, under CNDD-inducing conditions, mouse visceral yolk sacs had reduced NAD levels and altered NAD-related metabolic profiles which affected embryo metabolism. Expression of requisite genes for NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis is conserved in the equivalent yolk sac cell type in humans. Our findings show that visceral yolk sac-mediated NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis activity is essential for mouse embryonic development and perturbation of this pathway results in CNDD. Given the functional homology between mouse and human yolk sacs, our data improve the understanding of human congenital malformation causation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Congenital malformations with substantial medical consequences are a major health burden because of their severity and high prevalence, occurring in approximately 3% of live births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Moorthie et al., 2018</xref>). Causes of congenital malformation are complex and diverse and can involve genetic as well as environmental factors, complicating the identification of aetiologies. Consequently, the underlying causes of malformation are still unknown in the majority of cases.</p>
<p>Disruption of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway, by which L-tryptophan is converted to NAD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), causes congenital malformations of varying severity. It affects organs and structures such as heart, kidney, vertebrae and others, and is termed Congenital NAD Deficiency Disorder (CNDD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dunwoodie et al., 2023</xref>). NAD, referring to its oxidised and reduced form (NAD+ and NADH), is both a critical redox cofactor present in all living cells and an essential co-enzyme involved in a diverse range of cellular functions. Besides NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis from L-tryptophan, mammals also generate NAD from vitamin B3, a collective term for the vitamers nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (NAM), nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), and nicotinamide riboside (NR), via the Preiss-Handler and NAD Salvage Pathways (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis is performed by the yolk sac during organogenesis and later by the embryonic liver.</p><p>(A) Schematic overview of the NAD synthesis pathways. The NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway (blue box) converts the essential amino acid L-tryptophan to NAD and is predominantly performed by the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). The Preiss-Handler Pathway (purple box) converts nicotinic acid to NAD in the kidney. The Salvage Pathway (orange box), performed in all cells, salvages the product of NAD consuming enzymes, nicotinamide (NAM), back to NAD. When NAD levels are in excess, NAM is converted to 1-methylnicotinamide (1MNA), N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY) and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide (4PY) and excreted. Enzymes are in red, metabolites in black.

<p>In all CNDD cases identified to date, affected patients had biallelic pathogenic variants in either <italic>KYNU</italic> (kynureninase), <italic>HAAO</italic> (3-hydroxyanthranilic acid 3,4-dioxygenase) or <italic>NADSYN1</italic> (NAD synthetase 1), all essential genes of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Szot et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Kynu</italic>, <italic>Haao</italic>, or <italic>Nadsyn1</italic> homozygous-null CNDD mouse models recapitulated the human phenotypes; thereby confirming that NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis is required during embryogenesis and that a deficiency of NAD during embryogenesis induces the malformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Szot et al., 2024</xref>). CNDD is prevented in homozygous-null mouse embryos when the mother is provided sufficient dietary vitamin B3 to bypass their genetic block, as here NAD is synthesised via the Preiss-Handler Pathway or NAD Salvage Pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Conversely, embryos of wild-type mothers given diets low in L-tryptophan and depleted in vitamin B3 exhibit NAD deficiency and CNDD-like malformations, with phenotypic severity exacerbated by gene-environment interactions via <italic>Haao</italic> or <italic>Nadsyn1</italic> heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuny et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Szot et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>The CNDD mouse models suggest that NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis is active in the conceptus and is required for normal organ development unless sufficient vitamin B3 is supplied by the mother. In adult mice, NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis occurs in the liver and to a very minor extent in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). But mouse embryos are susceptible to CNDD between embryonic day (E) 7.5 and E12.5, before the embryo has developed a functional liver. Therefore, NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis is likely active in another tissue during this time window of susceptibility.</p>
<p>The major components of the mammalian conceptus are the embryo itself and two extraembryonic organs, the chorioallantoic placenta and the visceral yolk sac (hereon yolk sac). Perturbation of either extraembryonic organ function can induce malformations in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brent and Fawcett, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brent et al., 1971</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Perez-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, to determine where NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis activity occurs in the conceptus, we assessed pathway function in these extraembryonic tissues during the CNDD-susceptible organogenesis stages, and in the embryonic liver once formed. We quantified expression of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway genes, HAAO enzyme activity, and metabolites formed during the synthesis and consumption of NAD. We identified yolk sac endoderm cells as the site of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis during organogenesis in mice. A comparison of mouse and human single-cell RNA datasets indicates that these findings in mouse are relevant to humans.</p>

<title><italic>NAD de novo</italic> synthesis in the embryonic liver is active after organogenesis in mice</title>
<p>NAD is synthesised <italic>de novo</italic> from L-tryptophan, predominantly in the liver. In addition, all cells salvage NAD from NAM in the circulation, with circulatory NAM levels dependent on NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). We have shown in mice that the conceptus is able to synthesise NAD <italic>de novo</italic> prior to E12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>); however, it is unclear if or when the embryonic liver is capable of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis. In mice, liver primordial cells are present around E9.5 to E10.5, hepatocytes are present from E11.5, and enzymes of the pathway are detected from E13.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burke et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mu et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Notenboom et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yang et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine when NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway activity commences in hepatocytes during embryogenesis, we re-analysed published murine single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data for the hepatic lineage (liver primordium, liver bud, and hepatocytes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mu et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>Tdo2</italic> and <italic>Ido2</italic>, encoding tryptophan-catabolising enzymes, were negligibly expressed at all stages. Expression of subsequent pathway genes (<italic>Afmid</italic>, <italic>Kmo</italic>, <italic>Haao</italic>, <italic>Qprt</italic> and <italic>Nadsyn1</italic>) progressively increased during embryogenesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>), though the time of onset and proportion of cells varied between genes. Nonetheless, all were expressed by E14.5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). HAAO enzyme assays were performed on <italic>Haao<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryonic livers, isolated from mothers provided a diet rich in L-tryptophan and vitamin B3 (Breeder diet, see Methods). The livers showed limited HAAO activity at E12.5 and a gradually increase at subsequent developmental stages. Furthermore, HAAO activity correlated with the number of functional <italic>Haao</italic> alleles and was significantly different between genotypes at all stages assessed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p>To validate that the pathway is functional at E14.5 in the liver, we quantified NAD+ and 11 NAD-related metabolites in <italic>Haao<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> liver samples using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography– tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cuny et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). Differential accumulation of metabolites upstream and downstream of the <italic>Haao</italic> genetic block is a defining characteristic of enzyme loss-of-function in both mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Szot et al., 2024</xref>). Accordingly, <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> E14.5 livers had significantly elevated levels of the upstream metabolite 3HAA (18-fold) relative to <italic>Haao<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, whereas the downstream metabolites QA and NAMN were undetectable and significantly decreased (4-fold), respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D,E</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>,). NAD+ levels were also significantly affected by the loss of functional <italic>Haao</italic> alleles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>), with the lowest concentration measured in <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryonic livers. By contrast, levels of the NAD Salvage Pathway metabolite NAM were 2-fold higher in <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, compared to <italic>Haao<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> livers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>) and levels of the waste products N<sup>1</sup>-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY) and N<sup>1</sup>-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide (4PY) were similar between <italic>Haao</italic> genotypes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>).This suggests that NAD Salvage Pathway activity compensated for the loss of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis activity in <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos.</p>
<p>Together, these data confirm that NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway gene expression occurs in the developing liver from E11.5 onwards and the pathway is functional by E14.5, which is in line with expression of genes encoding other metabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mu et al., 2020</xref>). However, as CNDD malformations occur in <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse embryos when</p>
<p>NAD is deficient between E7.5 and E12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>), NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis must occur elsewhere in the earlier-stage conceptus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title><italic>NAD de novo</italic> synthesis occurs during early organogenesis in the mouse yolk sac but not the placenta</title>
<p>In mammals, two likely candidate sites for extrahepatic NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis are the chorioallantoic placenta and the yolk sac. First, we re-analysed published mouse E9.5-14.5 placenta scRNAseq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Marsh and Blelloch, 2020</xref>) and found that NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway gene expression was scattered between the maternal decidual stroma <italic>(Tdo2, Ido1, Ido2)</italic> or various immune cell populations <italic>(Afmid, Kmo, Kynu, Haao, Qprt, Nadsyn1)</italic> but not in the conceptus-derived trophoblasts that constitute the bulk of placental tissue (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). Additionally, we showed that HAAO enzyme activity was absent in the mouse placenta between E11.5 and E17.5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). Combined, these data indicate that the murine placenta does not conduct NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis.</p>
<p>Next, we quantified HAAO enzyme activity in the yolk sac between E11.5 and E17.5. By contrast to the placenta, <italic>Haao<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> yolk sacs exhibited HAAO enzyme activity during early organogenesis (E11.5 to E13.5), after which it progressively declined (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). The decline in HAAO activity in the yolk sac coincided with its rise in the embryonic liver (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). In the absence of available stage-appropriate RNA-seq datasets for the yolk sac, we assessed NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway gene expression by RT-qPCR between E10.5 and E17.5. Transcript levels for early pathway genes (<italic>Tdo2, Ido2</italic>, <italic>Afmid</italic>) were similar across all stages, whereas expression of subsequent genes (<italic>Kmo, Kynu, Haao, Qprt, Nadsyn1</italic>) was highest at E10.5, then declined 2-10 fold by E17.5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,B</xref>).</p>

Downstream of NAMN, NAD+ levels were not significantly affected by <italic>Haao</italic> genotype at any stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Table S3</xref>). However, levels of the NAD Salvage Pathway metabolite NAM and waste metabolites 2PY and 4PY were significantly reduced in E10.5 <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> yolk sacs relative to <italic>Haao<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G,H</xref>, <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Table S3</xref>), suggesting that loss of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis resulted in a perturbation of the NAD Salvage Pathway metabolic profile to compensate for and maintain NAD levels.</p>
<p>These data, combined with the presence of HAAO activity and expression of all requisite pathway genes, confirmed that the yolk sac performs NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis from at least E10.5 onwards and therefore is the site of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway activity in the conceptus during organogenesis prior to the formation of a functional liver.</p>

<p>Having confirmed that NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis is performed in the yolk sac during early organogenesis, we next sought to understand how its activity is perturbed under conditions that cause CNDD. The data outlined above was generated using a diet rich in vitamin B3 which allows pregnant mice with a genetic block in the NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway to generate NAD via the Preiss-Handler and NAD Salvage Pathway and provide sufficient NAD precursors to their embryos for normal development. Due to higher metabolic rate and food intake per body weight in mice compared to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bachmanov et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Holliday et al., 1967</xref>), to induce CNDD in mice, pregnant females need to be given L-tryptophan and/or vitamin B3 restricted diets, thereby limiting their ability to provide NAD precursors to the embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuny et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Szot et al., 2024</xref>). Given that NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis is established in the yolk sac by E10.5, we placed <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mothers on a NAD precursor-restricted diet specifically between E7.5 and E10.5. During this time window, L-tryptophan and vitamin B3 were removed from the chow and 1000 mg/L L-tryptophan and 3.5 mg/L nicotinic acid were supplemented in the drinking water (hereon referred to as NW3.5) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).

<p>Embryos from mothers on the NW3.5 diet were assessed for the presence of congenital anomalies at E18.5. <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos were significantly smaller than their <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> littermates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, 86.7% of <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos were malformed, with 83.3% (25/30) of them presenting with multiple defects (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table S4</xref>).

By contrast, the ability to perform NAD de <italic>novo</italic> synthesis prevented NAD deficiency in <italic>Haao</italic><sup>+/-</sup> littermate embryos; the only defect was a solitary case of heart ventricular defect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table S4</xref>).</p>

<title>The yolk sac has reduced NAD availability under conditions that induce congenital malformations</title>
<p>Having established the importance of E10.5 as a key stage of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis, we next characterised how maternal dietary NAD precursor-restriction between E7.5 and E10.5 affected levels of NAD and related metabolites in the yolk sac at E10.5.

Therefore, yolk sac samples from the maternal NW15 dietary condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) were collected as appropriate controls for comparison to NW3.5 samples.</p>
<p>Due to their small size, 2-3 yolk sacs were pooled per sample for NAD metabolite quantification by UHPLC-MS/MS. The diet itself had profound effects on the yolk sac metabolites (<xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Table S5</xref>-<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Although L-tryptophan concentration in the drinking water was equivalent in both diets, its levels were lower in NW3.5 yolk sacs than NW15 (<xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Table S5</xref>-<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">6</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The abundance of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis pathway metabolites both upstream (3HAA) and downstream (QA, NAMN, NAAD) of the <italic>Haao</italic> genetic block was significantly altered in <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> yolk sacs, respectively, relative to their NW15 counterparts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-E</xref>,Table S5-6).

By contrast, the inability of <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> yolk sacs to perform NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis resulted in a significant decline in NAD+ (54-71%) and NAM (69-77%) levels relative to <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> on the equivalent diet (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F-G</xref>, <xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Table S5</xref>-<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">6</xref>).

<title>The NAD metabolome of the yolk sac and embryo correlate during early organogenesis</title>
<p>The yolk sac has a nutritional role in mammals as it uptakes and processes maternally derived macro- and micronutrients and transfers these to the embryo via their interconnected and expanding vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Burton et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ornoy and Miller, 2023</xref>).

Therefore, we explored the effects of impaired NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of the yolk sac on NAD metabolite levels of the embryo.</p>
<p>We analysed the embryos that corresponded to the metabolically analysed yolk sacs above. Whilst we had to pool 2-3 yolk sacs at E10.5 for analysis, embryos were sufficiently large to be analysed individually with the embryo corresponding to one of the pooled yolk sacs. Contrary to observations at E18.5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), <italic>Haao</italic> genotype had no effect on embryo weight within the same dietary condition, but embryos were significantly smaller on NW3.5 than NW15 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>).Consistent with the yolk sac samples, the diet had a marked effect on embryonic NAD status, with NAD+ and the waste metabolites 2PY and 4PY significantly reduced in NW3.5 embryos relative to the same <italic>Haao</italic> genotype on the NW15 diet (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E,G,H</xref>, <xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Table S5</xref>).

Neither the placenta nor the embryonic liver synthesise NAD <italic>de novo</italic> at E10.5, suggesting that these metabolites either originate from the yolk sac, which is consistent with the connection of vitelline and embryonic vasculature, or that another embryonic cell type is synthesising NAD <italic>de novo</italic> at E10.5.</p>
<p>To test the latter option, we examined pathway gene expression in the embryo at E10.5 using the ‘mouse organogenesis cell atlas’ (MOCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cao et al., 2019</xref>). Except for some limited <italic>Afmid</italic> and <italic>Kynu</italic> expression predominantly in immune cell populations, the requisite genes were not expressed, including in hepatocytes (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>). Therefore, intermediary metabolites were seemingly exchanged between the yolk sac and the embryo. To explore this, we calculated the Pearson correlation for all measured NAD-related metabolites between corresponding yolk sacs and embryos. Protein-normalised concentrations of those metabolites differentially abundant by <italic>Haao</italic> genotype (3HAA, NAMN, QA and NAAD) were significantly positively correlated between the embryo and yolk sac (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I-J</xref>). Overall, this suggests extensive metabolite exchange between conceptus tissues occurred.</p>
<p>Levels of NAD Salvage Pathway metabolites NAD+, NAM and NMN were also significantly positively correlated both within and between the yolk sac and embryo tissues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I,K</xref>). NAM is the main NAD precursor exported into circulation after NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis for use in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Given the limited availability of other usable alternative NAD precursors in mouse circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cuny et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), NAD levels of <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> conceptuses likely depend on maternal plasma NAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cuny et al., 2023</xref>). Though their overall concentration markedly differed (<xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Table S5</xref>-<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">6</xref>), embryo and yolk sac NAM correlated strongly, irrespective of <italic>Haao</italic> genotype (<xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Table S5</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>). Therefore, embryonic NAD status depends on NAD precursor availability in the yolk sac, which is itself determined by both maternal provision and NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis activity.</p>

<p>The yolk sac is derived from two extraembryonic lineages, the endoderm and mesoderm, which subsequently differentiate into various specialised cell types including yolk sac endoderm, vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, erythroid progenitors/cells, myeloid progenitors/cells, and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zhao and Choi, 2019</xref>). <italic>Tdo2</italic> was only expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, whereas all other NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway genes (<italic>Afmid</italic>, <italic>Kmo</italic>, <italic>Kynu</italic>, <italic>Haao</italic>, <italic>Qprt</italic> and <italic>Nadsyn1</italic>) were exclusively expressed in the yolk sac endoderm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).

<p>To establish when gene expression commenced in the endodermal lineage, we used the “extraembryonic (ExE) endoderm” population from the mouse gastrulation atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pijuan-Sala et al., 2019</xref>).

<p>Despite the structural differences between the mouse yolk sac and its human equivalent, the definitive secondary yolk sac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Ross and Boroviak, 2020</xref>), there is increasing evidence that many metabolic pathways are conserved in the endodermal cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cindrova-Davies et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Goh et al., 2023</xref>).

Therefore, we investigated whether NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis is among the conserved metabolic pathways between the two species. We examined expression of the pathway requisite genes by re-analysing bulk and scRNA-seq for the human yolk sac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cindrova-Davies et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Goh et al., 2023</xref>) and hepatocyte lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wesley et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>All NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway genes were expressed within at least one human yolk sac bulk RNA-seq sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cindrova-Davies et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), but there were significant differences in transcript levels between them. High <italic>TDO2</italic> expressing yolk sacs concurrently expressed <italic>NMNAT1</italic>, and to a lesser extent <italic>NADSYN1</italic> (3/9), but showed limited expression of the other requisite genes.

<p>Re-analysis of published human scRNA-seq yolk sac data generated across organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Goh et al., 2023</xref>) showed that unlike in mice, requisite genes were expressed in multiple populations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). <italic>KMO</italic> expression was limited in the endoderm, with more robust expression observed in monocytes.

<p>By contrast, in the hepatocyte lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wesley et al., 2022</xref>), every NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis pathway gene was expressed by 5 PCW (hepatoblast (HB) stages 1 and 2) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>) and remained constant throughout foetal hepatocyte stages (FH) 1 (7-11 PCW) and 2 (12-17 PCW).

<p>Therefore, requisite NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis gene expression dynamics in humans largely recapitulate findings in mice with the pathway primarily active in the yolk sac endodermal cells during early organogenesis. As expression declines in this population, it increases in the hepatocyte lineage. The only major difference between the species is whether NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway activity in the embryonic liver is established during or after organogenesis, respectively.</p>

<p>NAD deficiency during human and mouse development causes CNDD characterised by multiple congenital malformations and foetal loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cuny et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuny et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dunwoodie et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mark and Dunwoodie, 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Szot et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Szot et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Szot et al., 2021</xref>). Human CNDD cases are characterised by biallelic pathogenic variants in either <italic>KYNU, HAAO</italic> or <italic>NADSYN1</italic>, all genes of the NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway. Mouse models of CNDD demonstrate that NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis occurs in the conceptus and that this activity is required for normal embryonic development unless the mother provides sufficient vitamin B3 which bypasses NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis. Here we report that NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis occurs at two sites in the conceptus; first in the transient extra-embryonic yolk sac during organogenesis, and later in the embryonic liver once formed. It is noteworthy that the placenta lacks this activity. We present evidence in human gene expression data that the NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway also occurs initially in the secondary yolk sac and later in the embryonic liver. Until now, the site of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis in the mammalian conceptus was unknown. The necessity of this metabolic activity in the yolk sac highlights the importance of this transient tissue in mammalian embryogenesis.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>The murine yolk sac is capable of synthesising NAD de novo from L-tryptophan</title>
<p>The yolk sac has various important functions during embryogenesis, including the uptake and processing of macro- and micronutrients before and after the formation of a functional chorioallanotic placenta. It also facilitates the transport of maternal lipids, cholesterol and other metabolites to the embryo until the embryonic liver can take over this function, and it is involved in haematopoiesis and gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cindrova-Davies et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the yolk sac metabolises teratogenic substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Terlouw and Bechter, 1992</xref>). Disruption of yolk sac function causes embryonic malformation phenotypes that overlap with CNDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brent and Fawcett, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brent et al., 1971</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ornoy and Miller, 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Perez-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>), underscoring the yolk sac’s crucial role for normal embryo development.</p>
<p>Our finding of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis activity as another metabolic process of the yolk sac is notable because it represents a multi-step pathway involving several sequential enzyme-catalysed processes. Our RNA-seq data analysis confirms that all requisite genes required for NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis are expressed in mouse yolk sac endoderm cells except for <italic>Tdo2</italic> which is expressed in the adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells. Our HAAO enzymatic assays and metabolic analyses confirm the pathway is indeed functional. Therefore, this is the first demonstration of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis occurring in a tissue outside of the liver and kidney.</p>

<title>NAD deficiency in early organogenesis is sufficient to cause CNDD</title>
<p>We developed a refined CNDD model by which we modulated the maternal dietary NAD precursor supply during a 3-day window between E7.5 to E10.5 to be either low (NW3.5) or sufficient (NW15). Combined with maternal <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and paternal <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> genotype, the NW3.5 diet reproducibly generated <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos with malformations and unaffected <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> littermates. The <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos exhibited a spectrum of CNDD defects but no cleft palate or talipes seen in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>) with a precursor restriction for five days between E7.5 and E12.5. This is likely because the developmental origin of these defects occurs due to precursor restriction after the E7.5 to E10.5 period. These data support our previous findings that the timing and severity of NAD deficiency during organogenesis determines which organs and body parts are affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cuny et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, diminished NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis in the yolk sac is responsible for the defects caused by our 3-day precursor restriction, because the embryonic liver has not yet formed.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Maternal vitamin B3 early in pregnancy can overcome a genetic disruption of yolk sac NAD de novo synthesis</title>
<p>The most abundant NAD precursors in circulation are L-tryptophan, L-kynurenine, and NAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuny et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Flux experiments in mice confirmed that the liver converts L-tryptophan into NAM and excretes it into circulation to maintain NAD levels using the NAD Salvage Pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). The CNDD models employed here use <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mothers, who along with their <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos, cannot use the L-tryptophan provided. These <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mothers and embryos are instead dependent on the vitamin B3 provided in the diet to synthesise NAD. The amount provided in the NW15 diet is sufficient to maintain conceptal NAD levels and normal embryonic development. By contrast, on the more vitamin B3 restricted NW3.5 diet, the ability to perform NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis using the L-tryptophan is ultimately what distinguishes the unaffected <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> embryos from their affected <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> littermates.</p>
<p>Indeed, <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> yolk sacs had lowered NAD levels under both diets, but the lowest NAD levels were found in NW3.5 <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> yolk sacs with the combination of genetic block of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis and dietary NAD precursor restriction. Similarly, embryonic NAD levels significantly declined under genetic block (<italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, NW15) or vitamin B3 restriction (<italic>Haao</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, NW3.5) alone relative to <italic>Haao<sup>+/-</sup></italic> on the NW15 diet but these were still sufficient to maintain normal development. By contrast, those embryos that would go on to develop defects, <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos on NW3.5, had the lowest NAD levels at E10.5, as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuny et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). This underscores that NAD deficiency in the embryo is linked to the inability of the yolk sac to perform NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis from maternally provided precursors.</p>
<p>Though unaffected by the <italic>Haao</italic> genetic block, the Preiss-Handler Pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) does not appear to play a role in yolk sac NAD synthesis given that the relevant metabolites NAMN and NAAD were undetectable or negligible in <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> yolk sacs regardless of diet. This leaves the NAD Salvage Pathway, and its circulatory precursor NAM, as the main source of NAD in <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> yolk sacs, as well as their corresponding embryos, as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cuny et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Szot et al., 2024</xref>). Indeed, NAM levels were lower in <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> yolk sacs compared to <italic>Haao</italic><sup>+/-</sup> under the equivalent diet, and yolk sac NAM levels strongly correlated with embryonic NAM in corresponding embryos irrespective of condition. Though not significantly different, the increase in NAM levels in both <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> tissues on the NW15 diet over the NW3.5 diet, and the corresponding significant increase in NAD levels themselves, likely originates from the additional provision of NAM from the mother under this diet. Correspondingly, levels of excretion products 2PY and 4PY, which are generated from NAM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) when its levels are in excess, were significantly lowered and close to zero in E10.5 <italic>Haao</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos on NW3.5 relative to NW15 embryos, indicating a low to insufficient NAD status.</p>
<p>Besides the direct effect of embryonic NAD deficiency as the cause of CNDD, it is possible that the low NAD levels observed in the yolk sac under NW3.5 diet also interfere with other crucial yolk sac functions that are linked to NAD, such as ATP-dependent active transport of essential nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chang, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cindrova-Davies et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dutta and Sinha, 2017</xref>) or NADP-dependent enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Di Pietro et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>), thereby further impacting normal embryonic development. Likely, it is a combination of both. Determining the specific mechanisms of CNDD causation requires further studies.</p>
<p>Together, our NAD metabolome findings confirm that if vitamin B3 supply is limited, yolk sac NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis becomes essential for maintaining NAD and normal embryo development. Further work with more refined analytical approaches, such as molecular flux analysis, could determine to which extent specific metabolites are exchanged between maternal circulation, the yolk sac, and the embryo.</p>

<sec id="s3d">
<title>Yolk sac functions, very likely including NAD de novo synthesis, are conserved in human</title>
<p>Human embryogenesis requires a transient primary (day 7 to day 12) and secondary yolk sac (day 13 to day 49), while the mouse has a single yolk sac (E7.5 to birth). While human yolk sac anatomy and the timing of its presence differs to mouse, many functions are conserved between the species. These functions include serum protein synthesis, micro- and macronutrient transportation, and certain metabolic pathways, and it is also the site of primary haematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cindrova-Davies et al., 2017</xref>). Using published datasets, we showed that the human yolk sac expresses all genes required for NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis during comparable embryonic stages as seen in the mouse. Therefore, it is plausible that yolk sac NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis activity in early pregnancy is of similar importance to maintain NAD status and allow normal embryonic development in humans.</p>
<p>Recent studies have established a link between human yolk sac disruption and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Specifically, a disruption of yolk sac size and shape in the first trimester was a predictor of foetal anomalies and pregnancy loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cho et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Detti et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Marin et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Suguna and Sukanya, 2019</xref>). Maternal diabetes during pregnancy is also a known risk factor for congenital anomalies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gabbay-Benziv et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies suggest that maternal diabetes not only affects the embryo but also the yolk sac due to hyperglycaemia, impairing nutrient transportation that drives embryopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dong et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Reece et al., 1994</xref>). Furthermore, diabetes has been implicated in perturbations of the NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allegri et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liu et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Oxenkrug, 2015</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that disruption of NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis, either maternally or in the yolk sac itself, may contribute to the formation of congenital malformations under diabetic conditions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is possible that the yolk sac NAD <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis capability is also conserved in non-mammalian vertebrates. At least one step of the pathway, catalysed by AFMID (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), was found to be active in chicken egg yolk sac membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Seifert, 2017</xref>). Inhibition of this enzyme in the yolk sac resulted in lowered embryo NAD levels and some evidence of disrupted embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Seifert and Casida, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Seifert and Casida, 1979</xref>). Whether the entire NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway is active in the avian yolk sac, or whether downstream enzymatic synthesis steps are performed elsewhere, is unclear and requires further research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3e">
<title>Outlook</title>
<p>We have shown in mice that NAD deficiency due to an impaired NAD <italic>de novo</italic> Synthesis Pathway can be prevented by supplementing pregnant mice with the NAD precursor vitamin B3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuny et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Szot et al., 2024</xref>). NAD deficiency between E7.5 and 10.5 recapitulate the majority of CNDD malformations, and under more severe conditions from E0.5 to 3.5 all embryos die (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). These mouse stages span approximately days 1 to 17 of human development (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Therefore, in women at risk of becoming NAD deficient, it would be necessary to enter pregnancy with sufficient NAD by taking vitamin B3 prior to pregnancy. Further research on the molecular intricacies of CNDD causation, the timing, and the tissues and cells involved will aid understanding of the causes of birth defects and miscarriages more generally.</p>
<p>Here, we highlight the importance of the yolk sac in embryogenesis. Given the link between yolk sac changes and miscarriage are established, other environmental and/or genetic factors may perturb yolk sac function and drive congenital malformation formation. Whilst CNDD should be preventable through supplementation, other causes may not be. In these cases, interventions to restore function of this transient organ would require other approaches. One such way, if the cause was known, would be to inject stable RNA into the cavity surrounded by the yolk sac. The <italic>Haao<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CNDD model could provide an opportunity to test such an idea. If this approach worked, one would expect the uptake of <italic>Haao</italic> RNA by the yolk sac and the production of an active HAAO enzyme to prevent embryo malformation or death, similar to supplementation. This would provide proof of principle that genetic manipulation to improve yolk sac function is a therapy worth considering.</p>

<title>Animal experiments</title>
<p>All animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Garvan Institute of Medical Research/St. Vincent’s Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee, Sydney, Australia (approvals 18/27 and 21/18). The <italic>Haao</italic> loss-of-function mouse line (allele <italic>Haao</italic><sup>em1Dunw</sup>) has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Mice were maintained on Breeder diet (Rat and Mouse Premium Breeder Diet, Gordons Specialty Feeds, Bargo, Australia) containing 90 mg/kg niacin and 3.7 g/kg L-tryptophan. Mice were set up for timed matings and pregnancy was confirmed by the presence of a vaginal copulation plug in the morning (defined as timepoint E0.5). Pregnant females were culled between E10.5 and E18.5 by cervical dislocation and embryos dissected. From each embryo, the following tissues were collected: whole visceral yolk sac, placenta (whole placenta at E10.5-11.5, ½ placenta at E12.5-13.5, ¼ placenta at E14.5-18.5), and whole embryonic liver. All embryonic tissues were weighed prior to being snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were genotyped for the <italic>Haao</italic> loss-of-functional allele as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuny et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>For experiments requiring limitation of the maternal dietary vitamin B3 supply during critical organogenesis stages, pregnant females were maintained on Breeder diet until E7.5. Between E7.5 and E10.5, the females were temporarily housed in a new cage and provided a diet lacking any NAD precursors (SF21-083, Specialty feeds) and drinking water containing 1 g/L L-tryptophan and 3.5 mg/L nicotinic acid (NW3.5) or 15 mg/L (NW15). At E10.5, females were re-placed on Breeder diet until embryo dissection.</p>
<p>E18.5 embryos were phenotyped as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cuny et al., 2020</xref>) except for the identification of heart defects, for which micro-CT was used. Briefly, hearts were dissected from fixed (4% paraformaldehyde with 1% glutaraldehyde) E18.5 embryos and stained in 0.7% phosphotungstic acid + 30% ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for a minimum of 7 days or until stained completely. Stained hearts were scanned using a Skyscan 1272 scanner (Bruker Corporation, Billerica, USA) at a resolution of 1092×1632 with a voltage of 80 kV and a 125 µA current. The filter was set to Al 1 mm with a pixel size of 4.95 µm. Projection images were recorded with 2300 ms exposure time per projection with a rotation step of 0.4° between projections. The hearts were scanned at a total of 360° rotation. Acquired projections were reconstructed using Nrecon software (Bruker) with smoothing set to 3, ring artefact reduction to 19, and beam hardening to 10%. Reconstructed volumes were exported in .TIFF format and visually inspected for structural heart defects.</p>

Briefly, volume of tissue lysis buffer (10 mM protease inhibitor in PBS) was adjusted by stage and tissue type to standardise total protein levels per assay (see Supplementary Table 1). Due to the small tissue size, yolk sacs and embryonic livers were pooled at early gestational stages to obtain sufficient material per biological replicate.

From the last supernatant after addition of chloroform and centrifugation, 30 µL were taken, diluted with 70 µL of 100 mM ammonium acetate in water (=sample for abundant metabolite quantification), and measured. The remainder of supernatant was dried in a vacuum centrifuge at room temperature, metabolites reconstituted in 60 µL of 100 mM ammonium acetate, centrifuged for 2 min at 15,000 g and 4°C, and 50 µL of the supernatant taken and measured by UHPLC-MS/MS as described (=sample for low concentration metabolite quantification). Metabolite concentration values were normalised by the tissue sample wet weight at dissection. Metabolite concentrations in NW3.5 and NW15 embryos and yolk sacs were additionally normalised by protein concentration in the solid fraction (pellet) remaining after the first centrifugation step of the metabolite extraction procedure. To determine total protein concentration in the pellets, they were washed in methanol, air dried using a vacuum centrifuge, resuspended in 0.2 M sodium hydroxide, and incubated at 95°C for 20 minutes. Insoluble proteins and other debris were removed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 7 minutes in a microcentrifuge and protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigated the mechanism underlying Congenital NAD Deficiency Disorder (CNDD) using a mouse model with loss of function of the HAAO enzyme which mediates a key step in the NAD de novo synthesis pathway. This study builds on the observation that the kynurenine pathway is required in the conceptus, as HAAO null embryos are sensitive to maternal deficiency of NAD precursors (vitamin B3) and tryptophan, and narrows the window of sensitivity to a 3-day period.</p>
<p>An important finding is that de novo NAD synthesis occurs in an extra-embryonic tissue, the visceral yolk sac, before the liver develops in the embryo. It is suggested that lack of this yolk sac activity leads to impaired NAD supply in the embryo leading to structural abnormalities found later in development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Previous studies show a requirement for HAAO activity for the normal development of embryos. Abnormalities develop under conditions of maternal vitamin B3 deficiency, indicating a requirement for NAD synthesis in the conceptus. Analysis of scRNA-seq datasets combined with metabolite analysis of yolk sac tissue shows that the NAD synthesis pathway is expressed and functional in the yolk sac from E10.5 onwards (prior to liver development).</p>
<p>HAAO enzyme assay enabled quantification of enzyme activity in relevant tissues including the liver (from E12.5), placenta, and yolk sac (from E11.5).</p>
<p>Comprehensive metabolite analysis of the NAD synthesis pathway supports the predicted effects of Haao knockout and provides analysis of the yolk sac, placenta, and embryo at a series of stages.</p>
<p>The dietary study (with lower vitamin B3 in maternal diet from E7.5-10.5) is an incremental addition to previous studies that imposed similar restrictions from E7.5-12.5.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this emphasises the importance of the synthesis pathway on the conceptus at stages before the liver activity is prominent.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The current dietary study narrows the period when deficiency can cause malformations (analysed at E18.5), and altered metabolite profiles (eg, increased 3HAA, lower NAD) are detected in the yolk sac and embryo at E10.5. However, without analysis of embryos at later stages in this experiment it is not known how long is needed for NAD synthesis to be recovered - and therefore until when the period of exposure to insufficient NAD lasts. This information would inform the understanding of the developmental origin of the observed defects.</p>
<p>More importantly, there is still a question of whether in addition to the yolk sac, there is HAAO activity within the embryo itself prior to E12.5 (when it has first been assayed in the liver - Figure 1C). The prediction is that within the conceptus (embryo, chorioallantoic placenta, and visceral yok sac) the embryo is unlikely to be the site of NAD synthesis prior to liver development. Reanalysis of scRNA-seq (Fig 1B) shows expression of all the enzymes of the kynurenine pathway from E9.5 onwards. However, the expression of another available dataset at E10.5 (Fig S3) suggested that expression is 'negligible'. While the expression in Figure 1B, Figure S1 is weak this creates a lack of clarity about the possible expression of HAAO in the hepatocyte lineage, or especially elsewhere in the embryo prior to E10.5 (corresponding to the period when the authors have demonstrated that de novo NAD synthesis in the conceptus is needed). Given these questions, a direct analysis of RNA and/or protein expression in the embryos at E7.5-10.5 would be helpful.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Disruption of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) de novo Synthesis Pathway, by which L-tryptophan is converted to NAD results in multi-organ malformations which collectively has been termed Congenital NAD Deficiency Disorder (CNDD).</p>
<p>While NAD de novo synthesis is primarily active in the liver postnatally, the site of activity prior to and during organogenesis is unknown. However, mouse embryos are susceptible to CNDD between E7.5-E12.5, before the embryo has developed a functional liver. Therefore, NAD de novo synthesis is likely active in another cell or tissue during this time window of susceptibility.</p>
<p>The body of work presented in this paper continues the corresponding author's lab investigation of the cause and effects of NAD Deficiency and the primary goal was to determine the cell or tissue responsible for NAD de novo synthesis during early embryogenesis.</p>
<p>The authors conclude that visceral yolk sac endoderm is the source of NAD de novo synthesis, which is essential for mouse embryonic development, and furthermore that the dynamics of NAD synthesis are conserved in human equivalent cells and tissues, the perturbation of which results in CNDD.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the primary findings regarding the source of NAD synthesis, the temporal requirement, and conservation between rodent and human species are quite novel and important for our understanding of NAD synthesis and its function and role in CNDD.</p>
<p>The authors used UHPLC-MS/MS to quantify NAD+ and NAD-related metabolites and showed convincingly that the NAD salvage pathway can compensate for the loss of NAD synthesis in Haao-/- embryos, then determined that Haao activity was present in the yolk sac prior to hepatic development identifying this organ as the site of de novo NAD synthesis. Dietary modulation between E7.5-10.5 was sufficient to induce CNDD phenotypes, narrowing the window of susceptibility, and then re-analysis of RNA-seq datasets suggested the endoderm was the cell source of NAD synthesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Page 4 and Table S4. The descriptors for malformations of organs such as the kidney and vertebrae are quite vague and uninformative. More specific details are required to convey the type and range of anomalies observed as a consequence of NAD deficiency.</p>
<p>Can the authors define whether the role of the NAD pathway in a couple of tissue or organ systems is the same? By this I mean is the molecular or cellular effect of NAD deficiency is the same in the vertebrae and organs such as the kidney. What unifies the effects on these specific tissues and organs and are all tissues and organs affected? If some are not, can the authors explain why they escape the need for the NAD pathway?</p>
<p>Page 5 and Figure 6C. The expectation and conclusion for whether specific genes are expressed in particular cell types in scRNA-seq datasets depend on the number of cells sequenced, the technology (methodology) used, the depth of sequencing, and also the resolution of the analysis. It is therefore essential to perform secondary validation of the analysis of scRNA-seq data. At a minimum, the authors should perform in situ hybridization or immunostaining for Tdo2, Afmid, Kmo, Kynu, Haao, Qprt, and Nadsyn1 or some combination thereof at multiple time points during early mouse embryogenesis to truly understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of expression and NAD synthesis.</p>
<p>Absolute functional proof of the yolk sac endoderm as being essential and required for NAD synthesis in the context of CNDD might require conditional deletion of Haoo in the yolk sac versus embryo using appropriate Cre driver lines or in the absence of a conditional allele, could be performed by tetraploid embryo-ES cell complementation approaches. But temporal dietary intervention can also approximate the same thing by perturbing NAD synthesis Shen the yolk sac is the primary source versus when the liver becomes the primary source in the embryo.</p>

<p>General comments, factual mistakes:</p>
<p>Reviewer 1 - Summary: “This study builds on the observation that the kynurenine pathway is required in the conceptus, as HOO null embryos are sensitive to maternal deficiency of NAD precursors (vitamin B3) and tryptophan, and narrows the window of sensitivity to a 3-day period.”</p>
<p>Correction:</p>
<p>Vitamin B3 should not be in parentheses, because vitamin B3 and tryptophan are both NAD precursors. We also suggest that the second half of this sentence is changed to “…and narrows the window of sensitivity to a 3-day period from embryonic day 7.5 to E10.5.” Currently, it reads as if Haao-null embryos are sensitive to any 3-day period of maternal NAD precursor restriction.</p>
<p>Reviewer 1 – Strengths: “Abnormalities develop under conditions of maternal vitamin B3 deficiency, indicating…”</p>
<p>Correction:</p>
<p>We suggest replacing “vitamin B3 deficiency” with “NAD deficiency”, as this is more accurate.</p>
<p>Reviewer 2 – Strengths: “…and then re-analysis of RNA-seq datasets suggested the endoderm was the cell source of NAD synthesis.”</p>
<p>Correction:</p>
<p>We suggest re-phrasing this sentence to “…and then re-analysis of RNA-seq datasets suggested the yolk sac endoderm cells are the source of NAD de novo synthesis.”</p>

<p>Kidney defects were classified as described in Cuny et al. 2020 PNAS (PMID:32015132). In brief, kidneys with a length (tip to tip) of ≤ 1.5 mm in length were counted as hypoplastic, because the average length of a normal kidney at E18.5 is 2.98 mm (2.75-3.375 mm). The one dysmorphic kidney we observed in our dataset had a cyst. We plan to include this information plus more details of the observed vertebral defects in the revised version of this manuscript.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this is a very important question, but consider it beyond the scope of this manuscript. To elucidate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms in individual organs will require a multiomic approach because NAD is involved in hundreds of molecular and cellular processes affecting gene expression, protein levels, metabolism, etc. For details of NAD functions that have relevance to embryogenesis see Dunwoodie et al 2023 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1089/ars.2023.0349">https://doi.org/10.1089/ars.2023.0349</ext-link>. Furthermore, organs develop at different times during embryogenesis with both distinct, but in some cases shared, molecular and cellular processes. Relating these to specific NAD functions is the challenge. We are currently seeking funds to investigate how NAD deficiency disrupts organogenesis.</p>

<p>Page 5 and Figure 6C. The expectation and conclusion for whether specific genes are expressed in particular cell types in scRNA-seq datasets depend on the number of cells sequenced, the technology (methodology) used, the depth of sequencing, and also the resolution of the analysis. It is therefore essential to perform secondary validation of the analysis of scRNA-seq data. At a minimum, the authors should perform in situ hybridization or immunostaining for Tdo2, Amid, Kmo, Kanu, Haao, Qprt, and Nadsyn1 or some combination thereof at multiple time points during early mouse embryogenesis to truly understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of expression and NAD synthesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have tested antibodies against HAAO, KYNU, and QPRT in adult mouse liver samples (the main site of NAD de novo synthesis) which produced non-specific bands with western blotting. Therefore, in situ immunostaining  studies on embryonic tissues are not feasible. We will investigate the possibility of effectively localizing transcripts of NAD de novo synthesis enzymes using in situ hybridization.</p>

<p>Reviewer 1 has a related comment. We have additional data showing that at E11.5 the embryo has no HAAO activity, like the placenta. Similarly, E14.5 embryos with their livers removed, do not have HAAO activity either. We believe this provides sufficient proof that the yolk sac endoderm is the only site of NAD de novo activity in the conceptus until the liver has formed and takes over this function.</p>
