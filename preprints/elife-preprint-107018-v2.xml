<title>Abstract</title><p>In mice, postnatal endothelial cell (EC)-specific knockout of the genes coding for Transforming Growth Factor-Beta Receptor (TGFBR)1 and/or TGFBR2 eliminates TGF-beta signaling in vascular ECs and leads to distinctive central nervous system (CNS) vascular phenotypes. Knockout mice exhibit (1) reduced intra-retinal vascularization, (2) choroidal neovascularization with occasional anastomoses connecting choroidal and intraretinal vasculatures, (3) infiltration of diverse immune cells into the retina, including macrophages, T-cells, B-cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells, (4) a close physical association between immune cells and retinal vasculature, (5) a pro-inflammatory transcriptional state in CNS ECs, with increased ICAM1 immunoreactivity, and (6) increased Smooth Muscle Actin immunostaining in CNS pericytes. Comparisons of the retinal phenotype with two other genetic models of retinal hypovascularization – loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling and loss of VEGF signaling – shows that the immune cell infiltrate is greatest with loss of TGF-beta signaling, more modest with loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling, and undetectable with loss of VEGF signaling. The phenotypes caused by loss of TGF-beta signaling in ECs recapitulate some of the cardinal features of retinal and neurologic diseases associated with vascular inflammation. These observations suggest that therapies that promote TGF-beta-dependent anti-inflammatory responses in ECs could represent a promising strategy for disease modulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the central nervous system (CNS), vascular development, structure, and function are tightly regulated by multiple signaling pathways, including the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Wnt, Notch, and TGF-beta pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Wälchli et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Rattner et al., 2022</xref>). These signals control angogenesis, vascular remodeling, and vascular permeability. With respect to permeability, the vasculature serving most of the CNS is distinguished from non-CNS vasculature by greatly reduced permeability, a specialization refered to as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or, in the retina, the blood-retina barrier (BRB).</p>
<p>Disorders of CNS vascular structure and function are a major cause of morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Ropper et al., 2023</xref>). These include arteriovenous malformations, vasculitis, atherosclerosis, small vessel disease, moyamoya, neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, many CNS diseases or disorders that are not primarily vascular – including Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, stroke, infection, and traumatic brain injury – are associated with altered vascular function, most commonly with reduced BBB integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Profaci et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Chen et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>A common feature of many CNS disorders is neuro-inflammation. Although vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are not generally considered to be part of the immune system, in some locations and under some conditions they acquire properties characteristic of immune cells, including secretion of cytokines, surface display of co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory receptors, and antigen presentation in association with MHC class II proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Pober and Sessa, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Amersfoort et al., 2022</xref>). The best characterized role for ECs in immune system function is as a site for binding and extravasation of circulating immune cells. As first demonstrated in lymphoid organs, ECs can recruit immune cells by expressing chemokines and cell-surface adhesion proteins that interact with cognate receptors on immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Sackstein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Blanchard and Girard, 2021</xref>). In the context of inflammation, increased production of chemokines and adhesion proteins by ECs in non-lymphoid organs leads to the local recruitment of circulating immune cells and their subsequent extravasation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Denes et al., 2024</xref>). Under non-inflammatory conditions, ECs are maintained in a quiescent state. In CNS ECs, quiescence is maintained in part by the actions of astrocyte-derived Sonic Hedgehog and endothelial Wnt signaling, with the result that few immune cells other than resident microglia are found within the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Alvarez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Lengfeld et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>TGF-beta signaling regulates inflammation in many tissues and in many cell types, as determined by the phenotypes of ligand, receptor, and down-stream effector (SMAD) knockout (KO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Shull et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kulkarni et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Travis and Shepard, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Massagué and Sheppard, 2023</xref>). TGF-beta signaling also controls vascular development, with loss-of-function mutations in TGF-beta receptor 1 (TGFBR1/ALK5), TGFBR2, the EC accessory receptor Endoglin, or various SMADs producing defects in endothelial and/or pericyte development and early lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Goumans et al., 2009</xref>). The principal ligands for the TGFBR1-TGFBR2 heterodimer are the three highly homologous TGF-beta family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Heldin and Moustakas, 2016</xref>). TGF-beta ligands are initially secreted as inactive (“latent”) complexes that include inhibitory subunits, and the dimeric ligands are subsequently released by the catalytic action of integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Shi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Dong et al., 2017</xref>). Constitutive loss of both TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3, loss of integrins expressed by glia, or loss of TGFBR2 in endothelial cells produce similar defects in CNS angiogenesis and CNS vascular integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cambier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Mu et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aluwihare et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Nguyen et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Allinson et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Arnold et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of TGF-beta signaling in retinal vascular development has been studied with CreER/LoxP conditional KO mice, both to facilitate survival beyond the early lethality of constitutive KO alleles and to permit the study of cell-type specific KOs. Postnatal loss of TGFBR2 in all ocular cell types leads to microaneurysms, leaky capillaries, retinal hemorrhages, reactive microglia, and pericyte abnormalities, a picture that closely resembles the pathologies associated with severe diabetic retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Braunger et al., 2015</xref>). Postnatal EC-specific loss of TGFBR2 leads to defective retinal angiogenesis, the absence of an intraretinal capillary plexus, and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) (Allinson et al., 2011, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Schlecht et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Zarkada et al., 2021</xref>). The present study was undertaken to more fully define the cellular and molecular defects associated with endothelial-specific loss of TGF-beta signaling in the CNS, with an emphasis on the retina. In particular, we have sought to define the relationship between endothelial TGF-beta signaling and inflamation, as inflammation is a likely driver of diabetic retinopathy and AMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Wang et al., 2024</xref>).</p>

<title>Choroidal neovascularization with loss of endothelial TGF-beta signaling</title>
<p>Retinal ECs were visualized with GS-lectin, anti-PECAM1, or anti-CLDN5 in retinas from young adult mice with early postnatal EC-specific loss of <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> or <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> [<italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic> or <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr2<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic>mice treated with 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4HT) between postnatal day (P)3 and P5]. These retinas show moderate disorganization of the three nuclear layers and a near absence of capillaries in the outermost tier of the retinal vasculature in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>; <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with earlier descriptions of EC-specific inactivation of <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> (Allinson et al., 2011, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Schlecht et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Zarkada et al., 2021</xref>). These retinas also show multiple regions of choroidal (i.e., subretinal) neovascularization (CNV) as highlighted by the white arrows in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A and B</xref> (middle row) [see also <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> (right), and <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1B</xref>].</p>

</fig>
<p>Flatmounts of <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic> retinas mounted with the photoreceptor side up and imaged at the level of the photoreceptors and RPE show many regions with scattered CD45+ immune cells (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1D</xref>, upper panel) and zones of CNV that can be visualized in their entirety by immunstaining for a vascular marker (COL4 in <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1D</xref>, lower panel).</p>
<p>Flatmounts of control retinas immunostained and imaged in the same manner show no CD45+ cells in the outer retina and no CNV. Subretinal zones with normal morphology or with CNV are also seen in toluidine blue-stained epon-embedded sections (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 2</xref>). Quantification of whole eye cross-sections shows an average of one to four zones of CNV per section in <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic> and <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr2<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic>retinas, but no detectable CNV in phenotypically WT control retinas (typically <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/+</sup></italic> or <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr2<sup>CKO/+</sup></italic>) or in retinas with severely reduced intraretinal vascular development secondary to loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling (<italic>Ndp<sup>KO</sup></italic>; <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1C</xref>). Although the quantification in <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1C</xref> shows more CNV zones per section in <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr2<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic> retinas compared to <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic> retinas, we think it likely that a more extensive sampling would show little or no difference between these two genotypes.</p>
<p>Throughout this study, our analyses of EC-specific KO of <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> (<italic>VEcadCreER;TgfbrR1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic>), <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> (<italic>VEcadCreER;TgfbrR2<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic>) and of both <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> and <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> (<italic>VEcadCreER;TgfbrR1<sup>CKO/-</sup>;Tgfbr2<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic>) indicate that the vascular phenotypes in the brain and retina are virtually identical across all three genotypes, consistent with current models that envision TGFBR1-TGFBR2 heterodimers as the active receptor complex (e.g., compare <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and 1B, and compare <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplements 1</xref> and 3). In the figures that follow, all analyses have been conducted with EC-specific KO of <italic>Tgfbr1</italic>. For completeness, we also include some examples from EC-specific KO of <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> or EC-specific double KO of <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> and <italic>Tgfbr2</italic>.</p>
<p>In wild type (WT) mice, all retinal ECs are PECAM1+ (Platelet and Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1) and CLDN5+ (Claudin5, a marker of BBB and BRB vasculature) and all of the choroidal ECs are PLVAP+ (Plasmalemma Vesicle-Associated Protein, a marker of permeable vasculature) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and 1C; <xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 3</xref>). In mice with EC-specific deletion of <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> or <italic>Tgfbr2,</italic> all of the choroidal ECs are PLVAP+, all of the retinal ECs remain PLVAP-, and most, but not all, retinal ECs are CLDN5+ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and 1C; <xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 3</xref>). We note that this PLVAP phenotype contrasts with the phenotype caused by mutations in the Norrin/Fzd4 pathway, which converts all retinal ECs to PLVAP+ and all capillary and vein ECs to CLDN5- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Mutant retinas also exhibit occasional anastomoses between the subretinal and retinal vasculatures, a feature never observed in control retinas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, white arrows in bottom panels). The intraretinal segments of the communicating vessels are CLDN5+/PLVAP- and the subretinal segments, which invariably arise in a zone of CNV, are CLDN5-/PLVAP+ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), implying a mixed origin for these vessels. The attenuated intraretinal vasculature produced by deficient TGF-beta signaling is associated with retinal hypoxia as determined by localized accumulation of Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF)1-alpha in the nuclei of retinal parenchymal cells (<xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 4</xref>).</p>
<p>In mutant retinas, CD45+ immune cells are abundant and many of these cells are closely associated with the subretinal and inner retinal vasculatures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and 1C; <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A</xref> and 1B). In control retinas, the only CD45+ cells are the relatively sparse microglia. In the several non-CNS tissues examined – heart, kidney, liver, and lung – the density of CD45+ cells appears to be unaffected in <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1s5" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 5</xref>). Immunostaining for RPE65, a marker for the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and toluidine blue-staining of epon-embedded retina sections both show RPE displacement at the sites of CNV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplements 1B and 2</xref>). In mutant retinas, there is little change in pericyte NG2 immunostaining (<xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 3</xref>).</p>
<p>As the phenotypes associated with EC-specific deletion of <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> or <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> involve both endothelial cells and immune cells, it is important to ask whether Cre-mediated recombination directed by <italic>VEcadCreER</italic> is, in fact, EC-specific.

Additionally, CD45 localization in immune cells is mutually exclusive with <italic>R26-LSL-SUN1-sfGFP-6xmyc</italic> reporter expression in the choroid, small intestine, and retina (<xref rid="fig1s7" ref-type="fig">figure 1 – figure supplement 7</xref>). In these experiments, the occasional exceptions to ERG and GFP co-localization consist of ECs in which Cre-mediated recombination failed to occur (e.g., <xref rid="fig1s6" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 6B</xref>, white arrows in the kidney and lung panels). As a further test of <italic>VEcadCreER</italic> specificity, we asked whether the EC-specific recombination of the <italic>R26-LSL-SUN1-sfGFP-6xmyc</italic> reporter observed on a WT <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> background was retained in a <italic>Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic>background.</p>
<p>As seen in <xref rid="fig1s8" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 8</xref>, the CD45+ immune cells that accumulate in the retina lacking endothelial <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> do not express the GFP reporter, which retains its pattern of EC specificity. Based on these experiments, we conclude that all of the phenotypes observed in <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic>and <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr2<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic> mice follow from the loss of TGFBR function exclusively within ECs, and, more specifically, that all immune cell phenotypes in the retina are secondary to a change in EC properties.</p>
<p><italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic> retina flatmounts show large numbers of vascular tufts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). This aberrant vascular architecture, which is seen in both <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic> and <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr2<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic>mice, shows some similarities to the previously reported vascular architecture of <italic>Fzd4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Ndp<sup>KO</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Luhmann et al., 2005</xref>; Ye at al., 2009). In particular, retinas with each of these genotypes variably display disorganized and hypertrophic superficial vessels that give rise to intraretinal vascular tufts instead of the well-organized trilayered retinal vasculature. The morphologies and locations of the intraretinal vascular tufts are similar among all of these mutant genotypes, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>. At P14, when endothelial tip cells are building the central tier of intra-retinal capillaries in wild type (control) retinas (white arrows in the upper left panel in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), ECs in <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic> retinas have formed only a few rudimentary capillaries or disconnected vascular tufts (lower left panels in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

It is also worth noting that blood flow within the vascular tufts is almost certainly aberrant, as these structures comprise dead-ends rather than intermediary elements in the capillary network. This anomalous blood flow could also affect Sulfo-NHS-biotin accumulation.</p>

<p>In the quantification of CD45+ cells in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, cells with resident microglial morphology were not counted. As seen by immunostaining for ASC (Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD; nuclei) and CD45 (plasma membrane), microglia are present in control retina flatmounts at a density of 25-30 cells per 450 um x 450 um area in each of the three retinal layers in which they reside [retinal ganglion cell layer (RGC), inner plexiform layer (IPL), and outer plexiform layer (OPL)], for a total density of ∼85 cells per 450 um x 450 um area (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1</xref>). The density of CD45+ cells in <italic>Fzd4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Ndp<sup>KO</sup></italic> retinas in excess of the density of CD45+ cells in control retinas is ∼100 per 450 um x 450 um area, and the excess density of CD45+ cells in <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic> retinas is ∼200 per 450 um x 450 um area (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

<title>Hypovascularization secondary to loss of retinal VEGF signaling does not lead to immune cell infiltration</title>
<p>The presence of immune cells in retinas lacking endothelial TGF-beta signaling or Norrin/Fzd4 signaling could potentially arise from immune cell infiltration secondary to the hypoxic stress within the inner retina that results from reduced vasculaturization (<xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 4</xref>). Alternately, it could reflect changes in the intrinsic properties of retinal ECs that promote immune cell recruitment and extravasation. As a first step in distinguishing between these models, we generated and studied a distinct retinal hypovascularization model – <italic>Chx10-Cre;Vegfa<sup>CKO/CKO</sup></italic>– in which deletion of VEGF-A (hereafter, VEGF) in retinal Muller glia and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Rowan and Cepko, 2004</xref>) greatly reduces intra-retinal vascularization.</p>
<p>VEGF production by surface astrocytes guides the first stage of retinal angiogenesis, during which endothelial cells grow outward from the optic disc along the vitreal face of the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Stone et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Rattner et al., 2019</xref>). The second stage of retinal angiogenesis involves EC growth into the retina and is driven by VEGF production from cells within the inner retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Rattner et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>Chx10- Cre;Vegfa<sup>CKO/CKO</sup></italic> mice, the first stage of retinal angiogenesis is largely unaffected, but the second stage fails to occur (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>). In retinas lacking endothelial TGF-beta signaling or Norrin/Fzd4 signaling, high levels of retinal VEGF drive excess proliferation of ECs on the vitreal face of the retina and in intra-retinal tufts.

Instead, the simplest explanation for this data is that the absence of endothelial TGF-beta signaling – and, to a lesser extent, the absence of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling, but not the absence of VEGF signaling – leads to a pro-inflammatory vascular state that attracts immune cells. This second hypothesis is explored in the text and figures below.</p>

Close inspection of <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic>retinas shows that in venous ECs there are numerous ∼5 um diameter zones of reduced PECAM1 immunostaining, often accompanied by a rim of increased staining (white arrows in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).

Although one cannot determine, at the resolution of these images, whether the PECAM1 signal derives from ECs, immune cells, or both, these PECAM1+ rings likely represent the “transmigratory cup” that has been described as part of the process of leukocyte diapedesis and which appears to involve homophillic PECAM1-PECAM1 binding between ECs and leukocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Carman and Springer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Mamdouh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Arif et al., 2021</xref>).

<title>Increase in ICAM1 in retinal endothelial cells and altered pericyte properties with loss of endothelial TGF-beta signaling</title>

<p>Changes in EC phenotype can lead to changes in the characterstics of pericytes, as seen, for example, with defects in Platelet-Derived Growth Factor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lindahl and Betsholz, 1998</xref>). Although pericyte coverage appears to be minimally affected by loss of TGF-beta signaling (<xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 3</xref>), we observed a change in the relationship between NG2, a pericyte marker, and smooth muscle actin (SMA), a smooth muscle marker, in flatmounts of <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic> retinas compared to control retinas. In control retinas, SMA immunostaining is intense on arteries, patchy on veins, and nearly undetectable on capillaries, with the latter staining strongly for NG2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). In <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic> retinas, artery and vein SMA immunostaining is minimally affected, but capillaries and vascular tuft ECs immunostain for both NG2 and SMA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C and D</xref>). These differences could reflect higher levels of SMA in <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic>pericytes or a change in actin polymerization state.

<title>Transient defects in the BBB, altered pericyte properties, and localized immune infiltrates in the brain with loss of endothelial TGF-beta signaling</title>

<p>After P30, mice with EC-specific loss of TGFBR1, TGFBR2, or both TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 exhibit an increase in the density of focal brain lesions that are characterized by bleeding and an accumulation of immune cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). These brain lesions, which appear to be small cerebrovascular events (strokes), may explain the observation that otherwise healthy adult mice with EC-specific loss of TGF- beta signaling die at a rate of ∼20% per month.

<p>To obtain an unbiased assessment of gene expression changes in brain ECs lacking TGF-beta signaling, vascular fragments from P14 control and <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic> brains were enriched by centrifugation through Ficoll and used as input for single nucleus (sn)RNAseq (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>).

<p>snRNAseq on vascular fragments provides a snapshot of the transcriptomes of all of the major CNS cell classes, with ECs nuclei enriched to ∼15% of the total (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). It is evident from visual inspection of the shapes and positions of cell clusters in the UMAP plots that gene expression in ECs undergoes a substantial change with EC-specific loss of TGF-beta signaling, whereas gene expression in other cell types undergoes far smaller changes. A volcano plot of transcriptome changes within the EC cluster shows several dozen transcripts with fold changes &gt;4 and -log<sub>10</sub> p-values greater than 50 (chosen as a conservative p-value cut-off for this comparison of 2475 control vs 2944 mutant nuclei) (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>). <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref> shows UMAP plots for individual transcripts that exhibit increased abundance in mutant ECs (<italic>Ahr</italic>, <italic>Nr5a2</italic>, <italic>Pcdh17</italic>, and <italic>Tgfbr3</italic>), decreased abundance in mutant ECs (<italic>Stra6</italic>, <italic>AU021092</italic>, and <italic>Htra3</italic>), or little or no change in mutant ECs (<italic>Icam1</italic> and <italic>Icam2</italic>). In <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic>ECs, the elevation in <italic>Tgfbr3</italic> transcripts, which code for Beta-glycan, an accessory (type III) TGFBR receptor, could represent a homeostatic response to reduced TGF-beta signaling since Beta-glycan enhances the binding of TGF- beta ligands to the TGFBR1-TGFBR2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Heldin and Moustakas, 2016</xref>). The lack of a significant change in <italic>Icam1</italic> transcript levels implies that the increase in ICAM1 immunostaining is a post-translational phenomenon, either an increase in protein level or an increase in protein accessibility.</p>
<p>Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) confirms that the greatest changes in gene expression among CNS cell types in <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic> mice are in ECs, and it shows that EC transcriptome changes connected to the cell cycle and inflammation are the dominant categories (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9D</xref>). The latter includes the categories “Interferon (IFN) gamma response”, “Interferon (IFN) alpha response”, “IL2/STAT5 signaling”, and “Inflammation”. An analysis of two categories of inflammation-associated proteins – components of the NF-kappa-B (NFkB) pathway and the integrins – shows (1) constitutive enrichment in CNS ECs of transcripts coding for the p50 subunit of NFkB (<italic>Nfkb1</italic>) and, most dramatically, NFkB inhibitor alpha (<italic>Nfkbia</italic>), and (2) with loss of TGF-beta signaling, upregulation of transcripts coding for multiple integrins, including alpha1, alpha2, alpha4, alpha6, and beta1 (<xref rid="fig9s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 9 – figure supplement 1A and 1B</xref>). <xref rid="fig9s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 9 – figure supplement 1D</xref> presents a pictorial summary of the trancripts coding for those chemokines, adhesion proteins, integrins, and TNF receptor superfamily members that are up-regulated in CNS ECs in <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic> mice.</p>

Integrin alpha4/beta1 (Very Late Antigen-4; VLA-4) is a heterodimer adhesion protein expressed on ECs and immune cells that is implicated in immune cell homing. It is also one of several integrins expressed by ECs that mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Guerrero and McCarty, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Aman and Margadant, 2023</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The experiments described here show that postnatal EC-specific loss of TGF-beta signaling in mice leads to aberrent angiogenesis in the retina and a pro-inflammatory state within the retina and brain. More specifically, EC-specific loss of TGF-beta signaling leads to: (1) reduced intra-retinal vascularization, (2) choroidal neovascularization with occasional anastomoses connecting choroidal and intraretinal vasculatures, (3) infiltration of diverse immune cells into the retina, including macrophages, T-cells, B-cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells, (4) a close physical association between immune cells and vasculature, (5) a pro-inflammatory transcriptional state in CNS ECs, with increased ICAM1 immunoreactivity, and (6) increased SMA immunostaining in pericytes. A striking feature of the phenotypes studied here is their CNS specificity. Despite Cre-mediated recombination in ECs throughout the body directed by <italic>VEcadCreER</italic>, the vascular and inflammatory phenotypes associated with EC-specific loss of TGF-beta signaling appear to be largely confined to the CNS.</p>
<p>Comparisons of the retinal phenotype with two other genetic models of retinal hypovascularization – loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling and loss of VEGF signaling – reveal interesting differences. While loss of either Norrin/Fzd4 or VEGF signaling leads to a near absence of intra-retinal capillaries – similar to loss of TGF-beta signaling – the models differ in their immune phenotypes. The immune cell infiltrate is greatest with loss of TGF-beta signaling, more modest with loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling, and undetectable with loss of VEGF signaling. Interestingly, cleaved Caspase 3 is abundant in immune cells with loss of TGF-beta signaling but it is rare with loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling.</p>
<p>In considering the relationship between inflammation and vascular leakage with loss of TGF-beta signaling, it seems most likely that inflammation does not depend on vascular leakage in <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic> retinas because Sulfo-NHS-biotin leakage into the retinal (and brain) parenchyma is minimal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). By contrast, there could be a causal link between vascular leakage and inflammation with loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling because these retinas exhibit both leakage into the retinal parenchyma and inflammation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). As noted in the Results section, CreER-mediated recombination in <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic>mice after the completion of retinal vascular development (∼P14) did not lead to immune cell infiltration in the retina, suggesting that the abnormal development/anatomy of the retinal vasculature plays an essential role in the immune cell phenotype. This could reflect a role for the retinal hypoxia response in promoting a pro-inflammatory state, an hypothesis consistent with the absence of retinal inflammation with retina-specific loss of VEGF (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<title>A model for choroidal neovascularization</title>
<p>Choroidal neovascularization is the hallmark feature of neovascular AMD. The original classification scheme for neovascularization in AMD posited two categories: occult, or type 1, neovessels were those located in the sub-RPE space, and classical, or type 2, vessels were those located in the subretinal space (i.e., between the RPE and retina) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gass, 1997</xref>). More recently, a third type of neovessel has been recognized that consists of an anastomosis between choroidal and retinal vasculatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Freund et al., 2008</xref>), and these type 3 vessels are observed in approximately one-third of eyes with newly diagnosed neaovascular AMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jung et al., 2014</xref>). Among patients with type 3 vessels in only one eye, the probability that the other eye will develop type 3 vessels within three years is close to 100% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gross et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Multiple animal models of ocular neovascularization have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Grossniklaus et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Qiang et al., 2021</xref>). In the simplest model of CNV, a focal laser-induced injury to the RPE and Bruch’s membrane (the extracellular matrix that separates the RPE and the choroidal vessels) leads to growth of choroidal vessels through the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fabian-Jessing et al. 2022</xref>). This response reveals the intrinsic angiogenic potential of the choroidal vasculature, which is normally held in check by Bruch’s membrane and an intact RPE monolayer. Models of CNV that likely have greater relevance to pathogenic mechanisms in AMD have been developed in mice by altering – either singly or in combination – lipid/cholesterol metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative damage. These models include (1) KO of <italic>Cyp27a1</italic>, a ubiquitously expressed cytochrome P450 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Omarova et al., 2012</xref>), (2) <italic>Ccr2</italic>/<italic>Ccl2</italic> double KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Takeda et al., 2009</xref>), (3) ApoE over-expression combined with a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Malek et al., 2005</xref>), (4) <italic>Ccl2</italic>/<italic>Cx3cr1</italic> double KO combined with a low omega-3 polyunstaurated fatty acid diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chan et al., 2008</xref>), and (5) KO of Superoxide dismutase-1 (<italic>Sod1</italic>) and aging for at least one year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Imamura et al., 2006</xref>). We note that CNV was observed in the <italic>Ndp<sup>KO</sup></italic> mice studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Beck and colleagues (2018)</xref>, although we did not observe CNV in our <italic>Ndp<sup>KO</sup></italic> mice.</p>
<p>Genetic models for pathologic angiogenesis that may be relevant to type 3 neovascularization include (1) over-expression of VEGF in rod photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Tobe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Ohno-Matsui et al., 2002</xref>), (2) RPE-specific KO of the Von Hippel-Lindau gene (<italic>Vhl</italic>), which leads to activation of the hypoxia response and excessive production of VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Lange et al., 2012</xref>), (3) rod photoreceptor-specific KO of <italic>Vegfr1</italic>, which codes for FLT-1, a decoy receptor that reduces VEGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Luo et al., 2013</xref>), and (4) KO of the Very Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor (<italic>Vldlr</italic>), which presumably perturbs lipid metabolism (Heckenliveley et al., 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Hu et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Loss of TGF-beta signaling in ECs is mechansitically distinct from all of the above-mentioned models, and it has the added practical advantage that multiple CNV tufts are present in virtually every eye by three months of age without the need for dietary of other interventions (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Inflammation in retinal and brain vascular disease</title>
<p>Local and/or systemic inflammatory markers, such as cytokines, are elevated in patients with AMD, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vein occlusion (Tang et al., 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Kauppinen et al, 2016</xref>). One characteristic of the retinal inflammatory state is increased leukocyte adhesion to retinal ECs, which is observed in patients with diabetic retinopathy and may be a causal factor in vaso-occlusive events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chibber et al., 2007</xref>). In rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, ICAM1 and CD18 are elevated in retinal ECs, and genetic ablation of <italic>Icam1</italic> or <italic>Cd18</italic> or treatment with an ICAM1-blocking mAb reduces retinal leukostasis and vascular leakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Miyamoto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Joussen et al., 2004</xref>). Neuroinflammation in general, and vascular neuroinflammation in particular, is also a feature of multiple non-retinal CNS diseases, including Alzheimer disease, stroke, and multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Ritson et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Current evidence points to a combination of RPE oxidative damage, sub-RPE inflammatory cells, and complement activation as pathogenic mechanisms in neovascular AMD. In the early stages of AMD, inflammatory cells accumulate in the choroid and complement proteins accumulate in subretinal deposits, and, in the more advanced neovascular stage of AMD, choroidal neovascular tufts are associated with inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Kauppinen et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Armento et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Heloterä and Kaarniranta, 2022</xref>). Genetic evidence for a causal role of the complement system comes from the elevated AMD risk associated with the Y402H and I162V variants in the complement factor H gene, and less commonly with variants in the genes coding for complement factor 3 (C3), complement factor I (CFI), and the complement regulator SERPING1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Montezuma et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, the evidence presented here and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Schlecht et al. (2017)</xref> shows that loss of TGF-beta signaling in CNS ECs recapitulates some of the cardinal features of retinal and neurologic diseases associated with vascular inflammation.

<title>Tissue processing and immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Tissues were prepared and processed for immunohistochemical analysis as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Wang et al. (2012)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Zhou et al. (2014)</xref>. In brief, mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and then perfused via the cardiac route with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Non-ocular tissues were dissected and dehydrated in 100% cold methanol overnight at 4°C. Tissues were re-hydrated the following day in 1x PBS at 4°C for at least 3 hours before embedding in 3% agarose. Tissue sections of 100-200 μm thickness were cut using a Leica vibratome.</p>
<p>For whole-mount retinas, intact eyes were immersion fixed in 1% PFA in PBS at room temperature for 1 hour before the retinas were dissected. For eye sections, enucleated eyes were imbedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound (Tissue-Tek 4853) and frozen in dry ice. Embedded eyes were cut into 14 μm sections with a Zeiss cryostat and stored on glass slides at -80°C. For immunostaining, sections were warmed to room temperature, fixed in 1% PFA at room temperature for 30 minutes, and washed in PBS before pre-blocking.</p>
<p>For vascular permeability analysis, mice were injected intraperitoneally with Sulfo-NHS-biotin (100-200 μl of 20 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-biotin in PBS) 30-60 minutes prior to intracardiac perfusion. Covalently bound biotin was visualized in tissue sections or in whole-mount retinas with Texas Red conjugated Streptavidin.</p>
<p>Tissue sections or whole-mount retinas were permeabilized in PBSTC (1x PBS + 1% Triton X-100 + 0.1mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) overnight at 4°C, and subsequently incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies, diluted in 1x PBSTC + 7% normal goat or donkey serum. Samples were washed at least 6 times with 1x PBSTC over the course of 6-8 hours and subsequently incubated overnight at 4°C with secondary antibodies diluted in 1x PBSTC + 7% normal goat or donkey serum. The next day, samples were washed at least 6 times with 1x PBSTC over the course of 6 hours and mounted in Fluoromount G (SouthernBiotech 0100-01).</p>

<title>Image analysis for cell counts</title>
<p>The density of immune cells was quantified from retina or choroid flatmount images by manually counting cells using the point-and-click “Cell counter” tool in Fiji-ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/software/fiji/">https://imagej.net/software/fiji/</ext-link>).

<title>Image analysis for immunostaining and Sulfo-NHS-biotin staining intensities</title>
<p>SMA, NG2, and PECAM1 immunostaining intensities were quantified from images of retina flatmounts that had been processed identically and imaged with identical confocal microscope settings. From each quadrant of the retina, a 450 um x 450 um square was selected that lacked large arteries or veins. Using the “Analyze” tool and “Mean grey value” function Fiji-ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/software/fiji/">https://imagej.net/software/fiji/</ext-link>), the mean intensity values were determined for the individual immunostaining channel. The same method was used for ICAM1 intensities, except the region analyzed consisted of an entire quadrant of retina. For each experiment, which included experimental and control retinas, the mean pixel intensity in the ICAM1 channel was scaled for both experimental and control retinas so that the mean of the control value was set to 1.0. For quantifying streptavidin bound to Sulfo-NHS-biotin, small zones dispersed throughout the retina flat mount image and encompassing vessel-free parenchyma were captured as screenshots and their mean pixel intensities quantified with Fiji.</p>

<title>Purification of brain vascular fragments</title>
<p>Vascular fragments were purified from P14 control and <italic>VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1<sup>CKO/-</sup></italic>mouse brains as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hartz et al., 2018</xref>), with some modifications. For each preparation, one mouse was anesthetized using isoflurane, surface sterilized with 70% ethanol, sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and its brain dissected and transferred to a 10 cm tissue culture dish. The brain was minced into small pieces (∼1 × 1 mm) with a razor blade (100 strokes in each orthogonal direction) with two drops of Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS; no calcium, no magnesium) added to maintain moisture (Gibco, 14190144).</p>
<p>The minced brain tissue was suspended in 10 ml of ice-cold DPBS supplemented with 5 mM EDTA (Invitrogen, AM9262) and 60 U/ml of RNasin-Plus RNase Inhibitor (Promega, N2615), and gently homogenized using a smooth pestle in a Thomas Pestle Tissue Grinder (3431E45) on ice with 5 strokes. The sample was incubated on ice for 10 minutes, and then gently homogenized with 40 more strokes. To monitor the release of brain capillaries, 5 µl of the homogenate was briefly incubated at room temperature with DAPI and Isolectin GS-IB4 From <italic>Griffonia simplicifolia</italic> conjugated with Alexa Fluor™ 488 (Invitrogen, I21411) and then visualized under a fluorescent microscope.</p>
<p>The brain vascular fragments were pelleted by two rounds of centrifugation through 15% Ficoll PM 400 (Sigma-Aldrich, F4375). For the first round of centrifugation, 10 ml of the homogenate was vigorously mixed with 10 ml of 30% Ficoll PM 400. The sample was aliquoted into three 50 ml heavy-walled glass centrifuge tubes with round bottoms (Marienfeld, 3933041) and each tube was loaded with 6.7 ml of sample and then centrifuged at 5,800 x g for 20 min at 4°C. The pellets, containing enriched vascular fragments, were saved. For the second round of centrifugation, the supernatant from the first round of centrifugation, which included a layer of myelin at its top, was transferred to a fresh 50 ml glass tube and vigorously mixed. The sample was aliquoted into three heavy-walled glass centrifuge tubes and centrifuged as described for the first round. The pellets from the two rounds of centrifugation were resuspended and pooled in a total volume of 10 ml of DPBS supplemented with 1% BSA and 40 U/ml of RNasin-Plus RNase Inhibitor (“DPBS+BR”). The sample was centrifuged in a heavy-walled glass centrifuge tube with a round bottom at 300 x g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellets were resuspended and pooled in a total volume of 1 ml of DPBS+BR by gently pipetting 10 times with a 1 ml pipette tip.</p>
<p>The 1 ml suspension was filtered through a Nylon Mesh Filter (Tisch Scientific; 300 µm mesh, ME17240) to remove large tissue fragments. The material trapped by the filter was rinsed one time with 1 ml of DPBS+BR. The resulting 2-ml suspension was then filtered through a PluriStrainer 20 µm filter (Cell Strainer, 43-50020-03) to capture vascular fragments. The PluriStrainer 20 µm filter was placed on top of a 50-ml tube and loaded in several steps with the suspension, which was allowed to drain by gravity flow. The vascular fragments retained on the filter were then washed once with 1 ml of DPBS+BR. The vascular fragments were recovered from the surface of the filter with several washes with 1 ml of DPBS+BR. The resulting 3-ml sample was centrifuged in a 12 ml heavy-walled glass centrifuge tube with a round bottom (Marienfeld, 3933011, 12 ml) at 300 x g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 500 ul of DPBS buffer with 40 U/ml of RNasin Plus RNase Inhibitor using a 1 ml Low Retention Pipette Tip (1000 uL Filtered Pipette Tips for Rainin LTS Pipette - RNase and DNase Free; 3840/CS, LTS-1000FT-CS). The suspended vascular fragments were placed in a 1.5-ml Low Retention tube (Thermo Scientific, 3451) and centrifuged at 300 x g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was frozen on dry ice and stored at -80°C.</p>

<title>snRNAseq</title>
<p>Single nucleus (sn)RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the PIPseq T20 3’ Single Cell RNA Kit v4.0 PLUS or the PIPseq T10 Single Cell RNA Kit v5.0 (Fluent BioSiences; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Clark et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Fontanez et al., 2024</xref>).

Samples were homogenized in a 2 mL Dounce homogenizer, using 15 strokes with a loose-fitting pestle followed by 30 strokes with a tight-fitting pestle. The sample was filtered through a 10 μm filter (CellTrix, Sysmex, 04-004-2324), and nuclei were pelleted in Low Retention 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for 5 min at 500 x g at 4°C. Nuclei were washed twice with Nuclei Suspension Buffer (supplied in the Fluent BioSciences kit) supplemented with 1% BSA and 40 U/mL Protector RNase Inhibitor. Nuclei were counted, and ∼40,000 nuclei (for the T20 kit) or ∼20,000 nuclei (for the T10 kit) were used for library production following the Fluent BioSiences protocol. The resulting snRNA-seq libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq X Plus sequencer. Vascular fragments from two mouse brains were pooled for each snRNAseq library.</p>

<title>Analysis of snRNAseq data</title>
<p>Reads were aligned with the PIPseeker program (Fluent BioSiences, version 3.3.0) using the pipseeker-gex-reference-GRCm39-2023.04 index provided by Fluent BioSiences. The CellBender program was used to detect empty droplets and remove background (version 0.3.2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fleming et al., 2023</xref>). The SOLO program was used to remove doublets (scVI-tools 1.2.2-post2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bernstein et al., 2020</xref>). Manual curation was used to further remove potentially mixed (doublet) nuclei as well as clusters with multiple nuclei from samples AR7 and AR8. The data were normalized using a regularized negative binomial regression algorithm implemented with the SCTransform function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>). Batch effects were corrected using the Seurat RPCAIntegration function. UMAP dimensional reduction was performed using the R uwot package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot">https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot</ext-link>) integrated into the Seurat R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Melville, 2022</xref>). Data for the various scatter plots were extracted using the Seurat AverageExpression function, and differential gene expression was analyzed using the Seurat FindMarkers function. The Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to calculate p-values. The p-values were adjusted with a Bonferroni correction using all genes in the dataset. Data exploration, analysis, and plotting were performed using RStudio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">RStudio Team, 2020</xref>), the tidyverse collection of R packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Wickham, 2017</xref>), and ggplot2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Wickham, 2009</xref>).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript analyses the effects of deleting the TgfbR1 and TgfbR2 receptors from endothelial cells at postnatal stages on vascular development and blood-retina barrier maturation in the retina. The authors find that deletion of these receptors affects vascular development in the retina but importantly it affects the infiltration of immune cells across the vessels in the retina. The findings demonstrate that Tgf-beta signaling through TgfbR1/R2 heterodimers regulates primarily the immune phenotypes of endothelial cells in addition to regulating vascular development, but has minor effects on the BRB maturation. The data provided by the authors provides a solid support for their conclusions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript uses a variety of elegant genetic studies in mice to analyze the role of TgfbR1 and TgfbR2 receptors in endothelial cells at postnatal stages of vascular development and blood-retina barrier maturation in the retina.</p>
<p>(2) The authors provide a nice comparison of the vascular phenotypes in endothelial-specific knockout of TgfbR1 and TgfbR2 in the retina (and to a lesser degree in the brain) with those from Npd KO mice (loss of Ndp/Fzd4 signaling) or loss of VEGF-A signaling to dissect the specific roles of Tgf-beta signaling for vascular development in the retina.</p>
<p>(3) The snRNAseq data of vessel segments from the brains of WT versus TgfbR1 -iECKO mice provides a nice analysis of pathways and transcripts that are regulated by Tgf-beta signaling in endothelial cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses (Original Submission):</p>
<p>(1) The authors claim that choroidal neovascular tuft phenotypes are similar in TgfbrR1 KO and TgfbrR2 KO mice. However, the phenotypes look more severe in the TgfbrR1 KO rather than TgfbrR2 KO mice. Can the authors show a quantitative comparison of the number of choroidal neovascular tufts per whole eye cross-section in both genotypes?</p>
<p>(2) In the analysis of Sulfo-NHS-Biotin leakage in the retina to assess blood-retina barrier maturation, the authors claim that there is increased vascular leakage in the TgfbR1 KO mice. However, there does not seem like Sulfo-NHS-biotin is leaking outside the vessels. Therefore, it cannot be increased vascular permeability. Can the authors provide a detailed quantification of the leakage phenotype?</p>
<p>(3) The immune cell phenotyping by snRNAseq seems premature as the number of cells is very small. The authors should sort for CD45+ cells and perform single cell RNA sequencing.</p>
<p>(4) The analysis of BBB leakage phenotype in TgfbR1 KO mice needs to be more detailed and include some tracers in addition to serum IgG leakage.</p>
<p>(5) A previous study (Zarkada et al., 2021, Developmental Cell) showed that EC-deletion of Alk5 affects the D tip cells. The phenotypes of those mice look very similar to those shown for TgfbrR1 KO mice. Are D tip cells lost in these mutants by snRNAseq?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors meticulously characterized EC-specific Tgfbr1, Tgfbr2, or double knockout in the retina, demonstrating through convincing immunostaining data that loss of TGF-β signaling disrupts retinal angiogenesis and choroidal neovascularization. Compared to other genetic models (Fzd4 KO, Ndp KO, VEGF KO), the Tgfbr1/2 KO retina exhibits the most severe immune cell infiltration. The authors proposed that TGF-β signaling loss triggers vascular inflammation, attracting immune cells - a phenotype specific to CNS vasculature, as non-CNS organs remain unaffected.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The immunostaining results presented are clear and robust. The authors performed well-controlled analyses against relevant mouse models. snRNA-seq corroborates immune cell leakage in the retina and vascular inflammation in the brain.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have revised the manuscript and addressed all my questions.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors claim that choroidal neovascular tuft phenotypes are similar in TgfbrR1 KO and TgfbrR2 KO mice. However, the phenotypes look more severe in the TgfbrR1 KO rather than TgfbrR2 KO mice. Can the authors show a quantitative comparison of the number of choroidal neovascular tufts per whole eye cross-section in both genotypes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for asking about this.  Each VE-cad-CreER;TGFBR1 CKO/- and VE-cad-CreER;TGFBR2 CKO/- retina exhibits multiple zones of choroidal neovascularization.  The examples in Figures 1 and Figure 1 – Figure supplements 1 and 2 are mostly from retinas with loss of TGFBR1, but we could have chosen similar examples from retinas with loss of TGFBR2.  The quantification in the original version of Figure 1- Figure supplement 1 panel C had a labeling error.  It actually showed the quantification choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in the sum of both VE-cad-CreER;TGFBR1 CKO/- and VE-cad-CreER;TGFBR2 CKO/- retinas, not only in VE-cad-CreER;TGFBR1 CKO/- retinas as originally labeled.  The point that it made is that CNV is seen with loss of TGF-beta signaling but not in control retinas or retinas with loss of Norrin signaling.  We have now updated that plot by separating the data points for VE-cad-CreER;TGFBR1 CKO/- and VE-cad-CreER;TGFBR2 CKO/- retinas, so that they can be compared to each other.   The result shows ~2.5-fold more CNV in VE-cad-CreER;TGFBR2 CKO/- retinas compared to VE-cad-CreER;TGFBR1 CKO/-.  We think it likely that a more extensive sampling would show little or no difference between these two genotypes – but the data is what it is. This is now described in the Results section.</p>
<p>We have also added a panel D to Figure 1- Figure supplement 1, which shows a retina flatmount analysis of CNV.  This is done by mounting the retina with the photoreceptor side up so that the outer retina can be optimally imaged.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In the analysis of Sulfo-NHS-Biotin leakage in the retina to assess blood-retina barrier maturation. The authors claim that there is increased vascular leakage in the TgfbR1 KO mice. However, it does not seem like Sulfo-NHS-biotin is leaking outside the vessels. Therefore, it cannot be increased vascular permeability. Can the authors provide a detailed quantification of the leakage phenotype?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this point.  Your comment prompted us to look at this question in greater depth with more experiments.  We have expanded Figure 2 to show and quantify a comparison between control (i.e. phenotypically WT), NdpKO, and TGFBR1 endothelial KO and we have expanded the associated part of the Results section (Figure 2C and D).  In a nutshell, control retinas show little Sulfo-NHS-biotin accumulation in or around the vasculature or in the parenchyma; NdpKO retinas show Sulfo-NHS-biotin accumulation in the vasculature and in the parenchyma (i.e., the area between the vessels); and VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1CKO/- retinas show Sulfo-NHS-biotin accumulation in the vascular tufts with minimal accumulation in the non-tuft vasculature and minimal leakage into the parenchyma.   The conclusion is that the bulk of the retinal vasculature in TGFBR1 endothelial KO mice is minimally or not at all leaky – very different from the situation with loss of Norrin/Frizzled4 signaling.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The immune cell phenotyping by snRNAseq is premature, as the number of cells is very small. The authors should sort for CD45+ cells and perform single-cell RNA sequencing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this point.  For the revised manuscript, we have performed additional snRNAseq analyses using the same tissue processing protocol as for our original snRNAseq data.  We have opted to homogenize the tissue and prepare nuclei (our original method) rather than dissociate the tissue and FACS sorting for CD45+ cells because the nuclear isolation approach is unbiased – we assume that nuclei from all cell types are present after tissue homogenization.  By contrast, we cannot be certain that CD45 FACS will capture the full range of immune cells since some cells may not express CD45, may express CD45 at low level, or may be tightly adherent to other cells, such as vascular endothelial cell.  Additionally, by following the original protocol, we can combine the original snRNAseq dataset and the new snRNAseq dataset.  In the revised manuscript we present the snRNAseq data from the combination of the original and the more recent snRNAseq datasets (revised Figure 4; N=628 immune cell nuclei).  The new analysis comes to the same conclusions as the original analysis: the immune cell infiltrate in the mutant retinas is composed of a wide variety of immune cells.</p>

<p>(4) The analysis of BBB leakage phenotype in TgfbR1 KO mice needs to be more detailed and include tracers as well as serum IgG leakage.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described in our response to query 2, we have conducted additional experiments to look at vascular leakage in control, VE-cad-CreER;TGFBR1 CKO/-, and NdpKO retinas.  We have also looked at Sulfo-NHS-biotin leakage in the VE-cadCreER;TGFBR1 CKO/- brain, and it is indistinguishable from WT controls.  Since Sulfo-NHS-biotin is a low MW tracer (&lt;1,000 kDa), this implies that loss of TGF-beta signaling does not increase non-specific diffusion of either low or high MW molecules.  Therefore, the elevated levels of IgG in the brain parenchyma in young VE-cad-CreER;TGFBR1 CKO/- mice (Figure 8A) likely represents specific transport of IgG across the BBB.  Such transport is known to occur via Fc receptors expressed on vascular endothelial cells, although it is normally greater in the brain-to-blood direction than in the blood-to-brain direction.  For example, see Lafrance-Vanasse et al (2025) Leveraging neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) to enhance antibody transport across the blood brain barrier.  Nat Commun. 16:4143.  This is now described in greater detail in the Results section.</p>

<p>(5) A previous study (Zarkada et al., 2021, Developmental Cell) showed that EC-deletion of Alk5 affects the D tip cells. The phenotypes of those mice look very similar to those shown for TgfbrR1 KO mice. Are D-tip cells lost in these mutants by snRNAseq?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please note: Alk5 is another name for TGFBR1.  This is noted in the second sentence of paragraph 4 of the Introduction.  The reviewer is correct: there are a lot of similarities because these are exactly the same KO mice.  Also, Zarkada and we used the same VEcadCreER to recombine the CKO allele.  The proposed snRNAseq analysis would serve as an independent check on the diving (D) tip vs stalk cell analyses published in Zarkada et al (2021) Specialized endothelial tip cells guide neuroretina vascularization and blood-retina-barrier formation. Dev Cell 56:2237-2251.  We have not gone in this direction because the question of tip vs. stalk cells and of subtypes of tip cells in WT vs. mutant retinas is beyond our focus on choroidal neovascularization and the role of immune cells and vascular inflammation.  The proposed snRNAseq analysis would also require a major effort since tip cells are rare and must be harvested from large numbers of early postnatal retinas followed by FACS enrichment for vascular endothelial cells.  Finally, we have no reason to doubt the results of Zarkada et al.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors meticulously characterized EC-specific Tgfbr1, Tgfbr2, or double knockout in the retina, demonstrating through convincing immunostaining data that loss of TGF-β signaling disrupts retinal angiogenesis and choroidal neovascularization. Compared to other genetic models (Fzd4 KO, Ndp KO, VEGF KO), the Tgfbr1/2 KO retina exhibits the most severe immune cell infiltration. The authors proposed that TGF-β signaling loss triggers vascular inflammation, attracting immune cells - a phenotype specific to CNS vasculature, as non-CNS organs remain unaffected.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The immunostaining results presented are clear and robust. The authors performed well-controlled analyses against relevant mouse models. snRNA-seq corroborates immune cell leakage in the retina and vascular inflammation in the brain.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The causal link between TGF-β loss, vascular inflammation, and immune infiltration remains unresolved. The authors' model posits that EC-specific TGF-β loss directly causes inflammation, which recruits immune cells. However, an alternative explanation is plausible: Tgfbr1/2 KO-induced developmental defects (e.g., leaky vessels) permit immune extravasation, subsequently triggering inflammation. The observations that vein-specific upregulation of ICAM1 staining and the lack of immune infiltration phenotypes in the non-CNS tissues support the alternative model. Late-stage induction of Tgfbr1/2 KO (avoiding developmental confounders) could clarify TGF-β's role in retinal angiogenesis versus anti-inflammation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this point.  Your comment prompted us to look at this question in greater depth with more experiments.  We have expanded Figure 2 to show and quantify a comparison between control (i.e. phenotypically WT), NdpKO, and TGFBR1 endothelial KO and we have expanded the associated part of the Results section (Figure 2C and D).  In a nutshell, control retinas show little Sulfo-NHS-biotin accumulation in or around the vasculature or in the parenchyma; NdpKO retinas show Sulfo-NHS-biotin accumulation in the vasculature and in the parenchyma (i.e., the area between the vessels); and VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1CKO/- retinas show Sulfo-NHS-biotin accumulation in the vascular tufts with minimal accumulation in the non-tuft vasculature and minimal leakage into the parenchyma.   The conclusion is that the bulk of the retinal vasculature in TGFBR1 endothelial KO mice is minimally or not at all leaky – very different from the situation with loss of Norrin/Frizzled4 signaling.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we have expanded the Discussion section to address the two alternative hypotheses raised by the reviewer.  Here are the relevant data in a nutshell: (1) vascular leakage into the parenchyma, as measured with sulfo-NHSbiotin, in TGFBR1 endothelial CKO retinas is far less than in NdpKO retinas, where nearly all ECs convert to a fenestration+ (PLVAP+) phenotype and there is leakage of sulfo-NHS-biotin, (2) ICAM1 in ECs in TGFBR1 endothelial CKO retinas increases several-fold more than in NdpKO or Frizzled4KO retinas, (3) TGFBR1 endothelial CKO retinas have more infiltrating immune cells than NdpKO or Frizzled4KO retinas, and (4) in TGFBR1 endothelial CKO retinas large numbers of immune cells are observed within and adjacent to blood vessels.  We think that the simplest explanation for these data is that loss of TGFbeta signaling in ECs causes an endothelial inflammatory state with enhanced immune cell extravasation.  That said, the case for this model is not water-tight, and there could be less direct mechanisms at play.  In particular, this model does not explain why the inflammatory phenotype is limited to CNS (and especially retinal) vasculature.</p>
<p>Regarding the last sentence of the reviewer’s comment (“Late stage induction…”), we have tried activating CreER recombination at different ages and we observe a large reduction in the inflammatory phenotype when recombination is initiated after vascular development is complete.   This observation suggests that the vascular developmental/anatomic defect – and perhaps the resulting retinal hypoxia response – is required for the inflammatory phenotype.  In the revised manuscript we have expanded the Results and Discussion sections to describe this observation.</p>

<p>Thank you for raising this point.  The quantification in the original version of Figure 1- Figure supplement 1 panel C was mis-labeled.  It quantifies choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in both VE-cad-CreER;TGFBR1 CKO/- and VE-cadCreER;TGFBR2 CKO/- retinas, not VE-cad-CreER;TGFBR1 CKO/- retinas only as originally labeled.  The point it makes is that CNV is seen with loss of TGF-beta signaling but not in control retinas or retinas with loss of Norrin signaling.

<p>Thank you for raising this point.  There is no detectable Sulfo-NHS-biotin leakage into the brain parenchyma in VE-cadCreER;TGFBR1 CKO/- mice.  We have expanded Figure 2 to show and quantify the data for retinal vascular leakage (Figure 2C and D).  The data show that in VE-cad-CreER;TGFBR1 CKO/- mice there is accumulation of Sulfo-NHS-biotin in the vascular tufts but minimal accumulation elsewhere in the retinal vasculature and minimal leakage of Sulfo-NHS-biotin into the retinal parenchyma.</p>

<p>Suggestions for improving the manuscript:</p>
<p>(6) The statement that ECs acquire properties of immune cells (Page 2, Line 90) is incorrect. Endothelial cells may acquire characteristics of antigen presenting cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for that correction.  Based on the review from Amersfoort et al (2022) (Amersfoort J, Eelen G, Carmeliet P. (2022) Immunomodulation by endothelial cells - partnering up with the immune system? Nat Rev Immunol 22:576-588) and the articles cited in it, we have changed the sentence to “Although vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are not generally considered to be part of the immune system, in some locations and under some conditions they acquire properties characteristic of immune cells, including secretion of cytokines, surface display of co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory receptors, and antigen presentation in association with MHC class II proteins (Pober and Sessa, 2014; Amersfoort et al., 2022).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The statement in Page 3, Line 100-101 [In CNS ECs, quiescence is maintained in part by the actions of astrocyte-derived Sonic Hedgehog, with the result that few immune cells other than resident microglia are found within the CNS (Alvarez et al., 2011).] is incomplete. Wnt signaling also suppresses the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules from endothelial cells and therefore helps with immune cell quiescence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising that point.  We have expanded that sentence to include Wnt signaling in CNS endothelial cells, as described in the following reference: Lengfeld JE, Lutz SE, Smith JR, Diaconu C, Scott C, Kofman SB, Choi C, Walsh CM, Raine CS, Agalliu I, Agalliu D. (2017) Endothelial Wnt/beta-catenin signaling reduces immune cell infiltration in multiple sclerosis. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 114:E1168-E1177.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) It may be beneficial for the reader to separate the results of the vascular phenotypes related to choroidal neovascularization compared to retinal vascular development.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion.  The two topics are partly overlapping: choroidal neovascularization is described in Figure 1, and retinal development is described in Figures 1 and 2.  The challenge is that some of same images illustrate both phenotypes as in Figure 1, so the topics cannot be easily separated.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) In addition to comparing the phenotypes in Tgfb signaling mutant mice with Wnt signaling and VEGF-A signaling mutants, the authors should compare and contrast their data with those found in Alk5 KO mice, as there are a lot of similarities.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer has alerted us to a nomenclature challenge which we will try to resolve in the introduction: Alk5 is just another name for TGFBR1.  The reviewer is correct: there are a lot of similarities between the present study and that of Zarkada et al (2021) because both use the same TGFBR1(=Alk5) CKO mice.</p>

<p>Figure 2</p>
<p>For 2B, the authors should clarify whether the two regions shown in the Tgfbr1 KO retina (P14) represent central vs. peripheral areas, as phenotype severity varies.</p>
<p>For 2C, does the uneven biotin accumulation reflect developmental gradients (e.g., central-peripheral maturation timing)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising these points.  Regarding Figure 2B, these images are all from the mid-peripheral retina, where the phenotype is moderately severe.  This is now noted in the figure legend.</p>
<p>Regarding Figure 2C, the reviewer is correct that the pattern of Sulfo-NHS-biotin is uneven in VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1CKO/- retinas – it accumulates only in the tufts.  We have expanded Figure 2C to show a comparison between control (i.e.</p>
<p>phenotypically WT), NdpKO, and TGFBR1 endothelial KO retinas, and we have expanded the associated part of the Results section.  In a nutshell, control retinas show little Sulfo-NHS-biotin accumulation in the vasculature or in the parenchyma; NdpKO retinas show Sulfo-NHS-biotin accumulation in the vasculature and in the parenchyma (i.e., the area between the vessels); and VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1CKO/- retinas show Sulfo-NHS-biotin accumulation in the vascular tufts with minimal accumulation in the non-tuft vasculature and minimal leakage into the parenchyma.   The conclusion is that the bulk of the retinal vasculature in TGFBR1 endothelial KO mice is not leaky – very different from the situation with loss of Norrin/Frizzled4 signaling.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 6</p>
<p>The claim that PECAM1+ rings on veins reflect EC-immune cell binding is uncertain, as PECAM1 is also known to be expressed by immune cells. The complete correlation of PECAM1 and CD45 staining signals suggests that a subset of immune cells upregulates PECAM1. The VEcadCreER;Tgfbr1 flox/-; SUN1:GFP reporter would be helpful to delineate ECimmune cell proximity. Super-resolution imaging with Z-stacks could also resolve spatial relationships (luminal vs. abluminal immune cell adhesion).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment.  The reviewer is correct that, at the resolution of these images, we cannot determine whether the PECAM1 immunostaining signal is derived from ECs, from leukocytes, or from both.  This is now stated in the Results section.  The PECAM1-rich endothelial ring structure associated with leukocyte extravasation has been characterized in various publications, for example in (1) Carman CV, Springer TA. (2004) A transmigratory cup in leukocyte diapedesis both through individual vascular endothelial cells and between them. J Cell Biol 167:377-388 and (2) Mamdouh Z, Mikhailov A, Muller WA. (2009) Transcellular migration of leukocytes is mediated by the endothelial lateral border recycling compartment. J Exp Med 206:2795-2808.  The ring structures visualized in Figure 6D by PECAM1 immunostaining conform to the ring structures described in these and other papers.  In showing these structures, our point is simply that they likely represent sites of leukocyte extravasation.  This is now clarified in the text.  We have also added some additional references on leukocyte extravasation and the ring structures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 7</p>
<p>A time-course analysis of ICAM1 would strengthen the mechanistic model. Does ICAM1 upregulation precede immune infiltration (supporting inflammation as the primary defect)? Given that immune cells appear by P14 (per snRNA-seq), is ICAM1 elevated earlier?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting idea, but based on what is known about leukocyte adhesion and extravasation we predict that there will not be a clean temporal separation between ICAM1 induction and leukocyte adhesion/infiltration.  That is, if the proinflammatory state causes an increase in the number of leukocytes, then as ICAM1 levels increase, leukocyte adhesion would also increase.  Similarly, if the presence of leukocytes increases the pro-inflammatory state, then as the number of leukocytes increases, the levels of ICAM1 would be predicted to increase.  Thus, we think that a time course analysis is unlikely to provide a definitive conclusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 8-SF1</p>
<p>In brain slices, a transient pan-IgG accumulation suggests a self-resolving defect in the BBB. However, this BBB impairment appears to be spatiotemporally distinct from ICAM1 upregulation. ICAM1 staining is restricted to the lesion site, aligning with immune cell-driven inflammation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising these points.  The reviewer is correct that these observations don’t fit together in a clear way.  There does not appear to be a general increase in brain vascular permeability in VE-cad-CreER;TGFBR1 CKO/- mice, as shown by sulfo-NHS-biotin.  However, there is a large and transient increase in IgG in the brain parenchyma, suggestive of a general vascular alteration, and – as the reviewer correctly notes – it is not accompanied by a generalized increase in ICAM1 vascular immunostaining.  At this point, we don’t have any real insight into the mechanistic basis of the transient IgG increase.</p>
