<abstract><p>Stress promotes phenotypic changes in bacteria that allow them to survive antibiotic treatment. This phenomenon, termed antibiotic tolerance, can cause treatment failure, highlighting a need to define bacterial pathways that promote survival. Previously, we found <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> downregulates <italic>tusB</italic>, a gene involved in modifying tRNAs with s<sup>2</sup>U, in response to doxycycline. Here we find that deletion of <italic>tusB</italic> results in loss of s<sup>2</sup>U and induces antibiotic tolerance. Using a combination of sequencing-based approaches and analysis of gene codon usage, our data show that loss of s<sup>2</sup>U decreases translation of ribosomal proteins. Ribosomal proteins are highly enriched in codons that require s<sup>2</sup>U-modified tRNAs for efficient translation, and loss of s<sup>2</sup>U results in ribosome pausing at these codons. Our results highlight a previously unknown mechanism of antibiotic tolerance where reduction in ribosomal protein abundance can globally reduce translation, and describes a novel strategy bacteria use to slow growth by modulating s<sup>2</sup>U levels.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Antibiotic treatment failure is a concerning and multifaceted problem. Major focus has been on antibiotic resistance, which occurs when bacteria acquire a genetic mutation or a genetic element that allows bacteria to grow in the presence of antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. However, bacteria can also develop phenotypic changes in response to stress that allows them to survive antibiotic treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. This phenomenon is known as antibiotic tolerance when the entire bacterial population responds this way, or antibiotic persistence when only a subpopulation is recalcitrant to antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. These phenotypic changes are transient and typically induce a slowed growth response that renders antibiotics less effective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Once the stress is removed, bacteria resume growth, which is a major concern for relapsing infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Growing evidence also suggests that antibiotic tolerance and persistence contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. We currently lack strategies to target antibiotic tolerant bacteria, making it important to understand what pathways promote bacterial survival, so we can leverage this information to improve antibiotic efficacy.</p>
<p><italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> (Yptb) is a Gram-negative bacterium in the class of Gammaproteobacteria that is a natural pathogen of humans and rodents. Yptb has been used as a model to study multiple aspects of pathogenesis of enteric pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and recently has been studied in a mouse model of antibiotic persistence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In a previous study we investigated the phenotypic response of Yptb to doxycycline treatment and found expression of the gene <italic>tusB</italic> was significantly downregulated in response to doxycycline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. TusB (2-thio<underline>u</underline>ridine <underline>s</underline>ubunit <underline>B</underline>) is involved in a sulfur relay system that transfers a sulfur group onto the wobble position of tRNAs encoding for glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), and lysine (Lys)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. TusB complexes with itself and other Tus proteins (TusC and TusD homodimers) forming a heterohexamer that mediates the transfer of sulfur from TusA to TusE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. TusE then transfers sulfur to MnmA, which catalyzes the final 2-thiolation reaction, adding the sulfur group onto the second carbon of the uridine (U34) in the tRNA anticodon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. This modification restricts binding of the tRNA to purines (A and G), rather than pyrimidines (C or U), thereby increasing translation fidelity and efficiency.</p>
<p>Translation efficiency is generally defined as the rate of protein production per mRNA molecule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Initiation is primarily thought to be the rate limiting step of translation, but elongation can be a limiting step as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. During elongation, the speed at which proteins are translated is impacted by the available pool of tRNAs and competition between cognate and non-cognate tRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. tRNA modifications that stabilize the interaction between the anticodon and its cognate codon increase translation efficiency by promoting more rapid decoding. tRNA modifications can thus impact protein translation depending on which codons are decoded by the modified tRNA, and how enriched those codons are in a given transcript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In yeast, absence of s<sup>2</sup>U has been shown to impact the metabolic state of cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and led to proteotoxic stress due to improper protein folding during translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, but has been postulated to not have a major impact on translation efficiency, as measured by correlating transcriptional changes with ribosome footprint changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In contrast, loss of s<sup>2</sup>U seems to impact translation in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, by biasing the translation of certain proteins depending on their enrichment of lysine codons, impacting artemisinin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, it has been shown that s<sup>2</sup>U mutants have delayed expression of specific proteins, RpoS, Fis, and FtsZ, and impaired cell division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. However, it is not known whether s<sup>2</sup>U has a global impact on translation or if this tRNA modification impacts antibiotic susceptibility in bacteria.</p>
<p>Here, we find that deletion of <italic>tusB</italic> and loss of the s<sup>2</sup>U modification renders <italic>Yersinia</italic> tolerant to multiple ribosome-targeting antibiotics, and the RNA polymerase-targeting antibiotic, rifampicin. We hypothesized that loss of the modification slows translation at Glu, Gln, and Lys codons. In line with this, we find that ribosomes pause more frequently at the specific codons that rely on the tRNA modification for proper decoding. We find that ribosomal proteins themselves are highly enriched in these codons and downregulated at the protein level, but not the transcript level, indicating they may be translated less efficiently in the absence of s<sup>2</sup>U. Our results support the model that a reduction in ribosomal proteins is globally reducing translation and is responsible for slowing bacterial growth and inducing antibiotic tolerance.</p>

<title>Deletion of <italic>tusB</italic> results in a complete loss of mnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U and induces changes in other modifications</title>
<p>To understand what impact <italic>tusB</italic> expression has on antibiotic susceptibility, we created a <italic>tusB</italic> deletion strain (Δ<italic>tusB</italic>). First, to confirm that deletion of <italic>tusB</italic> results in loss of the s<sup>2</sup>U modification, we performed chromatography-coupled tandem quadrupole mass spectrometric (LC-MS) analysis to detect relative tRNA modification levels in Δ<italic>tusB</italic> compared to our wild-type (WT) strain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We also compared relative tRNA modification levels in WT +/- doxycycline (dox) treatment to see if downregulation of <italic>tusB</italic> would be sufficient to lower tRNA modification levels. We chose to look at tRNA modification levels in the early log phase of growth to match our RNA-seq timepoint where we saw downregulation of <italic>tusB</italic> under WT+dox conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Additionally, early to mid-log phase is when the s<sup>2</sup>U modification should be highest in WT cells, prior to nutrient (particularly sulfur) limitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Log phase bacterial cultures were grown for 2h at 37°C (untreated or treated with 1µg/mL of doxycycline). Small RNA was purified and digested into nucleosides. Changes in relative quantities of modified nucleosides were measured by LC-MS/MS.

</fig>
<p>Hierarchal clustering analysis shows that the <italic>tusB</italic> deletion strain clusters together regardless of doxycycline treatment and WT + dox samples also cluster together (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Importantly, as expected, we found a complete loss of s<sup>2</sup>U in Δ<italic>tusB</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, blue box</xref>). We saw minimal downregulation of mnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U (average 0.9-fold change WT dox vs. WT untreated) and cmnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U (average 0.87-fold change WT dox vs. WT untreated) in response to doxycycline.</p>
<p>Interestingly we detected other changes in relative tRNA modification levels in Δ<italic>tusB</italic> compared to WT, and in response to doxycycline treatment. The sulfur modifications, s<sup>2</sup>C and ms<sup>2</sup>i6A, were downregulated in response to doxycycline (both in WT and Δ<italic>tusB</italic>) and somewhat in response to <italic>tusB</italic> deletion alone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), which could indicate low sulfur availability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Additionally, we also detected upregulation of many modifications commonly found on ribosomal RNA (m<sup>5</sup>C, m<sup>1</sup>A, m<sup>3</sup>U, m<sup>2</sup>G, and m<sup>66</sup>A). Our RNA isolation enriches for tRNA based on size and can include smaller ribosomal RNA fragments if these are abundant.</p>

<title>Loss of 2-thiolation tRNA modification induces tolerance to specific ribosome and RNA-polymerase targeting antibiotics</title>
<p>We tested the growth and antibiotic susceptibility of Δ<italic>tusB</italic> and found that it was significantly slower growing and more tolerant to multiple antibiotics including the ribosome-targeting antibiotics, doxycycline and gentamicin, and the RNA polymerase-targeting antibiotic, rifampicin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). We detected a slight decrease in antibiotic susceptibility to chloramphenicol, although this was not statistically significant. These phenotypes were rescued by integrating the <italic>tusB</italic> gene back into the genome (<italic>tusB</italic> rescue, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Additionally, to confirm that phenotypes were specific to loss of the tRNA s<sup>2</sup>U modification, we complemented the deletion strain with the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> pathway for 2-thiolation. <italic>B. subtilis</italic> possess an abbreviated version of the sulfur relay system where the cysteine desulfurase, YrvO, transfers sulfur groups directly to MnmA, which catalyzes the final 2-thiolation reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. As expected, expression of <italic>yrvO-mnmA</italic> restored growth and antibiotic susceptibility of Δ<italic>tusB</italic>, although this was not statistically significant for doxycycline (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Chloramphenicol susceptibility was similar to Δ<italic>tusB</italic> when <italic>yrvO-mnmA</italic> was expressed, indicating that loss of the modification does not greatly impact chloramphenicol susceptibility. Importantly, phenotypes were only complemented when a functional copy of <italic>yrvO</italic> was expressed and not when the active cysteine residue (C325A) of YrvO was mutated or with an empty vector control (<xref rid="fige2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 2</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Log phase bacterial cultures were grown at 37C and sampled every 2h to enumerate CFUs (colony forming units). Complemented strains carry a plasmid (pDS145)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> with the <italic>yrvO-mnmA</italic> open reading frames under the control of the P<sub>ara</sub> promoter, and were treated with 0.2% arabinose throughout the experiment to induce expression of the construct. Cultures were treated with either 1µg/mL doxycycline, 25µg/mL chloramphenicol, 2µg/mL gentamicin, 2µg/mL rifampicin, 0.1µg/mL ciprofloxacin, or left untreated. Fold change in CFUs are shown by normalizing each timepoint to the 0h timepoint. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons.

</fig>
<p>Overall, these results indicate that loss of the s<sup>2</sup>U tRNA modification induces tolerance to the ribosome and RNA-polymerase targeting antibiotics that were tested. Interestingly, we observed no difference in susceptibility of Δ<italic>tusB</italic> to the DNA-gyrase targeting antibiotic, ciprofloxacin, (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) indicating that this tolerance phenotype may be specific to antibiotics that target translation and transcription. Since transcription and translation are generally coupled in bacteria, we hypothesized that this might indicate translation is impacted by loss of s<sup>2</sup>U.</p>

<title><bold>Δ</bold><italic>tusB</italic> has a starvation-like metabolic signature and decreased levels of ribosomal proteins</title>
<p>To further understand the impact of loss of s<sup>2</sup>U, we performed RNA-seq and mass spectrometry to define the transcriptome and proteome, respectively, of Δ<italic>tusB</italic> compared to WT. 259 genes were significantly downregulated, and 182 genes were significantly upregulated at the transcript level (p<sub>adj</sub> &lt; 0.05 and &gt;2-fold change). At the protein level, 166 genes were significantly downregulated, and 197 genes were significantly upregulated (p-value &lt; 0.05 and &gt;2-fold change in protein abundance).</p>
<p>KEGG Pathway Enrichment analysis of differentially regulated genes from our RNA-seq dataset shows that Δ<italic>tusB</italic> upregulates multiple amino acid biosynthesis pathways (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Many of these are also upregulated at the protein level in our mass spectrometry dataset (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We hypothesized this could indicate the stringent response is being induced by loss of the tRNA modification. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown the s<sup>2</sup>U modification improves tRNA synthetase binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> making it plausible that loss of the modification could result in uncharged tRNAs binding to the ribosome, inducing the stringent response. However, deleting the alarmone synthetase, <italic>relA</italic>, in the <italic>tusB</italic> deletion background did not rescue the slowed growth or antibiotic tolerance phenotype (<xref rid="fige3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 3</xref>), indicating the Δ<italic>tusB</italic> phenotype is not linked to the stringent response.</p>

<p>RNA-seq and proteomic analyses generally revealed that Δ<italic>tusB</italic> has a starvation-like metabolic signature. Δ<italic>tusB</italic> significantly downregulated oxidative phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref>) as indicated by downregulation of several genes in the TCA cycle and multiple subunits of the electron transport chain. This type of metabolic shift is often associated with antibiotic tolerance and persistence and is consistent with the slowed growth phenotype of Δ<italic>tusB</italic>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, our proteomic analysis revealed that 37 of the 54 ribosomal protein subunits were significantly downregulated in Δ<italic>tusB</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Most of these ribosomal subunits did not show up as hits in our RNA-seq dataset and the few that did (p&lt;0.05) were not strongly downregulated or upregulated at the transcript level (less than 2-fold change) (<xref rid="tble1" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 1</xref>). This also indicates that the stringent response is likely not be responsible for the expression changes in Δ<italic>tusB</italic>, since the ppGpp alarmone has been shown to repress transcription of ribosomal protein genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that this difference between our RNA-seq and proteomics datasets could indicate that the ability to translate these proteins is impaired in Δ<italic>tusB</italic>.</p>

<p>To understand what impact <italic>tusB</italic> deletion has on translation, we performed ribosome profiling to determine if loss of the s<sup>2</sup>U tRNA modification impacts ribosome speed. We adopted a ribosome profiling approach developed by Mohammad et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, allowing us to identify ribosome abundance and positioning at single codon resolution. Ribosome pause scores are calculated by taking the average ribosome density at a single codon normalized to the average ribosome density across a given gene and averaging this for all genes in the genome. As expected, the relative ribosome codon occupancy (Δ<italic>tusB</italic> pause score normalized to WT) was moderately increased at Glu, (GAG and GAA), Gln, (CAA), and Lys (AAA and AAG), indicating that ribosomes paused more frequently at these codons in Δ<italic>tusB</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). No change in ribosome pausing at CAG was expected since Yptb have one Gln tRNA that is not modified with s<sup>2</sup>U (tRNA<sup>CUG</sup>) that is likely sufficient for decoding CAG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. In contrast, Yptb seem to more heavily rely on modified tRNAs for decoding Lys (4 tRNA<sup>UUU</sup> and only one tRNA<sup>CUU</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> and Glu (5 tRNA<sup>UUC</sup> and no tRNA<sup>CUC</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, which explains why we see ribosome pausing at both isoacceptor codons for Lys and Glu.</p>

<p>In addition to indicating slower translation, ribosome pausing can also be a sign that proteins are being mistranslated and/or not properly folded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Since s<sup>2</sup>U is important for stabilizing the interaction between the tRNA anticodon and its cognate codon, we briefly investigated if the absence of s<sup>2</sup>U impacts translation fidelity, with the idea that loss of s<sup>2</sup>U would increase the chances that a near cognate tRNA could bind and incorporate the wrong amino acid. We detected potential misincorporation of amino acids in a preliminary LC-MS/MS run, considering the following changes as modifications in peptides: glutamate to aspartate, glutamine to histidine, and lysine to asparagine. To understand if these misincorporations occur more frequently due to loss of s<sup>2</sup>U, we measured the relative abundance of modified to unmodified peptides in Δ<italic>tusB</italic> vs. WT (<xref rid="fige4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplemental Data 8</xref>). Interestingly we detected on average higher frequency of misincorporation at Glutamine CAA versus Glutamine CAG codons in Δ<italic>tusB</italic> compared to WT (<xref rid="fige4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 4B</xref>), consistent with our finding that ribosomes pause at CAA and not CAG (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). However, with a small sample size we cannot conclusively say whether misincorporation of amino acids is more frequent due to loss of s<sup>2</sup>U. Additionally, it does not seem that proteins are being widely mistranslated in Δ<italic>tusB</italic>, given that we saw no indication of proteotoxic stress in our differential expression analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, our results indicate that absence of s<sup>2</sup>U impacts ribosome speed. The ribosome pausing we detected at Glu, Gln, and Lys codons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) is comparable to what has been reported in yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, although we detected relatively higher pause scores at Gln CAA and Lys AAG codons. These values are considered a moderate increase in ribosome occupancy, indicating that the ribosome is transiently pausing at these sites rather than stalling. Although transient pausing at one site may not have a great impact on protein output, we hypothesized that if transcripts were highly enriched in these codons, this would significantly slow down the ribosome and decrease translation of a given transcript.</p>

<title>Switching Gln codons from CAA to CAG slightly improves translation of GFP</title>
<p>To test whether enrichment of codons with ribosome pausing is sufficient to slow translation and impact protein output, we created a codon-optimized GFP reporter construct where all CAA codons (6/8 total Gln codons) are switched to CAG (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We focused on Gln codons since we saw a clear increase in ribosome pausing at CAA, but not CAG (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). As expected, Δ<italic>tusB</italic> grew slower than WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). However, Δ<italic>tusB</italic> growth was slightly improved when expressing the CAG construct (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), consistent with others have reports that bacterial growth is impaired by expressing <italic>gfp</italic> with codons that slow the ribosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Oddly, we saw lower GFP fluorescence from the CAG construct in the WT strain compared to native GFP, which was unexpected since CAA and CAG are used equally in protein coding sequences in Yptb and thus switching these codons was not predicted to bias translation in the WT strain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). However, GFP fluorescence from the CAG construct was not lower than native GFP in Δ<italic>tusB</italic>, instead it was slightly higher (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). As a proxy for GFP translation, we quantified GFP fluorescence relative to <italic>gfp</italic> transcript levels at 4h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Importantly we can see GFP fluorescence per relative <italic>gfp</italic> transcript level is trending lower in Δ<italic>tusB</italic> vs. WT (p-value = 0.0552) for native GFP, suggesting GFP translation is lower in Δ<italic>tusB</italic>. GFP fluorescence per relative <italic>gfp</italic> transcript level was slightly improved in Δ<italic>tusB</italic> with the CAG construct, suggesting that replacing CAA codons with CAG slightly improves GFP translation, although this was not statistically significant.</p>

<p>Overall, these results indicate that translation is lower when s<sup>2</sup>U is absent and is partially improved by replacing CAA codons with CAG. We expect that GFP translation was not significantly improved by switching only Glutamine codons since the other codons, Glutamate and Lysine, likely also contribute to the lower translation of GFP in Δ<italic>tusB</italic></p>
<p>Since GFP protein levels can also be impacted by protein decay and degradation, we measured GFP decay using a ssrA tag to target the GFP protein to the ClpXP proteosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Unstable GFP (<italic>gfp-ssrA</italic>) had a half-life of 57 minutes in WT. In contrast, unstable GFP (<italic>gfp-ssrA</italic>) had a half-life of 187 minutes in Δ<italic>tusB</italic>, indicating that protein degradation is impaired (<xref rid="fige5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 5</xref>). Additionally, stable GFP also had a longer half-life in Δ<italic>tusB</italic> (277 minutes) compared to WT (165 minutes) (<xref rid="fige5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 5</xref>). These findings may be explained by our RNA-seq and proteomic analysis which indicates that Δ<italic>tusB</italic> downregulates the ClpXP proteosome (<italic>clpX</italic> is downregulated 1.79-fold by RNA-seq (padj =1x10^8) and 3-fold in protein abundance (p = 0.0292); <italic>clpP</italic> is downregulated 1.69-fold by RNA-seq (padj = 1.49x10^8) and 3.77-fold in protein abundance (p=0.00508), see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplemental Data 9</xref>). It is unclear why Δ<italic>tusB</italic> downregulates the ClpXP proteasome, but this suggests that Δ<italic>tusB</italic> is impaired in protein degradation, allowing us to conclude that the lower GFP fluorescence of Δ<italic>tusB</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, D</xref>) is not due to increased degradation of GFP proteins.</p>

<title>Lys AAG codon enrichment is highly associated with subset of downregulated ribosomal proteins</title>
<p>To look globally at the impact of loss of the s<sup>2</sup>U tRNA modification on biasing translation, we analyzed codon usage for all protein-coding genes in the <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> IP2666 genome, with the idea that enrichment of Glu, Gln, and Lys codons would be highly associated with downregulated proteins if these codons were biasing translation. Codon Z-scores, detailing relative codon over- or under-use in a gene (relative to genome averages), were calculated for each codon in each gene by subtracting the average global codon frequency from the gene codon frequency and normalizing to the standard deviation of that codon’s usage throughout the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. As a result, codon Z-scores represent how many standard deviations above or below the global frequency a specific codon is used in a given gene. We performed principal component (PC) analysis using the codon Z-scores for all genes that were differentially regulated at the protein level (2-fold change in protein abundance, Δ<italic>tusB</italic> vs. WT, p-value &lt; 0.05). PC scores are calculated for each gene based on their codon usage and plotted in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, revealing a cluster of downregulated proteins along PC1. We performed principal component regression analysis using the log2fold change in protein abundance (Δ<italic>tusB</italic> vs. WT) as the dependent variable and found several codons that significantly contribute to the variance in protein expression. Codons of interest, Glu GAA (p-value=0.0345), Lys AAG (p-value &lt;0.0001) and Lys AAA (although not significant, p-value = 0.1757) corresponded with the cluster of downregulated proteins along PC1 in the lower right quadrant of the loadings plot (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B, C</xref>). The codon Z-scores are particularly high for Lys AAG amongst the downregulated proteins in this subset. Interestingly 18 of the 21 downregulated proteins are ribosomal proteins, indicating that enrichment of Lys AAG codons may explain why these proteins are less abundant even though none were significantly downregulated at the transcript level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Although we were also expecting Gln CAA codons to bias translation of proteins, principal component regression analysis indicated they did not significantly contribute to the variance.</p>

<title>A combination of Glu, Gln and Lys enrichment likely contributes to decreased ribosomal protein levels</title>
<p>Finally, we also looked at the combined impact of all five codons that increased ribosome pausing, with the idea that enrichment of a combination of Glu, Gln (CAA) and Lys codons would have more impact than enrichment of a single codon, and that codons with higher ribosome pause scores would have a greater impact on the translation of a given protein. We took the sum of the codon Z-scores for Glu (GAA), Glu (GAG), Gln (CAA), Lys (AAA), and Lys (AAG) for each gene and weighted (multiplied) each codon Z-score by the average ribosome pause score for that respective codon. We refer to this calculation as the “cumulative pause predictor score”, with the idea that a higher score will predict a gene will be translated less efficiently due to increased ribosome pausing along the transcript. Consistent with this idea, we saw significantly increased cumulative pause predictor scores among proteins that were downregulated in Δ<italic>tusB</italic> compared to upregulated proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Ribosomal proteins in particular had significantly higher cumulative pause predictor scores than all other downregulated proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that not only enrichment of Lys AAG, but likely enrichment of a combination of all five of these codons is slowing down the translation of ribosomal proteins when s<sup>2</sup>U is absent. Importantly, we do not see this same trend in five other codons selected as a control that did not have changes in ribosome pausing (<xref rid="fige6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 6</xref>). Additionally, for the 54 ribosomal proteins, we see that higher cumulative pause predictor scores correlate with decreased protein abundance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, these results suggest that translation of ribosomal proteins is significantly reduced when s<sup>2</sup>U is lost due to an enrichment of codons that slow down the ribosome.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This work provides evidence for a novel mechanism by which loss of s<sup>2</sup>U induces antibiotic tolerance. It also adds to the growing evidence that modulation of tRNA modifications can widely impact expression of genes through codon biases in translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. In other reports, s<sup>2</sup>U has been assumed to not have a drastic impact on protein translation output when only a moderate increase in ribosome pausing is seen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, here we see ribosome pausing highly correlates with genes that are significantly downregulated at the protein level, but not at the transcript level.</p>
<p>Although pausing at one site alone is likely not sufficient to significantly slow down translation, our results suggest that enrichment of ribosome pausing sites can lead to reduced protein levels. Ribosomal proteins seem to be the most impacted by this codon bias in translation as indicated by their high enrichment in Glu, Gln, and Lys codons and the significant reduction in ribosomal protein levels. We expect that this reduction in ribosomal proteins is globally reducing the translational capacity of the cell and is responsible for inducing tolerance to ribosome and RNA polymerase-targeting antibiotics.</p>
<p>The s<sup>2</sup>U tRNA modification is well conserved among bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and ribosomal protein sequences are also generally conserved across bacterial species, including prominent ESKAPE pathogens that are highly resistant to antibiotics (<xref rid="fige7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that this could be an antibiotic tolerance mechanism used broadly by bacteria to better survive antibiotics, although this would depend on the codon usage and tRNA availability for each species.</p>
<p>Future work will be needed to understand what conditions in the host environment are sufficient to reduce s<sup>2</sup>U levels. In our study doxycycline treatment only moderately lowered s<sup>2</sup>U tRNA modification levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). However, given the broad downregulation of the 2-thiolation pathway in response to gentamicin (<xref rid="fige1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 1</xref>), we expect that gentamicin may have a stronger impact on modulating s<sup>2</sup>U levels and promoting survival.</p>
<p>Given that s<sup>2</sup>U levels are modulated in response to sulfur availability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, it is likely that conditions within the host environment, other than antibiotic stress, also result in lowered s<sup>2</sup>U levels within bacterial pathogens. This highlights that the mechanism we have defined here may be one used broadly by bacteria to adapt to conditions where it is beneficial to slow growth, such as low nutrient conditions. Fast growing cells need to have a high number of ribosomes since protein synthesis is limited by the availability of free ribosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, and ribosome abundance is linearly correlated with growth rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. However, during slow growth, it is beneficial for bacteria to slow ribosome protein synthesis since ribosome biogenesis and translation are energetically demanding processes. Therefore, it is interesting to speculate that the impact of s<sup>2</sup>U on ribosomal protein levels we see here could be a previously unknown mechanism by which bacteria reduce translation of ribosomal proteins in response to conditions where it is beneficial to slow growth and save energy.</p>
<p>Surprisingly we detected some changes in other tRNA modifications (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), some of which are modifications also found on ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Particularly under starvation conditions, ribosomal RNA is more highly degraded, which could explain why we detected increased levels of modifications commonly found on rRNA in Δ<italic>tusB</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. However, it is unlikely that rRNA degradation is responsible for lower ribosomal protein levels in Δ<italic>tusB</italic>. 16S rRNA levels were not different by qPCR in WT versus Δ<italic>tusB</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplemental Data 7</xref>). Additionally, given the reduced capability of Δ<italic>tusB</italic> to degrade GFP (<xref rid="fige5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 5</xref>), along with downregulation of the ClpXP protease, it is unlikely that ribosomal proteins are being readily degraded in Δ<italic>tusB</italic>. Instead, the level at which ribosomal proteins are downregulated correlates with the enrichment of codons that rely on s<sup>2</sup>U for proper decoding, indicating that these codons bias their translation in the absence of s<sup>2</sup>U.</p>
<p>It is important to note that we also saw metabolic changes in Δ<italic>tusB</italic> that could be contributing to the slowed growth and antibiotic tolerance phenotypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). However, if reduced metabolism were the main contributing factor, we would expect to broadly see antibiotic tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Instead, loss of s<sup>2</sup>U seems to induce tolerance to only antibiotics that target transcription and translation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), consistent with our model that loss of s<sup>2</sup>U is impacting the translational capacity of the cell. It is unclear what drives these metabolic changes in Δ<italic>tusB</italic>, but interestingly, others have noted similar metabolic changes in response to loss of s<sup>2</sup>U in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and have postulated that 2-thiolation acts as a signal to the cell that nutrients are low <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Loss of s<sup>2</sup>U thus results in a compensatory increase in synthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Additionally, carbon metabolism is altered and shifts away from oxidative phosphorylation and towards carbohydrate storage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, similar to what we see in our transcriptional and proteomic analysis of Δ<italic>tusB</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, here we identified a novel mechanism by which changes in s<sup>2</sup>U tRNA modification levels reduce translation of ribosomal proteins and induce slowed growth and antibiotic tolerance. Future work will be needed to identify conditions sufficient to lower tRNA modification levels, to further bolster the evidence that modulating s<sup>2</sup>U levels is a phenotypic response to stress that promotes bacterial survival.</p>

<title>qPCR to measure transcriptional regulation of s<sup>2</sup>U modification pathway in response to antibiotics</title>
<p>Cultures of bacteria were grown at 37°C for 2h and treated with the MIC of antibiotics (1µg/mL doxycycline, 25µg/mL chloramphenicol, or 15µg/mL gentamicin) or left untreated. Approximately 10^7 CFUs were pelleted and then resuspended in Buffer RLT (QIAGEN) + β-mercaptoethanol. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). DNA was removed using the on-column DNase digestion kit (QIAGEN). RNA was reverse transcribed using the Protoscript II First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (NEB). Approximately 30ng of cDNA was used as a template for qPCR using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Applied Biosystems). Relative transcript levels were measured using the DCT and 2<sup>-ΔCT</sup> method (using 16S transcript levels as an endogenous control).</p>

<title>Protein extraction</title>
<p>Briefly, overnight cultures (16h at 26°C with rotation) were diluted into 50mL fresh LB and then grown for 2 hours at 37C. Approximately 10^9 CFUs were pelleted and stored in -80C. Bacterial pellets were subsequently washed in PBS then resuspended in 4X cell pellet volume of Bacterial Protein Extraction Buffer (BPER, Thermo-Fisher). After incubation for 15 minutes at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 15,000xg for 5 mins at 4C. Supernatants (soluble fraction) and pellets (insoluble fraction) were saved at -80C. Pellets were subsequently processed to extract the insoluble fraction by washing with 1:10 diluted BPER and resuspending in 8x cell pellet volume of Inclusion Body Solubilization Reagent (Thermo-Fisher). Samples were vortexed for 1 minute and shaken on a platform shaker for 30 minutes at room temperature before being sonicated in an ice water bath for a total of 5 minutes (30 seconds on pulse, with 10 seconds off in between pulses). Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000xg for 15min at 4C and the supernatant was saved at -80°C.</p>

<title>LC-MS/MS to detect relative protein expression changes in <bold>Δ</bold><italic>tusB</italic> vs. WT</title>
<p>40µg of protein for each sample was processed for mass spectrometry using SP3 cleanup and on-bead trypsin/LysC digest to remove contaminants and digest samples into peptides. Peptides were subsequently labelled with tandem mass tags (TMT). Peptides were separated by HPLC (Thermo-Fisher Vanquish NEO UHPLC) using a self-packed fused silica column over a 90 minute gradient. Eluted peptides were sprayed into an Exploris 480 mass spectrometer. Survey scans (full ms) were acquired on an Orbi-trap within 375-1,500 m/z using a data dependent mode. The full scan MS was followed by MS/MS for the top 15 peptides in each cycle with dynamic exclusion of 45s. Precursor ions were individually isolated with 0.7 Da and fragmented (MS/MS) using an HCD activation collision energy of 36. Precursor and fragment ions were analyzed at a resolution of 120,000 and 30,000, respectively. Reporter ions at resolution of 45,000 (Turbo TMT). Raw mass spectral data files were searched using Proteome Discoverer (version 3.1, Thermo Scientific) and the GCF_003814345.1 Yersinia pseudotuberculosis IP2666pBI genome assembly. Search parameters were 10 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ions. Fixed modification was carbamidomethylation of cysteine, TMTpro on Nterm, TMTpro on lysine residues. Variable modification was oxidation on methionine residues (maximum of 3). A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% was used to validate high confidence PSMs. Normalized protein abundances were averaged across three biological replicates. Protein abundance ratios are calculated by normalizing the average protein abundance of Δ<italic>tusB</italic> to the average protein abundance of WT. Pairwise comparisons were done with One-way ANOVA using a p-value of 0.05 and 2-fold change in protein abundance as cut offs for significantly differentially regulated proteins.</p>

<title>Detection of misincorporation of amino acids in <bold>Δ</bold><italic>tusB</italic> vs. WT</title>
<p>A preliminary LC/MS-MS run was done on one biological replicate using the soluble and insoluble fractions from WT and Δ<italic>tusB</italic> samples, similar to above (with TMT labeling). Raw mass spectral data files were searched in Proteome Discoverer v3.1 (ThermoFisher Scientific) using 3 mutations as variable modifications: Glutamate (E) changed to Aspartate (D), Glutamine (Q) changed to Histidine (H), and Lysine (K) changed to Asparagine (N). Peptides were prioritized based on relative abundance in each sample and selected in order to have a good representation of all the codons we expected there to be changes at (CAA, GAA, GAG, AAA, no mutations were identified at AAG), and codons we expected to not see increased changes at in WT compared to Δ<italic>tusB</italic> (CAG). A subsequent LC/MS-MS run (without TMT labeling) was done to discover additional peptides with potential misincorporations before targeting these peptides by data-independent acquisition (DIA) to determine the relative abundance of modified and unmodified peptides in each sample. 10µg of protein for each sample was processed using SP3 buffer exchange and on-bead trypsin/LysC digest. Peptides were desalted on OASIS HLB uElution plates (Waters), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Peptides were separated by a 100-minute linear gradient. MS1 scans were acquired in the Orbitrap detector of the Exploris 480 mass spectrometer from 300-1250 m/z with the following settings: RF lens setting of 50%, 120,000 resolution at 200 m/z, normalized AGC of 101%, maximum injection time set to Auto, and Easy-IC internal lockmass calibration turned on. Precursor ions in each window were fragmented by HCD at 30% NCE. DIA product ion (MS2) scans were acquired in the Orbitrap detector using the following settings: 140−1800 m/z, 30,000 resolution at 200 m/z, normalized AGC of 1000%, and a maximum injection time of 54 ms.</p>
<p>Raw data files were searched with Chimerys against a customized <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> UniProt FASTA database (proteome accession UP000255087, 1263 entries), with the addition of sequences of the OmpA protein (UniProt accession P38399) containing E307D, Q309H, and Q273H substitutions. Search criteria were tryptic cleavage (maximum 2 missed), peptide length 7-30, peptide charge 2-6, 20 ppm fragment ion mass tolerance, Cys carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification, and Met oxidation as a variable modification (max 3/peptide). Peptide identifications were validated by Chimerys at 1% false discovery rate (FDR) based on an auto-concatenated decoy database search.</p>

<title>Ribosome profiling</title>
<p>Ribosome profiling was done as described in Mohamed et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Overnight cultures (16h, at 26°C with rotation) were diluted into 200mL LB and grown at 37°C for 5 hours before 100mL (Approximately 10^10 CFUs) was flash frozen by spraying into liquid nitrogen. Frozen droplets of bacterial culture were stored at -80°C before 50g of frozen droplets were lysed by cryo-mill. Lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 9,000xg at 4°C for 10mins and then ribosomes were pelleted over a sucrose cushion. Approximately 12.5 AU of sample was digested with MNase to remove RNA not protected by ribosomes and then 70S monosomes were isolated by fractionation over a 10%-50% sucrose gradient. RNA (or ribosome protected fragments) was isolated by phenol chloroform extraction and then samples were run on a 15% TBE Urea gel to selectively isolate fragments within the size range of 15-45nt, which has been previously shown to be the size range of fragments protected by bacterial ribosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. cDNA libraries were prepared, sequenced and reads were mapped to the IP2666 <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> GCF_003814345.1 genome assembly. All reads that mapped to ribosomal RNA, tRNA, and non-coding RNA were excluded. Ribosome occupancy was measured at the single codon level at the A site of the ribosome. Pause scores were calculated by taking the average ribosome density at a codon in a given gene and normalizing it to the average ribosome density across that gene for all genes in the genome.</p>

<title>Codon bias analysis</title>
<p>Codon usage was calculated for each gene in the <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> IP2666 genome by measuring the frequency of each codon used in each gene, otherwise known as gene codon frequency. To calculate codon Z-scores, the gene-specific codon frequency was normalized to the average global usage (all ORFs in genome) of that codon and the standard deviation of that codon. Codon Z-scores for all up and downregulated proteins (2-fold change in protein abundance and p-value &lt;0.05), were put into a data matrix and analyzed by principal component analysis. Principal component regression analysis was done using the log2fold change in protein abundance as the dependent variable. To analyze codon usage among genes that were regulated differently at the protein level versus the transcript level, we analyzed genes that were, 2-fold upregulated at the protein level and 1-fold or lower downregulated at the transcript level, and 2-fold downregulated at the protein level and 1-fold or higher upregulated at the transcript level. All graphing and analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism.</p>

<p>This <bold>fundamental</bold> work examines how tRNA modifications influence antibiotic tolerance, providing novel insights that may have therapeutic uses. The evidence supporting the conclusions is <bold>convincing</bold>. Strengths of the manuscript include the mechanism of tRNA modification influencing antibiotic tolerance and the precise measurement techniques used throughout. Further analysis of growth rate impacts and specific identification of the proteins responsible for the effect would further strengthen the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Cotton et al. investigated the role of tusB in antibiotic tolerance in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. They used the IP2226 strain and introduced appropriate mutations and complementation constructs. Assays were performed to measure growth rates, antibiotic tolerance, tRNA modification, gene expression and proteomic profiles. In addition, experiments to measure ribosome pausing and bioinformatic analysis of codon usage in ribosomal proteins provided in-depth mechanistic support for the conclusions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings are consistent with the authors having uncovered new mechanistic insights into bacterial antibiotic tolerance mediated by reducing ribosomal protein abundance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Since the WT strain grows faster than the tusB mutant, there is a question of how growth rate, per se, impacts some of the analysis done. The authors should address this issue. In addition, it may not be essential, but would analysis of another slow-growing mutant (in some other antibiotic tolerance pathway if available) serve as a good control in this context?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study addresses a critical clinical challenge-bacterial antibiotic tolerance (a key driver of treatment failure distinct from genetic resistance)-by uncovering a novel regulatory role of the conserved s2U tRNA modification in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Its strengths are notable and lay a solid foundation for understanding phenotypic drug tolerance. The study is the first to link s2U tRNA modification loss to antibiotic tolerance, specifically targeting translation/transcription-inhibiting antibiotics (doxycycline, gentamicin, rifampicin). By establishing a causal chain - s2U deficiency → codon-specific ribosome pausing (at AAA/CAA/GAA) → reduced ribosomal protein translation → global translational suppression → tolerance - it expands the functional landscape of tRNA modifications beyond canonical translation fidelity, filling a gap in how RNA epigenetics shapes bacterial stress adaptation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study makes a valuable contribution to understanding tRNA modification-mediated antibiotic tolerance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are several limitations that weaken the robustness of the study's mechanistic conclusions. Addressing these gaps would significantly enhance its impact and translational potential.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript of Cotten et al., the authors study the 2-thiolation of tRNA in bacterial antibiotic resistance. The wildtype organism, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, downregulates 2-thiolation as a response to antibiotics targeting the ribosome. In this manuscript, the authors show that a knockout of tusB causes slower translation. They provide evidence on the mechanisms of the slowing by determining transcription and translation, ribosome profiling and performing codon-usage analysis. They successfully determined that 2 codons are drivers of the translation slowdown, and the data is highly conclusive. Technically, I have nothing to criticize.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>All in all, the study is very well made, and the writing is clear and concise. It covers a wide array of state-of-the-art analyses to unravel the interplay of tRNA modifications in translation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The only question that remains to be asked is why the slowed translation leads to a better survival of the bacteria under antibiotic stress. In my opinion, the mechanism itself remains unclear. Thus, the statement that &quot;We expect that this reduction in ribosomal proteins is globally reducing the translational capacity of the cell and is responsible for inducing tolerance to ribosome and RNA polymerase-targeting antibiotics&quot; does not truly emphasize the remaining open question of why slowed translation favors survival. Therefore, I would recommend a minor text revision.</p>

<p>The findings are consistent with the authors having uncovered new mechanistic insights into bacterial antibiotic tolerance mediated by reducing ribosomal protein abundance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Since the WT strain grows faster than the tusB mutant, there is a question of how growth rate, per se, impacts some of the analysis done. The authors should address this issue. In addition, it may not be essential, but would analysis of another slow-growing mutant (in some other antibiotic tolerance pathway if available) serve as a good control in this context?</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their time spent reviewing our manuscript and for their positive review. We plan to address their comment as to how growth rate impacts the analyses and plan to incorporate another slow-growing mutant in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study addresses a critical clinical challenge-bacterial antibiotic tolerance (a key driver of treatment failure distinct from genetic resistance)-by uncovering a novel regulatory role of the conserved s2U tRNA modification in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Its strengths are notable and lay a solid foundation for understanding phenotypic drug tolerance. The study is the first to link s2U tRNA modification loss to antibiotic tolerance, specifically targeting translation/transcription-inhibiting antibiotics (doxycycline, gentamicin, rifampicin). By establishing a causal chain - s2U deficiency → codon-specific ribosome pausing (at AAA/CAA/GAA) → reduced ribosomal protein translation → global translational suppression → tolerance - it expands the functional landscape of tRNA modifications beyond canonical translation fidelity, filling a gap in how RNA epigenetics shapes bacterial stress adaptation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study makes a valuable contribution to understanding tRNA modification-mediated antibiotic tolerance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are several limitations that weaken the robustness of the study's mechanistic conclusions. Addressing these gaps would significantly enhance its impact and translational potential.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their time spent reviewing our manuscript, and for both their positive comments about the significance and novelty of this work as well as their critiques. We plan to address their specific recommendations in the revised manuscript by focusing on the contribution of specific ribosomal proteins (i.e. the 30S subunit protein, S13) through overexpression, codon replacement, and stability experiments. We also plan to design experiments to assess in vivo relevance and assess possible impacts on other pathways involved in antibiotic tolerance.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript of Cotten et al., the authors study the 2-thiolation of tRNA in bacterial antibiotic resistance. The wildtype organism, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, downregulates 2-thiolation as a response to antibiotics targeting the ribosome. In this manuscript, the authors show that a knockout of tusB causes slower translation. They provide evidence on the mechanisms of the slowing by determining transcription and translation, ribosome profiling and performing codon-usage analysis. They successfully determined that 2 codons are drivers of the translation slowdown, and the data is highly conclusive. Technically, I have nothing to criticize.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>All in all, the study is very well made, and the writing is clear and concise. It covers a wide array of state-of-the-art analyses to unravel the interplay of tRNA modifications in translation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The only question that remains to be asked is why the slowed translation leads to a better survival of the bacteria under antibiotic stress. In my opinion, the mechanism itself remains unclear. Thus, the statement that &quot;We expect that this reduction in ribosomal proteins is globally reducing the translational capacity of the cell and is responsible for inducing tolerance to ribosome and RNA polymerase-targeting antibiotics&quot; does not truly emphasize the remaining open question of why slowed translation favors survival. Therefore, I would recommend a minor text revision.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their time spent reviewing our manuscript and for their positive review of the technical aspects, experimental design, and writing. We will incorporate their suggested text revision into the revised manuscript, and will add to this statement if additional planned experiments shed light on this remaining question.</p>
