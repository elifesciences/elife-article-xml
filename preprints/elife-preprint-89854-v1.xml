<title>Abstract</title><p>The transcription factor Bcl11b has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. Bcl11b is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is required for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remained unclear. We show that the synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2 is a direct functional target of Bcl11b that regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, we demonstrate C1ql2 to exert its functions through direct interaction with a specific splice variant of neurexin-3, Nrxn3(25b+). Interruption of C1ql2-Nrxn3(25b+) interaction by expression of a non-binding C1ql2 mutant or by deletion of Nrxn3 in the dentate gyrus granule neurons recapitulates major parts of the Bcl11b as well as C1ql2 mutant phenotype, and interferes with C1ql2 targeting to the synapse. Together, this study identifies a novel C1ql2-Nrxn3(25b+)-dependent signaling pathway through which Bcl11b controls mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function. Thus, our findings contribute to the mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders accompanied by synaptic dysfunction.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Disruptions in synaptic structure and function have been identified as a major determinant in the manifestation of various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia and intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hayashi-Takagi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lepeta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zoghbi &amp; Bear, 2012</xref>). The need to understand how synaptic function is compromised in these disorders has accentuated the importance of studying the regulatory mechanisms of physiological synaptic function. These mechanisms involve cell adhesion molecules at both the pre- and post-synaptic side that act as synaptic organizers, whose unique combination determines the structural and functional properties of the synapse. Many such proteins have already been identified and our understanding of their complex role in synapse assembly and function has significantly increased over the last years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">de Wit &amp; Ghosh, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">O’Rourke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sudhof, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, recent advances in the genetics of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders have implicated genes encoding for several of the known synaptic proteins, supporting a role for these molecules in the pathogenesis of corresponding disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sudhof, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Torres et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The sensitivity of the functional specification of the synapse to the combination of distinct synaptic proteins and their relative expression levels suggests that genetically encoded programs define at least facets of the synaptic properties in a cell-type specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sudhof, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">2021</xref>). In fact, several of the synaptic proteins have been shown to promote formation of functional pre- and postsynaptic assemblies when presented in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Dalva et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dean et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Scheiffele et al., 2000</xref>), showing that their ability to specify synapses is in part independent of signaling processes and neuronal activity and supporting the idea that synaptic function is governed by cues linked to cellular origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gomez et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the investigation for synaptic organizers and their function in health and disease should be expanded to the transcriptional programs that regulate their expression.</p>
<p>Bcl11b (also known as Ctip2) is a zinc finger transcription factor that has been implicated in various disorders of the nervous system including Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kunkle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Song et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Whitton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Whitton et al., 2016</xref>). Patients with <italic>BCL11B</italic> mutations present with neurodevelopmental delay, overall learning deficits as well as impaired speech acquisition and autistic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Eto et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lessel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Punwani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Bcl11b is expressed in several neuron types, including the dentate gyrus granule neurons (DGN) of the hippocampus. Expression of Bcl11b in the DGN starts during embryonic development and persists into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Simon et al., 2020</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that Bcl11b plays a crucial role in the development of the hippocampal mossy fiber system, the adult hippocampal neurogenesis as well as hippocampal learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Simon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Simon et al., 2012</xref>). In the mature hippocampus, Bcl11b is critical for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber synapses (MFS), the connection between DGN and CA3 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">De Bruyckere et al., 2018</xref>). MFS have a critical role in learning and memory stemming from their unique structural and functional properties, such as an enormous pool of releasable synaptic vesicles (SV), and reliable presynaptic short- and long-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nicoll &amp; Schmitz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rollenhagen &amp; Lubke, 2010</xref>). Conditional ablation of <italic>Bcl11b</italic> in murine DGN impairs presynaptic recruitment of SV and abolishes mossy fiber long-term potentiation (MF-LTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">De Bruyckere et al., 2018</xref>). The molecular mechanisms, however, through which the transcriptional regulator Bcl11b controls highly dynamic properties of the MFS remained elusive.</p>
<p>In the present study, we show that the secreted synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2, a member of the C1q-like protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yuzaki, 2017</xref>), is a functional target of Bcl11b in murine DGN. Reintroduction of C1ql2 in <italic>Bcl11b</italic> mutant DGN rescued the localization and docking of SV to the active zone (AZ), as well as MF-LTP that was abolished upon <italic>Bcl11b</italic> ablation. Knock-down (KD) of <italic>C1ql2</italic> in wildtype animals recapitulated major part of the MFS phenotype observed in <italic>Bcl11b</italic> mutants. Furthermore, we show that C1ql2 requires direct interaction with a specific neurexin-3 isoform, Nrxn3(25b+), a member of a polymorphic family of presynaptic cell adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Reissner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sudhof, 2017</xref>), to recruit SV <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, we demonstrate that the C1ql2-Nrxn3(25b+) interaction is necessary for the targeting of C1ql2 to the MFS. Taken together, this study identifies a novel Bcl11b/C1ql2/Nrxn3(25b+)-dependent regulatory mechanism that is essential for the control of MFS function. Recent genetic studies suggested its single components to be associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by synaptic dysfunction. Our data, for the first time, demonstrate these molecules to be interconnected in one regulatory pathway. Thus, our findings provide new mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of corresponding human disorders.</p>

<title>Reintroduction of C1ql2 into Bcl11b mutant dentate granule neurons restores synaptic vesicle recruitment at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse</title>
<p>We demonstrated before that Bcl11b is critical for the structural and functional integrity of adult excitatory hippocampal MFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">De Bruyckere et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Simon et al., 2012</xref>). The downstream regulatory mechanisms, however, through which Bcl11b exerts its complex functions at the MFS remained unclear. Using differential transcriptomic analyses on <italic>Bcl11b</italic> conditional knock-out (cKO) and wildtype (WT) DGN we screened for candidate transcriptional targets of this transcription factor. Among these, we identified the synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2, previously implicated in modulating MFS functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Matsuda et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>C1ql2</italic> transcript and protein levels are massively downregulated in <italic>Bcl11b</italic> mutant DGN (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 1a-b</xref>), and the Bcl11b protein directly binds to consensus sequences within the <italic>C1ql2</italic> promotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">De Bruyckere et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting Bcl11b to act on MFS through C1ql2. To directly test this, we stereotaxically injected a C1ql2-expressing AAV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a-b</xref>) into the dentate gyrus (DG) of <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO mice 2 weeks after induction of the mutation. AAV-mediated re-expression of <italic>C1ql2</italic> in the <italic>Bcl11b</italic> mutant DGN completely restored C1ql2 protein expression to control levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c-d</xref>; Control+EGFP: 1±0.216, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP: 0.2±0.023, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-C1ql2: 2.44±0.745, mean±SEM). Furthermore, the spatial distribution of the exogenous C1ql2 protein in mutants was indistinguishable from controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>). Using vGlut1 and Homer1 as pre- and postsynaptic markers, respectively, we observed exogenous C1ql2 protein to precisely localize at glutamatergic synapses within the stratum lucidum (SL) of CA3, confirming that reintroduced C1ql2 is correctly targeted to the MFS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>).</p>

<p>MFS of <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO animals were characterized by a misdistribution of SV in relation to the AZ, with fewer SV being present in the vicinity of AZ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>), as reflected by a lower average synapse score (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>; c.f. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">De Bruyckere et al., 2018</xref>). Reintroduction of C1ql2 fully recovered the synapse score to control values (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a-b</xref>; Control+EGFP: 3.4±0.012, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP: 2.96±0.037, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-C1ql2: 3.47±0.043, mean±SEM). As revealed by the relative frequency of the individual synapse scores, C1ql2 did not only reduce the number of inactive synapses, characterized by a synapse score of 0 but also improved the synapse score of active synapses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). To test for the specificity of the C1ql2 effects, we overexpressed C1ql3 in the DGN of <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a-b</xref>). C1ql3, a different member of the C1ql subfamily, is co-expressed with C1ql2 in DGN and the two proteins have been shown to form functional heteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Matsuda et al., 2016</xref>). C1ql3 expression is unchanged in <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 2a-b</xref>; Control+EGFP: 1±0.022, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP: 1.09±0.126, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-C1ql2: 0.87±0.146, mean±SEM). Overexpression of C1ql3 in the DGN of <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO neither interfered with C1ql2 expression levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c-e</xref>; Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-C1ql3: 0.29±0.042, mean ± SEM) nor was it able to rescue the synapse score of <italic>Bcl11b</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a-c</xref>; Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-C1ql3: 2.97±0.062, mean±SEM).</p>

<p>To analyze the C1ql2-dependent functions of Bcl11b on SV distribution in more detail, we quantified the number of SV docked on AZ in control animals, <italic>Bcl11b</italic> mutants, and upon the reintroduction of C1ql2. SV with a ≤ 5 nm distance from the plasma membrane were considered docked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kusick et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vandael et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Bcl11b</italic> mutant animals had significantly fewer docked vesicles per 100 nm of AZ profile length compared to control animals and more AZ with no docked vesicles at all. Rescue of C1ql2 expression restored the number of docked SV to control levels, while the overexpression of C1ql3 did not affect the number of docked vesicles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d, f-g</xref>; Control+EGFP: 0.53±0.098, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP: 0.24±0.038, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-C1ql2: 0.51±0.049, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-C1ql3: 0.26±0.041, mean±SEM). In contrast to vesicle distribution, Bcl11b and C1ql2 did not affect the size of the docked SV (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>; Control+EGFP: 36.39±1.75, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP: 35.18±1.13, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-C1ql2: 36.35±1.01, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-C1ql3: 36.65±0.1, mean±SEM). Thus, our data suggest that C1ql2 specifically controls SV recruitment downstream of Bcl11b.</p>
<p>Conditional deletion of <italic>Bcl11b</italic> in the adult hippocampus also leads to a loss of MFS, as well as reduced ultrastructural complexity of the remaining mossy fiber boutons (MFB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">De Bruyckere et al., 2018</xref>), posing the question of whether these phenotypic features also depend on C1ql2. Interestingly, C1ql2 reintroduction in the DGN of <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO neither restored the loss of glutamatergic synapses, as quantified by the colocalization of pre- and postsynaptic markers, vGlut1 and Homer1 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 2e</xref>; Control+EGFP: 90.65±8.25, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP: 60.68±4.62, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-C1ql2: 56.84±6.99, mean±SEM), nor the reduced ultrastructural complexity of MFB, as quantified by the MFB perimeter/area ratio (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 2c-d</xref>; Control+EGFP: 0.0051±0.00031, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP: 0.0042±0.00014, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-C1ql2: 0.0037±0.00021, mean±SEM). This suggests that Bcl11b acts on MFS through C1ql2-dependent as well as -independent signaling pathways.</p>

<title>Reintroduction of C1ql2 into Bcl11b mutant dentate granule neurons rescues mossy fiber synapse long-term potentiation</title>
<p>The ultrastructural changes at the MFS point towards potential alterations in synaptic function. Indeed, adult-induced <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO was previously found to result in a loss of MF-LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">De Bruyckere et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore tested whether the reintroduction of C1ql2 in <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO DGN can rescue LTP at the mutant MFS, similarly to SV recruitment. We stimulated mossy fibers in acute slices and measured the resulting field potentials in the SL of CA3. Field responses were carefully validated for the specificity of mossy fiber signals by the presence of strong paired-pulse facilitation and block by the mGluR antagonist DCG-IV. Under these conditions, input-output curves of fEPSP slopes versus axonal fiber volleys revealed no significant differences between control and <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO mice (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 2f-g</xref>; Control+EGFP: 1.95±0.09, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP: 2.02±0.14, mean±SEM), indicating that basal synaptic transmission was unaltered in the <italic>Bcl11b</italic> mutants. We then induced LTP by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of mossy fibers in control and <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO animals with or without AAV-mediated expression of C1ql2. Compared to controls, <italic>Bcl11b</italic> mutants injected with the control AAV displayed a strong reduction of LTP at 20-30 and 30-40 min after induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a-c</xref>; 0-10 min: Control+EGFP: 90.4±7.2, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP: 106.1±10.8, 10-20 min: Control+EGFP: 42.7±3.6, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP: 39.5±4.6, 20-30 min: Control+EGFP: 52.5±7.6, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP: 24.8±3.2, 30-40 min: Control+EGFP: 50.1±7.3, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP: 20.3±3.7, mean±SEM), consistent with our previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">De Bruyckere et al., 2018</xref>).

<p>MF-LTP is known to be mediated by a cAMP-dependent signaling cascade.

<title>C1ql2-Nrxn3(25b+) interaction recruits presynaptic vesicles <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>C1ql2 was previously shown to interact with a particular splice variant of Nrxn3β containing exon 25b sequences, Nrxn3(25b+), which was recombinantly expressed in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Matsuda et al., 2016</xref>). To explore whether the Bcl11b/C1ql2-dependent regulation of MFS involves interaction with neuronal Nrxn3, we co-cultured myc-C1ql2 expressing HEK293 cells with primary hippocampal neurons transfected with GFP-Nrxn3α(25b+). We used here the extracellularly longer Nrxn3α isoform because it is more strongly expressed in the murine DG compared to Nrxn3β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Uchigashima et al., 2019</xref>). C1ql2-dependent recruitment of Nrxn3α(25b+) was quantified by the surface area of HEK293 cells covered by GFP-Nrxn3α(25b+)-positive neuronal profiles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). HEK293 cells expressing myc-C1ql2 had a significantly larger surface area covered by neuronal Nrxn3α(25b+) in comparison to HEK293 cells expressing myc-tag only (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>; myc-C1ql2: 39.97±3.99, myc-tag: 17.29±2.27, mean±SEM). Using vGlut1 immunoreactivity as a proxy for SV localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fremeau et al., 2004</xref>), we examined in the same system whether C1ql2-expressing HEK293 cells were able to cluster vGlut1 in surrounding GFP-Nrxn3α(25b+)-positive neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>). Interestingly, vGlut1 accumulation was significantly increased in GFP-Nrxn3α(25b+)-positive neurons contacting myc-C1ql2 expressing HEK293 cells as compared to C1ql2-negative HEK293 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>; myc-C1ql2: 40.88±3.25, myc-tag: 24.78±4.99, mean±SEM). To specifically analyze whether endogenous Nrxn3 is required for C1ql2-mediated vGlut1 accumulation in neurons, we co-cultured myc-C1ql2 expressing HEK293 cells with primary hippocampal neurons derived from <italic>Nrxn123</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> mice, in which all three <italic>Nrxn</italic> genes are floxed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), and which we transfected with either active Cre recombinase or an inactive Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Klatt et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e</xref>). Neurons lacking all Nrxn variants showed a significantly lower accumulation of endogenous vGlut1 when contacting the C1ql2-expressing HEK293 cells compared to control neurons.

<p>To explore the relevant epitope that mediates binding of C1ql2 to Nrxn3(25b+) proteins, we analyzed the solvent accessible electrostatic surface properties of the C1ql-domain trimeric structure of C1ql2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ressl et al., 2015</xref>) (PDB_ID: 4QPY) and found that a change of lysine262 (K262) to glutamic acid renders a large area underneath the C1ql2-specific calcium and receptor binding loops negative (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5g</xref>) and hypothesized that this would repel binding to Nrxn3(25b+). We generated a C1ql2.K262E variant, expressed it in HEK293 cells as before, and tested it for its ability to cluster Nrxn3α(25b+) as well as vGlut1 in contacting primary neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a-d</xref>). In the presence of C1ql2.K262E, recruitment of Nrxn3α(25b+) was significantly lower compared to WT C1ql2 and indistinguishable from myc-tag control levels. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a-b</xref>; myc-K262E: 18.84±5.15). Moreover, the expression of C1ql2.K262E in HEK293 cells was unable to accumulate vGlut1 in contacting neurons expressing GFP-Nrxn3α(25b+) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c-d</xref>; myc-K262E: 16.9±1.2, mean±SEM). Together, these results provide <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence that the clustering of vGlut1 depends on an intact C1ql2-Nrxn3(25b+) interaction, and that a single point mutation that creates a negative charge of that surface area underneath the C1ql2-specific calcium and receptor binding loops abolishes this binding activity and, thereby, the regulation of SV clustering.</p>
<p>To validate our identification of K262 as a key residue for the C1ql2-Nrxn3(25b+) interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>, we expressed C1ql2.K262E in <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO DGN, in which endogenous C1ql2 expression is downregulated by the ablation of <italic>Bcl11b</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>).

However, the spatial distribution of C1ql2.K262E was notably different from the WT protein in the SL of CA3 where most of the MFS are located (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref>). In the SL, expression levels of C1ql2.K262E were significantly lower compared to WT C1ql2 as quantified by the integrated fluorescence density (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d-e</xref>; Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-C1ql2: 9.75±0.57 x10<sup>4</sup>, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-K262E: 5.89±0.55 x10<sup>4</sup>, mean±SEM).

<p>To investigate how the misdistribution of C1ql2.K262E in the SL affected the structure of MFS terminals, we determined if C1ql2.K262E was able to recover the average synapse score in the <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO background. As expected, we found an ineffective activity of the mutant molecule (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6f-g</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 4b</xref>; Control+EGFP: 3.39±0.048, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-K262E: 2.87±0.043, mean±SEM), consistent with a role for C1ql2 in organizing MFS structure. Furthermore, the number of docked vesicles per 100 nm of AZ profile length in the MFB of animals receiving the C1ql2.K262E AAV was significantly lower compared to control animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6h</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 4c-d</xref>; Control+EGFP: 0.41±0.069, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-K262E: 0.19±0.035, mean±SEM), indicating that C1ql2-dependent signaling also affected the docking of SV within these synapses. In contrast, the diameter of docked vesicles was unchanged (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 4e</xref>; Control+EGFP: 39.06±1.22, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-K262E: 36.38±2.19, mean±SEM). Unexpectedly, however, C1ql2.K262E was able to rescue the loss of MF-LTP observed in <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 4f-h</xref>; 0-10 min: Control+EGFP: 90.4±7.2, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-K262E: 155.8±30.3, 10-20 min: Control+EGFP: 42.7±3.6, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-K262E: 68.7±17.3, 20-30 min: Control+EGFP: 52.5±7.6, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-K262E: 55.9±13.8, 30-40 min: Control+EGFP: 50.1±7.3, Bcl11b cKO+EGFP-2A-K262E: 47.8±9.3, mean±SEM). Thus, our data suggest that Bcl11b regulates MFS function through divergent C1ql2-dependent downstream signaling pathways: while SV recruitment depends on a direct interaction of C1ql2 with Nrxn3(25b+), C1ql2 appears to regulate MF-LTP through Nrxn3(25b+)-independent mechanisms.</p>
<p>To explore if the binding to Nrxn3α(25b+) is required for correct C1ql2 targeting to the SL <italic>in vivo</italic>, we stereotaxically injected an AAV expressing GFP-tagged Cre or inactive Cre into the DG of 2 month old <italic>Nrxn123<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref>), which resulted in strong reduction of <italic>Nrxn3</italic> mRNA levels 2 months later, (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref>; inactive Cre: 1±0.127, Cre: 0.38±0.09, mean±SEM). Strikingly, endogenous C1ql2 expression along the MF axons in the SL of CA3 was significantly reduced in <italic>Nrxn123</italic> cKO animals compared to <italic>Nrxn123</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> animals expressing inactive Cre (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7c-d</xref>; inactive Cre: 11.65±1.75, Cre: 4.71±0.93, mean±SEM). To control for the specificity of this effect, we also determined the level of C1ql3 expression and found it unchanged in <italic>Nrxn123</italic> cKO (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 5a</xref>). To exclude that the reduced C1ql2 expression was simply a consequence of an overall loss of MFB, we used ZnT3 as a marker of MFB and found it unchanged in <italic>Nrxn123</italic> cKO compared to controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7e</xref>). Remarkably, disruption of the C1ql2-Nrxn3(25b+) binding by ablation of <italic>Nrxn3</italic> in <italic>Nrxn123</italic> cKO mutants not only led to the reduced C1ql2 expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7c</xref>) but in fact recapitulated the phenotype observed upon <italic>Bcl11b</italic> ablation or by KD of <italic>C1ql2</italic> as evidenced by a large reduction of the average synapse score in <italic>Nrxn123</italic> cKO (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7f-g</xref>, inactive Cre: 3.11±0.06; Cre: 2.67±0.074, mean±SEM). Also, similarly to the <italic>Bcl11b</italic> and <italic>C1ql2</italic> mutant phenotypes, we observed the number of docked vesicles per 100 nm of AZ profile length in <italic>Nrxn123</italic> cKO to be diminished compared to controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7h</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 5c-d</xref>; inactive Cre: 0.404±0.035, Cre: 0.197±0.019, mean±SEM), whereas the diameter of docked vesicles remained unchanged (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 5e</xref>; inactive Cre: 38.38±0.44; Cre: 37.12±0.8, mean±SEM). Thus, our results provide compelling evidence that Bcl11b controls MFS organization through C1ql2/Nrxn3(25b+)-dependent signaling, explicating how Bcl11b, a transcription factor with a broad range of functions, can regulate highly specific processes in the brain.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is emerging evidence that the zinc finger transcription factor Bcl11b is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental as well as neuropsychiatric disorders that are frequently associated with synaptic dysfunction. Previous work from our group demonstrated Bcl11b to be essential for synapse function in the mossy fiber circuit of the adult murine hippocampus. The underlying molecular mechanisms downstream of Bcl11b, however, remained elusive. In the present study, we uncover a novel C1ql2-dependent regulatory pathway through which Bcl11b controls the structural as well as functional integrity of hippocampal MFS in adult mice. We show that SV recruitment to the AZ of MFS, as well as the expression of MF-LTP, depend on C1ql2, which is a direct functional target of Bcl11b. Reintroduction of C1ql2 into <italic>Bcl11b</italic> mutant DGN restores defective SV recruitment and LTP expression. KD of <italic>C1ql2</italic> in DGN recapitulates the impaired SV recruitment and loss of LTP observed in <italic>Bcl11b</italic> mutants. Finally, we show that C1ql2 controls SV recruitment through a direct interaction with presynaptic Nrxn3(25b+), while LTP potentially depends on a Nrxn3-independent pathway. Recent studies suggested Nrxn3, as well as C1ql2, to be associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, our study for the first time identifies a Bcl11b/C1ql2/Nrxn3-dependent signaling pathway in the control of basic structural and functional properties of MFS. Analysis of this regulatory pathway in mice may provide important novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>We have previously shown that conditional ablation of <italic>Bcl11b</italic> in the adult hippocampus leads to structural and functional changes of MFS characterized by an overall reduction in synapse numbers, loss of bouton complexity, misdistribution of SV as well as loss of MF-LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">De Bruyckere et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we found that AAV-mediated reintroduction of the synaptic organizer protein C1ql2, which is a direct transcriptional target of Bcl11b and is downregulated in <italic>Bcl11b</italic> mutant DGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">De Bruyckere et al., 2018</xref>), was able to rescue major part of the <italic>Bcl11b</italic> mutant phenotype at the MFS. Restoring C1ql2 expression in <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO DGN led to a complete rescue of the SV distribution and docking as well as LTP at the MFS, while synapse numbers and ultrastructural complexity of boutons remained unchanged. Furthermore, KD of <italic>C1ql2</italic> in WT DGN recapitulated the <italic>Bcl11b</italic> phenotype with impaired SV recruitment and loss of LTP, supporting the specificity of C1ql2 function. MF-LTP, which manifests as a long-term increase in presynaptic vesicle release probability (P<sub>r</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Shahoha et al., 2022</xref>), directly depends on the distribution of SV at AZ. Recent studies have shown that the increase in P<sub>r</sub> involves the recruitment of new AZ and an increase in the number of docked and tethered vesicles, corresponding to the readily releasable pool of SV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Orlando et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vandael et al., 2020</xref>). The perturbed SV recruitment in both <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO and <italic>C1ql2</italic> KD mice could thus explain the loss of LTP in both conditions. Indeed, reintroduction of C1ql2 in <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO DGN specifically rescued SV recruitment and LTP, while synapse numbers and ultrastructural complexity of MFB remained unchanged. It is important to note, however, that additional factors have been suggested to contribute to the increase in P<sub>r</sub>, including a tighter coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and SV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Midorikawa &amp; Sakaba, 2017</xref>) and the accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels near release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fukaya et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, it cannot be excluded that C1ql2 regulates MF-LTP through one of these alternative mechanisms. Aiming to narrow in on the nature of the mechanism through which Bcl11b regulates MF-LTP, we used forskolin to induce LTP in <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO. MF-LTP relies on presynaptic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Castillo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zalutsky &amp; Nicoll, 1990</xref>), with a central role for the second messenger cAMP. This mediator is produced by AC in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Li et al., 2007</xref>) and kainate receptors (KAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lauri et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Schmitz et al., 2003</xref>). By using forskolin to directly activate AC we bypassed these initial steps, and still found a reduction of LTP in <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO mice, similarly to HFS. These results confirm that the loss of LTP is caused by a process downstream of the initial presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx following stimulation. We note that, in the present experiments, we did not observe the decrease in input-output relation as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">De Bruyckere et al. (2018)</xref>. After excluding technical differences, e.g. different methods of data analysis, we conclude that the discrepancy is best explained by differences in the population of presynaptic fibers. In the present study, mossy fiber responses were specifically identified by testing for frequency facilitation and sensitivity to mGluR antagonists, whereas in the previous study this purification was not done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">De Bruyckere et al., 2018</xref>). Together, our results suggest Bcl11b to be an important synaptic regulator that controls the structure and function of adult MFS through both C1ql2-dependent, as well as -independent transcriptional programs.</p>
<p>C1ql proteins are complement-related factors that are synthesized by the presynapse and secreted into the synaptic cleft. Within the hippocampus, C1ql2 and −3 protein expression overlaps and is highly restricted to DGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Iijima et al., 2010</xref>) and the corresponding mossy fiber system, including MF-CA3 synapses. C1ql2 and −3 were previously suggested to form functional heteromers that are able to cluster postsynaptic KAR on MFS. Selective deletion of either C1ql2 or −3 in mice was reported to have no overt mutant hippocampal phenotype, suggesting functional compensation for both proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Matsuda et al., 2016</xref>). Using shRNA-mediated selective KD of <italic>C1ql2</italic> in DGN as well as rescue of the <italic>Bcl11b</italic> mutation by the reintroduction of C1ql2 into mutant DGN, we observed a novel presynaptic function for C1ql2 in the recruitment of SV and the expression of LTP in MFS. This function was specific to C1ql2 since overexpression of C1ql3 in <italic>Bcl11b</italic> mutant DGN was unable to rescue the synapse phenotype. Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies suggested that C1ql2 function at the MFS involves interaction with Nrxn3 isoforms containing the SS5<sup>25b</sup> sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Matsuda et al., 2016</xref>). Nrxns are synaptic cell adhesion molecules that mediate various synaptic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Reissner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sudhof, 2017</xref>), including the recruitment of SV and dense-core vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dean et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ferdos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Quinn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rui et al., 2017</xref>). This prompted us to analyze, whether C1ql2-dependent SV recruitment in MFS requires a direct interaction with Nrxn3(25b+) <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Expression of C1ql2 in HEK293 cells co-cultured with GFP-Nrxn3α(25+)-expressing hippocampal neurons was able to recruit Nrxn3α(25b+) and vGlut1 at contact points, while C1ql2.K262E, a C1ql2 variant with an amino-acid replacement that perturbs the interaction with Nrxn3(25b+), was no longer able to recruit neuronal vGlut1. Furthermore, clustering of vGlut1 by C1ql2-expressing HEK293 cells was reduced in neurons harboring a pan-neurexin mutation, a phenotype that was rescued by the selective reintroduction of Nrxn3α(25b+). Finally, the introduction of C1ql2.K262E in <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO DGN <italic>in vivo</italic> was unable to rescue the SV recruitment, while the silencing of <italic>Nrxns</italic> in DGN <italic>in vivo</italic> perturbed the SV recruitment to a similar extent as in <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO and <italic>C1ql2</italic> KD. Based on these findings, we anticipated the overexpression of C1ql2.K262E in <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO DGN to be unable to rescue MF-LTP. Unexpectedly, the introduction of C1ql2.K262E into <italic>Bcl11b</italic> cKO fully rescued MF-LTP. This raises the possibility that C1ql2 can influence MF-LTP through additional, yet uncharacterized mechanisms, independent of SV recruitment or direct interaction with Nrxn3(25b+). We cannot exclude, however, that the expression of a mutant C1ql2 variant created an additional gain-of-function effect that circumvented SV recruitment and allowed the rescue of MF-LTP in our experimental system. The latter is supported by the fact that within the first 10 minutes after HFS, fEPSP slopes for C1ql2.K262E were significantly elevated compared to controls, an effect which was not seen after C1ql2 re-expression. Together, our data provide comprehensive experimental evidence that the direct interaction of C1ql2 with Nrxn3(25b+) is essential for SV recruitment at the MFS. The C1q domain is able to form stable, higher-order oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ressl et al., 2015</xref>). Neurexins, on the other hand, are highly mobile outside and inside of synaptic terminals <bold><sup>Error!</sup> <sup>Reference</sup> <sup>source</sup> <sup>not</sup> <sup>found.</sup></bold>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Klatt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Neupert et al., 2015</xref>). We observed that an abolished interaction between C1ql2 and Nrxn3(25b+) was accompanied by impaired targeting of the C1ql2 protein to the MFS. Thus, the interaction of C1ql2 with Nrxn3(25b+) may reciprocally augment the accumulation of both proteins at synaptic sites.</p>
<p>Perturbations in synaptic structure and function are major determinants of various neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hayashi-Takagi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lepeta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zoghbi &amp; Bear, 2012</xref>). Emerging evidence from recent genetic studies suggests such disorders to be linked to various genes encoding for synaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sudhof, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Torres et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Decoding the molecular mechanisms of synaptic organization and stability and their transcriptional regulation would therefore be expected to contribute to the mechanistic understanding of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The transcription factor Bcl11b has been linked to neurodevelopmental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lessel et al., 2018</xref>), neurodegenerative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kunkle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Song et al., 2022</xref>) and neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Whitton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Whitton et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>BCL11B</italic> mutations in humans are associated with neurodevelopmental delay, overall learning deficits as well as impaired speech acquisition and autistic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Eto et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lessel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Punwani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, conditional ablation of <italic>Bcl11b</italic> selectively in the adult murine hippocampus results in impaired learning and memory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Simon et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>NRXN3</italic> single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been implicated in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hu et al., 2013</xref>) and addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hishimoto et al., 2007</xref>), with one recorded SNP located close to SS5 altering the expression of Nrxn3(25b+). Interestingly, recent studies have also associated <italic>C1QL2</italic> with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Marballi et al., 2022</xref>) as well as cocaine addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Huggett &amp; Stallings, 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">2020b</xref>). In this study we demonstrate that Bcl11b, through its transcriptional target C1ql2, modulates the synaptic organization of MFS by controlling the recruitment of SV at AZ. This regulatory mechanism depends on a direct interaction of C1ql2 with Nrxn3(25b+). Importantly, SV trafficking and altered release probability have been implicated in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Egbujo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lepeta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the identification of the Bcl11b/C1ql2/Nrxn3(25b+)-dependent signaling module in this study provides a new entry point for future mechanistic analyses of synaptopathies. Moreover, the existence of such cell type-specific signaling modules reveals how a fundamental transcription factor with diverse functions such as Bcl11b can be implicated in the pathomegenesis of brain disorders characterized by synaptic dysfunction.</p>

For pan<italic>-neurexin</italic> KO, the DG of 60 days old <italic>Nrxn123<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice were injected with an AAV expressing EGFP-Cre or a control AAV expressing EGFP-Cre.Y324F, an inactive Cre. All AAV were produced by the Viral Vector Facility of the Neuroscience Center Zurich on request. The mice were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and placed in a mouse stereotaxic apparatus. During the entire procedure, anesthesia was maintained by constant administration of 2.2% isoflurane. Eye ointment was applied to prevent eyes from drying. For electrophysiological experiments, mice were subcutaneously injected with buprenorphine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg, Temgesic, Indivior) 30 minutes before and 3 hours after each surgery. For all other experiments, Butorphanol (Livisto) and Meloxicam (Boehringer-Ingelheim; 5 μg/g) were injected subcutaneously and the local anesthetic Bupivacaine (Puren; 5 μg/g) was injected subcutaneously at the incision site. After 10 min the head of the mouse was shaved and disinfected and an incision was made in the skin. Targeted injection sites were identified and a small craniotomy was performed for each site. The injector was placed at the individual sites and the viral solution was injected at 100 nL/min, with a 5-10 min recovery before removing the injector. After injections at all sites the incision was sutured and the animal was monitored for recovery from anesthesia, after which it was returned to its home cage. For histological and EM analyses of MFS, AAV were injected at three sites per hemisphere with the following coordinates (Bregma: AP 0; ML: 0; DV:0): AP −2 mm; ML ±1 mm; DV −2 mm. AP −2.5 mm; ML ±1.5 mm; DV −1.8 mm. AP −3.1 mm; ML ±2, DV −2.2 mm. For electrophysiological analyses, AAV were injected at two dorsoventral coordinates per hemisphere: AP −3.0 mm; ML ±3.25 mm; DV −2.4 and −2.8 mm. 200-300 nL of AAV (1e12 vg/mL) were injected in each location.</p>

<p>All procedures were performed in an RNase-free environment. Animals were sacrificed under deep CO<sub>2</sub>-induced anesthesia, brains were quickly dissected in ice-cold PBS, cryopreserved in 20% sucrose overnight, frozen in OCT compound (Polysciences), and stored at −80 °C. 20 μm thick coronal sections were collected on UV-treated and 0.05% poly-L-lysine coated membrane-covered PEN slides (Zeiss), fixed for 1 min in ice-cold 70% EtOH, incubated for 45 sec in 1% cresyl violet acetate solution (Waldeck) and washed for 1 min each in 70% EtOH and 100% EtOH. Sections were briefly dried on a 37 °C warming plate and immediately processed. The granule cell layer of the DG was isolated by laser capture microdissection using a PALM MicroBeam Rel.4.2 (Zeiss). RNA was isolated from the collected tissue using RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using the SensiFast cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bioline). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in triplets for each sample using the LightCycler DNA Master SYBR Green I Kit in a LightCycler 480 System (Roche).

<title>Electrophysiological recordings and data analysis</title>
<p>Animals were sacrificed under deep CO<sub>2</sub>-induced anesthesia at 4 months.

After cutting, slices were transferred to a “Haas”-type interface chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Haas et al., 1979</xref>), where they were perfused with carbogen-saturated ACSF containing (in mM) 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2.3 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 glucose, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (pH 7.4 at 34°C) at a rate of 1.5 mL/min at 34 ± 1 °C. Slices were allowed to recover for a minimum of 1 h before the start of recordings.</p>
<p>Recordings were carried out by placing a glass micropipette (tip diameter 3–5 μm) filled with ACSF in the SL of the CA3b area. To induce MF field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSP), a bipolar electrode (Science Products) was placed within the hilus region of the DG. 0.1 ms pulses were delivered with an Iso-Flex stimulus isolator (AMPI) at 20 sec intervals. Putative mossy fiber signals were preliminarily identified using a 25 Hz train of five pulses. Input-output relationships were obtained by measuring the fiber volley amplitude and fEPSP slope in response to stimulations with intensities ranging from 3 to 40 V. For LTP recordings, stimulation intensity for each slice was adjusted to obtain a slope value of 20% (30% in the case of forskolin (Biomol) experiments) of the maximum fEPSP slope. LTP was induced by three trains of 100 stimulation pulses at 100 Hz (high frequency stimulation, HFS), repeated every 8 sec. 3 μM DCG-IV (Tocris Bioscience) was applied after each experiment, and only recordings displaying &gt;70% reduction in putative MF-fEPSP slopes were used for analysis. fEPSPs were amplified 100x with an EXT 10-2F amplifier (npi electronics). Signals were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz and high-pass filtered at 0.3 Hz, digitized at 20 kHz with an analog-to-digital converter (Cambridge Electronic Design (CED)) and stored for offline analysis using Spike2 (v7) software (CED). Offline data analysis was performed on raw traces using Spike2. Slope values were measured from the linear part of the fEPSP rising phase by manually placing vertical cursors. Changes in fEPSP slopes were calculated as a percentage of the average baseline fEPSP ((average fEPSP slope in a given time interval after HFS - average fEPSP slope before HFS)/ (average fEPSP slope before HFS)).</p>

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis was conducted blind to the experimental treatment. Statistical analysis and graph generation was done using Python 3. If samples met the criteria for normality, we used two-tailed unpaired t-test to compare two groups and one-way ANOVA for more than two groups. For non-normally distributed data Mann-Whitney u-test was used. Two-way ANOVA was used for examining the influence of two different categorical independent variables. If ANOVAs were significant, we used a post hoc Tukey’s multiple-comparisons test to compare groups (structural and expression data) or a post hoc Bonferonni’s comparison test (electrophysiological data). Data are presented as mean±SEM. Significance levels were set as indicated in figures: *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001.</p>

<p>The authors identify a new role for C1ql2 at moss fiber synapses in the hippocampus and find that C1ql2, whose expression is controlled by Bcl11b, controls the recruitment of synaptic vesicles to active zones and is necessary for synaptic plasticity. The data implicating C1ql2 involvement, using numerous viral/genetic rescue approaches, are largely <bold>convincing</bold>, while the experimental evidence supporting the role of the specific Nrxn3 splice variant is less complete. These data are <bold>valuable</bold>, building on prior discoveries of how Bcl11b, a disease-relevant molecule, contributes to our understanding of mossy-fiber synaptic development.</p>

<p>Koumoundourou et al., identify a pathway downstream of Bcl11b that controls synapse morphology and plasticity of hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. Using an elegant combination of in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro approaches, the authors build on their previous work that indicated C1ql2 as a functional target of Bcl11b (De Bruyckere et al., 2018). Here, they examine the functional implications of C1ql2 at MF synapses in Bcl11b cKO mice and following C1ql2 shRNA. The authors find that Bcl11b KO and shRNA against C1ql2 significantly reduces the recruitment of synaptic vesicles and impairs LTP at MF synapses. Importantly, the authors test a role for the previously identified C1ql2 binding partner, exon 25b-containing Nrxn3 (Matsuda et al., 2016), as relevant at MF synapses to maintain synaptic vesicle recruitment. To test this, the authors developed a K262E C1ql2 mutant that disrupts binding to Nrxn3. Curiously, while Bcl11b KO and C1ql2 KD largely phenocopy (reduced vesicle recruitment and impaired LTP), only vesicle recruitment is dependent on C1ql2-Nrxn3 interactions. These findings provide new insight into the functional role of C1ql2 at MF synapses. While the authors convincingly demonstrate a role for C1ql2-Nrxn3(25b+) interaction for vesicle recruitment and a Nrxn3(25b+)-independent role for C1ql2 in LTP, the underlying mechanisms remain inconclusive. Additionally, a discussion of how these findings relate to previous work on C1ql2 at mossy fiber synapses and how the findings contribute to the biology of Nrxn3 would increase the interpretability of this work.</p>

<p>This manuscript describes experiments that further investigate the actions of the transcription factor Bcl11b in regulating mossy fiber (MF) synapses in the hippocampus. Prior work from the same group had demonstrated that loss of Bcl11b results in loss of MF synapses as well as a decrease in LTP. Here the authors focus on a target of Bcl11b a secreted synaptic organizer C1ql2 which is almost completely lost in Bcl11b KO. Viral reintroduction of C1ql2 rescues the synaptic phenotypes, whereas direct KD of C1ql2 recapitulates the Bcl1 phenotype. C1ql2 itself interacts directly with Nrxn3 and replacement with a binding deficient mutant C1q was not able to rescue the Bcl11b KO phenotype. Overall there are some interesting observations in the study, however there are also some concerns about the measures and interpretation of data.</p>
<p>The authors state that they used a differential transcriptomic analysis to screen for candidate targets of Bcl11b, yet they do not present any details of this screen. This should be included and at the very least a table of all DE genes included. It is likely that many other genes are also regulated by Bcl11b so it would be important to the reader to see the rationale for focusing attention on C1ql2 in this study.</p>
<p>All viral-mediated expression uses AAVs which are known to ablate neurogenesis in the DG (Johnston DOI: 10.7554/eLife.59291) through the ITR regions and leads to hyperexcitability of the dentate. While it is not clear how this would impact the measurements the authors make in MF-CA3 synapses, this should be acknowledged as a potential caveat in this study.</p>
<p>The authors claim that the viral re-introduction &quot;restored C1ql2 protein expression to control levels. This is misleading given that the mean of the data is 2.5x the control (Figure 1d and also see Figure 6c). The low n and large variance are a problem for these data. Moreover, they are marked ns but the authors should report p values for these. At the least, this likely large overexpression and variability should be acknowledged. In addition, the use of clipped bands on Western blots should be avoided. Please show the complete protein gel in primary figures of supplemental information.</p>
<p>Measurement of EM micrographs: As prior work suggested that MF synapse structure is disrupted the authors should report active zone length as this may itself affect &quot;synapse score&quot; defined by the number of vesicles docked. More concerning is that the example KO micrographs seem to have lost all the densely clustered synaptic vesicles that are away from the AZ in normal MF synapses e.g. compare control and KO terminals in Fig 2a or 6f or 7f. These terminals look aberrant and suggest that the important measure is not what is docked but what is present in the terminal cytoplasm that normally makes up the reserve pool. This needs to be addressed with further analysis and modifications to the manuscript.</p>
<p>The study also presents correlated changes in MF LTP in Bcl11b KO which are rescued by C1ql2 expression. It is not clear whether the structural and functional deficits are causally linked and this should be made clearer in the manuscript. It is also not apparent why this functional measure was chosen as it is unlikely that C1ql2 plays a direct role in presynaptic plasticity mechanisms that are through a cAMP/ PKA pathway and likely disrupted LTP is due to dysfunctional synapses rather than a specific LTP effect. The authors should consider measures that might support the role of Bcl11b targets in SV recruitment during the depletion of synapses or measurements of the readily releasable pool size that would complement their findings in structural studies.</p>
<p>
Bcl11b KO reduces the number of synapses, yet the I-O curve reported in Supp Fig 2 is not changed. How is that possible? This should be explained.</p>
<p>Matsuda et al DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2016.04.001 previously reported that C1ql2 organizes MF synapses by aligning postsynaptic kainate receptors with presynaptic elements. As this may have consequences for the functional properties of MF synapses including their plasticity, the authors should report whether they see deficient postsynaptic glutamate receptor signaling in the Bcl11b KO and rescue in the C1ql2 re-expression.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a strong manuscript that uses multiple current techniques to provide specific mechanistic insight into prior discoveries of the contributions of the Bcl11b transcription factor to mossy fiber synapses of dentate gyrus granule cells. The authors employ an adult deletion of Bcl11b via Tamoxifen-inducible Cre and use immunohistochemical, electron microscopy, and electrophysiological studies of synaptic plasticity, together with viral rescue of C1ql2, a direct transcriptional target of Bcl11b or Nrxn3, to construct a molecular cascade downstream of Bcl11b for DG mossy fiber synapse development. They find that C1ql2 re-expression in Bcl11b cKOs can rescue the synaptic vesicle docking phenotype and the impairments in MF-LTP of these mutants. They also show that C1ql2 knockdown in DG neurons can phenocopy the vesicle docking and plasticity phenotypes of the Bcl11b cKO. They also use artificial synapse formation assays to suggest that C1ql2 functions together with a specific Nrxn3 splice isoform in mediating MF axon development, extending these data with a C1ql2-K262E mutant that purports to specifically disrupt interactions with Nrxn3. All of the molecules involved in this cascade are disease-associated and this study provides an excellent blueprint for uncovering downstream mediators of transcription factor disruption. Together this makes this work of great interest to the field. Strengths are the sophisticated use of viral replacement and multi-level phenotypic analysis while weaknesses include the linkage of C1ql2 with a specific Nrxn3 splice variant in mediating these effects.</p>
<p>Here is an appraisal of the main claims and conclusions:</p>
<p>1. C1ql2 is a downstream target of Bcl11b which mediates the synaptic vesicle recruitment and synaptic plasticity phenotypes seen in these cKOs. This is supported by the clear rescue phenotypes of synapse anatomy (Fig.2) and MF synaptic plasticity (Fig.3). One weakness here is the absence of a control assessing over-expression phenotypes of C1ql2. It's clear from Fig.1D that viral rescue is often greater than WT expression (totally expected). In the case where you are trying to suppress a LoF phenotype, it is important to make sure that enhanced expression of C1ql2 in a WT background does not cause your rescue phenotype. A strong overexpression phenotype in WT would weaken the claim that C1ql2 is the main mediator of the Bcl11b phenotype for MF synapse phenotypes.</p>
<p>2. Knockdown of C1ql2 via 4 shRNAs is sufficient to produce the synaptic vesicle recruitment and MF-LTP phenotypes. This is supported by clear effects in the shRNA-C1ql2 groups as compared to nonsense-EGFP controls. One concern (particularly given the use of 4 distinct shRNAs) is the potential for off-target effects, which is best controlled for by a rescue experiment with RNA-insensitive C1ql2 cDNA as opposed to nonsense sequences, which may not elicit the same off-target effects.</p>
<p>3. C1ql2 interacts with Nrxn3(25b+) to facilitate MF terminal SV clustering. This claim is theoretically supported by the HEK cell artificial synapse formation assay (Fig.5), the inability of the K262-C1ql2 mutation to rescue the Bcl11b phenotype (Fig.6), and the altered localization of C1ql2 in the Nrxn1-3 deletion mice (Fig.7). Each of these lines of experimental evidence has caveats that should be acknowledged and addressed. Given the hypothesis that C1ql2 and Nrxn3b(25b) are expressed in DG neurons and work together, the heterologous co-culture experiment seems strange. Up till now, the authors are looking at pre-synaptic function of C1ql2 since they are re-expressing it in DGNs. The phenotypes they are seeing are also pre-synaptic and/or consistent with pre-synaptic dysfunction. In Fig.5, they are testing whether C1ql2 can induce pre-synaptic differentiation in trans, i.e. theoretically being released from the 293 cells &quot;post-synaptically&quot;. But the post-synaptic ligands (Nlgn1 and and GluKs) are not present in the 293 cells, so a heterologous synapse assay doesn't really make sense here. The effect that the authors are seeing likely reflects the fact that C1ql2 and Nrxn3 do bind to each other, so C1ql2 is acting as an artificial post-synaptic ligand, in that it can cluster Nrxn3 which in turn clusters synaptic vesicles. But this does not test the model that the authors propose (i.e. C1ql2 and Nrxn3 are both expressed in MF terminals). Perhaps a heterologous assay where GluK2 is put into HEK cells and the C1ql2 and Nrxn3 are simultaneously or individually manipulated in DG neurons?</p>
<p>4. K262-C1ql2 mutation blocks the normal rescue through a Nrxn3(25b) mechanism (Fig.6). The strength of this experiment rests upon the specificity of this mutation for disrupting Nrxn3b binding (presynaptic) as opposed to any of the known postsynaptic C1ql2 ligands such as GluK2. While this is not relevant for interpreting the heterologous assay (Fig.5), it is relevant for the in vivo phenotypes in Fig.6. Similar approaches as employed in this paper can test whether binding to other known postsynaptic targets is altered by this point mutation.</p>
<p>5. Altered localization of C1ql2 in Nrxn1-3 cKOs. These data are presented to suggest that Nrx3(25b) is important for localizing C1ql2 to the SL of CA3. Weaknesses of this data include both the lack of Nrxn specificity in the triple a/b KOs as well as the profound effects of Nrxn LoF on the total levels of C1ql2 protein. Some measure that isn't biased by this large difference in C1ql2 levels should be attempted (something like in Fig.1F).</p>
