<title>Abstract</title><p>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Treg) have been implicated in pain modulation in various inflammatory conditions. However, the mechanisms by which Treg hamper pain are still unclear. From a meta-analysis of 11 available transcriptomes, we show that the proenkephalin gene (<italic>Penk)</italic> which encodes the precursor of analgesic opioid peptides, is among the top 10 genes enriched in murine Treg relative to conventional T cells (Tconv). We then show that <italic>Penk</italic> expression in Treg is under the control of TNFR signaling and the transcription factor BATF. Using mice in which <italic>Penk</italic> mRNA expression can be tracked with a fluorescent reporter, we also show that <italic>Penk</italic> expression is restricted to Treg and activated Tconv in non-inflammatory conditions in all examined organs and tissues. Furthermore, inducible ablation of <italic>Penk</italic> in Treg leads to heat hyperalgesia for both male and female mice. Overall, our results indicate that TNFR signaling and BATF regulation of <italic>Penk</italic> in Treg might play a key role at modulating basal somatic sensitivity in mice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Regulatory T-cells (Treg), characterized by the expression of the alpha chain of the interleukin-2 receptor CD25 and the transcription factor Foxp3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, are known to be key players in immuno-regulation in both humans and mice; too few may lead to autoimmune diseases whereas too many may prevent an efficient immune response to cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Over the last few years, several new functions of Treg beyond immunoregulation have been identified in tissue regeneration or local regulation of metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> for instance. In addition, there are accumulating evidences of a cross-talk between Treg and the nervous system. These includes promotion of oligodendrocyte differentiation or inhibition of neuroinflammation facilitating CNS repair process after brain injuries and preventing cognitive decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Furthermore, Treg have been involved in the regulation of pain in various model of nerve injury in rats and mice, such as in autoimmune neuritis or chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Depletion of Treg have been associated with enhanced pain sensitivity whereas increased Treg number or activity limit pain hypersensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Although the current view is that Treg control pain through their immuno-suppressive functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, whether Treg might regulate pain at steady state is currently unknown. Starting from our previous observation that the expression of the proenkephalin gene (<italic>Penk</italic>), encoding for analgesic enkephalins, is highly enriched in Treg (Aubert et al., 2019 biorXiv, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/638072">https://doi.org/10.1101/638072</ext-link>), we characterize the expression of <italic>Penk</italic> in the immune system and investigate the role of Treg on pain <italic>in vivo</italic> at steady state using advanced genetically-engineered mouse models. Our results uncover a previously unknown mechanism by which Treg modulate basal somatic sensitivity.</p>

<title>A meta-signature of murine Treg and <italic>Penk</italic> expression in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs</title>
<p>Using 11 available transcriptomes retrieved from the GEO website, we generated a Treg molecular signature at steady state in lymphoid tissues, improving the robustness of the analysis by several orders of magnitude relative to individual studies. The 25 most differentially expressed genes are depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and the complete list is shown in Table S1. As expected from the sorting strategies used to isolate Treg (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> in the Material and Methods section), we observe that <italic>Il2ra</italic> and <italic>Foxp3</italic> are the most differentially expressed genes in Treg compared to Tconv, followed by the well-known Treg markers <italic>CTLA-4, Itgae</italic> (CD103), <italic>Ikzf2</italic> (Helios) and <italic>Klrg1</italic>. However, several unexpected genes are present in that signature, including the proenkephalin gene <italic>Penk</italic>, coding for opioid peptides endowed with analgesic properties. Using the Immuno-Navigator database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, a batch-corrected collection of RNA quantification across numerous studies, samples and cell types, we confirm that <italic>Penk</italic> is highly correlated to <italic>Foxp3</italic> in mice (R=0.871, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Enriched expression of <italic>Penk</italic> in Treg was previously reported in several specific contexts including TCR-transgenic mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, UVB-exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> or in the brain of mice recovering from stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Using publicly available datasets, we also observe that <italic>Penk</italic> is enriched in Treg in the thymus, the visceral adipose tissue and in muscles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, <italic>Penk</italic> mRNA expression in Treg is consubstantial of their generation and is independent of their tissue localization at steady state.</p>

<title><italic>Penk</italic> mRNA expression is regulated by TNFR signaling and the BATF transcription factor in Treg</title>
<p>To explore possible mechanisms that could explain the enrichment of Penk mRNA in Treg cells, we examined the Immuno-Navigator dataset to extract the genes that are most correlated with Penk and with each other (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Among these genes, we observe several members of the TNFR superfamily (<italic>Tnfrsf1b</italic> (TNFR2), <italic>Tnfrsf4</italic> (OX40), <italic>Tnfrsf9</italic> (4-1BB), <italic>Tnfrsf18</italic> (GITR)) as well as the transcription factor <italic>Batf</italic>. Furthermore, <italic>Batf</italic> expression is highly correlated with <italic>Penk</italic> in Treg (R=0.599, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, TNFR and BATF could be involved in the regulation of <italic>Penk</italic> in Treg. To examine this possibility, we reanalyzed our previously published dataset establishing the transcriptome of Treg stimulated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28 antibodies and TNFR agonists <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. We observe that addition of TNFR2, OX40 or 4-1BB agonists increases <italic>Penk</italic> expression at 36h post-stimulation relative to controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Batf</italic> is also increased by TNFR agonists at an earlier time point (18h), suggesting that TNFR signaling may regulate <italic>Penk</italic> expression through the BATF transcription factor. Accordingly, a dramatic decrease in <italic>Penk</italic> expression is observed in Treg lacking BATF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). In line with our hypothesis, BATF is a crucial partner of AP-1 transcription factor that has been shown to regulate <italic>Penk</italic> in the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>

<title><italic>Penk</italic> is prominently expressed by Treg at steady state</title>
<p>Based on these findings, we further investigated the expression of <italic>Penk</italic> mRNA in various immune cell types across multiple tissues, as defined by a combination of lineage markers. (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). To do so, we crossed a transgenic mouse model expressing Tamoxifen (TMX)-inducible Cre recombinase under the promoter of <italic>Penk</italic> (Penk<sup>Cre-ERT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) with the ROSA26<sup>TdTomato</sup> reporter mice. In these mice, any cell that would expressed <italic>Penk</italic> at the time of TMX administration would become permanently tagged with the tdTomato reporter a few days later. In order to improve detection of those cells by flow cytometry, we also used an anti-mCherry that cross-react with TdTomato (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>). In lymphoid tissue, such as in lymph node (LN), <italic>Penk</italic> expression is mainly restricted to Treg and to a small subset of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Similar results are obtained in non-lymphoid tissues, such as in the colon, although <italic>Penk</italic> expression in activated T cells is further increased relative to LN (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). As summarized in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, Treg is the immune subset expressing the highest level of <italic>Penk</italic> in all tissues analyzed. Expression of <italic>Penk</italic> is also detected in Tconv, but at lower frequencies than in Treg, in agreement with the molecular meta-signature established above (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). All other cell types show low or undetectable <italic>Penk</italic> expression. Interestingly, in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells (Tconv and Treg), <italic>Penk</italic> expression is higher in the activated CD62L<sup>low</sup> CD44<sup>high</sup> fraction compared to the naive CD62L<sup>high</sup> CD44<sup>low</sup> phenotype (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). Thus, we observed that <italic>Penk</italic> mRNA is predominantly found in Treg and activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the immune system at steady state. Among these, the highest expression of <italic>Penk</italic> was detected in Treg cells present in the skin and the colon. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the distribution of Penk may be broader in an inflammatory context. In line with this, a recent study demonstrated that <italic>Penk</italic> expression in M2 macrophages is dependent on IL-4 and occurs in response to nerve injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Heat hyperalgesia in mice deficient for <italic>Penk</italic> in Treg</title>
<p>To determine if enkephalins produced by Treg had an effect on pain at steady state, we generated mice deficient for enkephalins in Treg by crossing TMX-inducible Cre recombinase under the control of the <italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter (Foxp3<sup>Cre-ERT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) with mice transgenic for LoxP sequences flanking exon 2 of <italic>Penk</italic> (Penk<sup>flox</sup>). In these mice (hereafter referred to as Lox), any cell expressing Foxp3 at the time of TMX administration would become deficient for exon 2 of <italic>Penk</italic> a few days later. Since exon 2 is the precursor of Met-Enkephalin, an endogenous opioid that act on thermal pain sensation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, we evaluated the sensibility of these mice to pain induced by heat (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). As controls, we used mice expressing the Cre recombinase and wild-type (WT) at the locus of LoxP sequences insertion. Mice were treated with TMX and evaluated for heat sensitivity without further additional treatment at ten different time points (4 before and 6 after administration of TMX, 2 to 3 days apart). Under these conditions, a significant trend towards lower latency periods (signing heat hyperalgesia) is observed in the Lox group compared to WT mice. Interestingly, the effect is not apparent until 7 days after TMX administration (Figure S4). Indeed, before TMX administration, WT and Lox female and male mice do not differ in their response to heat (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-B</xref>). However, after TMX administration, Lox mice develop hyperalgesia compared to control mice, with a 20 percent reduction in their median latency period from D7 onwards (8.1 vs. 6.5 sec, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, the effect of <italic>Penk</italic> deletion in Treg on heat hyperalgesia is sex independent, since it is observed in both female and male (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), although the reduction was slightly higher in female (22% reduction in latency period) than in male (16% reduction). This can be explained by the fact that males tend to respond faster (7.9s vs 6.1s) than females (8.4s vs 7.0s), irrespective of the genotype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). <italic>Penk</italic> expression by CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells has been associated with analgesia in mice models of visceral pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, but the specific contribution of Treg was not investigated. In neuroinflammatory settings, such as constriction of the sciatic nerve, pain control by Treg could be dependent on their immuno-suppressive function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. On the contrary, our tests were performed at steady state, ruling out the possibility that hyperalgesia could be due to a defect in the immuno-suppressive function of Treg. They strongly suggest a direct role of enkephalins produced by Treg on nociception, uncovering a new non-immune fundamental function of Tregs on endogenous regulation of basal somatic sensitivity.</p>

<title>Hot plate test</title>
<p>The method used was described by Baker et al. (2002)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Briefly, mice were placed on a metal hot plate maintained at 55°C. The plate was enclosed with Plexiglas walls so that mice could not escape. The response latency, which is the time taken to observe a nocifensive behavior such as jumping, licking or flicking of the hind paws, was recorded. The mice were then immediately removed from the plate upon the recording of a reaction, or within 25s if no response was observed to prevent tissue damage. The test was repeated every two days for a total of four measures before the administration of tamoxifen and four measures starting from D3 post-tamoxifen. Male and female mice were tested separately. Mice remained in their home cage except when being tested on the hot plate. The experimenter was blind to the genotype of the mice until the end of the experiment</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors explore mechanisms through which T-regs attenuate acute pain using a heat sensitivity paradigm. Analysis of available transcriptomic data revealed expression on the proenkephalin (Penk) gene in T-regs. The authors explore the contribution of T-reg Penk in the resolution of heat sensitivity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Investigating the potential role of T-reg Penk in the resolution of acute pain is a strength.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The overall experimental design is superficial and lacks sufficient rigor to draw any meaningful conclusions.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>1. The were no TAM controls. What is the evidence that TAM does not alter heat-sensitive receptors.</p>
<p>2. There are no controls demonstrating that recombination actually occurred. How do the authors know a single dose of TAM is sufficient?</p>
<p>3. Why was only heat sensitivity assessed? The behavioral tests are inadequate to derive any meaningful conclusions. Further, why wasn't the behavioral data plotted longitudinally</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The present study addresses the role of enkephalins, which are specifically expressed by regulatory T cells (Treg), in sensory perception in mice. The authors used a combination of transcriptomic databases available online to characterize the molecular signature of Treg. The proenkephalin gene Penk is among the most enriched transcripts, suggesting that Treg plays an analgesic role through the release of endogenous opioids. In addition, in silico analysis suggests that Penk is regulated by the TNFR superfamily; this being experimentally confirmed. Using flow cytometry analysis, the authors then show that Penk is mostly expressed in Treg of the skin and colon, compared to other immune cells. Finally, genetic conditional excision of Penk, selectively in Treg, results in heat hypersensitivity, as assessed by behavior analysis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The manuscript is clear and reveals a previously unappreciated role of enkephalins, as released by immune cells, in sensory perception. The rationale in this manuscript is easy to follow, and conclusions are well supported by data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The sensory deficit of Penk cKO appears to be quite limited compared to control littermates.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Aubert et al investigated the role of PENK in regulatory T cells. Through the mining of publicly available transcriptome data, the authors confirmed that PENK expression is selectively enriched in regulatory but not conventional T cells. Further data mining suggested that OX40, 4-1BB as well as BATF, can regulate PENK expression in Tregs. The authors generated fate-mapping mice to confirm selective PENK expression in Tregs and activated effector T cells in the colon and spleen. Interestingly, transgenic mice with conditional deletion of PENK in Tregs resulted in hypersensitivity to heat, which the authors attributed to heat hyperalgesia.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The generation of transgenic mice with conditional deletion of PENK in foxp3 and PENK fate-mapping is novel and can potentially yield significant findings. The identification of upstream signals that regulate PENK is interesting but unlikely to be the main reason why PENK is predominantly expressed in Tregs as both BATF and TNFR are expressed in effector T cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There is a lack of direct evidence and detailed analysis of Tregs in the control and transgenic mice to support the authors' hypothesis. PENK was previously reported to be expressed in skin Tregs and play a significant role in regulating skin homeostasis: this should be considered as an alternative mechanism that may explain the changed sensitivity to heat observed in the paper.</p>

<p>This study presents a valuable finding on a new role of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in sensory perception, which may have an impact on our understanding of somatosensory perception.

</disp-quote>
<p>Author response : By comparing panel A and C, it appears that heat-sensitivity in controls (blue dots) is slightly different before and after TMX administration, suggesting that heat-sensitive receptors are moderately altered by TMX per se.  However, heat sensitivity is increased by two fold in KO animals. Thus, a possible effect of TAM on heat receptors is not responsible for the heat hyperalgesia seen in KO, as shown in figure 4 and S3.</p>
