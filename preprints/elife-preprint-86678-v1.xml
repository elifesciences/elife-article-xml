<title>Abstract</title><p>The pathogenesis of antibodies in severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH) remains unknown. We sought to determine if there was antibody deposition in SAH livers and whether antibodies extracted from SAH livers were cross-reactive against both bacterial antigens and human proteins. We analyzed immunoglobulins (Ig) in explanted livers from SAH patients (n=45) undergoing liver transplantation and tissue from corresponding healthy donors (HD, n=10) and found massive deposition of IgG and IgA isotype antibodies associated with complement fragment C3d and C4d staining in ballooned hepatocytes in SAH livers. Ig extracted from SAH livers, but not patient serum exhibited hepatocyte killing efficacy in an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay. Employing human proteome arrays, we profiled the antibodies extracted from explanted SAH, alcoholic cirrhosis (AC), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HD livers and found that antibodies of IgG and IgA isotypes were highly accumulated in SAH and recognized a unique set of human proteins as autoantigens. The use of an <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 proteome array revealed the presence of unique anti-<italic>E. coli</italic> antibodies in SAH, AC or PBC livers. Further, both Ig and <italic>E. coli</italic> captured Ig from SAH livers recognized common autoantigens enriched in several cellular components including cytosol and cytoplasm (IgG and IgA), nucleus, mitochondrion and focal adhesion (IgG). Except IgM from PBC livers, no common autoantigen was recognized by Ig and <italic>E. coli</italic> captured Ig from AC, HBV, HCV, NASH or AIH suggesting no cross-reacting anti-<italic>E. coli</italic> autoantibodies. The presence of cross-reacting anti-bacterial IgG and IgA autoantibodies in the liver may participate in the pathogenesis of SAH.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH) is a distinct clinical syndrome that can develop suddenly and quickly lead to liver failure. It carries a particularly poor prognosis with a 28-day mortality ranging from 30-50%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, there is little to offer medically to such critically ill patients beyond supportive care with steroids, which improves survival in only a minority.</p>
<p>Studies have established connections between alcohol abuse, disruption of gut microbial homeostasis, and alcoholic liver disease (ALD). It has been speculated for over four decades that antibodies targeting intestinal microbes might play a role in pathogenesis of ALD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. For example, the presence of IgA and IgG on the cell membrane of hepatocytes was detected by direct immunofluorescence in patients with ALD, and the percentage of IgG-positive hepatocytes correlated with transaminase levels, independently of the histological findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Although a number of studies demonstrated liver IgA deposition in ALD in the 1980s, other reports concluded that IgA deposition in the liver was not specific for ALD but might reflect the reduced metabolism of the damaged livers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> or the clearance of excess IgA from the circulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. A recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> confirmed that human livers contained IgA-secreting cells originating from Peyer’s patches and directed against intestinal antigens. Interestingly, livers from mice with ethanol-induced injury contain increased numbers of IgA-secreting cells and have IgA deposits in sinusoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The primary aim of this study was to determine if there was antibody deposition in SAH livers and whether antibodies extracted from SAH livers exhibited hepatocyte killing efficacy. The second aim was to determine if antibodies deposited in the liver were cross-reactive antibodies against both bacterial antigens and human proteins and whether the cross-reactive antibodies were presented uniquely in SAH livers.</p>

<title>Immunoglobulins in ballooned hepatocytes in SAH patients</title>
<p>To determine whether antibodies deposit in SAH livers, we collected explanted liver tissues from SAH patients during liver transplantation at Johns Hopkins. Liver tissue sections with H&amp;E staining from SAH patients showed histologic features of SAH including macrovesicular steatosis, neutrophilic lobular inflammation, ballooning hepatocyte degeneration, Mallory- Denk bodies, and portal and pericellular fibrosis (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></italic></bold>). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining by using anti-human immunoglobulin antibodies demonstrated massive IgA and IgG deposition in ballooned hepatocytes in SAH livers, while none of the hepatocytes were stained with anti-human immunoglobulin antibodies in liver tissue sections from healthy donors except for positive staining in some hepatic sinusoid cells (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and C</italic></bold>). To further confirm the deposition of immunoglobulins in SAH livers, the presence of immunoglobulins in liver tissue homogenates form SAH (n=7) or healthy donors (n=7) was assessed by Western blot analysis and ELISA assays. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the levels of IgA and IgG were dramatically increased in all SAH livers as compared with the donor livers (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and E</italic></bold>). The IgM but not the IgE level was also significantly increased in SAH livers. The increase of IgA, IgG and IgM levels in SAH liver tissue homogenates was further confirmed by ELISA. IgA and IgG isotypes were major immunoglobulins in SAH livers (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></italic></bold>). Further analysis of IgG subclasses demonstrated that the IgG subclass levels - predominantly IgG1 – were significantly higher in SAH livers than that in healthy donors (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>—figure supplement 1</italic></bold>). On the basis of these findings, we performed IHC staining for human IgG in SAH livers from 45 patients with liver transplantation and 10 donor livers in a clinical pathology lab at Johns Hopkins in a double- blind manner. The IgG+ hepatocytes in scanned slides of stained tissues sections were analyzed by using HALO<sup>TM</sup> Image Analysis Software. Positive cells were reported as percentage stained surface area of total annotated area by digital analysis (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">figure supplement 1</xref></italic></bold>). Few IgG+ hepatocytes were identified in donor livers. In contrast, on average ∼40% of the hepatocytes (ranging from 4% to 80%) were IgG positive in the SAH livers (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref></italic></bold>). These findings demonstrated the deposition of immunoglobulin antibodies in ballooned hepatocytes in SAH livers.</p>

<title>Immunoglobulin deposition is associated with activation of complement in ballooned hepatocytes and immunoglobulin extracted from SAH livers exhibits hepatocyte killing efficacy <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>IgG, especially IgG1, plays a critical role in the classical completement activation pathway. To determine if immunoglobulin in ballooning hepatocytes induces activation of complement, C3d and C4d were analyzed in SAH livers. IHC staining showed the presence of both C3d and C4d in ballooning hepatocytes in SAH livers but not in the donor livers (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref></italic></bold>). Double staining for IgG and complement fragments C3d or C4d showed IgG co-stained with C3d or C4d in ballooning hepatocytes (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref></italic></bold>). These results indicated that IgG deposition in hepatocytes was associated with activation of complement. Furthermore, complement activation including the presence of C3d and C4d in SAH liver was confirmed by Western blot analysis (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref></italic></bold>). Finally, we asked whether antibodies (Ig) extracted from SAH livers exhibit hepatocyte killing efficacy in an ADCC assay. Compared to isotype control human Ig from healthy donors, no increased hepatocyte killing was observed when PBMCs (effector cells) from healthy donors were added into cultured human hepatocytes (target cells) in the presence of serum Ig from SAH patients. However, the hepatocyte killing efficacy was significantly increased when the same levels of Ig extracted from SAH livers were added into the hepatocytes/PBMCs co-culture system (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref></italic></bold>). These results demonstrated that immunoglobulin antibodies deposited in hepatocytes of SAH livers could induce activation of complement but more importantly, exhibited antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of hepatocytes. Therefore, deposition of immunoglobulin antibodies may contribute to the hepatocyte ballooning degeneration and necrotic damage in SAH.</p>

<p>To further define the Ig and C4d deposition on the membrane of ballooned hepatocytes, we performed multiplex analyses by co-staining liver tissue sections with multiple cell markers for hepatocytes (Heppar1), Kupffer cells (CD68), hepatic sinusoid endothelial cells (CD32) and hepatocyte membrane (β-catenin). Images of confocal microscopy showed the presence of both IgG and IgA in hepatic sinusoid endothelial cells but not hepatocytes in the donor livers, while the majority of ballooned hepatocytes co-stained with IgG and IgA in SAH livers (new <bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></italic></bold>). Further, co-staining with β-catenin detected heavy IgG and IgA deposition on hepatocyte membrane (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></italic></bold>). Interestingly, the IgG and IgA on hepatocyte membrane were co-stained with C4d as well (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<title>Human proteome array-identified autoantigens were recognized by immunoglobulins extracted from SAH livers</title>
<p>We used the human proteome microarray (HuProt), comprised of 21,240 individual purified human proteins, to perform antibody profiling assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Each liver specimen was treated to release tissue-deposited immunoglobulins (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></italic></bold>). After neutralization, the extracted antibodies from each liver sample were separately probed to the HuProt arrays, using isotype- specific secondary antibodies to obtain the IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE autoimmune signatures of the same liver sample (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></italic></bold>). Many positive human proteins were recognized by each of the four Ig isotypes in all five SAH samples. Each antibody profiling assay was performed in duplicate and only those reproducible signals were scored. A substantial fraction of autoantigens was shared by the antibodies in all five SAH livers, regardless of the Ig isotype (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>—figure supplement 2</italic></bold>). The total numbers of the shared autoantigens recognized by the IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE isotypes were 346, 319, 194, and 10 (Suppl. Figure S2), respectively, suggesting that the shared autoantibodies of the IgG and IgA isotypes were the most prevalent, while the counterparts of IgE isotype were the scarcest. With tissues of five donor livers, the numbers of positive human proteins were much lower (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>—figure supplement 3</italic></bold>).</p>

<p>Although 95 shared IgG autoantigens were identified by the donor liver samples, 79 (83.2 %) of them were also shared by the SAH livers (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></italic></bold>).

<p>We applied the above approach to a group of five livers explanted from patients with AC, AIH, PBC, NASH, HCV, and HBV-infection. SAH still exhibited the highest number of shared IgG autoantigens, while HBV showed highest numbers of shared IgA and IgE autoantigens, and PBC showed the highest number of shared IgM autoantigens (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">figure supplement 3</xref></italic></bold>). The numbers of shared IgG, IgA and IgM autoantigens were much higher in SAH livers (n=859) as compared with AC (n=349), HBV (n=735), other liver diseases (n&lt;428) or HD livers (n=448). Although the shared IgE autoantigens were the lowest in all seven liver diseases, each disease showed a distinct autoantibody signature (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">figure supplement 3</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>We compared the shared autoantigens recognized by SAH immunoglobulins to their counterparts from the other six liver diseases.

The third in this category was PBC in which 7 unique IgG autoantigens, 2 unique IgA autoantigens and 81 unique IgM autoantigens were identified.

A large number of unique autoantigens were recognized by Ig recovered from SAH livers (<bold><italic>table supplement 1</italic></bold>) indicating immunoglobulins (especially IgG) deposited to the SAH livers (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></italic></bold>) might play an important role in pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Immunoglobulins from SAH or AC livers recognize a unique set of bacterial antigens</title>
<p>Antibodies secreted into the gut mostly target bacteria and bacterial products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Immunoglobulins deposited in SAH livers might be from the gut, and these immunoglobulins may be antibodies targeting intestinal bacterial antigens. To test this, we employed a bacterial proteome array, comprised of 4,256 purified <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins encoded by a commensal strain K12, to do antibody profiling assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></italic></bold>). Using the same liver tissues and approach described above, we obtained the immune signatures of the 40 livers from 7 diseases and 5 HD in duplicate.</p>
<p>Many more bacterial than human antigens were recognized by immunoglobulins from alcoholic livers (AC and SAH) compared with healthy donor livers (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">figure supplement 5</xref></italic></bold>). The differences in shared bacterial antigens between alcoholic livers and healthy donor livers were more pronounced across all four Ig isotypes. For instance, only one bacterial antigen was commonly recognized by IgG antibodies from HD livers, but 435 shared bacterial antigens (about 10.2% of 4,256 purified <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins) were recognized by IgG antibodies in the five SAH livers (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></italic></bold>), and 466 shared bacterial antigens were recognized by IgG antibodies in the five AC livers (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">figure supplement 5</xref></italic></bold>). The numbers of the commonly shared bacterial antigens identified by the IgG antibodies extracted from the other five liver diseases were much lower, ranging from 7 to 63 (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">figure supplement 5</xref></italic></bold>). In addition, the numbers of IgA, IgM or IgE recognized bacterial antigens by liver tissue homogenates from SAH or AC were much higher than that in other liver diseases, except PBC showing a higher number of IgM antigens than AC (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">figure supplement 5</xref></italic></bold>). This observation suggests that chronic or acute alcoholic liver disease is associated with specific antibacterial antibody signatures.</p>
<p>A large number of shared bacterial antigens were recognized by liver tissue homogenates from each liver disease.

<p>Immunohistochemistry staining for CD20+ and CD138+ cells revealed that most of these cells were localized in the inflammatory areas of SAH livers, with none in HD livers (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref></italic></bold>). These results suggest that increased gut bacterial antigens in the SAH liver are associated with increased B cells and plasma cells.</p>
<p>Based on our findings that immunoglobulins extracted from SAH livers but not present in the serum exhibited hepatocyte killing efficacy (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref></italic></bold>), we suspected that immunoglobulin antibodies deposited in hepatocytes might not be produced systemically but by plasma cells infiltrating the liver. To determine if infiltration of B and plasma cells in the SAH liver is associated with expression of genes coding for certain immunoglobulins or fragments of immunoglobulins, we analyzed RNA seq data generated from SAH and healthy donor livers (GEO GSE143318). Specifically, we examined whether genes coding for immunoglobulins or fragments of specific immunoglobulins are upregulated in SAH liver samples relative to donor liver samples. We identified 175 genes coding for immunoglobulins or fragments of immunoglobulins and compared their expression levels between SAH and control samples.</p>
<p>Interestingly, 87 identified genes representing immunoglobulin fragments showed a robust and stable expression in SAH livers but not in healthy donor livers (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></italic></bold>).

<sec id="s3">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using explanted livers from SAH patients, we discovered massive antibody deposition in ballooned hepatocytes which is associated with complement activation. Antibodies from the SAH liver but not patient serum exhibited hepatocyte killing efficacy in vitro. Unique antibodies found in the SAH liver not only recognize bacterial (<italic>E. coli</italic>) antigens but also cross-react with a large number of human antigens. Our data support the hypothesis that anti-bacterial antibodies and/or plasma cells originating from gut translocate to the liver due to gut leakiness caused by excessive alcohol drinking and that these hepatic plasma cells produce antibodies which not only recognize intestinal bacterial antigens but also cross react with antigens of human hepatocytes (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></italic></bold>). Antibody deposition, with complement activation as well as immune cell activation, may result in acute liver failure due to antibody-mediated inflammation.</p>
<p>Leaky gut, also known as increased intestinal permeability, is a digestive condition in which bacteria and toxins are able to pass from the gastrointestinal tract to extraintestinal sites and facilitate an increased ingress of inflammatory cytokines and endotoxin to the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Unique anti-<italic>E. coli</italic> IgG or IgA antibodies are identified in alcoholic livers, but not other liver diseases (<bold><italic>table supplement 2</italic></bold>) suggesting the impact of excessive alcohol drinking on translocation of anti-bacterial antibodies to the liver. Interestingly, few anti-bacterial antibodies in AC livers cross-reacted with human antigens (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">figure supplement 4</xref></italic></bold>), while a large number of anti- bacterial antibodies in SAH livers also recognized human antigens. The differing gut microbiota between actively drinking patients with cirrhosis and those with alcoholic hepatitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> supports the notion that alcohol-induced changes of gut microbiota composition may contribute to the development of anti-bacterial antibodies that cross-reacted with human antigens. SAH is an acute-on-chronic liver failure. Cross-reacting anti-bacterial autoantibodies translocated to the liver may determine the progress from chronic liver disease toward acute hepatitis.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, we found a significant number of unique IgA autoantibodies in HBV and unique IgG autoantibodies in HCV livers (<bold><italic>table supplement 1</italic></bold>) suggesting these IgA or IgG autoantibodies deposited in the liver might be derived from systemic autoimmune process which is ongoing in HBV or HCV infected patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Previous studies have clearly established the co-occurrence of certain autoantibodies in patients with chronic HBV or HCV infection and the autoantibody positivity was common in HBV and HCV patients. A strong association between increasing serum IgA level and disease progressing in patients with chronic HBV infection has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Similarly, serum IgG was increased in patients with chronic hepatitis C with respect to both alcoholics and healthy controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. No unique anti-<italic>E. coli</italic> protein IgA or IgG antibody was identified in HBV or HCV livers, indicating autoantibody production was related to the virus rather than bacterial infection.</p>
<p>The presence of cross-reacting IgM antibodies against <italic>E. coli</italic> and human antigens in the PBC livers is worth noting. Current data suggest that PBC is an autoimmune disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and an infectious etiology as trigger for development of PBC has been postulated. Antibodies reacting against the mitochondrial human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex which are the serologic hallmark of PBC cross react with the <italic>E. coli</italic> pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, implicating <italic>E. coli</italic> infection in the pathogenesis of PBC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Interestingly, patients with PBC had a much higher number of inducible IgM-producing B-cells in peripheral blood and each B-cell produced a greater quantity of IgM protein compared with control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. A large number of unique human and <italic>E. coli</italic> antigens were recognized specifically by IgM from the PBC livers, supporting the theory of bacterial infection-related IgM production in pathogenesis of PBC.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that SAH may be an antibody-mediated disease due to intrahepatic etiology. Unlike antibody mediated autoimmune disease where systemic B cells produce autoantibodies against self-antigens and unlike the fact that autoimmune diseases can be transferred from an affected patient to a normal individual by the transfer of patient-derived serum (or immunoglobulins), serum from SAH patients did not show hepatocyte killing efficacy in vitro. Importantly, no antibody-mediated rejection was observed in SAH patients following liver transplantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. It is perhaps more likely that gut-derived plasma cells were resident in SAH livers, and these plasma cells produce anti-bacteria antibodies which strongly cross-react with hepatocyte antigens. The diseased liver absorbs these gut-derived and locally produced antibodies without releasing them to the circulation. With the functional deposition of antibodies in the SAH liver (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></italic></bold>), activation of complement through the classical pathway which has been reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> leads to ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes which is the predominant mode of injury in alcoholic hepatitis and untreatable inflammation. When antibody is deposited, it may also impair a number of important biological process in hepatocytes (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></italic></bold>). This pathophysiology implies severe damage from short-lived leaky gut due to a transient interval of high alcohol intake with ongoing residual continued damage due to the antibody production that continues only within the liver to be replaced. Therefore, it is reassuring that the new transplanted liver will not be damaged because the pathogenesis, involving the consequences of leaky gut pathology, will end quickly as long as the recipient remains abstinent, by which the new liver is not threatened by the SAH process.</p>
<p>The main limitations of the present study are the limited sample size, the lack of whole gut bacterial-proteome microarrays and the lack of animal models of severe alcoholic hepatitis. Nevertheless, identifying the presence of anti-bacterial autoantibodies in SAH livers provides a new insight into pathogenesis of SAH. Future studies utilizing needle biopsy samples from mild and moderate alcoholic hepatitis patients could assess infiltration of B and plasma cells and a likely correlation between antibody deposition and severity of hepatitis. For example, infiltration of plasma cells and antibody deposition may predict the progression toward SAH.</p>
<p>This may be a new therapeutic strategy in alcoholic hepatitis patients. First, preventing gut leakiness caused by alcohol drinking may prevent SAH. Second, eliminating antibody producing B/plasma cells in the liver by using anti-CD20 may serve. Finally, a trial using complement inhibitors such as Eculizumab may be worth considering.</p>

After a five-minute spin down with 20,000 g at 4°C, the supernatants were transferred to new 15ml tubes and neutralized with 1M Tris-base buffer to pH 7.0 immediately. Then, the antibody enrichment was performed using Protein L coupled magnetic beads (Thermofisher, MA) according to the manual. The antibodies extracted from 4.8-gram liver tissue pieces were subjected to the protein microarray assays using human proteome microarray HuProt<sup>®</sup> array and <italic>E. coli</italic> strain K-12 bacterial proteome microarray respectively to screen their corresponding antigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Data analysis including the criteria for positive hits was performed as before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Identification of cross-reactive antibodies against human and bacterial proteins</title>
<p>The total lysates of <italic>E. coli</italic> were immobilized on the magnetic beads using the kit of Pierce NHS- Activated Magnetic Beads according to the product manual (ThermoFisher, MA). Then, these E. coli protein magnetic beads were incubated with the extracted total autoantibodies from liver samples to capture the active antibodies. After eluting with Glycine pH 2.0, the eluted antibodies were neutralized with 1 M tris-base buffer to pH 7.0 immediately. Finally, these antibodies were subjected to the human proteome microarray.</p>

<title>RNA-sequencing and data processing</title>
<p>The total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy© kit. After the RNA quality was assessed by capillary electrophoresis (bioanalyzer), cDNA libraries were prepared using TruSeq© RNA Library Prep Kit and sequenced with an Illumina NextSeq500. Base-calling and fastq conversion was performed using RTA (2.4.11) and Bcl2fastq (2.18.0.12), respectively. Raw sequencing files were uploaded to the NIH GEO database.</p>
<p>Adaptor sequences were trimmed from the raw reads using Cutadapt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Trimmed reads were then mapped to reference genome GRCh38 using STAR aligner with default parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The number of counts per gene was estimated using the “quantMode” command in STAR. Batch effect was corrected using Combat seq. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were then identified using DESeq2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Genes with adjusted <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 and log2 fold change &gt; 1 were chosen as DEGs.</p>

<caption><p>Venn diagram analysis of autoantigens recognized by antibodies extracted from the five SAH liver tissues. After individual elution of antibodies from the five SAH liver tissues (i.e., SAH1-5), they were individually profiled on the HuProt arrays. The identified autoantigens were grouped on the basis of anti-IgG, -IgA, -IgM, and -IgE isotypes, and the shared and unique autoantigens were analyzed using the Venn diagram analysis. As illustrated in each isotype panel, the shared autoantigens recognized by the anti-IgG, -IgA, -IgM, and -IgE antibodies among the five SAH samples are 346, 319, 194, and 10, respectively.</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study tested the hypothesis that liver-derived but not serum-derived antibodies that are cross-reactive to E.coli and to host proteins can play a role in the hepatic damage found in severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH). Using a <bold>solid</bold> methodology that includes state-of-the-art microscopy, proteome arrays, and gene ontology assays, it provides strong evidence that liver-derived IgG and IgA with cytotoxic properties and reactivity to both gut-derived E.coli and autoantigens accumulated in hepatocytes of SAH patients but not of healthy controls. The study would benefit from a broader analysis of gut microbiota proteome and further characterization of B cells infiltrating the liver tissue including their numbers/field and their origin (infiltrating versus resident cells). The work opens new avenues of understanding for the pathogenesis of severe alcoholic hepatitis and is of great interest to researchers and clinicians in the field.</p>

<p>Sun and colleagues investigated the cross-reactive antibodies between E.Coli and the host in severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH). The study found that IgA and IgG were deposited in the liver of SAH patients. Complements C3d and C4d were also deposited in the SAH patient's liver. Moreover, they found that the Ig accumulated in the SAH liver, but not in the SAH serum, induced hepatocyte killing, suggesting that liver Ig is important. Then, they found that these Ig can recognize both human and E. Coli antigens. Very interestingly, SAH-derived Ig shows cross-reactivity to both human and E. Coli antigens, suggesting E, Coli-primed Ig in SAH may damage hepatocytes through host antigen recognition. These Ig are not observed in alcoholic cirrhosis patients. The liver RNA-seq data suggested that Ig was also produced in the liver, not only gut-derived Ig. This is a very interesting study showing the novel mechanism of SAH mediated by the Ig with the cross-reactivity with bacteria and host antigens, which is not observed in AC patients. Overall, the study design is reasonable and the data are consistent to support their central hypothesis. There are a few comments.</p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>
1. Figures 1 and 2 show Ig deposition in the liver (it seems on hepatocytes). Not only Ig reaction to the specific antigen but also non-specific Fc receptor-mediated binding to hepatocytes could be contributed.</p>
<p>
2. Similarly, in Figure 2G Ig-mediated hepatocyte killing, Fc receptor-mediated hepatocyte killing may be involved.</p>
<p>
3. The study examined the possibility of liver resident B cell and plasma cell-mediated Ig. As the authors mentioned in the discussion, B cells may be translocated from the intestine to the liver. Or the resident B cells (not from the gut) are also involved.</p>

<p>In this paper, Ahmadi et al demonstrated that antibodies produced locally in the liver by infiltrating B cells can enhance liver damage caused by fat accumulation. The main finding is that human samples extracted from severe alcoholic hepatitis showed antibody accumulation that may be related to an enhanced immune response to self-antigens, which could ultimately fuel liver damage - which was already present due to alcohol consumption. Their data are corroborated by arrays and gene ontology assays, and I strongly believe that these data could add to the future options we have to treat patients.</p>

<p>Sun and colleagues investigated the cross-reactive antibodies between E. coli and the host in severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH). The study found that IgA and IgG were deposited in the liver of SAH patients. Complements C3d and C4d were also deposited in the SAH patient's liver. Moreover, they found that the Ig accumulated in the SAH liver, but not in the SAH serum, induced hepatocyte killing, suggesting that liver Ig is important. Then, they found that these Ig can recognize both human and E. coli antigens. Very interestingly, SAH-derived Ig shows cross-reactivity to both human and E. coli antigens, suggesting E. coli-primed Ig in SAH may damage hepatocytes through host antigen recognition. These Ig are not observed in alcoholic cirrhosis patients. The liver RNA-seq data suggested that Ig was also produced in the liver, not only gut-derived Ig. This is a very interesting study showing the novel mechanism of SAH mediated by the Ig with the cross-reactivity with bacteria and host antigens, which is not observed in AC patients. Overall, the study design is reasonable and the data are consistent to support their central hypothesis. There are a few comments.</p>

<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>1. Figures 1 and 2 show Ig deposition in the liver (it seems on hepatocytes). Not only Ig reaction to the specific antigen but also non-specific Fc receptor-mediated binding to hepatocytes could have contributed.</p>
<p>1. Similarly, in Figure 2G Ig-mediated hepatocyte killing, Fc receptor-mediated hepatocyte killing may be involved.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Anti-IgG antibody (ab200699) recognizes a protein of 75 kDa, identified as gamma heavy chain of human immunoglobulins. It is possible that non-specific Fc receptor-mediated binding to hepatocytes in the SAH liver can also be recognized by this anti-IgG antibody staining.</p>
<p>However, no IgG or IgA deposition in the healthy donor livers was identified by anti-IgG or IgA staining. These results suggest that there was no antigen specific or Fc receptor-mediated binding to healthy hepatocytes.</p>
<p>In the ADCC assay, hepatocytes isolated from healthy donor livers were used as the target cells. Immune cell (NK) mediated ADCC is mainly triggered by IgG (binding to antigens of hepatocytes) through the interaction between IgG Fc fragment and Fc-receptors (FcγRs) of NK cells. If IgG deposition in the SAH liver were mainly due to non-specific Fc receptor-mediated binding to hepatocytes, we would expect IgG binding to FcγRs of hepatocytes and no activation of NK cells. Ig-mediated hepatocyte killing (Figure 2G) indicates the Ig (from SAH liver) reaction to the specific antigens.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The study examined the possibility of liver resident B cell and plasma cell-mediated Ig. As the authors mentioned in the discussion, B cells may be translocated from the intestine to the liver. Or the resident B cells (not from the gut) are also involved.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer at this point. The resident B cells may be also involved in the Ig production.</p>
