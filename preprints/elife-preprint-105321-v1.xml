<title>Abstract</title><p>Sperm motility is crucial for male reproduction and relies on the structural integrity of the sperm axoneme, which has a “9+2” microtubule configuration. This structure includes nine outer microtubule doublets that house various macromolecular complexes. The nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) forms a crossbridge between the outer microtubule doublets, stabilizing them and facilitates sperm tail bending. Our investigation of ANKRD5, which is highly expressed in the sperm axoneme, reveals its interaction with TCTE1 and DRC4/GAS8, both key components of the N-DRC. The components of the N-DRC are often vital for sperm motility. ANKRD5<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited reduced sperm motility and male infertility; however transmission electron microscopy and cryoelectron tomography showed no significant alterations in microtubule doublets. Moreover, ANKRD5 deficiency did not affect ATP levels, and its interactions with TCTE1 and DRC4/GAS8 were found to be independent of calcium regulation. These findings establish that ANKRD5 is critical for maintaining axoneme stability, which is important for sperm motility.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>Male infertility affects 8%-12% of men globally, with defects in sperm motility accounting for 40%-50% of these cases. The axoneme, serving as the sperm’s motor apparatus, features a 9+2 microtubule arrangement, with the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) providing essential structural support between outer microtubule doublets. Understanding the synergistic relationship between the N-DRC’s structure and its protein composition is crucial for advancing male reproductive biology. In this study, we identify the protein ANKRD5 as a component of the axoneme that can interact with N-DRC components, which is crucial for sperm motility. This discovery enhances our understanding of sperm motility mechanisms and suggests potential targets for male contraceptive development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The interaction between sperm and egg, leading to embryo formation, is fundamental for life reproduction and species continuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Male infertility impacts 8%-12% of the global male population, with sperm motility defects contributing to 40%-50% of these cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) Fertilization relies on successful spermatogenesis and normal sperm motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), which occurs in the testes. Mammalian sperm gain motility and fertilization capabilities when they pass through the epididymis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The maturation of sperm in the epididymis is necessary for the production of fertile sperm. Asthenospermia caused by poor sperm motility is the main symptom of clinical infertility, yet its precise pathogenesis remains largely unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Individuals with poorly motile or immobile sperm are typically infertile unless advanced assisted reproductive techniques, such as gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), are employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). However, these common assisted reproductive technologies may pass genetic defects to offspring. A more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying sperm motility could lead to more effective clinical interventions for hypofertility caused by asthenospermia. Rather than bypassing the issue with ICSI, infertility from poor sperm motility could potentially be treated or even cured through stimulation of specific signaling pathways or gene therapy.</p>
<p>Sperm motility is driven by flagellar beating. The flagellum consists of three main parts: the midpiece, principal piece, and endpiece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). These three parts share a common central axoneme composed of approximately 250 proteins that are major components of the flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). The axoneme exhibits a 9+2 microtubule doublet structure, with the N-DRC forming cross-bridges between the outer microtubule doublets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Both the structure and molecular composition of N-DRC are evolutionarily conserved and play a central role in regulating sperm motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). The N-DRC is a large, complex structure with a molecular weight of approximately 1.5 MDa and can be divided into two regions: the linker and the base plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). The N-DRC is a large, complex structure with a molecular weight of approximately 1.5 MDa and can be divided into two regions: the linker and the base plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Additionally, the N-DRC interacts with the outer dynein arms (ODA) via outer-inner dynein (OID) linkers, functioning as a regulatory component for both ODA and inner dynein arms (IDA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>).</p>
<p>It was previously believed that N-DRC comprised 11 protein components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). However, integrated modeling combined with in situ cross-linking mass spectrometry revealed the existence of CCDC153 (DRC12), which is cross-linked with DRC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). In situ cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET) has further advanced understanding of the N-DRC architecture in Chlamydomonas, demonstrating that DRC1, DRC2/CCDC65, and DRC4/GAS8 constitute its core framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Additionally, proteins DRC3/5/6/7/8/11 associate with this framework and engage with other axonemal complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Biochemical experiments corroborate these findings and support this model. The integrity of the N-DRC structure is crucial for flagellar movements, and mutations of N-DRC subunits may lead to defects in flagellar movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). The N-DRC functions between the doublet microtubules (DMTs) to convert sliding into axonemal bending motion by restricting the relative sliding of outer microtubule doublets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Additionally, the formation of the N-DRC necessitates the coordination among various subunits. Mutations in three specific subunits—DRC1, DRC2/CCDC65, and DRC4/GAS8—have been previously associated with human ciliary motility disorders leading to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>).

Our findings indicate that ANKRD5 (Ankyrin repeat domain 5, ANKRD5, ANK5, ANKEF1) could interact with N-DRC structure, serving as an auxiliary element to facilitate collaboration among DRC members. The absence of ANKRD5 results in diminished sperm motility and subsequent male infertility.</p>

<p>The auxiliary factors required for the N-DRC structure to function effectively have not been fully elucidated. As an important structural component of the axoneme, the functionality of the N-DRC relies on protein interactions. The ANK domain is one of the crucial domains for protein interactions. Based on an analysis of the NCBI database and relevant single-cell sequencing data, <italic>Ankrd5</italic> expression is predominantly localized to the male reproductive system, with a relatively high expression specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). However, the impact of ANKRD5 on the functionality of the N-DRC remains unclear. In mice, ANKRD5 is a protein comprising 775 amino acids with a molecular weight of 86.9 kDa. Comparative analysis of the ANKRD5 protein sequence across various species revealed that it is relatively conserved (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). Sequence alignment using Clustal Omega demonstrated an 86% similarity between ANKRD5 sequences in mice and humans (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>), suggesting that studying ANKRD5 in mice has significant translational relevance for human applications. We further confirmed this tissue-specific expression in mice through qPCR, demonstrating that <italic>Ankrd5</italic> was highly expressed in the testes, with no detectable levels in the brain, liver, spleen, kidney, ovary, intestine, or stomach (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Further investigation into the temporal expression of <italic>Ankrd5</italic> in mouse testes indicated that its expression begins on postnatal day 21 and reaches peak levels by postnatal day 35 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), which coincides with the emergence of mature sperm.</p>

<p>To explore the biological function of <italic>Ankrd5</italic> in vivo, we generated an <italic>Ankrd5</italic> knockout mouse line (<italic>Ankrd5<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) on a C57BL/6J background by targeting exons 4 and 7 using CRISPR/Cas9. The knockout was confirmed at the gene level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Fertility tests showed that <italic>Ankrd5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> males were able to mate with wild-type females but did not produce any offspring (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These results indicated that <italic>Ankrd5</italic> is essential for male fertility. Since there were no significant differences in litter size (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and spermatogenesis between WT and het male mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>), we used het as the experimental control.

These results indicated that the infertility phenotype in <italic>Ankrd5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice was not a result of defective spermatogenesis.</p>

<title>Due to decreased sperm motility, <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm were unable to penetrate the zona pellucida</title>
<p>To investigate the cause of infertility in <italic>Ankrd5</italic> knockout mice, we performed in vitro fertilization (IVF) experiments. control sperm successfully fertilized both cumulus-intact eggs and cumulus-free eggs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm failed to fertilize the cumulus-intact eggs despite normal binding to the zona pellucida (ZP) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). However, <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm were able to fertilize zona pellucida-free eggs and develop to blastocyst (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). These results indicate that the infertility observed in <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm is primarily due to the sperm’s inability to penetrate the zona pellucida. Sperm penetration through the cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) is influenced by two key factors: the acrosome reaction and sperm motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Notably, <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm exhibit a normal acrosome reaction when stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>), suggesting that the reproductive defects are not attributable to an acrosome reaction deficiency.</p>

<p>Sperm motility is critical for penetrating the cumulus oophorus and zona pellucida, which are softened by the acrosome reaction. Computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) revealed significant reductions in curvilinear velocity (VCL), average path velocity (VAP), and straight line velocity (VSL) in <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm compared to controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Additionally, forward progression parameters such as straightness (STR) and linearity (LIN) were also diminished (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Sperm were categorized into four motility grades: rapid, medium, slow, and static. Significant differences were observed in the distribution of rapid, slow, and static grades, while no significant difference was noted in the medium grade (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The proportions of total and progressive motility decreased with the loss of <italic>Ankrd5</italic> function (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Furthermore, the tracking of sperm trajectories over time revealed that <italic>Ankr5<sup>-</sup></italic> null sperm exhibited lower motility compared to controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Moreover, sperm migration experiments revealed a significantly lower presence of <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm in the female uterus and oviducts six hours after mating (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E-G</xref>), further supporting the observed motility defects.

<title>ANKRD5 is primarily localized in the sperm axoneme</title>
<p>To explore the biological function of ANKRD5, we generated <italic>Ankrd5-FLAG</italic> mice by inserting a FLAG tag at the C-terminus using homologous recombination (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>).

The results revealed that the epididymis exhibited a normal structure, and the reproductive capabilities of <italic>Ankrd5-FLAG</italic> mice were intact, indicating that FLAG insertion did not impair the biological function of ANKRD5. Western blot analysis was employed to examine ANKRD5 protein expression across multiple organs and tissues, including liver, lung, kidney, heart, testis, spleen, brain, small intestine, skin, and sperm. The data revealed that ANKRD5 was predominantly expressed in mouse sperm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), with lower expression levels in the testis. To further investigate ANKRD5 localization within sperm, we subjected sperm to repeated freeze-thaw cycles followed by density gradient centrifugation to separate the head and tail.

<p>The sperm tail comprises three sections: midpiece, principal piece, and end piece. Immunofluorescence staining of adult mouse sperm revealed that ANKRD5 was primarily localized in the midpiece (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). As reported in previous studies, proteins from different regions of the sperm tail can be extracted with varying lysate intensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). To determine the precise localization of ANKRD5, we used specific markers, including BASIGIN, Acetylated Tubulin, and AKAP4, representing the Triton X-100 soluble, SDS soluble, and SDS resistant fractions, respectively. These three fractions contain, respectively, membrane-associated and cytosolic proteins, axonemal proteins, as well as fibrous sheath and outer dense fiber proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). The results indicated that ANKRD5 was primarily located in the SDS soluble fraction, suggesting its association with the sperm axoneme (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). These findings suggest that the infertility associated with the reduced motility in <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm may be linked to impaired axoneme function in the sperm tail.</p>

<title>ANKRD5 interacts with axoneme N-DRC components</title>
<p>In order to explore the function of ANKRD5 in the axoneme, we explored the interactome of ANKRD5 using LC-MS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). We identified the presence of several N-DRC components, including TCTE1, DRC3/LRRC48, DRC7/CCDC135, and DRC4/GAS8, with TCTE1 ranking highly in the mass spectrum (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). TEM analysis indicates that <italic>Tcte1</italic> null sperm maintain a normal DMT structure yet exhibit reduced motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), a phenotype similarly observed in ANKRD5 knockout sperm. ANKRD5 was identified in the TCTE1 mass spectrum with a high ranking, but their interaction had not been experimentally validated before our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We performed immunoprecipitation in 293T cells and validated protein interactions with 11 DRC components, except for DRC6, which failed to express (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3 A</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Our results confirmed that ANKRD5 interacts with TCTE1 and DRC4/GAS8, but no interaction with other DRC components (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3 A</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). ANKRD5 consists of two ANK domains and one EF-hand domain. The ANK domain is classic mediator of protein interactions, and the EF-hand domain typically functions as a calcium sensor; however, approximately one-third of EF-hand domains lack calcium-binding capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Through protein truncation experiments, we found that the ANK2 domain mediates the interaction between ANKRD5 and TCTE1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). But, the interaction between ANKRD5 and DRC4/GAS8 requires the presence of both the ANK1 and ANK2 domains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). The EF-Hand domain is not necessary for the interaction between ANKRD5 and TCTE1 or DRC4/GAS8. Western blot results indicated that calcium ions do not affect the interaction between ANKRD5 and DRC4/GAS8 or TCTE1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>).</p>

<p>As is well known, energy metabolism is crucial for sperm motility. The TCTE1 null sperm showed a decrease in ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). The loss of ANKRD5 does not change ATP levels in the sperm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). This result indicates that ANKRD5 can interact with N-DRC components without impacting energy metabolism. The mitochondrial sheath is located in the midpiece of sperm, where mitochondria play a key role in energy production and serve as a significant source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). A balanced level of ROS is crucial for several essential sperm functions, including motility, capacitation, the acrosome reaction, fertilization, and hyperactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) is correlated with sperm motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Decreased MMP (depolarization) indicates mitochondrial dysfunction, while increased MMP (hyperpolarization) leads to excess ROS. MMP in spermatozoa was assessed using TMRM staining and fluorescence imaging (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4 A</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). ROS levels were measured using DCFH-DA staining, followed by fluorescence imaging (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4 C</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). We found no significant differences between <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm and control. Thus, ANKRD5 deficiency did not significantly affect sperm ATP levels and mitochondrial function.</p>

<title>The knockout of <italic>Ankrd5</italic> does not affect the overall structure of DMT</title>
<p>The absence of certain DRC components has been shown to alter the expression of other N-DRC proteins. For instance, DRC2/3/4 expression is reduced in DRC1 mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), while DRC1/3/5/11 expression is downregulated in Chlamydomonas DRC2 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). To assess the impact of ANKRD5 deletion on sperm protein composition, we conducted quantitative proteomics using 4D-SmartDIA. Mass spectrometry identified 4,880 quantifiable proteins, of which 126 were differentially expressed (1.5 fold change), including 10 upregulated and 116 downregulated proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). DRC components were not included in the differentially expressed proteins list. In order to better understand the expression changes of these key proteins, the intensity data of DRC components were extracted and normalized, then performed the T-test. Due to technical limitations, DRC6 and DRC12 were not detected. However, the analysis revealed a significant difference in DRC11(IQCA1). As no effective commercial antibody was available, DRC11 was not tested using Western blottign (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6C</xref>). TCTE1 deficiency has been associated with abnormalities in glycolysis, leading to decreased ATP levels and reduced sperm motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We conducted a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) focusing on this term, but the results were not significant, which is consistent with our ATP measurement results (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">E</xref>).</p>
<p>The sperm axoneme follows a 9+2 structural arrangement, composed of nine outer microtubule doublets surrounding two central microtubules. Structural defects in this 9+2 arrangement may impair motility, but transmission electron microscopy of the sperm flagellum did not reveal any structural defects in <italic>Ankrd5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). To further explore the effects of <italic>Ankrd5</italic> knockout on each component of mouse sperm axoneme, we collected about 160 tilt series of <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm axoneme using cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). Data pre-processing and reconstruction were performed by Warp and AreTOMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>). In the original tomograms obtained, we found that the overall “9+2” structure of sperm axonemes remained intact regardless of side view or top view, and there was no significant difference from that of WT mouse sperm axonemes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), which was similar to TEM results. Among the 89 tomograms with good quality, we carried out manual particle selection of DMT fiber and applied RELION, M, and other software to carry out sub-tomogram average analysis (STA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). The 8nm-repeats DMT structure of <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm axoneme with a resolution of 24 Å was obtained (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>), and the overall structure of its A and B tubes was complete (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). We compared the DMT density map of <italic>Ankrd5</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse sperm with that of WT mouse sperm (EMD-35210/35211) and found that there was no significant difference between them, except for some difference in density between A05 of tube A and B09 and B10 of tube B (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). This may be due to the difference between the density maps of 8nm-repeats DMT and 16nm-repeats DMT itself. The known 16nm-repeats mouse sperm DMT model was fitted into two density maps, and all 16nm-repeats MIPs including tubulins could be well fitted. We must emphasize that although there appears to be no significant difference on overall DMT structure between the wild-type and <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm, we observed notable sample heterogeneity when manually selecting particles for <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm. This resulted in a significantly reduced quantity of particles with the 96 nm periodicity, which is distinctly different from the WT results. We were able to detect the N-DRC structure in WT sperm, but we failed to find the density of N-DRC adjacent to RS3 in <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>During natural fertilization, males could ejaculate millions of sperm, but most are expelled by contractions in the female reproductive tract. Freshly ejaculate sperm exhibit activate movements, and only a few hundred activated sperm reach the isthmus of the fallopian tube, where they attach to the mucosal epithelium to form a sperm reservoir, remaining dormant until ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Then, upon release from the reservoir, sperm transition to a hyperactivated state to approach the egg. Activation sperm exhibit symmetrical flagellar oscillations and swim along near-linear trajectories, whereas hyperactivated sperm display high-amplitude, asymmetrical flagellar oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Activation is the prerequisite for hyperactivation. The outer layer of the COC is rich in hyaluronic acid, which gives it highly viscoelastic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Acrosome reaction releases hyaluronidase, which softens the cumulus cell layer and facilitate sperm-egg interaction. Sperm motility plays an important role in penetrate the COC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). It has been reported that vole sperm can penetrate the zona pellucida of mice and hamsters without acrosome reaction, underscoring the importance of mechanical forces in sperm penetration of the COC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>).</p>
<p>N-DRC is critical for sperm motility. The auxiliary factors required for the N-DRC structure to function effectively have not been fully elucidated. As an important structural component of the axoneme, the functionality of the N-DRC relies on protein interactions. ANKRD5 is evolutionarily conserved and features a helix-turn-helix repeat structure known as the ANK domain, which is a common motif involved in protein-protein interactions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Given the high expression of ANKRD5 in the testes and its presence in the LC-MS results of TCTE1, we are concerned about the potential synergistic role of ANKRD5 in the function of N-DRC. Previous studies have found that ANKRD5 plays a critical role in cell adhesion and protrusion, contributing to the normal formation of the Xenopus gastrula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Ankrd5</italic> has been identified as differentially expressed in normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Ankrd5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> male mice exhibit normal spermatogenesis and are able to mate and produce mating plugs, but failed to produce offspring. Histological and morphological of the <italic>Ankrd5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> appeared normal. The IVF results found that <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm could penetrate cumulus cells, but they could not fertilize cumulus-intact eggs, even after granulosa cell were removed. Interestingly, zona pellucida free eggs were successfully fertilized, and the resulting embryos developed normally to the blastocyst stage. Our findings indicate that the absence of ANKRD5 results in male infertility due to the inability of <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida during fertilization. Acrosome reaction and sperm motility is important for sperm to penetrate the ZP. We used A23187 to induce the acrosome reaction and found that <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm exhibited normal acrosome reaction. However, CASA revealed reduced motility in <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm, suggesting that their inability to penetrate the zona pellucida is linked to abnormal motility rather than defective acrosome function. Our sperm migration results support this conclusion.</p>
<p>The sperm axoneme, a 9+2 motor apparatus, is critical for motility. Dynein arms on A-tubules hydrolyze ATP to “walk” along adjacent B-tubules, driving microtubule sliding. The N-DRC converts this sliding into flagellar bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Mass spectrometry identified several N-DRC members, including DRC5/TCTE1, DRC3/LRRC48, DRC7/CCDC135, and DRC4/GAS8. ANKRD5 knockout sperm shows a phenotype similar to TCTE1 knockout sperm, suggesting ANKRD5 may have a similar role to TCTE1. <italic>Drc3/Lrrk48</italic> knockout mice can grow up to adult and are capable of mating, but they are unable to produce offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). In chlamydomonas, <italic>Drc3/Lrrc48</italic> mutations cause flagellar motility defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). <italic>Drc7/Ccdc135</italic> knockout mice exhibit short-tailed sperm, leading to male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), while DRC4/GAS8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>) is associated with PCD in humans. Immunoprecipitation validated the mass spectrometry results, and GSEA analysis along with ATP measurements confirmed that ANKRD5 deficiency does not impact energy metabolism. Thus, ANKRD5 likely acts as a structural component aiding N-DRC function without involvement in metabolism.</p>
<p>TEM analysis showed no significant difference in the axoneme structure between wild-type and <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm, which may be due to the imaging technique’s low resolution. We therefore aim to use Cryo-ET to compare their electron density. Tilt series of <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm axonemes were collected by cryo-focused ion beam and cryo-electron tomography, and 160 tomograms were obtained by data pre-processing and reconstruction. However, in the process of manual selection of DMT fibers, we found that they were not as smooth as WT particles. This suggests that the knockout of <italic>Ankrd5</italic> may affect the structural stability of the axoneme, although no significant difference was found in tomograms. We obtained the 8nm-repeats DMT <italic>in situ</italic> structure of 24 Å <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm axonemes by sub-tomogram averaging. On the whole, although there is no obvious difference from the DMT density map of WT, there is a little deformation of tubulin, which does not indicate that DMT is damaged. When classifying 96nm-repeats DMT, we obtained a density similar to RS3, indicating that axoneme components such as DMT, CPC, and RS were not significantly affected, but we failed to obtain the corresponding density of N-DRC, which may be the average result of axoneme motility disturbance caused by decreased sperm motility. It is not clear if N-DRC was damaged.</p>
<p>Asthenospermia, characterized by reduced sperm motility, is a major cause of clinical infertility, yet its precise pathogenesis remains unclear. Investigating the infertility observed in <italic>Ankrd5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice may provide insights into the underlying causes of asthenospermia. While current birth control pills primarily target women, they can have adverse side effects such as dizziness, chest pain, decreased libido, and vision impairment. As a result, the development of a male contraceptive has become an urgent priority. Currently, no oral contraceptive is available for men, but our study offers new perspectives for male contraceptive research. ANKRD5 may represent a promising target for the development of such contraceptives.</p>

<title>Identification of interacting proteome by LC-MS</title>
<p>Protein bands were carefully excised from the polyacrylamide gel using a razor blade, minimizing the inclusion of excess blank gel. The excised gel bands were further trimmed into smaller pieces and transferred into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for processing. The gel pieces were destained three times using 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (NH₄HCO₃) in 50% methanol, with each destaining step lasting 10 minutes. Subsequently, the gel fragments were washed three times with a solution of 10% acetic acid in 50% methanol, with each wash lasting 1 hour. Afterward, the gel pieces were rinsed twice with water for 20 minutes each time to ensure removal of residual reagents. The gel pieces were then transferred into 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. To dehydrate the gel fragments, 0.5 mL of 100% acetonitrile (ACN) was added, and the tubes were gently inverted several times until the gel pieces turned opaque white. The ACN was subsequently removed, and the gel pieces were dried using a SpeedVac system for 20–30 minutes under mild heating conditions. For protein digestion, the gel pieces were rehydrated with 5–20 μL of trypsin solution (10 ng/Μl) in 50 mM NH₄HCO₃, pH 8.0). The samples were then incubated at 37 °C overnight to allow for proteolysis. Following digestion, the gel pieces were soaked in 25–50 μL of 50% ACN with 5% formic acid (FA) for 30–60 minutes with gentle agitation, taking care not to vortex the samples. The resulting supernatant was transferred to a fresh 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.

Aligned tilt series were visually inspected in IMOD and any low-quality frames (such as those blocked by the sample stage or grid bars, containing obvious crystalline ice or showing obvious jumps) were removed to create new sets of tilt series in Warp. The new tilt series underwent a second round of AreTOMO alignment. Then, low-quality frames were removed again using the same criteria as in the first round. The new tilt series was then subjected to a third round of automatic alignment, continuing the process until there were no frames to remove.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Asthenospermia, characterized by reduced sperm motility, is one of the major causes of male infertility. The &quot;9 + 2&quot; arranged MTs and over 200 associated proteins constitute the axoneme, the molecular machine for flagellar and ciliary motility. Understanding the physiological functions of axonemal proteins, particularly their links to male infertility, could help uncover the genetic causes of asthenospermia and improve its clinical diagnosis and management. In this study, the authors generated Ankrd5 null mice and found that ANKRD5-/- males exhibited reduced sperm motility and infertility. Using FLAG-tagged ANKRD5 mice, mass spectrometry, and immunoprecipitation (IP) analyses, they confirmed that ANKRD5 is localized within the N-DRC, a critical protein complex for normal flagellar motility. However, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) of sperm from Ankrd5 null mice did not reveal any structural abnormalities.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The phenotypes observed in ANKRD5-/- mice, including reduced sperm motility and male infertility, are conversing. The authors demonstrated that ANKRD5 is an N-DRC protein that interacts with TCTE1 and DRC4. Most of the experiments are thoughtfully designed and well executed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The cryo-FIB and cryo-ET analyses require further investigation, as detailed below. The molecular mechanism by which the loss of ANKRD5 affects sperm flagellar motility remains unclear. The current conclusion that Ankrd5 knockout reduces axoneme stability is not well-supported. Specifically, are other axonemal proteins diminished in Ankrd5 knockout sperm? Conducting immunofluorescence analyses and revisiting the quantitative proteomics data may help address these questions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript investigates the role of ANKRD5 (ANKEF1) as a component of the N-DRC complex in sperm motility and male fertility. Using Ankrd5 knockout mice, the study demonstrates that ANKRD5 is essential for sperm motility and identifies its interaction with N-DRC components through IP-mass spectrometry and cryo-ET. The results provide insights into ANKRD5's function, highlighting its potential involvement in axoneme stability and sperm energy metabolism.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors employ a wide range of techniques, including gene knockout models, proteomics, cryo-ET, and immunoprecipitation, to explore ANKRD5's role in sperm biology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Limited Citations in Introduction: Key references on the role of N-DRC components (e.g., DRC1, DRC2, DRC3, DRC5) in male infertility are missing, which weakens the contextual background.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of Functional Insights: While interacting proteins outside the N-DRC complex were identified, their potential roles and interactions with ANKRD5 are not adequately explored or discussed.</p>
<p>(3) Mitochondrial Function Uncertainty: Immunofluorescence suggests possible mitochondrial localization for ANKRD5, but experiments on its role in energy metabolism (e.g., ATP production, ROS) are insufficient, especially given the observed sperm motility defects.</p>
<p>(4) Glycolysis Pathway Impact: Proteomic analysis indicates glycolysis pathway disruptions in Ankrd5-deficient sperm, but the link between these changes and impaired motility is not well explained.</p>
<p>(5) Cryo-ET Data Limitations: The structural analysis of the DMT lacks clarity on how ANKRD5 influences N-DRC or RS3. The low quality of RS3 data hinders the interpretation of ANKRD5's impact on axoneme structure.</p>
<p>(6) Discussion of Findings: The manuscript could benefit from a deeper discussion on the broader implications of ANKRD5's interactions and its role in sperm energy metabolism and motility mechanisms.</p>

<p>Thank you for the constructive feedback from the reviewers. We are grateful for their insights and are committed to addressing the key concerns raised in the public reviews through the following revisions:</p>
<p>(1) Validating Axoneme Stability Claims</p>
<p>We have procured new antibodies for DRC11, as well as marker proteins for ODA, IDA, and RS. We will conduct quantitative immunofluorescence staining to validate our claims regarding axoneme stability.</p>
<p>(2) Investigating ANKRD5 Expression in Other Ciliated Cells</p>
<p>We plan to examine the expression of ANKRD5 in mouse respiratory cilia to determine whether it is also expressed in these cells.</p>
<p>(3) Supplementing Key Citations for N-DRC Components</p>
<p>We will add references to published studies on N-DRC components (e.g., DRC1, DRC2, DRC3, DRC5) associated with male infertility in the Introduction to strengthen the background context.</p>
<p>(4) Further Analysis and Validation of ANKRD5 Interactome</p>
<p>We will conduct additional analyses and validation of the interactome of ANKRD5 detected by LC-MS.</p>
<p>(5) Elucidating the Function of ANKRD5 in Mitochondria</p>
<p>We will further investigate the role of ANKRD5 in mitochondrial function.</p>
<p>(6) Investigating Mitochondrial Function and Energy Metabolism</p>
<p>We will further explore the role of ANKRD5 in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism.</p>
<p>(7) Improving Cryo-ET Data Quality and Interpretation</p>
<p>We will attempt to further improve the quality of the STA results and try to calculate the DMT structure with a period of 96 nm. We will also use the WT density map with the same period to generate a difference map.</p>
<p>(8) Expanding Discussion and Correcting Terminology</p>
<p>The Discussion section will be revised to elaborate on the implications of ANKRD5 for male contraceptive research, particularly in targeting sperm motility. We will also correct terminology inaccuracies (e.g., changing &quot;9+2 microtubule doublet&quot; to &quot;9+2 structure&quot;) and address formatting issues (e.g., capitalizing &quot;Control&quot;).</p>
<p>Response to Reviewer #2 Comment 4:</p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's careful consideration of our proteomic data. However, our Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways showed no significant enrichment (p-value=0.089, NES=0.708; Fig.6D), which does not meet the statistical thresholds for biological significance (|NES|&gt;1, pvalue&lt;0.05). This observation is further corroborated by our direct ATP measurements showing no difference between genotypes (Fig.6E). We agree that further studies on metabolic regulation could be valuable, but current evidence does not support glycolysis disruption as a primary mechanism for the motility defects observed in Ankrd5-null sperm. This misinterpretation likely arose from the reviewer's overinterpretation of non-significant proteomic trends. We request that this specific claim be excluded from the assessment to avoid misleading readers.</p>
<p>We will provide a comprehensive point-by-point response, along with detailed experimental data and revised figures, in the resubmitted manuscript. Thank you once again for the opportunity to address the reviewers' concerns. We are confident that these revisions will strengthen our manuscript and contribute to the scientific community.</p>
