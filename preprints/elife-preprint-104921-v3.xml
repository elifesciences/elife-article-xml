<abstract><p>Understanding how motoneuron activity is finely tuned remains an open question. Leeches are a highly suitable organism for studying motor control due to their well-characterized behaviors and relatively simple nervous system. On solid surfaces leeches display crawling, a rhythmic motor pattern that can be elicited in the isolated nerve cord or even in single ganglia isolated from it. This study aimed to learn how this motor output is shaped by concurrent premotor signals. Specifically, we analyzed how electrophysiological manipulation of a premotor nonspiking (NS) neuron, that forms a recurrent inhibitory circuit (analogous to that formed by vertebrate Renshaw cells), shapes the leech crawling motor pattern. The study included a quantitative analysis of putative motor units active throughout the fictive crawling cycle that shows that the rhythmic motor output in isolated ganglia mirrors the phase relationships observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. Taken together, the study reveals that the premotor NS neurons, under the control of the segmental pattern generator, modulated the degree of excitation of motoneurons during crawling in a phase-specific manner.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Animal locomotion involves the coordination of multiple muscles under the control of the nervous system. To ensure smooth movements, diverse regulatory mechanisms operate at different hierarchical levels within the motor system, narrowing down the degrees of freedom of a highly distributed system with multiple units. The overall functional organization and operational logic of motor systems, comprising the components at all levels of the hierarchy and their feedforward and feedback interactions, remain, to a great extent, an open question in both vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kiehn, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arber and Costa, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Barkan and Zornik, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grätsch et al., 2019</xref>); this includes the mechanisms that operate at the level of the nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grillner and El Manira, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">McLean and Dougherty, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Le Gal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sengupta and Bagnall, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Calabrese and Marder, 2024</xref>). Analysis of this organization across different organisms, developmental stages, and behavioral repertoires has provided fruitful information. Leeches have been highly useful to study motor control due to their robust repertoire of motor behaviors, which are executed by a relatively simple body plan and controlled by a similarly simple nervous system. This system is composed of a chain of 21 midbody ganglia flanked by head and tail brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wagenaar, 2015</xref>), where each midbody ganglion contains the sensory and motor neurons that innervate the corresponding segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Muller et al., 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>On solid surfaces, leeches exhibit a robust rhythmic motor pattern known as crawling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This behavior results from waves of elongation and contraction of the body along its antero-posterior axis, as the animal is anchored on the posterior and anterior suckers, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Stern-Tomlinson et al., 1986</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Fictive crawling (<italic>crawling</italic>) can be monitored in the isolated nervous system, where identified interneurons and motoneurons can be recorded intracellularly and extracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baader, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baader and Kristan, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eisenhart et al., 2000</xref>). The pattern is characterized by the alternating activation of the motoneurons, such as CV and DE-3, that innervate circular and longitudinal muscles, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). This pattern can be readily evoked by dopamine in the isolated nerve cords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Puhl and Mesce, 2008</xref>), in short chains of ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kearney et al., 2022</xref>), and in single isolated ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Puhl and Mesce, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rodriguez et al., 2012</xref>). These studies established that each ganglion contains the network responsible for producing the rhythmic motoneuron activity compatible with crawling. Note that in the context of this manuscript fictive crawling refers to the rhythm generation but does not include the connectivity that rules intersegmental interactions and the consequent intersegmental lags.</p>

<p>Studies on motor behaviors in diverse organisms show that, at the final stage of neural processing, motoneuron activity is controlled by multiple signal sources (El <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Manira, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhen and Samuel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rotstein et al., 2017</xref>). Analysis of the nature and effects of these signals on the motor pattern is an active field of research. The present work has focused on the role played by nonspiking (NS) premotor neurons on leech crawling. These neurons are present as bilateral pairs in each segmental ganglion and are functionally analogous to mammalian Renshaw cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Szczupak, 2014</xref>). These spinal cord cells deliver inhibitory signals to the motoneurons in proportion to the motoneuron activity, forming an activity-dependent feedback mechanism that regulates motoneuron output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alvarez and Fyffe, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Each pair of NS neurons is at the center of a recurrent inhibitory circuit mediated by chemical and electrical synaptic connections with the motoneurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rela and Szczupak, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rodriguez et al., 2009</xref>). In the context of this circuit the activity of excitatory motoneurons evokes chemically mediated inhibitory synaptic potentials in NS. Additionally, the NS neurons are electrically coupled to virtually all excitatory motoneurons via rectifying junctions that conduct when the transjunction NS-motoneuron potential is negative. In physiological conditions this coupling favors the transmission of inhibitory signals from NS to motoneurons. Given this recurrent inhibitory circuit, NS premotor neurons could operate as modulators of motoneuron activity. A previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rodriguez et al., 2012</xref>) indicated that NS membrane potential oscillates in tune with the <italic>crawling</italic> motor pattern and that this premotor neuron can indeed modulate motor activity. In that study <italic>crawling</italic> was monitored by the recording of a particular motoneuron, the dorsal excitor cell 3 (DE-3). However, the wide connectivity of NS with several excitatory motoneurons that fire during <italic>crawling</italic>, called for a more comprehensive readout of the motor pattern.</p>
<p>The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of the premotor NS neuron across the different stages of <italic>crawling</italic>. For this purpose, we describe the pattern of activity of different neurons during <italic>crawling</italic> which were simultaneously monitored through extracellular nerve recordings while manipulating the NS membrane potential. The study reveals that the premotor neuron mediated a reduction of the firing frequency of motoneurons recruited during a specific phase of <italic>crawling</italic>.</p>

<title>NS membrane potential oscillations during <italic>crawling</italic></title>
<p>To study the role that premotor NS neurons play in fictive crawling (<italic>crawling)</italic> we first analyzed the correspondence between NS electrophysiological activity and the motoneuron output during this motor pattern. Since motoneuron DE-3 (dorsal excitor cell 3), which innervates the longitudinal dorsal muscle fibers, is the most robust proxy of <italic>crawling</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Puhl and Mesce, 2008</xref>), extracellular recordings of this motoneuron in the DP nerve were combined with NS intracellular recordings. As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rodriguez et al., 2012</xref>), the NS membrane potential showed rhythmic oscillations tuned to DE-3 activity, with hyperpolarizations occurring in conjunction with DE-3 bursts and depolarizations during DE-3 silent phases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Here, a cross-correlation analysis between NS and DE-3 firing frequency revealed a marked anticorrelation, with a cross-correlation index of -0.61 ± 0.03 (mean ± SEM) at a lag close to 0 sec (0.24 ± 0.10 s) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). This result indicates that NS hyperpolarization takes place in phase with DE-3 bursts.</p>

<p>Within the framework of the recurrent inhibitory circuit, NS is the target of inhibitory signals evoked by excitatory motoneurons via chemically-mediated polysynaptic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rela and Szczupak, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, it was hypothesized that the NS hyperpolarizations observed during <italic>crawling</italic> resulted from inputs originating in DE-3 and other motoneurons that fire in phase with it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rodriguez et al., 2012</xref>). If this hypothesis was correct, the onset of DE-3 bursts should precede the onset of NS hyperpolarization. Because the cross-correlation was performed on binned DE-3 firing frequency curves, the peak lag reported does not offer a proper estimation of the relative timing between the two signals. To gain a more precise assessment, NS intracellular recordings were segmented into individual cycles and aligned with the first spike of the corresponding DE-3 burst (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). As shown in the figure, because of the NS membrane potential oscillations it is not possible to establish a sharp onset for the NS hyperpolarizing response. However, the example illustrates that the onset of the DE-3 bursts occurred after NS hyperpolarization was already initiated. These findings rule out the possibility that the NS hyperpolarization was originated by DE-3 bursting. Instead, they suggest that NS and DE-3 received concomitant rhythmic inputs of opposite sign—that is, hyperpolarizing inputs in NS and depolarizing ones in DE-3.</p>
<p>To further analyze the putative concomitant inputs from the pattern generator onto NS and DE-3, we evaluated the correlation between different features of their rhythmic activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We found no relationship between the amplitude of NS hyperpolarization and DE-3 mean firing frequency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). However, surprisingly, the former exhibited a high correlation with DE-3 burst duration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). This result led to examining how the amplitude of NS hyperpolarization related to the time between consecutive DE-3 bursts (interbursts time), preceding (pre) and following (post) the NS hyperpolarization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The data show a significant correlation of the amplitude of NS hyperpolarization with the pre-interburst duration, but not with the post-interburst duration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F-G</xref>). Taken in consideration the putative model presented in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, in which the oscillator units C and E inhibit each other, the longer the activity of unit E, the larger the rebound in unit C and its downstream effects on NS hyperpolarization and on DE-3 burst duration.</p>
<p>These results indicate that, in addition to the known recurrent inhibitory circuit between NS and motoneurons, NS neurons receive an inhibitory signal during <italic>crawling</italic>, which is in phase with DE-3 activity. This inhibitory signal seems to have originated from the same source that activates DE-3 motoneurons. In that case, it seems puzzling to find a lack of correlation between NS hyperpolarization amplitude and DE-3 firing frequency. However, this observation might be explained by considering that DE-3 is subjected to two counteracting effects at the same time: an excitatory input from the oscillator unit C and an inhibitory input from NS via the rectifying electrical junctions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Effect of NS on DE-3 activity during <italic>crawling</italic></title>
<p>In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rodriguez et al., 2012</xref>) we showed that hyperpolarization of NS during <italic>crawling</italic> reduced the firing frequency of DE-3, suggesting that the premotor neuron preserved the influence that exhibits in basal conditions during the rhythmic motor pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rodriguez et al., 2009</xref>). Here we aimed at testing whether the inhibitory signal that NS receives during crawling is indeed transmitted to the motoneurons. For this purpose the premotor neuron was transiently removed from the circuit. In line with the properties of the rectifying electrical synapse between NS and the motoneurons, depolarizing NS neurons is equivalent to disconnecting them from the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rela and Szczupak, 2007</xref>). The work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rodriguez et al. (2012)</xref> showed that NS depolarization increased DE-3 firing frequency but the study lacked appropriate controls that we carried out here.</p>
<p>Depolarizing steps applied in NS neurons in the course of <italic>crawling</italic> episodes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) shifted their membrane potential beyond +100 mV, well above the average membrane potential of the motoneurons. An important control introduced here evaluate potential drifts in <italic>crawling</italic> features over time. For this purpose we compared two series of experiments: one in which NS was subjected to depolarizing steps (depo) and a control (ctrl) in which it was not. We assessed changes in cycle period, DE-3 mean firing frequency (mFF), burst duration and duty cycle for both treatments (depo, ctrl) across different epochs (pre, test, post).</p>

<p>Transient NS depolarizations had no effect on the <italic>crawling</italic> period (measured in end-to-end cycles, see Materials and Methods), DE-3 burst duration and duty cycle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), but produced a 60% increase in DE-3 mFF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-C</xref>).</p>
<p>In the control series the analysis of <italic>crawling</italic> features over time shows that cycle period and DE-3 burst duration decreased over epochs, while the duty cycle remained constant. Similar results were obtained when cycles were segmented from start-to-start (data not shown). Thus, throughout the dopamine perfusion the motor pattern exhibited an acceleration but the duty cycle remained stable.</p>
<p>As predicted based on the known circuit (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), this series of experiments indicates that inhibitory signals onto NS premotor neurons are transmitted to DE-3 motoneurons, thereby limiting their firing frequency by counteracting their excitatory drive during <italic>crawling</italic>.</p>

<title>A more comprehensive view of <italic>crawling</italic></title>
    <p>As indicated above, the activity of motoneuron DE-3 has been widely used as a proxy of <italic>crawling</italic>. However, focusing on a single motoneuron neglects possible effects of NS on other phases of the motor pattern. To evaluate whether the effect of the premotor NS neuron extends to other motoneurons active during <italic>crawling</italic>, we performed extracellular recordings of DP along with AA and/or PP root nerves. Single units were identified using a spike sorting algorithm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Ai-Aii</xref>) that enabled a systematic analysis of their activity. The firing pattern of detected units (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Aiii</xref>) was expressed as binned firing frequency (bFF). Because DE-3 is used as a reference marker of the cycle, segmentation of the traces was performed using the start-to-start approach (see Material and Methods). This rhythmic activity shows that some units fire during the contraction stage, defined by DE-3 activity, while others fire during the elongation phase.</p>

<p>Plotting the bFF of the different rhythmic units as a function of phase within a <italic>crawling</italic> cycle (start-to-start) allowed for the manual classification of the unit. Based on their activity profile relative to DE-3 three types were identified: In-Phase, Anti-Phase, or In-Phase-Early-Onset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The In-phase units fire simultaneously with DE-3, the Anti-Phase units fire in between DE-3 bursts, and the In-Phase-Early-Onset units are active in phase with DE-3 but start firing before DE-3 burst onset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Multiple intracellular recordings represent a challenge, and therefore recording the activity of different motoneurons during crawling has been restricted to one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Puhl and Mesce, 2008</xref>) or two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rodriguez et al., 2012</xref>) cells at a time. While multiple extracellular recordings have been performed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eisenhart et al., 2000</xref>), these results (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) present the first quantitative analysis of multiple units activated throughout the <italic>crawling</italic> cycle in this type of recordings. Nerve roots carry both sensory and motor axons; however, the units recorded during <italic>crawling</italic> in isolated ganglia are more likely to be motoneurons. Although the preparation is detached from peripheral inputs, sensory neurons could still receive inputs from the segmental pattern generator. The recorded nerves conduct axons from mechanosensory pressure (P) and touch (T) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nicholls and Baylor, 1968</xref>). However, P cells show no activity during dopamine-induced <italic>crawling</italic>, and T cells receive inhibitory inputs in phase with DE-3 bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alonso et al. 2020</xref>). Axons from stretch receptors also run through the recorded nerves, but these neurons transmit information passively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Blackshaw and Thompson, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cang and Friesen, 2000</xref>). Therefore, the In-Phase units are expected to be motonerons that control the contraction stage by exciting or inhibiting the longitudinal or circular muscles, respectively, and the Anti-Phase units motoneurons that control the elongation stage, by exciting or inhibiting the circular or longitudinal muscles, respectively. It is plausible that In-Phase-Early-Onset are inhibitors of circular muscles, preparing the conditions for a fast contraction stage. Further studies should confirm this hypothesis.</p>

<title>Comparison of the motor pattern in single ganglia and in intact animals</title>
<p>The assumption that the crawling motor pattern described on the basis of extracellular recordings in isolated single ganglia, reflects key characteristics of the behavioral pattern, requires qualitative and quantitative validation. To this end intact leeches were monitored during crawling. The analysis was performed by tracking nine dots painted along the dorsal longitudinal midline of the leech, which divided the body into 8 sections (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Because ganglia are located in highly conserved positions relative to the length of the animal (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kearney et al. 2022</xref>), the relative distance from the head can be used to infer which ganglia are included within the 8 sections mentioned above. We focused the analysis on sections delimited by points 4-5 and 5-6, that correspond to the range of segmental ganglia included in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies (ganglia 8 to 15) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref>). For electrophysiological data the frame of analysis was the cycle of DE-3 rhythmic activity and, equivalently, for the behavioral data the frame of analysis was the crawling step (see Materials and Methods).</p>

<p><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> shows a representative trace of a series of whole length waves, that were divided into discrete steps (see Materials and Methods), and the corresponding measurements in the section delimited by the dots 4 and 5. Within each crawling step, four stages were identified in the studied sections (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>): the elongation stage (marked by an increase in section length), the contraction stage (marked by a decrease in section length) and two isometric stages flanking the dynamic stages. The plot in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> shows the section length of different steps by the same animal, normalized by the step duration, and illustrates the variability of the step dynamics.</p>
<p>For a quantitative comparison of the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments the following variables were evaluated: period of the rhythmic pattern and duty cycle of the different phases. While the average cycle period (end-to-end) recorded in isolated ganglia was of 15.22 ± 3.21 s (n = 6), the average duration of the leech step was of 7.49 ± 0.50 s (n=6). These values are similar to those reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Puhl and Mesce, 2008</xref>, for single ganglia; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Stern-Tomlinson et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baader and Kristan, 1992</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Puhl and Mesce, 2008</xref>, for intact animals). Thus, in the intact animal the rhythmic activity was twice as fast as in the isolated ganglion, suggesting that peripheral signals may accelerate the rhythmic behavior, as already described in other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pulver et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fushiki et al., 2016</xref>). However, we cannot rule out that activation of the rhythmogenic circuit in isolated ganglia may fail to activate a circuit component responsible for speeding the rhythm.</p>
<p>It seems natural to correlate the activity of the Anti-Phase and In-Phase units of <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies with the elongation and contraction stages of <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior, respectively. But the isometric stages displayed <italic>in vivo</italic> at the section level have no obvious counterpart in the electrophysiological recordings of motoneurons in the isolated ganglia. It is important to consider that the rhythmic movement of successive segments along the antero-posterior axis of the animal requires a delay signal that allows the appropriate propagation of the metachronal wave (Puhl and Mesce, 2010; Puhl et al 2012), and this signal is probably absent in the isolated ganglion. In consequence, for the comparison of the duty cycle, the <italic>in vivo</italic> isometric stages were ignored, and only the duration of the dynamic fraction of the step was taken in consideration. In turn, the behavioral duty cycle was calculated as the ratio between the elongation or contraction stage duration over the dynamic step duration. Thus measured, the duty cycle of the elongation stage was 0.65 ± 0.01 and that of the contraction was 0.35 ± 0.01 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). These values are noticeably close to the duty cycle of the Anti-Phase units (0.64 ± 0.07) and of the DE-3 motoneurons (0.32 ± 0.03) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>) measured in the isolated ganglia.</p>
<p>These results show that the dynamic pattern described by multiple motoneurons recorded in isolated ganglia reflects the phase relation observed in the corresponding body section <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Effect of NS on the activity of the different types of motoneurons during <italic>crawling</italic></title>
    <p>The results shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> support the view that the activity recorded in single isolated ganglia reflects the neuronal control of the rhythmic motor pattern underlying crawling. Based on this premise the recording of multiple units presented above was used to evaluate the influence of NS on units active at different <italic>crawling</italic> stages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6Ai-ii</xref>). Previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rodriguez et al., 2012</xref>) and the experiments presented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> suggest that NS depolarization releases motoneuron DE-3 from the inhibitory influence of the premotor neuron. The suggested interpretation postulates that NS depolarization, by turning off the rectifying junctions, prevents the transmission of NS inhibitory inputs onto DE-3. Given the widespread connectivity of NS with all the excitatory motoneurons, it is expected that NS manipulation affects the activity of all the units that fire in phase with DE-3 when NS receives inhibitory inputs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, units active in anti-phase with DE-3 should not be affected as NS does not receive inhibitory inputs during that stage.</p>

</fig>
<p>To evaluate the effect of NS depolarization, the activity of the motoneurons was characterized using two metrics: maximum bFF (Max bFF) to assess activity level, and relative half width (Rel HW) to evaluate the duty cycle. To enable a comparison with the other units, the data for DE-3 was reanalyzed in this manner.</p>
<p>NS depolarization produced an increase in DE-3 Max bFF of around 60% (as shown above), while this variable remained stable throughout control experiments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>Different from DE-3, In-Phase units showed a marked decrease in the maximum bFF across time in control conditions, but similar to DE-3, this variable underwent an increase of around 50% upon NS depolarization (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Given the temporal drop detected in the control series this increase is probably an underestimation of the NS effect on the In-Phase firing frequency.</p>
<p>The Anti-Phase units also showed a slight but significant decrease in the maximum bFF across time in control conditions, but in this case the effect of NS depolarization was limited to counteracting this decrease (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). While in control conditions Anti-Phase motor units exhibited a decrease of around 15% between pre and test epochs, the depo experiments showed no decrement between these two epochs. Notwithstanding, control and depo experiments showed a marked decrease in bFF from test to post (15% and a 20% decrease, respectively). NS depolarization did not affect the maximum bFF of the In-Phase-Early-Onset units (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding the relative HW, the effect of NS depolarization was limited to In-Phase units. Our results show that the relative HW of these units tended to fall across epochs in control conditions and that releasing NS depolarization enhanced this tendency (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). In control experiments, the relative HW decreased by about 15% between test and post epochs; and in the depo experiments the decrease was of around 40%.</p>
<p>The statistical analyses, as well as the estimated ratios between epochs for each case, are detailed in Supplementary Table 2.</p>
<p>Taken together, the results support the hypothesis presented earlier: the inhibitory signals received by NS in phase with the contraction stage modulated the activity of the motoneurons active in this instance. It is worth noting that the fact that the firing frequency of Anti-Phase MNs was not affected by NS depolarization indicates that this experimental manipulation did not cause a generalized change in the activity of MNs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study shows that phase specific inhibitory signals, delivered by the functional analogue of Renshaw cells in the leech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Szczupak, 2014</xref>), modulate the degree of excitation of the motoneurons responsible for the contraction stage of <italic>crawling</italic>. This effect was phase specific, as motoneurons active in the rest of the cycle were not affected. NS is a premotor neuron that operates at the center of a recurrent inhibitory circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rela and Szczupak, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rodriguez et al., 2009</xref>) and thus the initial hypothesis suggested that the effect on <italic>crawling</italic> was mediated entirely by this circuit. However, the results show that the inhibitory signal did not originate at the level of the motoneurons themselves but, most probably, at the crawling oscillator. The marked temporal correlation between the neurons active at the contraction stage and NS hyperpolarizations suggests that the excitatory signals onto the motoneurons and the hyperpolarizing signals onto NS were driven by the same upstream element (e.g. the element in the oscillator that controls the contraction stage). This result further feeds the analogy between vertebrate Renshaw cells and leech NS neurons in that the formers are not only targeted by motoneuron inputs but by rhythmogenic premotor elements as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nishimaru et al., 2006</xref>). Nonetheless, the results do not rule out that the existing recurrent inhibitory circuit contributes to the hyperpolarization of NS.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the fact that In-Phase-Early-Onset activity was also unaffected by NS depolarization confirms that these motoneurons constitute a distinct group from the In-Phase units. Furthermore, this suggests that these units might be inhibitory motoneurons that are not connected to the NS via the recurrent inhibitory circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rela and Szczupak, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wadepuhl, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, we propose that the crawling oscillator releases a dual signal onto the motoneurons that control the contraction stage: a direct excitatory input that elicits the rhythmic bursts and a concurrent inhibitory input via NS (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Consistent with this interpretation, the activity level of the Anti-Phase units was not influenced by these inhibitory signals.</p>

<p>The corroboration of a dual counteracting set of actions on motoneuron output calls for a functional interpretation. In a characterization of the electrophysiological properties of leech motoneurons it was shown that DE-3 can reach a firing frequency that exceeds 100 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Perez-Etchegoyen et al., 2011</xref>) while the maximal muscle tension that this motoneuron can evoke is achieved at around 25 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mason and Kristan, 1982</xref>). Additionally, it is relevant to consider that the population of motoneurons that activate longitudinal muscles is linked by ohmic coupling that can result in mutual excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ort et al., 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ashaber et al., 2021</xref>). As a result, when all the activators of longitudinal muscles are excited during the contraction stage, the excitatory spread can lead to runaway motoneuron activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hennequin et al., 2017</xref>). An inhibitory signal imposed on NS can spread to all the motoneurons simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rela and Szczupak, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rodriguez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wadepuhl, 1989</xref>) and thus limit the activity of the whole motoneuron population.</p>
<p>Previous work showed that leech motoneurons are subjected to a generalized inhibition mediated by GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Baca et al., 2008</xref>) while the electrically mediated inhibition exerted by NS shown here is phase-specific. The existence of concurrent excitation and inhibition has been revealed in vertebrate motor networks, where it was proposed as a balancing factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kishore et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Parkis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Petersen et al., 2014</xref>). In line with the present results, experiments performed in zebrafish showed that in-phase inhibition originates from a set of premotor neurons that comprise the Renshaw cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Callahan et al., 2019</xref>). Neurophysiological studies in the leech offer the particular advantage of allowing electrical manipulation of individual neurons in adults, where they can be readily recognized by their anatomical and electrophysiological characteristics. In this sense the present study offers clear-cut evidence of the dual signal motoneurons receive in the course of motor control from an identified premotor element.</p>
<p>The results further highlight the notion that knowing the connectivity among neurons is not sufficient to deduce its functional operation, as the dynamical interplay among them is highly relevant to understand its physiological role.</p>

<title>Structure of <italic>crawling</italic> based on MN activity and behavior</title>
<p>Evaluation of phase specificity required a more comprehensive tracking of motoneuron activity throughout the cycle and we addressed this demand through the analysis of the activity of multiple motoneurons. In the present study we show that in the course of <italic>crawling</italic> DE-3 neurons fire concurrently with neurons that reach the periphery mainly through the PP and the AA roots. Based on the classical description of Ort and collaborators (1974) the spikes in phase with DE-3 recorded in the PP root are likely to correspond to VE-4 (ventral-excitor 4), DE-5, DE-7 and VE-8, while those recorded in AA are likely to correspond to DE-107 and VE-108. Intracellular recordings of VE-4, VE-5 showed indeed the coincident firing with DE-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baader, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eisenhart et al., 2000</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Puhl and Mesce, 2008</xref>)</p>
<p>To learn how the motoneuron readout compares with the rhythmic body movements that take place in crawling we presented behavioral studies that focused on the sections of the leech body that match the range of ganglia used in the electrophysiological studies. The comparison shows two main differences. The period of the rhythmic animal behavior was half that measured in the fictive behavior at the isolated ganglia. In addition, at the behavioral level the actual elongation-contraction gestures were flanked by isometric stages, while in dopamine-induced <italic>crawling</italic> studied in isolated ganglia the rhythmic activity of the motoneurons appears as the alternation between units In-Phase with DE-3 and Anti-Phase of DE-3, with no clear references for isometric phases. The absence of known descending brain signals (Puhl et al., 2012) and/or peripheral signals are assumed as important factors in determining the cycle period and the sequence at which the different behavioral stages take place. However, it is noteworthy that taking the isometric stages aside, the sequence of events, and the proportion of the active cycle dedicated to elongation and contraction were remarkably similar in both experimental settings. This suggests that the network activated in the isolated ganglion is the one underlying the dynamic aspects of the motor behavior at any given section of the animal.</p>

<p>To induce fictive crawling (<italic>crawling</italic>), ganglia were superfused with 75 μM dopamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States), freshly prepared at the beginning of each experimental day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Puhl and Mesce, 2008</xref>). Only one episode was evoked per ganglion. The rhythmic motor pattern was monitored via extracellular recording of the DP nerve, where the largest spike corresponds to the DE-3 motoneuron, one of the motoneurons innervating the longitudinal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ort et al., 1974</xref>). In the present study the minimum and maximum mean period values (end-to-end) in isolated ganglia were 6.32 and 31.24 s, respectively.</p>
<p>When testing the effect of NS neurons, depolarizing pulses of +5 nA to +7 nA were injected into its soma through the intracellular electrode. Between four and five <italic>crawling</italic> cycles before and after a depolarizing pulse were left unaffected to obtain control pre and post rhythmic epochs.</p>

<title>Behavioral Experiments</title>
<p>Leeches were anesthetized by placing individuals at −20◦C for 5 to 10 minutes. Then the skin of the animal was dried, and nine points of water-based paint were applied along its dorsal longitudinal midline (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). When the animals recovered they were allowed to crawl onto a graph paper sheet covered with a transparent plastic surface. Crawling was filmed at 60 fps with a digital camera (Sony ILCE-A6400) supported above the arena. The position of each point painted on the leech skin was tracked using DeepLabCut version 2.3.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Insafutdinov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nath et al., 2019</xref>). To this end, 338 frames randomly selected from 66 videos of 8 leeches were used for manually labeling the painted dots, and used for training a ResNet_50-based neural network for automating the detection.</p>
<p>To characterize crawling, steps were defined by the frames in which the algorithmic sum of the following values was at a minimum: 1) the whole length of the leech, 2) the velocity of the most anterior dot, and 3) the velocity of the most posterior dot (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Steps where DeepLabCut failed to detect any of the nine points on the animal were discarded. After dividing the animal displacement into steps, we performed a quantitative analysis of the changes in the length of the animal sections (defined between each pair of points) over time. Specifically, the sections delimited by the painted points 4-5 and 5-6 were chosen since they include the range of ganglia considered in the electrophysiological studies (8-15). The length traces of each leech were filtered using a Gaussian filter (sigma of 0.25 s). For each step, the duration of the elongation and contraction stages within a section was calculated by using the maximum length as the boundary between these phases. The onset of elongation and the end of contraction were determined by detecting knee points, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Satopaa et al. (2011</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>Spike Sorting</title>
<p>Extracellular recordings were spike sorted using a custom-written algorithm which relies on a template matching-based method based on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pouzat et al., 2002</xref>), incorporating a t-SNE model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pedregosa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008</xref>). Because spike sorting is sensitive to misclassification, the resulting output was manually curated to address whether a single cluster of waveforms was self-consistent with a single neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hill et al., 2011</xref>). During manual curation, all clusters of putative spike events were evaluated. Clusters containing two well defined groups of waveforms were split and pairs of clusters with similar waveforms and temporally coordinated activity were merged. Clusters that had inconsistent waveforms and could not be split into clusters with well-defined waveforms were discarded. After this procedure, each cluster was considered a single motor unit.</p>
<p>To select for rhythmic units, autocorrelations were performed considering the first four cycles of the fictive behavior. Units whose autocorrelogram included at least 2 peaks with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.25 were considered rhythmic.</p>

<title>Data Processing</title>
<p>DE-3 spike times were derived from DP nerve recordings using the spike sorting algorithm mentioned above. DE-3 bursts were considered as such if they comprised at least 10 spikes with a mean firing frequency of 8 Hz, where the separation between two subsequent spikes occurred with a maximum separation of 0.5 seconds. Burst duration was calculated as the time difference between the last and first DE-3 spikes in each burst. Cycle period was calculated in two different ways: as the time difference between the last (end-to-end), or the first spikes (start-to-start) of subsequent DE-3 bursts, and is reported accordingly. Duty cycle was calculated as the ratio between burst duration and period. The mean firing frequency (mFF) of each burst was calculated as the number of spikes over the burst duration. The binned firing frequency (bFF) of DE-3, or any other unit, was obtained by binning the number of spikes across the recording using a 0.05 s or a 0.5 s interval, for <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, respectively. For cross-correlation analysis, the DE-3 bFF was filtered using a Gaussian filter (sigma of 150 ms).</p>
<p>For the cross-correlation between NS membrane potential and DE-3 firing frequency, the intracellular recording of NS was resampled to match the data rate of DE-3 bFF. To determine the amplitude of NS hyperpolarization, a baseline membrane potential was established using a Gaussian filter (sigma of 5 s) applied to the entire trace. The amplitude was calculated as the difference between the baseline value at the start of the DE-3 burst and the minimum membrane potential reached by NS during the corresponding burst (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>When NS depolarization was implemented, the cycles including the onset or offset of the current pulse were excluded, and the traces were divided into three epochs: pre, test, and post. Control experiments were treated similarly.</p>
<p>When analyzing the activity of the units obtained by spike sorting, the maximum bFF value and relative half width were obtained from curves displaying bFF versus cycle-phase (time normalized to the period of each cycle). The relative half width was calculated as the width at half the maximum bFF value.</p>
<p>Data processing was performed using custom written Python scripts.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using R (R Core Team, 2020). The goodness-of-fit for each model was analyzed using the DHARMa package. For every analysis, the structure of random factors was kept maximal whenever possible. The specific random factors considered in each case are detailed in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.</p>
<p>To analyze the correlation between the amplitude of NS hyperpolarization and different <italic>crawling</italic> features (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-G</xref>), the lmer function from the lmerTest package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kuznetsova et al., 2017</xref>) was used to perform linear mixed models (LMM) with the experiment as a random factor.</p>
<p>To analyze the effect of NS depolarization on motoneuron activity, the data was analyzed using mixed-effects models with two fixed factors: epoch (pre, test, post) and treatment (control, depolarization). All models included motor units as a random factor. Each ganglion was also included as a random factor. The effect of NS depolarization was analyzed with the glmmTMB function from the glmmTMB package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brooks et al., 2017</xref>) to perform a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) or with the lmer function to perform a LMM. For the GLMM, we used a student-t distribution (t_family) with the identity link or Gamma family with a log link as indicated in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. The significance of a factor was determined with a likelihood-ratio test for the GLMM or an F-test for the LMM. This was done by comparing the model including the factor with a model dropping that factor. Pairwise simple contrasts were performed within the treatment factor and between the epoch factor using the <italic>emmeans</italic> package and the Tukey correction were applied to obtain the p values.</p>
<p>To analyze a possible temporal drift on <italic>crawling</italic> features we considered the data of control experiments and used mixed-effects models with epoch (pre, test, post) as a fixed factor and units as a random factor. Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 specifies the models used for each analysis.</p>

<p>The medicinal leech preparation is an amenable system in which to understand the neural basis of locomotion. Here a previously identified non-spiking neuron was studied in leech and found to alter the mean firing frequency of a crawl-related motoneuron, which fires during the contraction phase of crawling. The findings are <bold>valuable</bold> and the experiments were diligently done and considered <bold>solid</bold>. The results lay a foundation for additional studies in this system.</p>

<p>The medicinal leech preparation is an amenable system in which to understand how the underlying cellular networks for locomotion function. A previously identified non-spiking neuron (NS) was studied and found to alter the mean firing frequency of a crawl-related motoneuron (DE-3), which fires during the contraction phase of crawling. The data are solid. Identifying upstream neurons responsible for crawl motor patterning is essential for understanding how rhythmic behavior is controlled.</p>

<p>This study by Radice et al., takes advantage of the very well-established leach preparation to investigate questions related to motor control, more precisely the question of how the activity of motoneurons taking part in leach crawling behavior are finely tuned.</p>
<p>The paper is overall well written. The findings are clearly presented, and the data seems solid overall.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>The medicinal leech preparation is an amenable system in which to understand how the underlying cellular networks for locomotion function. A previously identified non-spiking neuron (NS) was studied and found to alter the mean firing frequency of a crawl-related motoneuron (DE-3), which fires during the contraction phase of crawling. The data are mostly solid. Identifying upstream neurons responsible for crawl motor patterning is essential for understanding how rhythmic behavior is controlled.</p>
<p>Review of Revision:</p>
<p>On a positive note, the rationale for the study is clearer to me now after reading the authors' responses to both reviewers, but that information, as described in the authors' responses, is minimally incorporated into the current revised paper. Incorporating a discussion of previous work on the NS cell has, indeed, improved the paper.</p>
<p>I suggested earlier that the paper be edited for clarity but not much text has been changed since the first draft. I will provide an example of the types of sentences that are confusing. The title of the paper is: &quot;Phase-specific premotor inhibition modulates leech rhythmic motor output&quot;. Are the authors referring to the inhibition created by premotor neurons (e.g., on to the motoneurons) or the inhibition that the premotor neurons receive?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this case, this is an interesting ambiguity: NS is inhibited and that inhibition is directly transmitted to the motoneurons because both cells are electrically coupled.  We believe that the title does not disguise the findings conveyed by the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I also find the paper still confusing with regard to the suggested &quot;functional homology&quot; with the vertebrate Renshaw cells. When the authors set up this expectation of homology (should be analogy) in the introduction and other sections of the paper, one would assume that the NS cell would be directly receiving excitation from a motoneuron (like DE-3) and, in turn, the motoneuron would then receive some sort of inhibitory input to regulate its firing frequency. Essentially, I have always viewed the Renshaw cells as nature's clever way to monitor the ongoing activity of a motoneuron while also providing recurrent feedback or &quot;recurrent inhibition&quot; to modify that cell's excitatory state. The authors present their initial idea below on line 62. Authors write: &quot;These neurons are present as bilateral pairs in each segmental ganglion and are functional homologs of the mammalian Renshaw cells (Szczupak, 2014). These spinal cord cells receive excitatory inputs from motoneurons and, in turn, transmit inhibitory signals to the motoneurons (Alvarez and Fyffe, 2007).&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with Reviewer #2: the correct term is &quot;analogous,&quot; not &quot;homologous.&quot; Thanks for pointing this out. We changed the term throughout the text.</p>
<p>The Reviewer is also right in the appreciation of the role of Renshaw cells. NS plays exactly the role that the Reviewer expresses. The ONLY difference is that NS is inhibited by the motoneurons, and in turn transmits this inhibition to the motoneurons via the rectifying electrical junctions. Attending the confusion that our description caused in the Reviewer, we have modified the cited sentence accordingly now in lines 65-67.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor note:</p>
<p>I suggest re-writing this last sentence as &quot;these&quot; is confusing. Change to: 'In the spinal cord, Renshaw interneurons receive excitatory inputs from motoneurons and, in turn, transmit inhibitory signals to them (Alvarez and Fyffe, 2007).']</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please, see the changes mentioned above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, the authors note that (line 69 on): &quot;In the context of this circuit the activity of excitatory motoneurons evokes chemically mediated inhibitory synaptic potentials in NS. Additionally, the NS neurons are electrically coupled......In physiological conditions this coupling favors the transmission of inhibitory signals from NS to motoneurons.&quot; Based on what is being conveyed here, I see a disconnect with the &quot;functional homology&quot; being presented earlier. I may be missing something, but the Renshaw analogy seems to be quite different compared to what looks like reciprocal inhibition in the leech. If the authors want to make the analogy to Renshaw cells clearer, then they should make a simple ball and stick diagram of the leech system and visually compare it to the Renshaw/motoneuron circuit with regard to functionality. This simple addition would help many readers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have simplified the description regarding the Renshaw cell (lines 65-67) to avoid the “details” of the connectivity between the two circuits.</p>
<p>This report focuses on NS neurons and their role in crawling; we mention the analogy with Renshaw cells to widen the interest of the results. We do not think that making a special diagram to compare how the two neurons play a similar role via different connections among the players is useful in the context of this manuscript.</p>

<p>The Abstract, Authors write (line 19), &quot;Specifically, we analyzed how electrophysiological manipulation of a premotor nonspiking (NS) neuron, that forms a recurrent inhibitory circuit (homologous to vertebrate Renshaw cells)....&quot;</p>
<p>First, a circuit would not be homologous to a cell, and the term homology implies a strict developmental/evolutionary commonality. At best, I would use the term functionally analogous but even then I am still not sure that they are functionally that similar (see comments above).</p>

<p>Reviewer #2 is right. We changed the sentence in line 20.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 22: &quot;The study included a quantitative analysis of motor units active throughout the fictive crawling cycle that shows that the rhythmic motor output in isolated ganglia mirrors the phase relationships observed in vivo.&quot; This sentence must be revised to indicate that not all of the extracellular units were demonstrated to be motor units. Revise to: &quot;The study included a quantitative analysis of identified and putative motor units active throughout the fictive crawling cycle that shows.....'</p>
<p>Line 187 regarding identifying units as motoneurons: Authors write, &quot;While multiple extracellular recordings have been performed previously (Eisenhart et al., 2000), these results (Figure 4) present the first quantitative analysis of motor units activated throughout the crawling cycle in this type of recordings.&quot; The authors cannot assume that the units in the recorded nerves belong only to motoneurons. Based on their first rebuttal, the authors seem to be reluctant to accept the idea that the extracellularly recorded units might represent a different class of neurons. They admit that some sensory neurons (with somata located centrally) do, indeed, travel out the same nerves recorded, but go on to explain why they would not be active.</p>
<p>The leech has a variety of sensory organs that are located in the periphery, and some of these sensory neurons do show rhythmic activity correlated with locomotor activity (see Blackshaw's early work). The numerous stretch receptors, in fact, have very large axons that pass through all the nerves recorded in the current paper.</p>
<p>In Fig. 4, it is interesting that the waveforms of all the units recorded in the PP nerve exhibit a reversal in waveform as compared to those in the DP nerve, which might indicate (based on bipolar differential recording) that the units in the PP nerve are being propagated in the opposite direction (i.e., are perhaps afferent). Rhythmic presynaptic inhibition and excitation is commonly seen for stretch receptors within the CNS (see the work of Burrows) and many such cells are under modulatory control.</p>
<p>Most likely, the majority of the units are from motoneurons, but we do not really know at this point. The authors should reframe their statements throughout the paper as: 'While multiple extracellular recordings have been performed previously (Eisenhart et al., 2000), these results (Figure 4) present the first quantitative analysis of multiple extracellular units, using spike sorting methods, which are activated throughout the crawling cycle.' In cases where the identity of the unit is known, then it is fine to state that, but when the identity of the unit is not known, then there should be some qualification and stated as 'putative motor units'</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the concern of Reviewer #2 regarding the type of neurons active during dopamine-induced crawling in isolated ganglia. However, we believe there is sufficient evidence to support that the recorded spikes originate from motoneurons. As readers may share the same concern, we have added a paragraph explaining why spikes from somatic sensory neurons such as P or T cells, or from stretch receptors, are unlikely to contribute (lines 206-214). We included the term putative in the abstract.</p>

<p>The Methods section:</p>
<p>Needs to include the full parameters that were used to assess whether bursting activity was qualified in ways to be considered crawling activity or not. Typically, crawl-like burst periods of no more than 25 seconds have been the limit for their qualification as crawling activity. In Fig 2F, for example, the inter-burst period is over 35 seconds; that coupled with an average 5 second burst duration would bring the burst period to 40 seconds, which is substantially out of range for there to be bursting relevant to crawl activity. Simply put, long DE-3 burst periods are often observed but may not be indicative of a crawl state as the CV motoneurons are no longer out of phase with DE-3. A number of papers have adopted this criterion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now indicate in the methods the range of period values measured in our experiments.  For the reviewer informatio we show here histograms depicting the variability of period and duty cycle values recorded in our experiments (control conditions). The Reviewer can see that the bursting activity of DE-3 fall within what has been published.</p>
