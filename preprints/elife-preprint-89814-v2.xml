<title>Abstract</title><p>Genomic germline and somatic variations may impact drug binding and even lead to resistance. However, designing a different drug for each mutant may not be feasible. In this study, we identified the most common cancer somatic mutations from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) that occur in structurally characterized binding sites of approved therapeutic antibodies. We found two HER2 mutations, S310Y and S310F, that substantially compromise binding of Pertuzumab, a widely used therapeutics, and lead to drug resistance. To address these mutations, we designed a multi-specific version of Pertuzumab, that retains original function while also bindings these HER2 variants. This new antibody is stable and inhibits HER3 phosphorylation in a cell-based assay for all three variants, suggesting it can inhibit HER2-HER3 dimerization in patients with any of the variants. This study demonstrates how a small number of carefully selected mutations can add new specificities to an existing antibody without compromising its original function, creating a single therapeutic antibody that targets multiple common variants, making a drug that is not personalized yet its activity may be.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cells contain naturally occurring germline and somatic variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Cancer cells have more mutations than healthy cells due to somatic mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. COSMIC, a database for somatic mutations in cancer (cancer.sanger.ac.uk) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], currently records over 23 million genomic variants in ∼1.5 million clinical cancer samples, an average of 15 somatic mutations per sample. These somatic and germline mutations may affect the binding of drugs to their targets in different ways, compromising efficacy and conferring resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Somatic and germline mutations have been shown to cause resistance to several anti-cancer drugs, <italic>e.g.</italic> EGFR mutations that cause cetuximab or gefitinib resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], Topoisomerase II mutation that causes Amascarine resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] and HER2 mutations that cause resistance to trastuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and to several small molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. According to one account, in nearly half of cancer patients pre-existing resistance to chemotherapy is observed prior to, and independent of, treatment due to existing variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Thus, for many drugs, response rate is significantly reduced because of mutations that compromise efficacy. Possible effects of such mutations are steric hindrance of the drug binding pocket [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], target protein conformational changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], or reduced binding affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. It has been suggested that a customized design that considers specific variations in the drug target, may lead to new versions of existing drugs that will be more effective in patients with specific mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. However, mutations in the populations are usually overlooked in drug development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], and the development of mutation-specific versions of existing drugs poses commercial and regulatory challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].</p>
<p>A possible route for overcoming the challenge of genomic variations that cause drug resistance is the design of multi-specific drugs that can effectively bind common variants of the target protein. A single molecule that can bind slightly different variants of the target can provide a single general treatment that is produced, developed, and regulated once, and yet takes into consideration personal genomic profiles.</p>
<p>Antibodies are increasingly used as cancer therapeutics, due to their high affinity, exquisite specificity, long half-life, and their mammalian and sometimes even human origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Several formats of engineered antibodies posses the capability of more than one different antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Among these formats, dual-specific antibodies were designed to target two distinct targets with a single antibody (“Two-in-one antibody”) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Unlike bi-specific antibodies, which have different arms that bind different targets, dual-specific antibodies may be symmetrical IgGs, in which both arms can bind both targets. We propose that such antibodies can be computationally designed to recognize both wild-type and mutated versions of targets. Such a single multi-specific compound may address a wider range of mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. In infectious disease, a broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) is a naturally occurring antibody that binds multiple variants of the same protein, <italic>e.g.</italic>, in attacking the highly variable HIV-1 virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. In the context of infectious diseases, such multi-specific Abs are directed toward one conserved epitope that is assumed to be the same in all variants. In the context of cancer, however, somatic cancer mutations that confer resistance to an effective treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] may not leave a conserved active site that can be attacked by a broadly neutralizing antibody. Thus, inhibiting multiple variants with a single antibody requires the design of a multi-specific antibody that binds slightly altered epitopes to block known escape paths of the tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. While such an approach may not necessarily block all possible mutants and may create selective pressure for the emergence of new escape mutants, it will nonetheless increase the response rate and extend the duration of the response.</p>
<p>HER2, a human epidermal growth factor receptor (also known as ERBB2), is a known oncogene and is overexpressed in several cancers, <italic>e.g.</italic>, breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], ovarian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], gastric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], salivary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] and lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. In breast cancer, it is over-expressed in about 15-30% of the tumors and is associated with poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. HER2 mutations are found in 4% of all breast cancer patients and can go up to 10% in specific breast cancer subtypes. They are abundant in metastatic ER+ tumors, suggesting a role in acquired resistance to endocrine therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. In COSMIC v.95, there are 941 different cancer somatic genomic variations in HER2. There are four approved anti-HER2 antibodies, and five biosimilars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Pertuzumab (Trade name: Perjeta®)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] is a cancer treatment, approved for use in combination with Trastuzumab (trade name: Herceptin®)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] and chemotherapy for treating breast and gastric cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>].</p>
<p>Pertuzumab inhibits HER2 dimerization, thus blocking the HER signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Here, we analyzed reported somatic mutations in cancer patients and identified two HER2 mutations, S310F and S310Y, that, according to our predictions, may confer resistance to Pertuzumab. Previous studies had shown that Pertuzumab does not bind these mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], although HER2 dimerization is not disrupted by them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. In fact, due to <italic>de-novo</italic> hydrophobic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], these mutations were found to stabilize and enhance HER2 dimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Cells expressing these mutations show hyperphosphorylation of HER2 and an increase in the subsequent activation of signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Targeting these HER2 mutants is clinically important, as they were found to have oncogenic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>] and to promote cell migration, invasion, aggregation, and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Each of these mutations has been identified independently as a somatic mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], and the S310Y was obsereved as a germline variation (ClinVar Variation ID: 376188). Thus, targeting them can be relevant not only for patients that were born with these mutations and do not respond to treatment but also for patients that acquire these mutations during their illness and become resistant. While there is no clinical observation that these mutations alone confer resistance to Pertuzumab, it is clear from biochemical studies that Pertuzumab does not bind these mutants. Using computational and experimental methods, we altered the original therapeutic antibody and turned it into a multi-specific antibody. The designed antibody retains its binding to canonical HER2 while also binding the two mutants S310F and S310Y. This computationally guided design of a multi-specific antibody suggests a framework for therapeutic antibody design that may allow for therapeutic antibody candidates that could be used for larger patient populations without requiring the development and regulatory approval of new, personalized therapeutic antibody for smaller patient populations.</p>

<title>Therapeutic Abs Target Mutations</title>
<p>COSMIC Mutation Data (Targeted Screens and Genome Screens) was filtered to find mutations in contact sites of therapeutic antibodies. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the number of mutations in each step of the filtration process. We found 102 known missense mutations that alter a residue in the interface between a clinical-stage antibody and its target but do not alter protein length. The most frequent mutations were HER2 S310F and S310Y. These mutations are present on the interface with Pertuzumab (trade name: Perjeta)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] which targets HER2 for breast cancer treatment. Each of these mutations has been identified independently both as a germline variation (rs1057519816 in dbSNP) and a somatic mutation (COSMIC Mutation Genomic IDs COSV54062198 and COSV54062802, respectively).</p>

<title>HER2 mutations disrupt Pertuzumab Binding</title>
<p>Two HER2 somatic cancer mutations from COSMIC are located in the interface with Pertuzumab as calculated from the 3D structure of the complex (PDB id: 1S78) and are fairly prevalent in the population. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> shows that the predicted effects of the S310F and S310Y mutations on the Ab-Ag affinity as calculated by Maestro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] are 3.48 and 2.62 kcal/mol.

<p>S288 in the PDB structure numbering corresponds to S310 in the sequence numbering. Unless otherwise specified, below we will use the Uniprot numbering. Using a previously suggested cutoff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] of 3 kcal/mol as a guide for a significant predicted change in affinity, we estimated that these mutations will disrupt binding. The complete alignment of the canonical HER2 sequence and the crystalized residues is shown in Supplementary Figure 1. We experimentally validated these predicted effects of the mutations on the therapeutic antibody binding. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> shows experimentally measured effects of the mutations on Pertuzumab-HER2 binding for canonical HER2 as well as for the two mutants. Both S310 mutations abrogated HER2 binding to Pertuzumab. For our next objective, <italic>i.e</italic>., designing a multi-specific antibody, we attempted to engineer an antibody that binds canonical HER2 as well as both S310 mutants.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Selections Yielded Tri-Specific Binders</title>
<p>To computationally engineer a variant of Pertuzumab that binds canonical HER2 and its main mutants, S310Y and S310F, we explored two strategies. The first approach was to search for mutations that can strengthen the interaction by directly altering the patch on the antibody surface that contacts S310. The other approach was to try and form new additional contacts in areas of the antibody that are in close spatial proximity to residues in HER2 but do not form energetically beneficial contacts with Pertuzumab. To this end, we designed a library based on Pertuzumab, focusing on antibody residues that are in close spatial proximity to S310. We also included variations in residues that are not in direct contact with HER2 but are near residues that form contacts with the goal of sampling conformational changes in the region that can strengthen binding. To maintain the antibody structure, we avoided residues with multiple intra-molecular bonds and residues that are evolutionarily conserved. This resulted in fourteen positions in which we introduced diversity, allowing all 20 possible amino acids in each position. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows a structure of the Pertuzumab-HER2 complex, highlighting SER310 in cyan (numbered as 288 in the PDB residue numbering) and the fourteen selected Pertuzumab residues for the library, color-coded by the reason for choosing them: Direct contact with S310, spatial proximity to the S310, adjacency to a residue contacting S310. We also added diversity in antibody residues that contact the HER2 in other positions that are not S310, to allow for the strengthening of the complex through alternate interactions.</p>

<p><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> shows all 14 residues on Pertuzumab heavy chain that were selected for variation, with their corresponding number on the PDB 1S78 structure. Experimental constraints in yeast transformation and yeast surface display limit tractable library size to 10<sup>9</sup> variants. Hence, with reasonable undersampling, we wished to reduce the diversity of the designed library so that it’s within two orders of magnitude of the experimentally tractableize. We thus limited the number of mutations in each variant such that no more than six mutations are allowed in one sequence in the library. This also helped assure that the variants in the library are not too different from the Pertuzumab sequence and are more likely to maintain a developable profile. The 14 positions selected for the introduction of variation were divided into four groups based on their sequence position, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and the last column of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>. Based on this division we constructed the library such that each variant in the library will have representative mutations from each group, covering all possible combinations. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> shows the predetermined number of residues that were mutated from each of the four groups to reduce the diversity of the library, sampling for a total of 3.86×10<sup>11</sup> sequences. Using yeast surface display the library was selected against the three variants. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows the complete selection scheme, with two MACS rounds and two FACS rounds. After three rounds of selection, a population of putative binders was gated. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> shows the scatter plot of this gated population against each of the three variants of HER2. As illustrated by the figure, this population appears to contain binders for all three HER2 variants. The cells in the top right quadrant of each plot, which represent putative binders, were collected for the next round of selection.</p>

<p>The sequencing analysis did not identify a single sequence that bound all three variants of the HER2. We thus used the sequencing results to try and stitch together such tri-specific sequences. We analyzed the diversity observed in each position and identified all the residues that were observed in all binders of each of the three antigens – canonical HER2, S310Y, and S310F. These residues were then combined, to compose a set of residues per position that appear in at least one binder for all three antigens, as shown in Supplementary Table 1. For example, residue number 57 in Pertuzumab is Serine, but Alanine, Serine, Threonine, and Valine were found in this position in binders of all three antigens – canonical HER2, S310Y, and S310F. Subsequently, sequences composed of the residues detailed in Supplementary Table 1 in the fourteen tested positions were taken for further analysis as monoclones. This resulted in two tri-specific candidate sequences, shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>. These sequences were synthesized and inserted into yeast to assess binding.</p>

<title>A Cell-Based Assay Shows High HER3-Mutant HER2 Dimerization</title>
<p>A cell-based assay was designed to assess the functional effect of the antibodies. The assay measures signal transduction leading to HER3 phosphorylation as a result of HER2-HER3 dimerization in the presence of HRG ligand and whether a given antibody inhibits it. An initial measurement of HER3 phosphorylation is shown in Supplementary Figure 5. HER3 phosphorylation is indicative of HER2-HER3 dimerization levels. The HER2 mutant assays showed higher phosphorylated HER3 levels, implying that HER2 mutants increase HER2-HER3 dimerization levels, confirming previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Naturally occurring genomic variation can cause altered drug responses, ranging from improved binding to complete drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Multi-specific antibodies may offer a potential solution for variations that impair drug binding, with a single therapeutic antibody that binds several versions of the target with high affinity and specificity. Here, we show a computationally-aided design framework for designing multi-specific binders based on an existing binder of a single variant.</p>
<p>While the antibodies that emerged from our library may require additional refinements to become clinical leads, the results highlight two important facts. First: only five mutations sufficed to add new specificities to a mature antibody. This illustrates the plasticity of mature antibodies and the fact that they can often be further engineered to acquire an additional specificity. For at least two of our variants, this new specificity comes without paying a cost in the affinity to the original target. This may suggest that there is more room for improvement either in terms of improved affinity or in terms of additional specificities that could be added with more carefully selected mutations. Second, the simple computational design that focused on rationally identifying a handful of positions to alter in the antibody to accommodate the new specificities allowed for exhaustive screening of a tiny fraction of the sequence space. This, we proposed, is crucial when attempting to introduce new specificities to mature antibodies.</p>
<p>HER2, like many other targets, harbors point mutations that may occur somatically in cancer but are also prevalent as germline alleles in the population. In such cases, multi-specific Abs that efficiently bind multiple variants may be beneficial both by allowing efficacy on a wider initial patient population and by increasing the therapeutic index, as it blocks at least some of the tumor’s escape routes from the drug. Thinking about these mutations early, before nominating a lead candidate for development, may save the effort, cost, and time of developing a new, mutant-specific version of the drug later. Resistance mutations prior to or as a result of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) therapy have been targeted using second and even third-generation drugs, that are specific to different sets of mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. However, these are small molecules that do not possess the inherent plasticity that an antibody has due to its size. The results presented here suggest that such a scenario can be preempted to a certain degree by analyzing the patient population and considering variations early.</p>
<p>In a wider context, approaches like the one we propose here offer a path for dealing with one of the great challenges of personalized medicine, <italic>i.e.</italic>, designing a single molecule that is made the same for everyone but can act on multiple different stratified populations. The drug is not personalized yet its activity may be.</p>
<p>To identify the mutations, we used previously sequenced cancer and germline samples, enabling the use of the existing wealth of data to find mutations that can affect drug binding. Whether other mutations located in drug-target interfaces disrupt drug binding still remains to be discovered. However, the approach we described here, may allow for further engineering to cover additional escape mutations, if such mutations are identified.</p>

<title>Library Design</title>
<p>A library of sequences was designed to find an antibody that will bind both the canonical SER310 HER2 and the mutations S310Y and S310F. As only Pertuzumab heavy chain was found to be in contact with S310, its residues that are either in direct contact with SER310, adjacent to a residue that is in direct contact with S310, or in contact with HER2 and can potentially strengthen Ab-Ag binding were collected. All the bonds that these residues were involved in were calculated, as well as their evolutionary profile. Out of all collected residues, fourteen were shown to be evolutionary diverse between a hundred homologous sequences and were not involved in bonds that are likely to be essential for protein folding. In <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, these fourteen residues are listed with their classifications. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows these residues on the 1S78 structure.

<p>For transfection, COS7 cells were seeded at 1.5×10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in a 6-well plate, cultured for 24h, and transiently transfected with 5µg DNA using linear polyethyleneimine (PEI) (Polysciences, Inc, Polyethylenimine HCL MAX, MW 40000, cat: 24765-1), 15 µl PEI for 5 µg plasmid DNA per well. Transfected cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 8h. The medium was then changed to a serum-free medium for starvation. Pertuzumab IgG, Negative control IgG, and our engineered 41 and 85 IgGs were added at several concentrations for 16h. The cells were then stimulated with 10nM NRG1β (PeproTech, cat: 100-03) for 10 min at 37 °C, cooled on ice for 5 min, washed two times in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in 400 µl SIMA buffer (120mM NaCl, 25mM HEPES, 1% Triton, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EGTA, 0.75mM MgCl2, Roche Complete protease inhibitors, 1mM sodium orthovanadate,2 mM sodium fluoride, pH 7.4) per 6-well on ice for 30 min. Lysates were transferred into 1.5ml microcentrifuge tubes, spun at 15,000g for 15 min, and supernatants were transferred into fresh tubes with SDS loading dye. Phospho-HER3 (pY1289) and HER3 levels in lysates were determined by western blot. Antibodies used for detection were rabbit anti-HER3 (Cell Signaling, D22C5, 1:1,000), rabbit anti-phospho-HER3 recognizing phosphorylated tyrosine position Y1289 (Cell Signaling, 21D3, 1:1,000) and anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked antibody (Cell Signaling, cat: 7074, 1:10,000). Protein visualization by chemiluminescence and quantification was performed using AmershamTM Imager 600 (GE Healthcare).</p>

<p>In this <bold>important</bold> manuscript, the authors used unbiased approaches to identify somatic mutations in publicly available databases that would disrupt clinically approved antibodies targeting HER2. Using a <bold>solid</bold> combination of both computational and experimental approaches they identify mutations that could restore therapeutic antibody sensitivity in a series of disease-relevant model systems. Additional cell-based and in vivo assays would strengthen the work and increase the translational and potential clinical relevance of the proposed work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Starting from an unbiased search for somatic mutations (from COSMIC) likely disrupting binding of clinically approved antibodies the authors focus on mutations known to disrupt binding between two ERBB2 mutations and Pertuzamab. They use a combined computational and experimental strategy to nominate position which when mutated could result in restoring the therapeutic activity of the antibody. Using in vitro assays the authors confirm that the engineered antibody binds to the mutant ERBB2 and prevents ERBB3 phosphorylation</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) In my assessment, the data sufficiently demonstrates that a modified version of Pertuzamab can bind both the wild-type and S310 mutant forms of ERBB2.</p>
<p>(2) The engineering strategy employed is rational and effectively combines computational and experimental techniques.</p>
<p>(3) Given the clinical activity of HER2-targeting ADCs, antibodies unaffected by ERBB2 mutations would be desired</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) There is no data showing that the engineered antibody is equally specific as Pertuzamab i.e. that it does not bind to other (non-ERBB2) proteins.</p>
<p>(2) There is no data showing that the engineered antibody has the desired pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics properties or efficacy in vivo.</p>
<p>(3) Computational approaches are only used to design a phage-screen library, but not used to prioritize mutations that are likely to improve binding (e.g. based on predicted impact on the stability of the interaction). A demonstration how computational pre-screening or lead optimization can improve the time-intensive process would be a welcome advance.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>I have nothing to add beyond my first review, because no substantial changes, additional experiments and/or data, have been made to the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Peled et al identified HER2 mutations in connection with resistance to the anti-HER2 antibody Pertuzumab-mediated therapy. After constructing a yeast display library of Pertuzumab variants with 3.86×10^11 sequences for targeted screening of variant combinations in chosen 6 out of 14 residues, the authors performed experimental screening to obtain the clones that bind to HER2 WT and/or mutants (S310Y and S310F), and then combined new variations to obtain antibodies with a broad spectrum binding to both WT and two HER2 mutants. These are interesting studies of clinical impact and translational potential.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Deep computational analyses of large datasets of clinical data provide useful information about HER2 mutations and their potential relevance to antibody therapy resistance.</p>
<p>(2) There is valuable information analyzing the residues within or near the interface between the antigen HER2 and the Pertuzumab antibody (heavy chain).</p>
<p>
The experimental antibody library screening obtained 90+ clones from 3.86×10^11 sequences for further functional validation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) There is lack of assessment for antibody variant functions in cancer cell phenotypes in vitro (proliferation, cell death, motility) or in vivo (tumor growth and animal survival). The only assay was the western blotting of phosphopho-HER3 in Figure 4. However, HER2 levels and phosphor-HER2 were not analyzed.</p>
<p>(2) There is misleading impression from the title of computational engineering of a therapeutic antibody and the statement in the abstract &quot;we designed a multi-specific version of Pertuzumab that retains original function while also bindings these HER2 variants&quot; for a few reasons:</p>
<p>a. The primary method used for variant antibody identification for HER2 mutant binding is rather traditional experimental screening based on yeast display instead of computational design of a multi-specific version of Pertuzumab.</p>
<p>b. There is insufficient or lack of computational power in the antibody design or prioritization in choosing variant residues for the library construction of 3.86×1011 sequences. It seems random combinations from 6 residues out of 4 groups with 20 amino acid options.</p>
<p>
c. The final version of tri-binding variant is a combination of screened antibody clones instead of computation design from scratch.</p>
<p>
d. There is incomplete experimental evidence about the therapeutic values of newly obtained antibody clones.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>Two major comments remain and have not been well addressed. Comment 1 is expecting any cellular phenotypic analysis if not in vivo. Comment 2 requires some modifications to avoid overstating.</p>

<p>Thank you for this important comment. In the present ms we indeed used a computational approach for prioritizing residues to be mutated, but we did not prioritize the mutations that are likely to improve binding. In the initial library design, we did prioritize the mutations. However, due to experimental approach limitations with codon’s selection for the library, we had decided to allow all possible residues in each position, knowing that the selection will remove non-binding variants.</p>

<p>We indeed did not assess the engineered antibodies function in cancer cells. While a complete signaling assessment obviously requires functional assessment as well, due to the complexity of this assay, papers in this field (for example [1-3]) measure the signaling activation following HER2-HER3 dimerization by measuring pHER3, and we relied on them in this ms.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this relevant comment. When addressing relevant residues to be mutated, the number of potential variants is enormous. The computational approach was aimed at identifying the most preferable residues, in which variation can improve binding and is not likely to harm important interactions. Although an initial smaller number of residues could be chosen, we decided to broaden our view and create a larger library, in the aim of combining the computational selection with an experimental selection. This indeed is not a computational design from scratch, but rather an intercourse between the computer and the lab, that yielded the presented results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figures can be improved with better labeling and organization. Some essential pieces of data such as Supplementary Figure 1B on HER2 mutations in S310 that abrogated its binding to Pertuzumab should be placed in the main figures.</p>

<p>Thank you for this comment, the relevant figures were moved to the main text, and the labels were revised.</p>

<p>High-quality figures were submitted with the revised ms.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>(1) It should be clarified whether the S310 somatic mutations represent resistance mutations to Pertuzamab (i.e. emerge post-therapy) or are general mutations that activate HER2. This is important because mutations that specifically &quot;evade&quot; the binding of an antibody may be substantially more difficult to overcome than mutations that only by chance occur in the antibody binding site. This concern should be addressed in the introduction and discussion as it changes the interpretation of the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a very important note. To the best of our knowledge, these mutations were not identified as resistance mutations that emerged post-therapy. However, as mentioned in the introduction, these mutations form hydrophobic interactions that stabilize HER2 dimerization. Moreover, cells expressing these mutations show hyperphosphorylation of HER2 and an increase in the subsequent activation of signaling pathways. Thus, these mutations do not necessarily evade Pertuzumab binding, but benefit cancer growth. This point was clarified in the introduction of the revised text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) While the authors claim that S310 germline pathogenic variants exist, I could not find evidence that this is the case. The dbGAP ID does not provide any evidence (either in the form of a citation or prevalence). The variants do not exist in GnomAD. A recent article discussing pathogenic ERBB2 germline variants only mentions S310 as a somatic variant <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8268839">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8268839</ext-link>/ and I could not find evidence for S310 being a germline variant in the references provided by the author (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3391">https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3391</ext-link>) - where it is only mentioned as a somatic mutation. I could not find evidence of a cancer predisposition syndrome associated with this variant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for highlighting this matter. We had assumed that the presence of the variant in dbSNP means it is also a germline mutations, what may not be correct. However, we did find some evidence of this mutation as germline in ClinVar, and this was edited in the revised ms. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV001311879.7">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV001311879.7</ext-link>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors should consider experiments that show that the modified Pertuzamab has the same mechanism of action as the original Pertuzamab in preventing dimerization of the ERBB2 homodimer and/or interactions with ERBB3. I cannot recommend a specific approach, but at present it is not clear whether the mechanism or just the effect (phosphorylation of ERBB3) is the same.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, for the assessment of HER-HER3 binding and HER3 signaling, in this ms we relied on a previous works [1-3] that also measured the signaling activation following HER2-HER3 dimerization by measuring pHER3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors should perform in vitro experiments to demonstrate that the engineered antibody has similar on-target specificity not only sensitivity. I don't know what the ideal experiments would be, but should probably probe native epitopes. Western blots, immunoprecipitation of cell lysates?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, showing the specificity of the engineered antibodies is indeed important. We did not address it in the current ms, but it can be tested in future work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor:</p>
<p>(1) The introduction should review better the literature on the computational/rational design of antibodies, especially multi-specific - and likely de-emphasize small molecules (and mutations associated with the resistance thereof) as the presented research does not inform the design of mutation-agnostic small molecules.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for these comments, the introduction was revised accordingly.</p>

<p>(2) The authors should better present the fact that the lack of binding of Pertuzamab to HER2 S310 was previously known, thus the whole strategy of searching COSMIC, and computationally predicting their binding impact was unnecessary. Rather it would be helpful to learn how many other COSMIC hotspots could have a similar effect on other clinical antibodies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The lack of binding was indeed previously known, as mentioned in the introduction. However, we did not start our analysis targeting HER2 specifically, but we rather found these mutations because they were located in the binding pocket, which enabled our strategy to compensate for these mutations with alteration of the original Pertuzumab. Regarding other potential hotspots, the numbers appeared in Supplementary Table 1, and were moved to the main text.</p>

<p>Stylistic:</p>
<p>(1) Avoid using the term &quot;drug&quot; for an antibody.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The term was changed to “antibody therapeutics” in the revised text.</p>

<p>(2) Avoid repetition in the introduction.</p>

<p>Thank you, we revised the introduction with this comment in mind.</p>

<p>The quality of Figure 2B-C flow data needs to be improved:</p>
<p>a. The diagonal populations suggest inappropriate color compensation or indicate cells are derived from unhealthy populations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe there may be some confusion here. The figures you are referring to are figures of very diverse library. The selected clones show nice diagonals, as shown in Supplementary Figure 5.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b. Additional round 3 and round 4 did not seem to improve the enrichment of targeted clones but rather had similar binding profiles to each of the three proteins over and over.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Two sets of the fourth round of selection were done, each originated from a different sub-population in round 3: 1. Clones that bind the S310Y mutation 2. Clones that bind the S310F mutation. The aim of the R4 was to examine this binders against the second mutation and canonical HER2 in the search for multi-specificity. Additional clarification of this point will be added to the main text.</p>
