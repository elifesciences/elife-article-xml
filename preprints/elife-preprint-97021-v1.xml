<title>Abstract</title><p>Despite advances in therapeutic approaches, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. To understand the molecular programs underlying lung cancer initiation and maintenance, we focused on stem cell programs that are normally extinguished with differentiation but can be reactivated during oncogenesis. Here we have used extensive genetic modeling and patient derived xenografts to identify a dual role for Msi2: as a signal that acts initially to sensitize cells to transformation, and subsequently to drive tumor propagation. Using Msi reporter mice, we found that Msi2-expressing cells were marked by a pro-oncogenic landscape and a preferential ability to respond to Ras and p53 mutations. Consistent with this, genetic deletion of Msi2 in an autochthonous Ras/p53 driven lung cancer model resulted in a marked reduction of tumor burden, delayed progression, and a doubling of median survival. Additionally, this dependency was conserved in human disease as inhibition of Msi2 impaired tumor growth in patient-derived xenografts. Mechanistically, Msi2 triggered a broad range of pathways critical for tumor growth, including several novel effectors of lung adenocarcinoma. Collectively, these findings reveal a critical role for Msi2 in aggressive lung adenocarcinoma, lend new insight into the biology of this disease, and identify potential new therapeutic targets.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lung cancer is the second most common type of cancer. While the death rate due to lung cancer has decreased over time due to a drop in the prevalence of smoking, it is still by far the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and women, resulting in more deaths than colon, breast, and prostate cancer combined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most prevalent form of lung cancer, accounting for 84% of lung cancer cases. Within this cancer type, adenocarcinoma is the most frequent subtype, accounting for 50% of all NSCLCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Most cases of lung cancer are diagnosed at late-stage— when there is regional or distant spread of the disease—at which time treatment options are limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Despite advances in lung cancer therapy, the 5-year survival rates for late-stage (i.e. regional or distant) NSCLC are 37% to 9%, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. These survival rates highlight the critical need for improved understanding of the biology of this disease in order to develop more effective treatments.</p>
<p>To understand the key dependencies of lung cancer, we have focused on stem cell programs which are often co-opted to perpetuate an aggressive, undifferentiated state. The stem cell fate determinant Musashi-2 (Msi2) is one such signal that has been shown to be critical in development as well as advanced cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>; however, its role in lung cancer is not well understood. Msi2 has been reported to be overexpressed in human lung adenocarcinoma and regional metastases, and its inhibition in human cell lines has been shown to reduce invasive and metastatic potential <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. However, this study focused on <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis utilizing human NSCLC cell lines; thus, no evidence for a role of Msi2 <italic>in vivo</italic> using definitive genetic mouse models exist. Further, whether Msi2 is a dependency for tumor initiation or required for continued propagation, and which pathways are regulated by Msi2 to drive tumor growth, also remain unknown. Here we have utilized a combination of genetic models and patient-derived xenografts to determine the role of Msi2 signaling in the growth and progression of lung adenocarcinoma. Using Msi2 knock-in reporter mice and Msi2 conditional knockout mice, we show that Msi2 plays a dual role in lung adenocarcinoma, acting as a signal that not only is essential for initiation, but one that continues to be required post-establishment in both genetically-engineered mouse models and in patient-derived xenografts. Finally, using RNA-sequencing analysis we show that Msi2 can trigger a range of pathways critical for tumor growth, including several new effectors of lung adenocarcinoma. These findings suggest that Msi2 is a critical regulator of lung adenocarcinoma and offer new insight into the signals that facilitate transformation and support disease progression.</p>

<title>Msi2 is expressed in normal lung and in adenocarcinoma</title>
<p>To determine whether Musashi regulates the growth and progression of aggressive lung cancer we first determined whether Msi2 is expressed in stem cells of the distal lung. We used a Msi2<sup>eGFP/+</sup> knock-in reporter mouse to track endogenous Msi2 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, and found that Msi2 is expressed in 39% of Lin<sup>-</sup>EpCAM<sup>+</sup> lung epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) and, more specifically, in 37% of cells enriched for Club/BASC cells and 26% of cells enriched for AT2 cells—the known stem cell populations of the distal lung (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>). Interestingly, although Msi2 expression could only be detected in a fraction of distal lung stem cells, widespread expression of Msi2 was often observed in lung adenocarcinomas formed in Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>; p53<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). The expansion of Msi2 expression in lung tumors compared to normal lung epithelia suggests that normal cells expressing Msi2 are more sensitive to transformation, or that once transformed, Msi2 expression is amplified in tumor cells.</p>

<title>Msi2-expressing cells are more responsive to transformation by mutant Ras and p53</title>
<p>To determine whether Msi2 expression marks cells with increased capacity for tumor growth, we generated Msi2-reporter Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>; p53<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with inducible Cre expression (Msi2<sup>eGFP/+</sup>; Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>; p53<sup>fl/fl</sup>; RosaCre<sup>ER/+</sup>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), delivered tamoxifen, isolated Msi2<sup>+</sup> and Msi2<sup>-</sup> lung epithelial cells, and tested sphere-forming capacity. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, Msi2<sup>+</sup> cells had enhanced sphere-forming capacity, with a 6-fold increase in sphere-forming observed at primary passage, and this capacity was retained for up to 4 passages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Further, spheres that were isolated and transplanted subcutaneously into the flanks of immunocompromised mice developed Msi2-expressing tumors <italic>in vivo</italic> as well as metastatic lesions in the lung, demonstrating that the observed sphere-forming capacity is reflective of tumorigenicity and not merely stem cell capacity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-E</xref>). To understand the basis for the enhanced tumorigenic capacity of Msi2<sup>+</sup> cells, we carried out RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) to examine the transcriptional landscape of Msi2-expressing cells in normal lung epithelia. Interestingly, the differentially expressed gene (DEG) profile showed that Msi2<sup>+</sup> cells are transcriptionally distinct from Msi2<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) further revealed that Msi2<sup>+</sup> cells are significantly enriched for signatures related to developmental and stem cell signaling, consistent with the known role of Msi2 as a critical regulator of the stem cell state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, as well as signatures related to oncogenic signaling and therapy resistance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2K</xref>) which are associated with aggressive cancers. Over 1,900 differentially expressed genes were found to be enriched in the Msi2<sup>+</sup> population. In line with the GSEA results, these enriched genes included those involved in developmental and stem cell signaling (such as <italic>Dll1, Jag2,</italic> and <italic>Notch3)</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, oncogenic signaling (such as <italic>Akt3, Ret, Myb, and Fos</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, and therapy resistance (such as <italic>Axl</italic>, <italic>Egr1,</italic> and several glutathione S transferases implicated in platinum drug resistance including <italic>Gstp1 and Gsta2</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2J</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2L</xref>). These findings suggest that prior to tumor initiation, the transcriptional landscape of Msi2-expressing cells is enriched in signaling programs that are conducive to tumorigenesis, which may make them uniquely poised for transformation.</p>

<title>Genetic deletion of Msi2 leads to a decrease in tumor incidence, burden, and progression</title>
<p>To determine if Msi2 not only marks a cell with an enhanced capacity for lung adenocarcinoma growth, but whether it may also be required for initiation of these tumors, we compared wild type and Msi2 knock-out Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>; p53<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (Msi2<sup>-/-</sup>; Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>; p53<sup>fl/fl</sup>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). In this model, the <italic>Msi2</italic> gene has been disrupted via gene trap mutagenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, while the inhalation of adenoviral-Cre (Ad-Cre) results in the conditional activation of Kras and inactivation of p53 in the lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Importantly, loss of Msi2 led to the formation of significantly fewer (84%) tumor lesions as well as a significantly lower (85%) overall tumor burden in the lung at a 14-week midpoint (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-D</xref>). Further, while there was no difference in the frequency of low-grade tumors, there was a significant decrease in the frequency of mid- and high-grade tumors (45-54%), suggesting that loss of Msi2 delayed tumor progression from low to high grade (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Importantly, Msi2<sup>-/-</sup> KP<sup>f/f</sup> mice infected with Ad-Cre developed tumors less frequently than their wild type counterparts (61% Msi2<sup>-/-</sup> vs 83% Msi2<sup>+/+</sup>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). To confirm that the population of lung stem cells is not reduced in Msi2 knockout mice and therefore contributing to a decrease in tumor lesions, we stained the lungs of WT and Msi2 knockout mice for Club/BASC and AT2 lung stem cells and saw no difference (data not shown). Additionally, Msi2<sup>-/-</sup> KP<sup>f/f</sup> mice displayed a significant increase in overall survival compared to Msi2<sup>+/+</sup> KP<sup>f/f</sup> mice. Msi2<sup>+/+</sup> KP<sup>f/f</sup> mice had a median survival of 209 days while the Msi2<sup>-/-</sup> KP<sup>f/f</sup> mice had a median survival of 428 days, reflecting a 2-fold increase in survival (p = 0.04, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Notably, the majority of lung tumors that formed in Msi2<sup>-/-</sup> KP<sup>f/f</sup> mice were found to express Msi2, suggesting that the tumors that formed in Msi2<sup>-/-</sup> KP<sup>f/f</sup> mice were escapers that re-expressed Msi2, underscoring the dependency on Msi2 signaling for tumor formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). Taken together these results suggest that Msi2 not only marks cells with an enhanced capacity for tumor growth but is also required for initiation and progression of lung adenocarcinoma.</p>

<p>The analyses described above were performed in Msi2<sup>-/-</sup> KP<sup>f/f</sup> mice, and therefore in an environment in which Msi2 is absent at the onset of tumorigenesis. To test whether established cancers have a similar dependency on Msi2 for their growth, we knocked down Msi2 in primary tumor cell lines generated from Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>; p53<sup>fl/fl</sup> lung tumors (KP<sup>f/f</sup> cell line) and measured tumorsphere formation. Importantly, loss of Msi2 led to a significant decrease (75%) in tumorsphere formation <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that Msi2 is required for tumor cell propagation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B</xref>). To confirm this finding <italic>in vivo</italic>, Msi2 knockdown KP<sup>f/f</sup> cells were transplanted into the flanks of syngeneic mice, and tumor growth monitored over time. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, the Msi2-knockdown tumors had significantly reduced (89%) tumor cell numbers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-D</xref>), indicating that established tumors remain dependent on Msi2 signaling for growth. To determine the relevance of our findings for human disease, we examined the effect of Msi2 inhibition on primary patient samples. To this end, patient samples were transplanted into immunocompromised mice to generate patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Once established, PDX tumors were harvested, dissociated, transduced with either shControl or shMsi2 lentivirus, and subsequently transplanted into the flanks of immunocompromised mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Importantly, although an equivalent number of shControl and shMsi2 cells were transplanted into recipient mice, there was a notable delay in the growth of Msi2-knockdown tumors, which were 64-88% smaller than control tumors at endpoint (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). These findings suggest that human lung adenocarcinomas are dependent on Msi2 for their continued growth.</p>

<title>Msi2 regulates signaling pathways critical for tumor growth</title>
<p>To understand the mechanism by which Msi2 impacts tumor growth, we knocked down Msi2 in KP<sup>f/f</sup> cell lines and carried out an RNAseq analysis comparing control and knock-down cells. Principal component analysis shows a clear separation between the control and Msi2-knockdown cells and significant changes in over ∼170 genes, highlighting the marked impact that loss of Msi2 has on the transcriptional profile of lung adenocarcinoma (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Consistent with the role of Msi2 in stem cell maintenance, the inhibition of Msi2 in lung cancer cells had a significant impact on developmental and stem cell signaling programs and genes, this included <italic>Porcn,</italic> the transcription regulator <italic>Nupr1,</italic> and the NuRD complex member <italic>Mbd3</italic>, which have been shown to play a role in the maintenance of the stem cell state (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In addition, Msi2 impacted a broad range of other signaling programs and their associated genes, including DNA repair and metabolism. DNA repair genes included <italic>Brca1</italic>, <italic>Atm</italic>, and several Fanconi anemia complementation group genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, and metabolism programs included the gluconeogenesis enzyme <italic>Pck2</italic>, which has been shown to promote lung cancer cell survival in low glucose conditions, several isoforms of <italic>Cpt1</italic>, a key regulator in fatty acid oxidation known to promote tumor growth in a variety of cancers, and the glutamate dehydrogenase <italic>Glud1</italic>, which has been shown to promote tumorigenesis in lung cancer xenografts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>-G<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>). Interestingly, several known regulators of lung adenocarcinoma such as <italic>Gli1</italic>, a canonical downstream effector of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, βIII tubulin (<italic>Tubb3)</italic>, and CC Chemokine Receptor 1 (<italic>Ccr1)</italic> were found to be significantly downregulated following Msi2 inhibition as well (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. These data suggest that Msi2 is a regulator of a variety of signaling pathways that are critical to tumor growth and lung cancer progression. In addition to these known regulators, a number of genes not previously implicated in lung cancer were found to be significantly downregulated following Msi2 inhibition, suggesting that they may play a role in tumor growth (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I-J</xref>). To identify potential novel regulators of lung adenocarcinoma we focused on significantly downregulated genes that were highly expressed, which narrowed our gene list to 30 potential candidates. PCR based validation and prioritization of those genes with no known role in lung cancer led to a subset that included genes such as the E3 ubiquitin ligase <italic>Rnf157</italic>, which promotes neuronal growth through the inhibition of apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, Synaptotagmin 11 (<italic>Syt11)</italic>, a critical mediator of neuronal vesicular trafficking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, prostoglandin D2 synthase (<italic>Ptgds</italic>) known to be involved in reproductive organ development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, and ADP ribosylation like binding protein (<italic>Arl2bp),</italic> a known regulator of STAT3 signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. To test whether these genes regulate tumor cell growth we knocked down each of these genes (<italic>Ptgds</italic>, <italic>Arl2bp</italic>, <italic>Rnf157</italic>, and <italic>Syt11</italic>) in the KP<sup>f/f</sup> cell line. Inhibition of each target led to a significant decrease (88-98%) in the formation of tumor spheres <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K</xref>). These findings not only identify these genes as downstream effectors of Msi2 activity but more generally show that this dataset could be an important resource to identify new regulators of lung adenocarcinoma growth.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The stem cell fate determinant Msi2 is commonly found to be expressed in carcinomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> and Msi signaling has been shown to contribute to colon adenomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> and maintain the aggressive, undifferentiated state in hematologic malignancies and pancreatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Here we have used genetically-engineered and autochthonous models to show that Msi2 is critically required in the development and progression of primary lung adenocarcinoma. Msi2 signaling emerges as a key dependency at initiation and continues to be needed during tumor progression. Using the well-established Kras<sup>G12D</sup>; p53<sup>flox/flox</sup> (KP<sup>fl/fl</sup>) mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, we created a Msi2 knock-out lung adenocarcinoma model and found that deletion of Msi2 at initiation significantly impaired tumor incidence, reduced tumor burden and progression, and cumulatively led to a doubling of median survival. Furthermore, loss of Msi2 impaired propagation of established KP<sup>fl/fl</sup> tumors <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In order to determine whether these findings were relevant for the human disease, we used patient-derived xenografts, which have proven to be a highly valuable tool for understanding the biology of human cancers and have been shown to faithfully predict therapeutic response in a majority of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Inhibition of Msi2 in PDXs also led to impaired tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting that dependence on Msi2 is conserved in human lung adenocarcinoma.</p>
<p>Our finding that the loss of Msi2 prior to transformation significantly impacts tumor initiation prompts the interesting question of whether Msi2 signaling can influence early tumor growth for lung adenocarcinoma. Previous use of the KP<sup>fl/fl</sup> model has illustrated how both the cellular and molecular context at the time of transformation influences subsequent cancer development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Using cell-type specific Ad-Cre to drive the expression of either Kras<sup>G12D</sup> alone or Kras<sup>G12D</sup> in combination with p53<sup>flox/flox</sup>, work by Sutherland et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> has shown that the cell of origin for adenocarcinoma differs based on the genetic mutations used to drive the cancer. When Kras<sup>G12D</sup> alone was used as the driver, AT2 cells were able to form adenomas which then progressed to adenocarcinomas, while Club cells were only able to form adenomas which did not progress further. However, when Kras<sup>G12D</sup> was used in combination with p53<sup>flox/flox</sup>, both cell types were capable of forming adenomas which could then progress to adenocarcinomas. While both genetic drivers and the cell of origin are key components for tumor formation, whether there are signaling factors that endow the cell of origin with the capacity to transform when presented with these key drivers is an area that has been less explored. In this context, our work sheds new light on such signals required at initiation as we found that Msi2 is expressed in a subpopulation of distal lung stem cells, that cells expressing Msi2 are preferentially sensitive to transformation, and that its genetic ablation leads to a marked decrease in tumor initiation and progression. The results of our RNAseq analysis suggest that this enhanced capacity may be established through an enrichment in signaling programs involved in the maintenance of an undifferentiated state as well as those known to support aggressive tumor growth which then provides a permissive environment for early tumor growth and development. These findings identify a new role for Msi2 signaling as an enhancer of tumor growth for lung adenocarcinoma and indicate that subpopulations harboring these signals may be particularly primed for transformation.</p>
<p>The continued dependency on Msi2 signaling following tumor initiation illustrates the potency of Msi2 as a regulator of tumor progression; thus, defining the mechanism by which Msi2 exerts this influence in lung adenocarcinoma would be critical to understanding the molecular basis of its broad influence. Here, our RNAseq analysis suggests that Msi2 may act in part as a regulator of the stem cell state. Interestingly, this analysis also showed that the role of Msi2 may extend to the regulation of processes crucial for tumor growth, such as metabolism and DNA repair, thus placing it upstream of multiple potent oncogenic signals. This work also led to the identification of several novel effectors of lung adenocarcinoma regulated by Msi2. Our functional experiments inhibiting these genes showed that loss of <italic>Ptgds</italic>, <italic>Arl2bp</italic>, <italic>Rnf157</italic>, and <italic>Syt11</italic> can block lung cancer sphere formation. Previous work has shown that Ptgds indirectly facilitates phosphorylated Sox9 nuclear translocation via activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> and is important in the development of Sertoli cells. While <italic>Ptgds</italic> has been shown previously to be expressed in human lung tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> our work is the first to identify a functional role of Ptgds in lung adenocarcinoma. As a regulator of STAT3 signaling, Arl2bp directly binds to the STAT3 transcription factor, which maintains STAT3’s phosphorylation status and its localization in the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. STAT3 activity has been implicated in NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, thus modulating STAT3 activity through <italic>Arl2bp</italic> inhibition may provide an alternative therapeutic strategy. Lastly, both Rnf157 and Syt11 are predominantly expressed in the brain and have been implicated in neuronal cell survival and dendrite growth and neuronal vesicular trafficking, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Thus far, their roles have not been investigated in cancer. Our findings suggest the need for further study of these genes and raise the possibility that they could serve as future therapeutic targets.</p>
<p>While early treatment approaches centered principally on the use of cytotoxic agents, the treatment of lung cancer has evolved to incorporate the use of targeted therapies and immunotherapy, when appropriate, in combination with the standard cytotoxic regimen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. For patients with a lung cancer subtype harboring known targetable mutations, this has led to considerable improvements in the response to treatment. Yet troubling survival rates, driven largely by either late-stage detection or recurrence of the disease—even in cases for which a targeted therapy has been offered— illustrate the need for an increased understanding of the biology of lung cancer in order to inform future therapeutic approaches. The findings presented here identify a novel role for Msi2 in the growth and progression of lung adenocarcinoma and suggest that this role extends to human disease. Further, these findings identify novel effectors of lung adenocarcinoma regulated by Msi2 thereby lending new insight into the mechanism by which Msi2 exerts its influence on this disease. These new insights enhance our understanding of the biology of lung adenocarcinoma and may serve to open new avenues of focus for future therapeutic strategies.</p>

For tumorsphere assays involving Msi2<sup>eGFP/+</sup>; Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>; p53<sup>fl/fl</sup>; RosaCre<sup>ER/+</sup> mice, tamoxifen treatment and cell sorting for CD45-CD31-EpCAM+GFP+ (Msi2<sup>+</sup>) and CD45-CD31-EpCAM+GFP-(Msi2-) cell populations were performed as described. After sorting, cells were resuspended in full media [1X DMEM:F12 (Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10%FBS, 1X pen/strep (Fisher Scientific), 1X N-2 supplement (Life Technologies), 35ug/mL bovine pituitary extract (Fisher Scientific), 20ng/mL recombinant mouse EGF (Biolegend), 20ng/mL recombinant mouse FGF (R&amp;D Systems)]. Resuspended cells were mixed with an equal volume of growth factor reduced Matrigel (Corning) for a total volume of 100µL, plated in 96 well flat-bottom plates (Fisher Scientific) at a density of 500 cells/well. Matrigel was allowed to solidify at 37°C for 20 min, and 150 µL of full media was added to the well. Tumorsphere cultures were incubated at 37°C for 10-14 days with the media refreshed once a week. To passage cells, tumorspheres were dissociated from surrounding Matrigel by removing the media, adding 200 µL of 2mg/mL collagenase/dispase (Millipore Sigma) to the wells, and incubating for 1 hour at 37°C. Cells were collected and placed on ice, the wells were washed 3X with full media, and each media collection was pooled on ice with the original cell collection. Cells were pelleted via centrifugation at 500 rcf for 5 minutes at 4°C, media was aspirated, 200 µL of cold Accumax (Innovative Cell Technologies) was added to the cell pellet, and cells were incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes. Cells were manually pipetted 100X to dissociate tumorspheres and examined via hemocytometer to determine if a single cell suspension had been obtained. The incubation and mechanical dissociation were repeated 2-3X until a single cell suspension was obtained. Cells were resuspended in full media, and 500 cells were plated at a 1:1 ratio with growth factor reduced Matrigel (Corning) at a final volume of 100 µL.

<title>Flank Transplant Assays</title>
<p>For flank transplant assays of mouse lung cancer cell lines involving genetic inhibition via shRNA, low passage KP<sup>f/f</sup> cell lines were transduced with shRNA lentivirus, sorted, and 20,000 cells were resuspended in a 1:1 mix of full media and Matrigel (Corning) at a final volume of 100 µL in the manner described.

Subcutaneous tumors were measured with calipers once weekly for 6-15 weeks and did not exceed 2cm in diameter. At endpoint, flank tumors were removed, and tumors were dissociated as described. Tumor cells were stained with CD45-PeCy7 and CD31-PeCy7, and the absolute number of tumor cells was calculated by multiplying the percentage of CD45-CD31- transduced cells by the total number of CD45-CD31- live cells. For flank transplant assays of patient-derived xenografts, freshly dissociated xenografts were plated in full media [1X DMEM:F12 (Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10%FBS, 1X pen/strep (Fisher Scientific), 1X N-2 supplement (Life Technologies), 35ug/mL bovine pituitary extract (Fisher Scientific), 20ng/mL recombinant human EGF (Life Technologies), 20ng/mL recombinant human FGF-basic (Fisher Scientific)]. 500,000 cells/well were plated in a 6-well plate (Fisher Scientific) coated with Matrigel (Corning) for subsequent transplant, and 83,000 cells/well were plated in a 24-well plate (Fisher Scientific) coated with Matrigel (Corning) for subsequent determination of transduction efficiency via FACS. Cells were transduced with proportionate amounts of shControl or shMsi2 lentivirus. 24 hours after transduction, media from the cells intended for transplant was collected and placed on ice. 1mL of 2mg/mL collagenase/dispase (Millipore Sigma) was then added to the well and incubated for 45 minutes at 37°C to dissociate the remaining cells from Matrigel. The wells were washed 3X with full media and each wash was collected and pooled on ice with the media previously collected. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C, an equivalent number of shControl and shMsi2 transduced cells were resuspended in full media, mixed at a 1:1 ratio with growth factor reduced Matrigel (Corning) at a final volume of 100 µL, and transplanted subcutaneously into the flanks of NSG recipient mice. Tumor growth was monitored 1-2X a week via caliper measurement for 11-12 weeks and did not exceed 2cm in diameter. 48 hours after transduction, cells from the 24-well plate were collected in the manner described using a proportionate amount of reagents, and the frequency of transduced live cells was determined via FACS. For flank transplant assays of cells from Msi2<sup>eGFP/+</sup>; Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>; p53<sup>fl/fl</sup>; RosaCre<sup>ER/+</sup> tumorspheres, quaternary passage tumorspheres were dissociated from surrounding Matrigel in the manner described. Cells were resuspended in full media, mixed at a 1:1 ratio with growth factor reduced Matrigel (Corning) at a final volume of 100 µL, and transplanted subcutaneously into the flanks of NSG recipient mice. Tumor growth was monitored 1-2X a week via caliper measurement for 13 weeks and did not exceed 2cm in diameter. At endpoint, both the flank tumor and lungs were collected for fixation and H&amp;E analysis in the manner described. Lung H&amp;E sections were analyzed for the presence of metastatic tumors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Here, the authors, Barber AG et al, developed a new mouse model and investigated an importance of Musashi-2 in lung cancer. Specifically, they found that Musashi-2 is important for lung cancer cells as it controls cancer cell growth, and also regulates several genes that also control cancer cell growth. Development of a new Musashi-2 mouse model is a plus, which confirmed Musashi-2 importance for lung cancer survival, and finding several genes that Musashi controls that are important for lung cancer growth. Additionally, they demonstrated that Musashi-2 overexpression which is tracked by GFP is preferred in lung adenocarcinoma cells. The data is rigorous and only minor revisions are requested.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Authors achieved their goals, by developing new Musashi-2 mouse model, confirming Musashi-2 importance for lung cancer survival, and finding several genes that Musashi controls that are important for lung cancer growth.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The findings of Musashi-2 mouse and human lung cancer growth control are not that novel as prior publication in 2016 showed that already, again, in both human and mouse models (Kudinov et al PNAS, PMID: 27274057), and also the authors missed the point of that paper which did use both miuse and human models to show impact on inbvasion and metastasis- both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, another publication is currently under revisions recently also generated new Musashi-2 transgenic mouse model which confirmed Musashi-2 support of lung cancer growth (Bychkov I et al, PMID: 37398283; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.13.544756v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.13.544756v1</ext-link>). Another weakness is that Musashi-2 cannot be effectively targeted and the new genes the authors found that Musashi-2 regulates are likely to be also difficult therapeutic targets. Therefore, impact of this new investigation is relatively modest in the field.</p>
<p>Major suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 3: it is unclear what is the efficiency of Msi2 deletion shRNA - could you demonstrate it by at least two independent methods? (QPCR, Western, or IHC?) please quantitate the data.</p>
<p>(2) In Figure 4, similarly, it is unclear if Msi2 depletion was effective- and what is shRNA efficiency. Please test this by at least two independent methods (QPCR, Western, or IHC) and also please quantitate the data</p>
<p>(3) the reason for impairment of cell growth demonstrated in Figs 3 and 4 is not clear: is it apoptosis? Necrosis? Cell cycle defects? Autophagy? Senescence? Please probe 2-3 possibilities and provide the data.</p>
<p>(4) Since Musashi-1 is a Musashi-2 paralogue that could compensate for Musashi-2 loss, please test Msi1 expression levels in matching Fig 3 and Fig 4 sections (in cells/ tumors with Msi2 deletion and in KP cells with Msi2 shRNA). One method could suffice here.</p>
<p>(5) It is not exactly clear why RNA-seq (as opposed to proteomics) was done to investigate downstream Msi2 targets (since Msi2 is in first place, translational and not transcriptional regulator)- . RNA effects in Fig 5J are quite modest, 2-fold or so. It would be useful (if antibodies available) to test four targets in Fig 5J by Western blot, to see any impact of musashi-2 depletion on those target protein levels. Indeed, several papers - including Kudinov et al PNAS, PMID: 27274057, Makhov P et al PMID: 33723247 and PMID: 37173995 - used proteomics/ RIP approaches and found direct Musashi-2 targets in lung cancer, including EGFR, and others.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Alison G. Barber et al. reports the function of Msi2 in mouse models of non-small cell lung cancer. The expression of Msi2 in normal lung was evaluated using a knockin reporter allele. Msi2 expressing cells were found to be around 30-40% in normal lung epithelium without a strong bias in subsets of lung cells. Knocking out Msi2 in a KrasG12D and P53 KO model reduced lung cancer initiation. Knocking down Msi2 in established lung cancer cells reduced in vitro sphere formation and in vivo xenograft. Finally, the authors identified several genes whose expression was downregulated by Msi2 knockdown. Knocking down four of these genes, including Ptgds, Arl2bp, hRnf157, and Syt11, each with a single shRNA, reduced lung sphere formation in vitro, suggesting their involvement in lung cancer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript represents an interesting advance on the role of Msi2 in lung cancer. While some of the data (for example the knockdown effect of Msi2 in established lung cancer cells) corroborated previous findings, the study of Msi2 expression in normal lung and the characterization of the KO phenotype in lung cancer initiation are new and interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Two areas can be further strengthened. Several conclusions are not fully supported by the existing data. The stable/dynamic nature of Msi2 expressing cells in lung would benefit from more detailed investigations for proper data interpretation.</p>
<p>(1) It will be interesting to determine whether Msi2+ cells are a relatively stable subset or rather the Msi2+ cells in lung is a dynamic concept that is transient or interconvertible. This is relevant to the interpretation of what Msi2 positivity really means.</p>
<p>(2) Does Kras mutation and/or p53 loss upregulate Msi2? This point and the point above are related to whether Msi2+ cells are truly more susceptible to tumorigenesis, as the authors suggested.</p>
<p>(3) The KO of Msi2 reducing tumor number and burden in the lung cancer initiation model is interesting. However, there are two alternative interpretations. First, it is possible that the Msi2 KO mice (without Kras activation and p53 loss) has reduced total lung cell numbers or altered percentage of stem cells. There is currently only one sentence citing data not shown on line 125, commenting that there is no difference in BASC and AT2 cell populations. It will be helpful that such data are shown and the effect of KO on overall lung mass or cellularity is clarified. Second, the phenotype may also be due to a difference in the efficiencies of cre on Kras and p53 in the Msi2 WT and KO mice.</p>
<p>(4) All shRNA experiments (for both Msi2 KD and the KD of candidate genes) utilized a single shRNA. This approach cannot exclude off-target effects of the shRNA.</p>
<p>(5) The technical details of the PDX experiment (Figure 4F) are not fully explained.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Barber and colleagues propose a dual role for the RNA-binding protein Mushashi-2 (Msi2) in lung adenocarcinoma initial transformation and subsequent tumor propagation. First, authors show that Msi2 is expressed in a subset of Club/BASC (37%) and AT2 (26%) cells in the normal lung and displayed a distinct transcriptional profile than non-expressing Msi2 cells. Furthermore, Msi2 is broadly expressed/activated in vivo in genetically induced lung adenocarcinoma tumors (Kras/p53 mouse model) and Msi2+ cells displayed a significantly higher ability to form tumor spheres in vitro. Authors demonstrated by in vivo and in vitro assays that Msi2 loss of function significantly impair tumor growth and progression in lung adenocarcinoma. Data showed that Msi2 function is conserved in human adenocarcinoma tumor growth in patient-derived xenograft. Lastly, novel genes regulated by Msi2 and involved in lung adenocarcinoma tumor growth were identified.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provided convincing data for a key role of Msi2 in lung adenocarcinoma tumor progression and growth. Multiple evidences using Msi2 knock-out genetic mouse model and shRNA knock-down in tumor sphere formation assay are clearly demonstrated. The conservation and importance of Msi2 was further shown in human patient-derived xenograft. Although specific cell types (Club/BASC, AT2) were not isolated, authors further delved in the transcriptional difference between Msi2+ and Msi2- cells in the normal lung. Furthermore, novel genes and pathways regulated by Msi2 in lung adenocarcinoma were identified and tested for their ability to inhibit tumor growth in vitro. These 2 RNA-Seq datasets will be useful in the future and provide a basis to explore 1) potential propensity of a given cell to initiate oncogenic transformation, and 2) potential novel regulators of lung adenocarcinoma.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although this work strongly demonstrated the importance of Msi2 in lung adenocarcinoma tumor progression and growth, the following points remain to be clarified or addressed.</p>
<p>- In Figure 1, characterization of Msi2 expression in the normal mouse lung was carried out by using a Msi2-GFP Knock-in reporter and analyzed by flow cytometry followed by cytospins and immunostaining. Additional characterization of Msi2 expression by co-immunostaining with well-known markers of airway and alveolar cell types in intact lung tissue will strengthen the existing data and provide more specific information about Msi2 expression and abundancy in relevant cell types. It will be also interesting to know whether Msi2 is expressed or not in other abundant lung cell types such as ciliated and AT1 cells.</p>
<p>- While this set of experiments provide strong evidence that Msi2 is required for tumor progression and growth in lung adenocarcinoma, it is unclear whether normal Msi2+ lung cells are more responsive to transformation or whether Msi2 is upregulated early during the process of tumorigenesis. Future lineage tracing experiments using Msi2-CreER and mouse models of chemically-induced lung carcinogenesis will provide additional data that will fully support this claim.</p>
<p>- In Figure 4F, Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) assays were conducted in 2 patients only and the percentage of cells infected by shRNA-Msi2 is low in both PDX (30% and 10% for patient 1 and 2 respectively). It is surprising that Msi2 downregulation in a small percentage of tumor cells has such a dramatic effect on tumor growth and expansion. Confirmation of this finding with additional patient samples would suggest an important non-cell autonomous role for Msi2 in lung adenocarcinoma.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Figure 3: it is unclear what is the efficiency of Msi2 deletion shRNA - could you demonstrate it by at least two independent methods? (QPCR, Western, or IHC?) please quantitate the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 3, we did not delete Msi2 via shRNA. Instead, we utilized a genetic model in which the Msi2 gene was disrupted via gene trap mutagenesis. We have also used this model in previous publications to define the impact of Msi2 loss in other systems1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 4, similarly, it is unclear if Msi2 depletion was effective- and what is shRNA efficiency. Please test this by at least two independent methods (QPCR, Western, or IHC) and also please quantitate the data</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We demonstrated that the efficiency of Msi2 depletion was ~83% (Figures 4A and 4C) via qPCR analysis for our in vitro and in vivo experiments, respectively, and verified the knockdown via bulk RNA-seq analysis. The shRNA hairpin used was previously validated and published by our lab2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) the reason for impairment of cell growth demonstrated in Figs 3 and 4 is not clear: is it apoptosis? Necrosis? Cell cycle defects? Autophagy? Senescence? Please probe 2-3 possibilities and provide the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The basis of the cell growth impairment after Msi2 deletion/knockdown in this paper is certainly an important question, and future experiments will be performed to better delineate this. In previous publications loss of Msi2 in leukemia cells has been shown to inhibit growth via arrested cell cycle progression by increasing the expression of p213. Further, loss of Msi2 was also shown to promote apoptosis in part by upregulating Bax3. These data suggest that Msi2 can have an impact via multiple distinct mechanisms including by mediating cell cycle arrest and blocking apoptosis. While these specific genes were not detectably changed after loss of Msi2 in lung cancer cells, other genes in these and other pathways will be important to study in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Since Musashi-1 is a Musashi-2 paralogue that could compensate for Musashi-2 loss, please test Msi1 expression levels in matching Fig 3 and Fig 4 sections (in cells/ tumors with Msi2 deletion and in KP cells with Msi2 shRNA). One method could suffice here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our RNA-seq of cells following Msi2 knockdown, Msi1 expression was undetectable. The TPM values for Msi1 in control and knockdown cells were less than 0.01, suggesting that it did not compensate for the loss of Msi2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) It is not exactly clear why RNA-seq (as opposed to proteomics) was done to investigate downstream Msi2 targets (since Msi2 is in first place, translational and not transcriptional regulator)- . RNA effects in Fig 5J are quite modest, 2-fold or so. It would be useful (if antibodies available) to test four targets in Fig 5J by Western blot, to see any impact of musashi-2 depletion on those target protein levels. Indeed, several papers - including Kudinov et al PNAS, PMID: 27274057, Makhov P et al PMID: 33723247 and PMID: 37173995 - used proteomics/ RIP approaches and found direct Musashi-2 targets in lung cancer, including EGFR, and others.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Previous published work from the lab showed that expression of Msi2 in the context of myeloid leukemia1can not only repress NUMB protein (I believe protein should be all caps?) (as has been previously demonstrated in the nervous system) but also Numb RNA. This indicated that as an RNA binding protein, Msi2 also can bind and destabilize direct binding targets such as Numb; this was the reason for pursuing transcriptomic analysis.  However as the reviewer suggests, proteomic studies are certainly very important to develop a complete picture of the impact of Musashi to determine which targets are controlled by Msi2 at the protein level.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) It will be interesting to determine whether Msi2+ cells are a relatively stable subset or rather the Msi2+ cells in lung is a dynamic concept that is transient or interconvertible. This is relevant to the interpretation of what Msi2 positivity really means.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In previous unpublished work from our lab, we have found that Msi2+ cells from a GFP reporter KPf/fC mouse are readily able to become GFP negative (Msi2-), but the inverse is not true. Specifically, when Msi2+ KPf/fC pancreatic cells were transplanted into the flanks of NSG mice, Msi2+ cells formed tumors in all recipients; these tumors contained both GFP+ and GFP- cells (over 80%)  recapitulating the original heterogeneity and suggesting GFP+ cells can give rise to both GFP+ and GFP- cells (Lytle and Reya, unpublished observations). In contrast only a small subset of GFP- transplanted mice formed tumors. One of the rare GFP- derived tumors was isolated and found to contain largely GFP- cells, with ~0.1% GFP+ cells. The small frequency of GFP expression could be from contaminating cells or may suggest that GFP- cells retain some ability to switch on Msi under selective pressure, and that although they pose a lower risk of driving tumorigenesis than Msi+ cells, they may nonetheless bear latent potential to become higher risk. These data may offer a possible model for projecting the potential of Msi2+ cells in the lung, but is something that needs to be further studied in this tissue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Does Kras mutation and/or p53 loss upregulate Msi2? This point and the point above are related to whether Msi2+ cells are truly more susceptible to tumorigenesis, as the authors suggested.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In unpublished work from our lab, we have found that Kras mutation upregulates Msi2 over baseline and subsequent p53 loss upregulates Msi2 further in the context of pancreatic cells (Lytle and Reya unpublished results), therefore it is possible that the same is true for the lung. Specifically, we have observed that Msi2 increased from normal acinar cells to Kras-mutated acinar (e.g. pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN)).</p>
<p>To address whether Msi2+ cells are more susceptible to tumorigenesis, we have recently published data showing that the stabilization of the oncogenic MYC protein in lung Msi2+ cells drive the formation of small-cell lung cancer in a new inducible Msi2-CreERT2; CAG-LSL-MycT58A mice (Msi2-Myc)4 model. More importantly, this data provides the first evidence that normal Msi2+ cells are primed and highly sensitive to MYC-driven transformation across many organs and not just the lung4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The KO of Msi2 reducing tumor number and burden in the lung cancer initiation model is interesting. However, there are two alternative interpretations. First, it is possible that the Msi2 KO mice (without Kras activation and p53 loss) has reduced total lung cell numbers or altered percentage of stem cells. There is currently only one sentence citing data not shown on line 125, commenting that there is no difference in BASC and AT2 cell populations. It will be helpful that such data are shown and the effect of KO on overall lung mass or cellularity is clarified. Second, the phenotype may also be due to a difference in the efficiencies of cre on Kras and p53 in the Msi2 WT and KO mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We isolated the lungs of three Msi2 WT and three Msi2 KO mice and used immunofluorescence staining to stain for CC10 (BASC) and SPC (AT2) to determine if these cell populations were reduced after Msi2 loss alone. Below are representative images showing that the Msi2 KO mice did not have lower numbers of both BASC and AT2 cell populations.</p>

<p>(4) All shRNA experiments (for both Msi2 KD and the KD of candidate genes) utilized a single shRNA. This approach cannot exclude off-target effects of the shRNA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The shRNA hairpin used for Msi2 was previously validated and published by our lab2. Additionally, in this work we did develop and use a Msi2 genetic knockout mouse model that validates our shRNA knockdown data showing the specific impact of Msi2 on lung tumor growth.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The technical details of the PDX experiment (Figure 4F) are not fully explained.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Due to space considerations, we were unable not put the specifics in the legend, but the details are in the methods section (Flank Transplant Assays). In brief, 500,000 cells/well were plated in a 6-well plate coated with Matrigel and 83,000 cells/well were plated in a 24-well plate coated with Matrigel for subsequent determination of transduction efficiency via FACS. 24 hours after transduction, media from the cells was collected and placed on ice. 1mL of 2mg/mL collagenase/dispase was then added to the well and incubated for 45 minutes at 37ºC to dissociate the remaining cells from Matrigel followed by subsequent washes. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and an equivalent number of shControl and shMsi2 transduced cells were resuspended in full media, mixed at a 1:1 ratio with growth factor reduced Matrigel at a final volume of 100 μL, and transplanted subcutaneously into the flanks of NSG recipient mice.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>- In Figure 1, characterization of Msi2 expression in the normal mouse lung was carried out by using a Msi2-GFP Knock-in reporter and analyzed by flow cytometry followed by cytospins and immunostaining. Additional characterization of Msi2 expression by co-immunostaining with well-known markers of airway and alveolar cell types in intact lung tissue will strengthen the existing data and provide more specific information about Msi2 expression and abundancy in relevant cell types. It will be also interesting to know whether Msi2 is expressed or not in other abundant lung cell types such as ciliated and AT1 cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We performed co-staining of Msi2 and CC10 as well as Msi2 and SPC in Figure 1C. In the future we can include additional markers as well as markers for airway and other alveolar cell types.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Recently, we published data showing that Msi2 is expressed in Clara cells at the bronchoalveolar junction in the lung of our new Msi2-CreERT2 knock-in mouse model4. Furthermore, stabilization of the oncogenic MYC protein in these specific cells to model Myc amplification was sufficient to drive the formation of small-cell lung cancer4. These data excitingly demonstrate that Msi2+ cells are more responsive to transformation after Myc stabilization.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- In Figure 4F, Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) assays were conducted in 2 patients only and the percentage of cells infected by shRNA-Msi2 is low in both PDX (30% and 10% for patient 1 and 2 respectively).

Confirmation of this finding with additional patient samples would suggest an important non-cell autonomous role for Msi2 in lung adenocarcinoma.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the future we hope to collect more patient samples to further validate the data presented with the first 2 patients shown here. We are not certain about the reason behind the large impact of Msi2 inhibition, but as cancer stem cells drive the formation of the rest of the tumor and also drive the stromal microenvironment, it is possible that when Msi2 is deleted, Msi2- cells no longer form tumors? and also the ability to build the stromal microenvironment is impacted. This possibility needs to be further tested in future experiments.</p>
