<title>Abstract</title><p>The Nix-TB clinical trial evaluated a new 6-month regimen containing three-oral- drugs; bedaquiline (B), pretomanid (Pa) and linezolid (L) (BPaL regimen) for treatment of tuberculosis (TB). This regimen achieved remarkable results as almost 90% of the multidrug resistant (MDR) or extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB participants were cured but many patients also developed severe adverse events (AEs). The AEs were associated with the long-term administration of the protein synthesis inhibitor linezolid. Spectinamide 1599 is also a protein synthesis inhibitor of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> with an excellent safety profile but which lacks oral bioavailability. Here, we propose to replace L in the BPaL regimen with spectinamide (S) administered via inhalation and we demonstrate that inhaled spectinamide 1599, combined with BPa ––BPaS regimen––has similar efficacy to that of BPaL regimen while simultaneously avoiding the L-associated AEs. The BPaL and BPaS regimens were compared in the BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ murine chronic TB efficacy models. After 4-weeks of treatment, both regimens promoted equivalent bactericidal effect in both TB murine models. However, treatment with BPaL resulted in significant weight loss and the complete blood count suggested development of anemia. These effects were not similarly observed in mice treated with BPaS. BPaL and BPa, but no the BPaS treatment, also decreased myeloid to erythroid ratio suggesting the S in the BPaS regimen was able to recover this effect. Moreover, the BPaL also increased concentration of proinflammatory cytokines in bone marrow compared to mice receiving BPaS regimen. During therapy both regimens improved the lung lesion burden, reduced neutrophil and cytotoxic T cells counts while increased the number of B and helper and regulatory T cells. These combined data suggest that inhaled spectinamide 1599 combined with BPa is an effective TB regimen that avoids L-associated AEs.</p>

<title>Imporatance</title>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is an airborne infectious disease that spreads via aerosols containing <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), the causative agent of TB. TB can be cured by administration of 3-4 drugs for 6-9 months but there are limited treatment options for patients infected with multidrug (MDR) and extensively resistant (XDR) strains of Mtb. BPaL is a new all-oral combination of drugs consisting of Bedaquiline (B), Pretomanid (Pa) and Linezolid (L). This regimen was able to cure ∼90% of MDR and XDR TB patients in clinical trials but many patients developed severe adverse events (AEs) associated to the long-term administration of linezolid. We evaluated a new regimen in which Linezolid in the BPaL regimen was replaced with inhaled spectinamide 1599. In the current study, we demonstrate that 4-weeks of treatment with inhaled spectinamide 1599 in combination with Bedaquiline and Pretomanid has equivalent efficacy to the BPaL drug combination and avoids the L-associated-AEs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of death initiated by an infectious agent. In 2021, the World Health Organization reported 10.6 million new TB cases worldwide and among those, 450,000 cases were also diagnosed as multidrug resistant (MDR) or extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Treatment of MDR- and XDR- TB patients is lengthy and is often poorly tolerated due to significant associated side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, a 6-month novel treatment regimen of three-oral-drugs: bedaquiline (B), pretomanid (Pa) and linezolid (L) referred to as the BPaL regimen was approved. Preclinical studies demonstrated the better efficacy of BPaL regimen for drug sensitive TB compared to the standard TB chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) and thereafter, the BPaL regimen was tested in the Nix-TB clinical trial conducted in South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). This trial enrolled patients with XDR-TB and treatment-intolerant or non-responsive MDR-TB, including HIV positive patients with a CD4 count of 50 or higher. The results were remarkable as 95 out of 107 patients were cured though many patients had a high rate of treatment-associated adverse events (AEs).</p>
<p>The long-term administration of linezolid (an oxazolidinone antibiotic) was likely the causative agent resulting in bone marrow myelosuppression (48%), peripheral neuropathy, optic neuritis (81%) and anemia (37%) in patients treated with the BPaL regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Subsequently, the ZeNix trial adjusted the BPaL regimen to a linezolid dose of 600mg. This trial also had remarkable results; it cured 84-91% of patients (9 to 26 weeks of therapy, respectively) and resulted in fewer AEs than those observed in the Nix- TB trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Apart from AEs, several studies have also raised awareness of high doses of linezolid leading to development of linezolid-resistant <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). At present, the TB-drug development field is working to modify the BPaL regimen to maintain or improve its efficacy while diminishing treatment-associated AEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>Spectinomycin, an aminocyclitol antibiotic, is a broad spectrum antibiotic used mainly for the treatment of <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) and has an acceptable safety profile with no known ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). The activity of spectinomycin against Mtb is very poor but its structural modification led to the development of a new series of semisynthetic analogs called spectinamides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Spectinamides bind selectively with the bacterial 30S ribosomes and importantly, unlike linezolid, they do not bind to the mitochondrial 30S in mammalian cells. The latter represents a great advantage for reduced potential for side effects, such as ototoxicity and myeloid suppression that are commonly associated with other protein synthesis inhibitors such as amikacin and linezolid, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Spectinamides’ potent anti-tubercular activity is attributed to its ability to evade drug efflux by Rv1258c major facilitator superfamily transporter present on the surface of Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Spectinamides have shown excellent activity against MDR- and XDR-Mtb strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) h owever, their poor oral availability has limited their usage to injectable forms.</p>
<p>One of the lead spectinamides, 1599, has demonstrated promising results <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and was shown to lack cross-resistance with existing anti-TB drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). 1599, delivered subcutaneously, proved an effective partner agent when combined with rifampin and pyrazinamide and also with bedaquiline, pretomanid or moxifloxacin in TB mouse efficacy models of increasing complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the limitations of using 1599 as injectable is a potential risk for poor patient compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) and direct administration of aerosolized antibiotics to the lungs has been studied for decades as an alternative to systemic drug administration via injection. Aerosolized administration of 1599 has been tested in preclinical <italic>in vivo</italic> studies using liquid formulation of the drug. These studies have shown that inhaled 1599, used in monotherapy or in combination with pyrazinamide, is efficacious and well tolerated in murine TB efficacy models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). A comparative study assessing biodistribution of the drug in relation to the administration route demonstrated that 1599 showed 48 times higher exposure in mouse lungs via inhalation compared to equivalent dosages administered by subcutaneous injection; the latter may explain the increased efficacy of this drug following intrapulmonary aerosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Moreover, 1599 was shown to be amenable to dry powder formulation and delivery, suggesting a pathway to a more patient-friendly delivery system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that combining BPa with inhaled S will maintain equivalent efficacy to the BPaL regimen while avoiding the accompanying toxicities that occurred with long-term BPaL administration to human MDR/XDR-TB patients. Based on the diversity of outcomes observed during human TB disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and as no single animal model recapitulates the wide spectrum of human TB pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), we chose the BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ murine TB models. The BALB/c chronic TB model is representative of a long-term Mtb chronic infection that develops homogenous lung granulomatous lesions restraining the bacilli within intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) of macrophages and foamy macrophages. In contrast, low-dose aerosol Mtb infection of C3HeB/FeJ mice also results in a chronic infection, but their lungs exhibit a heterogenous spectrum of lesions including granulomas similar to those seen in BALB/c chronic TB model in addition to caseous necrotic lesions surrounded by a fibrotic rim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). The caseum of these necrotic granulomas creates a hypoxic environment and contains abundant extracellular bacilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) in a similar fashion to necrotic granulomas found in some human TB patients. It is believed that the fibrotic, necrotic and hypoxic environment of these granulomas creates barriers to drug penetration, alters bacterial phenotype, and all together challenge therapeutic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Therefore, to understand the implications of drug efficacy and drug associated AEs in scenario without (BALB/c) and with (C3HeB/FeJ) necrotic granulomas, both murine TB efficacy models were employed.</p>

<title>Linezolid and spectinamide 1599 show similar efficacy in monotherapy</title>
<p>To compare the efficacy of L or S in monotherapy, Mtb-infected C3HeB/FeJ (n=7) and BALB/c (n=4-6) mice received L (administered 5/7 days per week orally at 100 mg/Kg) or S (administered 3/7 days per week on alternate days via intrapulmonary aerosol delivery at 100 mg/Kg and 50 mg/Kg, respectively) for 4 weeks. At the end of treatment, the animals were sacrificed, and the CFU in lungs and spleen was enumerated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-D</xref>). Treatment of C3HeB/FeJ mice with L (7.30 ± 0.45 log<sub>10</sub>) or S (6.90 ± 0.48 log<sub>10</sub>) for 4 weeks resulted in an average of 0.51 and 0.91 log<sub>10</sub> CFU reduction in the lungs respectively, compared to untreated (UnRx) control (7.81 ± 0.36 log<sub>10</sub>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This difference failed to achieve statistical significance owing to the larger standard deviation associated with heterogenous advanced lung pathology observed in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). In contrast, L (4.49 ± 0.10 log<sub>10</sub>) treated C3HeB/FeJ mice had significantly lower spleen bacterial burden compared to UnRx (5.43 ± 0.27 log<sub>10</sub>), with no significant difference between the L and S (4.94 ± 0.11 log<sub>10</sub>) treatment arm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In BALB/c mice, L or S treatment was found to promote significant reduction in lung bacterial burden (0.83 and 0.77 log<sub>10</sub> respectively) compared to UnRx or the vehicle only controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). There was no significant difference in lung bacterial burden after L or S treatment in BALB/c mice and there was no change in spleen bacterial burden compared to UnRx control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>Bactericidal effect of BPaL and BPaS in TB mouse models after 4-weeks of treatment BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ female mice were chronically infected with a low dose aerosol infection of Mtb Erdman strain to deliver ∼75 and ∼100 bacilli respectively. Post-infection, BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ mice were rested for 4 and 8-9 weeks respectively until they were randomly assigned to the study groups. The mice were treated with monotherapy of linezolid or spectinamide 1599 or combination therapy of BPaL, BPa or BPaS for 4 weeks. Bedaquiline (B), pretomanid (Pa) and linezolid (L) were administered at 25, 100 and 100 mg/kg respectively by oral gavage for 5/7 a week while spectinamide 1599 at 50 and 100 mg/kg in BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ TB models respectively for 3/7 a week on the alternate days via intrapulmonary aerosol delivery. On the third day of the last treatment, the mice were euthanized, and their lungs and spleen were collected. The organs were homogenized, serially diluted and plated on 7H11 agar with 4% charcoal (to avoid drug carry-over effect) to determine bacterial burden in the form of colony forming units (CFU) in each sample.

<title>Combination therapy with BPaL or BPaS have similar efficacy</title>
<p>We further tested and compared the efficacy of L or S when used in combination therapy with BPa. Mtb-infected C3HeB/FeJ mice were treated with either BPaL (B= 25mpk; Pa= 100 mg/Kg and L= 100 mg/Kg all administered 5/7 a week via oral gavage) or BPaS (BPa as in BPaL and S= 100 mg/Kg administered 3/7 a week on alternate days via intrapulmonary aerosol delivery) for 4 weeks. The comparative analysis from combined data of three independent studies is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>&amp;G (data from individual studies are shown in Figures S1-3). Two of three studies contained an extra group of BPa treated mice as a reference control. Compared to UnRx (7.48 ± 0.12 log<sub>10</sub>) control, mice in the BPa (5.49 ± 0.42 log<sub>10</sub>), BPaL (4.76 ± 0.38 log<sub>10</sub>) and BPaS (4.98 ± 0.35 log<sub>10</sub>) treatment groups had significantly reduced the lung bacterial burden by 1.99, 2.72, and 2.50 log<sub>10</sub> respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Although a higher CFU reduction was observed in the lungs of C3HeB/FeJ mice treated with BPaL or BPaS, these differences failed to achieve statistical significance compared to BPa backbone regimen. All three regimens proved highly effective at reducing spleen bacterial burden in C3HeB/FeJ mice, with most mice returning no CFU within the limit of detection (LOD) employed herein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>The effect of BPaL and BPaS (S= 50 mg/Kg) combination therapy on the bacterial burden in lungs and spleen of Mtb-infected BALB/c mice was determined at the end of 4- weeks of treatment. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>&amp;H show the combined lung and spleen CFU data from two independent studies (data for each study is shown in Figures S8-9). The combined result demonstrated that compared to UnRx (5.24 ± 0.17 log<sub>10</sub>) control, mice in the BPaL (1.29 ± 0.13 log<sub>10</sub>) and BPaS (1.44 ± 0.17 log<sub>10</sub>) treatment groups returned significantly fewer CFU in the lungs, with most mice returning no CFU within the LOD employed herein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). As in C3HeB/FeJ TB model, no significant difference was observed in the lung CFU of BALB/c mice treated with either the BPaL or BPaS regimen. BPaL and BPaS therapy reduced BALB/c spleen bacterial burden to below the LOD of the assay with no CFU recovered for any treated mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). In summary, these results support our hypothesis and demonstrate that both BPaL, BPaS (and BPa in the C3HeB/FeJ TB model) multidrug regimens show equivalent bactericidal effects in C3HeB/FeJ and BALB/c chronic TB efficacy models.</p>

<p>The Nix-TB trial associated the long-term administration of L within the BPaL regimen as the causative agent resulting in anemia in patients treated with the BPaL regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Thus, the effect of combination therapy with the BPaL or BPaS regimen on CBC profile was analyzed at 1-, 2- and 4-weeks of treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). None of the 20 parameters of CBC changed during the first 2 weeks of treatment. However, out of the 20-blood parameters evaluated, a total of four blood parameters were affected at 4- weeks-of treatment. L-containing BPaL regimen was again associated with a significant increase in the RDWs, and lower hemoglobin (HGB) compared to UnRx control after 4 weeks. This effect was not observed in mice treated with BPa or BPaS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). However, as in monotherapy, there was a trend towards lower overall MCHC in mice treated with either BPaL or BPaS. The mean platelet volume (MPV) was marginally higher at 4 weeks in mice treated with BPa compared to BPaL or BPaS, albeit not significantly different from UnRx control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Given that no difference in HGB or RDWs was observed between UnRx control and their comparator BPa and BPaS regimens, we concluded that the significant HGB decrease and RDWs increase (often observed during development of anemia) were associated with inclusion of L in BPaL regimen.</p>

<p>To further evaluate if L was associated with myelosuppressive effect, we performed hematopathology analysis on bone marrow from Mtb-infected C3HeB/FeJ and BALB/c mice at the end of treatment. For C3HeB/FeJ mice, the number of myeloid (M) and erythroid (E) precursor cells were calculated from H&amp;E stained sections and their myeloid to erythroid ratio (M:E) was determined by counting 300 bone marrow cells in 5 different regions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The BPa and BPaL treatment significantly decreased myeloid cells while increasing the proportion of erythroid cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Hence, the corresponding ratio in bone marrow of animals treated with BPaL or BPa was lower compared to UnRx control. Importantly, the BPaS treatment did not show any difference in the content of myeloid or erythroid cells when compared to UnRx control suggesting that S in the BPaS was able to recover this effect.

<title>BPaL therapy increases proinflammatory cytokine response in bone marrow</title>
<p>A comparative analysis for concentration of cytokines and chemokines in the bone marrow, plasma, and lung samples from Mtb-infected C3HeB/FeJ mice treated with BPaL or BPaS regimen was also conducted. The bone marrow samples demonstrated a significant difference between the BPaL and BPaS groups, with appreciably higher level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-1β, IL-12p70, IL-23, TNFα, GROα (CXCL1), MP-2α (CXCL2), IP-10 (CXCL10), MP-1α (CCL3), RANTES (CCL5), MCP-3 (CCL7) and Eotaxin (CCL11)) in the BPaL- compared to BPaS-treated mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).

We also performed a correlation analysis of bone marrow cytokine and chemokine content with lung CFU obtained from treatment (BPaL or BPaS) and UnRx groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The analysis suggested that compared to UnRx control, there was a strong correlation between the profound reduction of lung bacterial burden and profound reduction in bone marrow cytokine and chemokine contents observed in mice from BPaL or BPaS groups. Similar correlations were found between lung CFU and content of cytokines and chemokines in lung (Figure S14) and plasma (Figure S15).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We used two preclinical chronic TB murine efficacy models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) to investigate BPa, BPaL and BPaS, for efficacy and any associated AEs during the course of 4- weeks of treatment. Overall, our antimicrobial data are in accordance with the granuloma spectrum of both mouse models used where a more robust reduction in lung bacterial burden was observed in the absence (BALB/c) versus the presence (C3HeB/FeJ) of necrotic lesions. Both multidrug regimens as BPaL or BPaS significantly reduced lung bacterial burden by 3.8-4.0 log<sub>10</sub> and 2.5-2.7 log<sub>10</sub> in BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ TB models, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E-H</xref>). We therefore conclude that both regimens promote similar bactericidal effects in murine models lacking, or featuring, advanced pulmonary pathology. Furthermore, the potent antimicrobial effect of the BPaL and BPaS regimens also resulted in improvement of the pathological outcome during chronic infection with Mtb but only the L-containing BPaL regimen, not BPaS, was associated with a significant decrease in the body weight at week 4 in Mtb- infected BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ mice (Figure S4B and S10B). Future studies will determine if prolonged treatment with BPaL will continue affecting the body weight of the animals. The extent of weight loss is an important preclinical and clinical parameter in TB patients because it determines the severity of disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), and it is also an indicator of <italic>in vivo</italic> drug efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). The bactericidal effects of S (as monotherapy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) and BPaL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) in mice observed in these studies is in line with previous reports and similar inverse relationship between body weight and L exposure was recently reported in human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>).</p>
<p>Among L-associated hematological side effects, the incidence of anemia is reported up to 62.5% in MDR and XDR-TB patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) and the onset of this effect can occur 2 weeks to 2 months post L administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). In TB patients treated with anti- TB drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), increased RDWs and lower HGB are associated with anemia and these parameters serve as markers of disease prognosis. Using a CBC profile of 20 peripheral blood parameters, our preclinical study failed to detect any difference between L or S 4-weeks monotherapy in terms of total red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, or hemoglobin (HGB) concentration compared to UnRx control (data not shown). However, L treatment alone increased the RDWs and both L and S decreased the MCHC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Likewise, none of the 20-blood parameters evaluated showed any change after the first 2 weeks of therapy with BPa, BPaL, or BPaS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). However, by 4 weeks, a significant drop in HGB and an increase in the RDWs was apparent for the BPaL group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This is interpreted to mean that mild hematological effects observed in mice treated for 4 weeks with L or BPaL are dependent on the number of L-doses administered and are thus, time-dependent. Overall, the onset of these hematological effects when testing an L-containing regimen (BPaL) is in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) in human patients.</p>
<p>The mechanism of L-induced toxicity is attributed to its binding with the host mitochondrial ribosomes leading to mitochondrial toxicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). The latter results in activation of Nlrp3 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>) and subsequently results in L-mediated bone marrow myelosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>); a phenomenon consistent with the hematologic anomalies seen in patients treated with L for extended time periods. Because spectinamides do not bind to mitochondrial ribosomes there is reduced potential for similar side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). To conclusively test this hypothesis, we performed bone marrow histopathology to quantify the myeloid to erythroid ratio (M:E), a parameter that provides information about the relative proportions of myeloid lineage (granulocytes, monocytes, and their precursors) to erythroid lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). The BPa and BPaL regimens altered M:E in the C3HeB/FeJ TB model by suppressing myeloid and inducing erythroid lineages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>&amp;D) whereas no such difference was observed in mice treated with BPaS compared to untreated control. L was previously shown to impact M:E ratio, although an opposite trend was observed in those studies, which employed 12-days of L administration and a different strain of otherwise healthy mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Time course studies using a single consistent assay method are needed to resolve this discrepancy.</p>
<p>Elevation of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) levels and activation of Nlrp3 inflammasome have been previously linked to myelosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). A 26-plexed immunoassay on bone marrow samples from Mtb-infected C3HeB/FeJ mice revealed that most of the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-1β, IL-12p70 and TNF-α were present at significantly higher concentrations in animals treated with BPaL compared to BPaS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>&amp;B). The presence of elevated IL-1β was previously reported during monotherapy with L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Studies from UnRx Mtb-infected C3HeB/FeJ mice also revealed highly elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). As expected, the positive therapeutic effect of BPaL and BPaS (as seen by reduction in bacterial and lesion burden of lungs) also correlated with decreased level of proinflammatory cytokines in bone marrow, lung, and plasma (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref>, S14 and S15 respectively).</p>
<p>Similar to changes observed for cytokine profile, the flow cytometry data of bone marrow, blood, and lungs along with quantification of mfIHC lung image analysis revealed a significant change in the percentage of myeloid and lymphoid phenotypes during treatment compared to UnRx control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Most notably, the therapeutic effect of the BPa, BPaL and BPaS treatments reduced inflammatory myeloid cells expressing CCR2 in blood and bone marrow and reduction in cytotoxic T cells (CD3+CD8+) and γδT cells (CD3+CD8+γδTCR+) in lungs. In addition, BPa, BPaL and BPaS therapy significantly increased the influx of helper T cells (CD3+CD4+), regulatory T cells (Foxp3+) and B cells (CD3-CD19+) in lungs. These results suggest that the combination therapy promotes the immune system’s equilibrium by reducing inflammation and enhancing adaptive immune responses.</p>
<p>An additional striking finding from this study was a strong concordance between the decrease in lung and spleen bacterial burden and a corresponding decrease in the number of cells expressing the neutrophil associated marker (Ly6G) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>&amp;D). An implication of this finding is that the favorable treatment outcomes may promote a corresponding decline in Ly6G neutrophil population as suggested before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Among all immune cell phenotypes studied, no differences were found between BPaL and BPaS treated animals and only the F4/80+ cells in the BPaS (but not in the BPaL) treated animals showed significant increase when compared to the UnRx control.</p>
<p>To conclude, the TB drug development field is working towards developing shorter and safer therapies with a common goal of developing new multidrug regimens of low pill burden that are accessible to patients, of short duration (ideally 2-3 months) and consist of 3-4 drugs of novel mode-of-action with proven efficacy, safety, and limited toxicity. Here we present initial results for new multidrug regimens containing inhaled spectinamide 1599 that are in line with these goals. It is proposed that human use of spectinamides 1599 will be administered using a dry powder formulation delivered by the RS01 Plastiape dry powder inhaler. We already reported on the aerodynamic properties of dry powder spectinamide 1599 within #3 HPMC capsules and delivered from a RS01 Plastiape inhaler device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). Future studies are already under consideration for funding by NIH-NIAID to understand the pharmacokinetics of mono, binary and ternary combinations of BPaS. These studies also aim to identify the optimal dose level and dosing frequency of each regimen along with their efficacy and relapse free-sterilization potential. Studies are also planned using a model-based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) framework, guided by an existing human BPa PKPD model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>) to find allometric human dose levels, dosing frequencies and treatment durations that will inform the experimental design of future clinical studies.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Female C3HeB/FeJ and BALB/c mice at 6-8 weeks of age were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories. All protocols and use of these animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at CSU. Animals were infected with a low dose aerosol infection of Mtb (Erdman strain; ATCC 35801) using an inhalation exposure system (Glas-Col, Terre Haute, IN) calibrated to deliver ∼50-100 colony forming units (CFU) to the lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Clinical observations (e.g., inactivity, rough fur, hunched posture, increased respiratory rate or effort) were monitored daily and their body weights were taken weekly.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Drug preparation and treatment</title>
<p>Bedaquiline fumarate (B) and linezolid (L) were obtained from LKT laboratories, pretomanid (Pa) from ChemShuttle and 1599 (S: dihydrochloride) was provided by Dr. Lee at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. B was administered at 25 mg/kg. Pa and L were administered at 100 mg/kg each and S was delivered by inhalation in liquid form at 50 and 100 mg/kg to BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ mice, respectively. The drugs were formulated in weekly batches according to the body weight of the animals, aliquoted for single daily dosing, and stored at 4 °C in the dark.</p>
<p>The drugs were prepared and administered as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Drug treatment was started 4 weeks post-aerosol infection for BALB/c and at 8-9 weeks post- aerosol infection for C3HeB/FeJ mice to allow time for lung pathology to fully develop.</p>
<p>All drugs were administered once daily for 5 days/week for 4 weeks by oral (gavage) administration except S which was administered 3 days/week by intrapulmonary aerosol delivery using the Penn Century microsprayer as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). B was administered in the morning, Pa one hour after B and, L and S at least 4 hours after Pa.</p>

<title><bold>Necropsy</bold></title>
<p>After 4-weeks of treatment, C3HeB/FeJ and BALB/c mice were humanely euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> narcosis. Blood, lungs, spleen, femur and tibia bones were collected from each mouse for further processing and analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title>Assessment of Efficacy</title>
<p>The efficacy of the treatment was assessed by determining changes in bacterial burden [measured as colony forming units (CFU)] in the lungs and spleen of animals at necropsy. The lungs and spleen were homogenized and prepared as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). The lung homogenates were plated onto 7H11 agar plates supplemented with 0.4% activated charcoal to reduce the carryover effect of drugs and incubated at 37 °C for 6-8 weeks before the final CFU count. The remaining lung homogenate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and stored at -80 °C for evaluation of cytokines and chemokines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Histopathology and lesion scoring</title>
<p>The lungs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 48 hours then embedded in paraffin for histopathology. Sections from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues were cut at 5 µm, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and scanned at 40X magnification using multispectral automated PhenoImager (Akoya Biosciences) for histopathological evaluation. The extent of lung lesion burden was quantified in blinded digital images using an open-source QuPath software for image analysis as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). For each tissue section, a region of interest (ROI) was generated at low magnification with a custom tissue detecting algorithm using decision forest training and classification to differentiate tissue versus background based on color and area. Lesions were identified within tissue ROIs at high magnification with an additional custom-made algorithm using decision forest training and classification based on staining intensity, color normalization and deconvolution, area, and morphological features. Percent lesion calculations were integrated into the same algorithm and calculated from tissue area and lesion area as designated by the ROI and lesions detected.</p>
<p>The sternum and one femur were fixed in 4% PFA and processed for histology. To evaluate the myelosuppressive effect of the drugs, bone sections were cut at 5 µm and stained with H&amp;E. The number of myeloid and erythroid cells from 5 different regions of the bone were blinded and then counted by a veterinary clinical pathologist.</p>

<sec id="s4e">
<title>Bone marrow collection</title>
<p>Briefly, a 0.6 mL sterile Eppendorf tube punctured at the bottom with the help of a 26-gauge needle was inserted into a 1.5 mL sterile Eppendorf tube. One end of the epiphysis of the long bones was cut open to expose the bone marrow and placed down into the small Eppendorf tube-system. The tubes were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 15 seconds and the marrow was collected from the base of the large Eppendorf tube. The bone marrow was resuspended in PBS and centrifuged again. Thereafter, the supernatant was collected and stored at -80 °C for evaluation of cytokines and chemokines while the bone marrow cells were saved in 4% PFA and freezing media for further use in clinical pathology analysis and flow cytometry, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f">
<title>Processing of blood</title>
<p>For complete blood count (CBC) analysis of C3HeB/FeJ animals during the treatment, blood was collected in K2-EDTA tubes via submandibular vein puncture as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). The blood was immediately analyzed in VETSCAN<sup>®</sup> HM5 hematology analyzer (Zoetis).</p>
<p>At the time of necropsy, whole blood was collected via cardiac puncture in K2- EDTA containing tubes. After adding an equal volume of PBS, the samples were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 25 °C with the brake off (deceleration = 0). The top plasma layer was collected and stored at -80 <bold>°</bold>C for evaluation of their cytokine’s content. The buffy coat was collected, washed and the erythrocytes were lysed using Miltenyi RBC lysis buffer (Miltenyi, CA). The cells were washed and resuspended in 500 µL of complete DMEM media and prepared for flow cytometry analysis.</p>

<title>Cytokine quantification</title>
<p>Multiplex immunoassay was performed using a Luminex bead-based multiplex ELISA kit (ProcartaPlex Mouse Cytokine &amp; Chemokine Panel 1 26plex, reference # EPXR260-26088-901, Invitrogen). Each sample was normalized to the total protein concentration determined by Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Fisher). The BCA and Luminex assay were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the final stained samples were fixed with 4% PFA prior to acquisition. Sample data were acquired on a MAGPIX instrument running xPONENT 4.3 software (Luminex Corp.).</p>
<p>Heatmaps were generated using R pheatmap package. Correlation analysis of cytokine contents in bone marrow, plasma and lungs with the lung bacterial burden was performed using the corrplot package in R.</p>

<title>Multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Five µm sections of FFPE lung tissues were stained for multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry (mfIHC) by the Imaging Core at the University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Denver. The mfIHC was performed for a panel of 6-color antibodies + DAPI using Opal-plex Tyramide Signal Amplification (TSA) technique using a Leica Bond III autostainer. The details of antibodies and Opal fluorophores used are given in Table S2. Each antibody was optimized using Opal 3-Plex Anti-Rb Detection Kit (Akoya Biosciences Inc. cat# NEL830001KT) and stained with automated LabSat<sup>TM</sup> Research (Lunaphore Technologies SA, Epredia). Slides were scanned using multispectral automated PhenoImager<sup>TM</sup> (Akoya Biosciences) and analyzed for several immune cell populations using the inForm<sup>®</sup> tissue Finder (Version 2.4.8) and Phenochart<sup>TM</sup> (Version 1.0.12) software (Akoya Biosciences).</p>

<p>In this <bold>useful</bold> study, the authors report the efficacy, hematological effects, and inflammatory response of the BPaL regimen (containing bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid) compared to a variation in which Linezolid is replaced with the preclinical development candidate spectinamide 1599, administered by inhalation in tuberculosis-infected mice. The authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that supports the replacement of Linezolid in the current standard of care for drug-resistant tuberculosis.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript entitled A Modified BPaL Regimen for Tuberculosis Treatment</p>
<p>
replaces Linezolid with Inhaled Spectinamides by Malik Zohaib Ali et al. is an extension of previous studies by this group looking at the new drug spectinamide 1599. The authors directly compare therapy with BPaL (bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid) to a therapy that substitutes spectinamide for linezolid (BPaS). The Spectinamide is given by aerosol exposure and the BPaS therapy is shown to be as effective as BPaL without adverse effects. The work is rigorously performed and analyses of the immune responses are consistent with curative therapy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. This group uses 2 different mouse models to show the effectiveness of the BPaS treatment.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. Although this is not a weakness of this paper, a sentence describing how the spectinamide would be administered by aerosolization in humans would be welcomed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Replacing linezolid (L) with the preclinical development candidate spectinamide 1599, administered by inhalation, in the BPaL standard of care regimen achieves similar efficacy, reduces hematological changes and por-inflammatory responses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors not only measure efficacy but also quantify histological changes, hematological responses and immune responses, to provide a comprehensive picture of treatment response and the benefits of the L to S substitution.</p>
<p>The authors generate all data in two mouse models of TB infection, each reproducing different aspects of human histopathology.</p>
<p>Extensive supplementary figures ensure transparency.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Articulation of objectives and hypotheses can be improved, as suggested below.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this paper, the authors sought to evaluate whether the novel TB drug candidate, spectinamide 1599 (S), given via inhalation to mouse TB models, and combined with the drugs B (bedaquiline) and Pa (pretomanid), would demonstrate similar efficacy to that of BPaL regimen (where L is linezolid). Because L is associated with adverse events when given to patients longterm, and one of those is associated with myelosuppression (bone marrow toxicity) the authors also sought to assess blood parameters, effects on bone marrow, immune parameters/cell effects following treatment of mice with BPaS and BPaL. They conclude that BPaL and BPaS have equivalent efficacy in both TB models used and that BPaL resulted in weight loss and anemia (whereas BPaS did not) under the conditions tested, as well as effects on bone marrow.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors used two mouse models of TB that are representative of different aspects of TB in patients (which they describe well), intending to present a fuller picture of the activity of the tested drug combinations. They conducted a large body of work in these infected mice to evaluate efficacy and also to survey a wide range of parameters that could inform the effect of the treatments on bone marrow and on the immune system. The inclusion of BPa controls (in most studies) and also untreated groups led to a large amount of useful data that has been collected for the mouse models per se (untreated) as well as for BPa - in addition to the BPaS and BPaL combinations which are of particular interest to the authors. Many of these findings related to BPa, BPaL, untreated groups etc corroborate earlier findings and the authors point this out effectively and clearly in their manuscript. To go further, in general, it is a well written and cited article with an informative introduction.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors performed a large amount of work with the drugs given at the doses and dosing intervals stated, but there is no exposure data available at this time. The authors intend to evaluate exposure-effect relationships in future work. An understanding of the exposures at which the efficacy and adverse effects are seen will assist in the translation of these findings to the clinic.</p>
<p>
In addition, it is always challenging to interpret findings for combinations of drugs and for now, the data available cannot attribute confidence to the weight loss seen for only the BPaL group to L specifically, as opposed to a PK interaction leading to an elevated exposure and weight loss due to B or Pa. It is not yet possible, then to state that what is seen are &quot;L-associated AEs&quot; - this is assumed only.</p>
<p>
The evaluations of activity in the BALB/c mouse model as well as the spleens of the Kramnik model resulted in CFU below/at the limit of detection so comparisons between BPaL and BPaS cannot be made and so the conclusion of equivalent efficacy in BALB/c is not supported with the data shown. There is no BPa control in the BALB/c study, therefore it is not possible to discern whether L or S contributed to the activity of BPaL or BPaS. The same is true for the assessment of lesions - unfortunately, there was no BPa control meaning that even where equivalency is seen for BPaL and BPaS, the reader is unable to deduce whether L or S made a contribution to this activity.</p>
<p>
Although these weaknesses limit what we can learn from the current body of data, the authors note that further studies will be done to increase understanding of the points above.</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>In this useful study, the authors report the efficacy, hematological effects, and inflammatory response of the BPaL regimen (containing bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid) compared to a variation in which Linezolid is replaced with the preclinical development candidate spectinamide 1599, administered by inhalation in tuberculosis-infected mice. The authors provide convincing evidence that supports the replacement of Linezolid in the current standard of care for drug-resistant tuberculosis. However, a limitation of the work is the lack of control experiments with bedaquiline and pretomanid only, to further dissect the relevant contributions of linezolid and spectinamide in efficacy and adverse effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge a limitation in our study due to lack of groups with monotherapy of bedaquiline and pretomanid however, similar studies to understand contribution of bedaquiline and pretomanid to the BPaL have been published already (references #4 and #60 in revised manuscript).  Our goal was to compare the BPaS versus the BPaL with the understanding that TB treatment requires multidrug therapy.   We omitted monotherapy groups to reduce complexity of the studies because the multidrug groups require very large number of animals with very intensive and complex dosing schedules. Even if B or Pa by themselves have better efficacy than the BPa or BPaL combination, patients will not be treated with only B or Pa because of very high risk of developing drug resistance to B or/and PA. If drug resistance is developed for B or Pa, the field will lose very effective drugs against TB.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript is an extension of previous studies by this group looking at the new drug spectinamide 1599. The authors directly compare therapy with BPaL (bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid) to a therapy that substitutes spectinamide for linezolid (BPaS). The Spectinamide is given by aerosol exposure and the BPaS therapy is shown to be as effective as BPaL without adverse effects. The work is rigorously performed and analyses of the immune responses are consistent with curative therapy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This group uses 2 different mouse models to show the effectiveness of the BPaS treatment.</p>
<p>(2) Impressively the group demonstrates immunological correlates associated with Mtb cure with the BPaS therapy.</p>
<p>(3) Linezolid is known to inhibit ribosomes and mitochondria whereas spectinaminde does not. The authors clearly demonstrate the lack of adverse effects of BPaS compared to BPaL.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Although this is not a weakness of this paper, a sentence describing how the spectinamide would be administered by aerosolization in humans would be welcomed.</p>

<p>We already reported on the aerodynamic properties of dry powder spectinamide 1599 within #3 HPMC capsules and its delivery from a RS01 Plastiape inhaler device (reference #59 in revised manuscript).  To address this critique, we added a last paragraph in discussion “It is proposed that human use of spectinamides 1599 will be administered using a dry powder formulation delivered by the RS01 Plastiape dry powder inhaler&quot; (reference #59 in revised manuscript).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Replacing linezolid (L) with the preclinical development candidate spectinamide 1599, administered by inhalation, in the BPaL standard of care regimen achieves similar efficacy, and reduces hematological changes and proinflammatory responses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors not only measure efficacy but also quantify histological changes, hematological responses, and immune responses, to provide a comprehensive picture of treatment response and the benefits of the L to S substitution.</p>
<p>The authors generate all data in two mouse models of TB infection, each reproducing different aspects of human histopathology.</p>
<p>Extensive supplementary figures ensure transparency.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The articulation of objectives and hypotheses could be improved.</p>

<p>We edited to &quot;The AEs were associated with the long-term administration of the protein synthesis inhibitor linezolid. Spectinamide 1599 (S) is also a protein synthesis inhibitor of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> with an excellent safety profile, but which lacks oral bioavailability. Here, we propose to replace L in the BPaL regimen with spectinamide administered via inhalation and we demonstrate that inhaled spectinamide 1599, combined with BPa ––BPaS regimen––has similar efficacy to that of BPaL regimen while simultaneously avoiding the L-associated AEs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors sought to evaluate whether the novel TB drug candidate, spectinamide 1599 (S), given via inhalation to mouse TB models, and combined with the drugs B (bedaquiline) and Pa (pretomanid), would demonstrate similar efficacy to that of BPaL regimen (where L is linezolid). Because L is associated with adverse events when given to patients long-term, and one of those is associated with myelosuppression (bone marrow toxicity) the authors also sought to assess blood parameters, effects on bone marrow, immune parameters/cell effects following treatment of mice with BPaS and BPaL. They conclude that BPaL and BPaS have equivalent efficacy in both TB models used and that BPaL resulted in weight loss and anemia (whereas BPaL did not) under the conditions tested, as well as effects on bone marrow.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors used two mouse models of TB that are representative of different aspects of TB in patients (which they describe well), intending to present a fuller picture of the activity of the tested drug combinations. They conducted a large body of work in these infected mice to evaluate efficacy and also to survey a wide range of parameters that could inform the effect of the treatments on bone marrow and on the immune system. The inclusion of BPa controls (in most studies) and also untreated groups led to a large amount of useful data that has been collected for the mouse models per se (untreated) as well as for BPa - in addition to the BPaS and BPaL combinations which are of particular interest to the authors. Many of these findings related to BPa, BPaL, untreated groups, etc corroborate earlier findings and the authors point this out effectively and clearly in their manuscript. To go further, in general, it is a well-written and cited article with an informative introduction.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors performed a large amount of work with the drugs given at the doses and dosing intervals started, but at present, there is no exposure data available in the paper. It would be of great value to understand the exposures achieved in plasma at least (and in the lung if more relevant for S) in order to better understand how these relate to clinical exposures that are observed at marketed doses for B, Pa, and L as well as to understand the exposure achieved at the doses being evaluated for S. If available as historical data this could be included/cited. Considering the great attempts made to evaluate parameters that are relevant to clinical adverse events, it would add value to understand what exposures of drug effects such as anemia, weight loss, and bone marrow effects, are being observed. It would also be of value to add an assessment of whether the weight loss, anemia, or bone marrow effects observed for BPaL are considered adverse, and the extent to which we can translate these effects from mouse to patient (i.e. what are the limitations of these assessments made in a mouse study?). For example, is the small weight loss seen as significant, or is it reversible? Is the magnitude of the changes in blood parameters similar to the parameters seen in patients given L? In addition, it is always challenging to interpret findings for combinations of drugs, so the addition of language to explain this would add value: for example, how confident can we be that the weight loss seen for only the BPaL group is due to L as opposed to a PK interaction leading to an elevated exposure and weight loss due to B or Pa?</p>

<p>We totally agree with this critique but the studies suggested by the reviewer are very expensive and</p>
<p>logistically/resource intensive. Data reported in this manuscript was used as preliminary data in a RO1 application to NIH-NIAID that included studies proposed above by this reviewer. The authors are glad to report that the application got a fundable score and is currently under consideration for funding by NIH-NIAID.   The summary of proposed future studies is included in the last paragraph of the discussion in this revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Turning to the evaluations of activity in mouse TB models, unfortunately, the evaluations of activity in the BALB/c mouse model as well as the spleens of the Kramnik model resulted in CFU below/at the limit of detection and so, to this reviewer's understanding of the data, comparisons between BPaL and BPaS cannot be made and so the conclusion of equivalent efficacy in BALB/c is not supported with the data shown. There is no BPa control in the BALB/c study, therefore it is not possible to discern whether L or S contributed to the activity of BPaL or BPaS; it is possible that BPa would have shown the same efficacy as the 3 drug combinations. It would be valuable to conduct a study including a BPa control and with a shorter treatment time to allow comparison of BPa, BPaS, and BPaL.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer these studies need to be done.  Some of them were recently published by our colleague Dr. Lyons (reference #60 in revised manuscript). The studies proposed by the reviewer will be performed under a new award under consideration for funding by the NIH-NIAID, the summary of future studies is included in the last paragraph of the discussion in this revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the Kramnik lungs, as the authors rightly note, the studies do not support any contribution of S or L to BPa - i.e. the activity observed for BPa, BPaL, and BPaS did not significantly differ. Although the conclusions note equivalency of BPaL and BPaS, which is correct, it would be helpful to also include BPa in this statement;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We edited and now included in lines #191 as requested</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would be useful to conduct a study dosing for a longer period of time or assessing a relapse endpoint, where it is possible that a contribution of L and/or S may be seen - thus making a stronger argument for S contributing an equivalent efficacy to L. The same is true for the assessment of lesions - unfortunately, there was no BPa control meaning that even where equivalency is seen for BPaL and BPaS, the reader is unable to deduce whether L or S made a contribution to this activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Added in the future plans in the last paragraph of discussion</p>
<p>“Future studies are already under consideration for funding by NIH-NIAID to understand the pharmacokinetics of mono, binary and ternary combinations of BPaS. These studies also aim to identify the optimal dose level and dosing frequency of each regimen along with their efficacy and relapse free-sterilization potential. Studies are also planned using a model-based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) framework, guided by an existing human BPa PKPD model (reference #61 in revised manuscript), to find allometric human dose levels, dosing frequencies and treatment durations that will inform the experimental design of future clinical studies.</p>

<p>Line 277-289, Figure 6: given the heterogeneity of a C3HeB/FeJ mouse lung (TB infected), and the very heterogeneous cell population distribution in these lungs (Fig. 6A), the validity of whole lung analysis on 2 or 3 mice (the legend should state what 1, 2 and 3 means, individual mice?) is put into question. &quot;F4/80+ cells were observed significantly higher in BPaS compared to UnRx control&quot;: Figure S14 suggests a statistically significant difference, but nothing is said about the other cell type, which appears just as much reduced in BPaS compared to UnRx as F4/80+. Overall, sampling the whole lung for these analyses should be mentioned as a limitation in the Discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that &quot;visually&quot; it appears as other populations in addition to F4/80 have statistical significance.  We run again the two way Anova with Tukey test and only the BPaS and UnRx for F4/80 is significant.</p>

<p>We added the following last paragraph to discussion:</p>
<p>To conclude, the TB drug development field is working towards developing shorter and safer therapies with a common goal of developing new multidrug regimens of low pill burden that are accessible to patients, of short duration (ideally 2-3 months) and consist of 3-4 drugs of novel mode-of-action with proven efficacy, safety, and limited toxicity. Here we present initial results for new multidrug regimens containing inhaled spectinamide 1599 that are in line with these goals. It is proposed that human use of spectinamides 1599 will be administered using a dry powder formulation delivered by the RS01 Plastiape dry powder inhaler.  We already reported on the aerodynamic properties of dry powder spectinamide 1599 within #3 HPMC capsules and delivered from a RS01 Plastiape inhaler device (reference #59 in revised manuscript). Future studies are already under consideration for funding by NIHNIAID to understand the pharmacokinetics of mono, binary and ternary combinations of BPaS. These studies also aim to identify the optimal dose level and dosing frequency of each regimen along with their efficacy and relapse free-sterilization potential.

<p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions.  The data presented in this manuscript with 4 weeks of treatment along with monitoring of effects of therapy in blood, bone marrow and immunity have been submitted for a RO1 application to NIH-NIAID, which have received a fundable score and is under funding consideration. All the points suggested by the reviewer(s) here are included in the research proposed in the RO1 application including manufacturing and physico-chemically characterize larger scale of dry powders of spectinmides and evaluation of their aerodynamic performance for human or animal use; Pharmacokinetics and efficacy studies to determine the optimal dose level and dosing frequency for new multidrug regimens containing spectinamides. These studies include mono, binary and ternary combinations of each multidrug regimen along with their efficacy and relapse free- sterilization potential. These studies will also develop PK/PD simulation-based allometric scaling to aid in human dose projections inhalation. We hope the reviewer will understand all together these studies will last 4-5 years.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Although I truly appreciate the great efforts of the authors, I suggest that in order to better evaluate the contribution of S versus L to BPa in these models, repeat studies be run that:</p>
<p>(a) include BPa groups to allow the contribution of S and L to be assessed. Included in research proposed RO1 application mentioned above</p>
<p>(b) use shorter treatment times in BALB/c to allow comparisons at end of Tx CFU above the LOD. We have added new data for 2 weeks treatment with BPaL and BPaS in Balb/c mice infected with MTb that was removed from previous submission of this manuscript</p>
<p>(c) use longer treatment times and ideally a relapse endpoint in Kramnik to allow</p>
<p>assessment of L and S as contributors to BPa (i.e. give a chance to see better efficacy of BPaL or BPaS versus BPa) and also measure plasma exposures of all drugs (or lung levels if this is the translatable parameter for S) to allow detection of any large DDI and also understand the translation to the clinic. Related to the safety parameters, it would be really great to understand whether or not the observations for BPaL would be labeled adverse in a toxicology study/in a clinical study, and it would be useful to include information on the magnitude of observations seen here versus in the clinic (eg for the hematological parameters).</p>

<p>The research proposed in the RO1 application mentioned above included extensive PK, extended periods of treatment beyond 1 month of treatment (2-5 months as needed to reach negative culturable bacterial from organs) and of course relapse studies.</p>
