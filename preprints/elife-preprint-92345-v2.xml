<title>Abstract</title><p>Viruses are ubiquitous in nature and play key roles in various ecosystems. Notably, some viruses (e.g. bacteriophage) exhibit alternative life cycles, such as chronic infections without cell lysis. However, the impact of chronic infections and their interactions with the host organisms remains largely unknown. Here, we found for the first time that polysaccharides induced the production of multiple temperate phages infecting two deep-sea <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strains (WC36 and zth2). Through physiological assays, genomic analysis, and transcriptomics assays, we found these bacteriophages were released via a chronic style without host cell lysis, which might reprogram host polysaccharide metabolism through the potential auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs). The findings presented here, together with recent discoveries made on the reprogramming of host energy-generating metabolisms by chronic bacteriophages, shed light on the poorly explored marine virus-host interaction and bring us closer to understanding the potential role of chronic viruses in marine ecosystems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Viruses are the most abundant and genetically diverse biological entities on this planet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Suttle, 2007</xref>), and potentially play a role in shaping microbial abundances, community structure, and the evolutionary trajectory of core metabolisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Samson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zimmerman et al., 2020</xref>). The effect of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) on their specific hosts and within the microbial community is largely determined by their lifestyle. Traditionally, most bacteriophage life cycles are classified as being either lytic or lysogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Du Toit, 2017</xref>). During the lytic cycle, phages hijack the host’s metabolic machinery for replication of their own genome and the production of progeny particles that are released through lysis. By contrast, during lysogeny, phages integrate their genomes into the host chromosome (or exist in the extrachromosomal form) and enter a dormant state, with the potential to re-enter a lytic cycle and release progeny by environmental changes at a later stage. Currently, more and more attention has been paid to chronic life cycles where bacterial growth continues despite phage reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hoffmann Berling and Maze, 1964</xref>), which was different from the lysogenic life cycle that could possibly lyse the host under some specific conditions. During a chronic cycle, progeny phage particles are released from host cells via extrusion or budding without killing the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Putzrath and Maniloff, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Russel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Marvin et al., 2014</xref>), instead of lysis of the host cell. Chronic infections are common among eukaryotic viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Godkin and Smith, 2017</xref>), however, to our best knowledge, only few phages have been described for prokaryotes in the pure isolates up to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Roux et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Alarcón-Schumacher et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). The best-studied examples of chronic infection are those from filamentous ssDNA (single-stranded DNA) phages that to date have primarily been identified in the order <italic>Tubulavirales</italic>, which currently involves three families (<italic>Inoviridae</italic>, <italic>Paulinoviridae</italic> and <italic>Plectroviridae</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ackermann, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Knezevic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chevallereau et al., 2022</xref>). One of the most distinctive features of inoviruses is their ability to establish a chronic infection whereby their genomes may either integrate into the host chromosome or reside within the cell in a non-active form, and inoviruses particles are continuously released without killing the host. In addition, tailless phages enclosed in lipid membrane are also released from hosts during chronic life cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Recent studies indicate that chronic cycles are more widespread in nature than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mäntynen et al., 2021</xref>), and the abundance of inoviruses in ecosystem may have been far underestimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Roux et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, a large percentage of phages in nature are proposed to replicate through chronic life cycles, but whether chronic cycles are associated with specific environments or ecological conditions remains to be thoroughly explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chevallereau et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Marine ecosystems always influence the operating conditions for life on earth via microbial interaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Falkowski et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Faust and Raes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wigington et al., 2016</xref>), which are modulated by viruses through impacting their lifespan, gene flow and metabolic outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Suttle, 2005</xref>). A majority of these viruses are bacteriophages, which exist widely in oceans and affect the life activities of microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Breitbart, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Roux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gregory et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dominguez-Huerta et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to core viral genes encoding viral structural proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brum et al., 2016</xref>), bacteriophages also encode various auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brum and Sullivan, 2015</xref>) that provide supplemental support to key steps of host metabolism. For instance, AMGs of marine bacteriophages have been predicted to be involved in photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mann et al., 2003</xref>), nitrogen cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ahlgren et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gazitúa et al., 2021</xref>), sulfur cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Anantharaman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Roux et al., 2016</xref>), phosphorus cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zeng and Chisholm, 2012</xref>), nucleotide metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sullivan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dwivedi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Enav et al., 2014</xref>), and almost all central carbon metabolisms in host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hurwitz et al., 2013</xref>). However, AMGs of chronic phages have not been reported. Thus, it is worth exploring whether chronic phages could carry AMGs and assist host metabolism during chronic infection.</p>
<p>The deep sea harbors abundant and undiscovered viruses, which potentially control the metabolism of microbial hosts and influence biogeochemical cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Li et al., 2021</xref>). However, due to the vast majority of deep-sea microbes cannot be cultivated in the laboratory, most bacteriophages could not be isolated. Thus, it is of great significance to further identify unknown phages in the deep sea and explore their relationship with microbial hosts and even marine ecosystems. Here, we report that polysaccharides can induce deep-sea <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> bacteria (difficult-to-cultivate microorganisms) to release some chronic bacteriophages. These chronic bacteriophages might assist host polysaccharides metabolism via corresponding potential AMGs.</p>

<title>Polysaccharides promote the growth of deep-sea <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strain WC36 and stimulate the expression of phage-associated genes</title>
<p>As a primary carbon source, polysaccharides are a ubiquitous energy source for microorganisms in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zheng et al., 2021a</xref>). In our previous work, we successfully isolated a novel <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> species through a polysaccharide degradation-driven strategy from the deep-sea cold seep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zheng et al., 2021a</xref>). Of note, using the same approach and deep-sea sample replicates, we also cultured a bacterial strain WC36 that was identified as a member of the phylum <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> by 16S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogenetic analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). As expected, growth assays showed that two kinds of polysaccharides including laminarin and starch could promote strain WC36 growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In particular, supplementation of 10 g/L laminarin and 10 g/L starch in rich medium resulted in ∼7-fold and ∼4-fold growth promotion respectively compared to cultivation in rich medium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To explore the reasons behind this significant growth promotion by polysaccharide supplementation, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of strain WC36 cultured in rich medium supplemented either with or without 10 g/L laminarin for 5 days and 10 days. In addition to the up-regulation of genes related to glycan transport and degradation, when 10 g/L laminarin was added in the rich medium, the most upregulated genes were phage-associated (e. g. phage integrase, phage portal protein) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and Supplementary Table 1), which were expressed at the background level in the rich medium alone. Consistently, RT-qPCR results (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) confirmed upregulation of some genes encoding phage-associated proteins, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>. Therefore, we speculate that the metabolism of polysaccharides in strain WC36 might be closely connected with the phage production.</p>

<title>Polysaccharides induce the production of bacteriophages in <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strain WC36</title>
<p>To test our hypothesis that polysaccharides might induce strain WC36 to release bacteriophages, we grew strain WC36 in rich medium supplemented with or without laminarin or starch and isolated bacteriophages from the cell suspension supernatant according to established standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). Based on the growth curve of strain WC36, we found that the growth rate of strictly anaerobic strain WC36 was relatively slow. Therefore, different to the typical sampling time (24 h) for bacteriophage isolation from other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jiang and Paul, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Weinbauer et al., 1999</xref>), we selected a longer sampling time (10 days) to extract bacteriophages. TEM observation showed that many different shapes of phage-like structures indeed existed in the supernatant of WC36 cells cultured in rich medium supplemented with laminarin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, panels II-IV) or starch (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, panels V-VIII). In contrast, we did not observe any phage-like structures in the supernatant of WC36 cells cultured in rich medium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, panel I). We also tested and confirmed that there were not any phage-like structures in rich medium supplemented with 10 g/L laminarin alone (Supplementary Fig. 1A) or in 10 g/L starch alone (Supplementary Fig. 1B), ruling out the possibility of phage contamination from the polysaccharides (laminarin/ starch). These results suggest that polysaccharides indeed stimulate the production of various bacteriophages from strain WC36. Correspondingly, in the presence of laminarin, different forms of bacteriophages were observed by TEM, with filamentous ones dominant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The length of these filamentous phages was about ∼0.4 μm to ∼8.0 μm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, panel II), and the size of the hexagonal phages was less than 100 nm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, panel IV). In the presence of starch, in addition to filamentous and hexagonal phages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, panels V, VI, and VIII), we also observed a kind of icosahedral <italic>Microviridae</italic>-like phage with a diameter of 25-30 nm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, panel VII).</p>

</fig>
<p>Given that we found bacteriophages in cultures of strain WC36, we next sought to explore whether bacteriophages adhering to bacterial cells could be observed. To this end, we checked the morphology of strain WC36 in the absence or presence of polysaccharides. As expected, with TEM we observed many filamentous phage-like structures around strain WC36 cells cultivated in rich medium supplemented with laminarin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, panel II) and starch (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, panels III-IV). In contrast, we could not find any phage-like structures around strain WC36 cells cultivated in rich medium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, panel I). Meanwhile, we also checked the polysaccharides (laminarin/ starch) in rich medium directly by TEM and did not find any phage-like structures (Supplementary Fig. 2). Moreover, based on TEM observation of ultrathin sections of strain WC36 cultured in medium supplemented with polysaccharide, we even observed filamentous phages that were being released from or entering into host cells via a kind of extrusion or budding structure around bacterial cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, panels II-IV; Supplementary Fig. 3B, panels II-III), which were typical cellular structures in host cells used for chronic bacteriophage release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Marvin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Krupovic and Consortium, 2018</xref>). In contrast, phage-like structures with extrusions or buddings were not found in cells of strain WC36 cultivated in rich medium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, panel I; Supplementary Fig. 3B, panel I). Hence, these results collectively suggest that filamentous bacteriophages induced from deep-sea strain WC36 replicate in a chronic manner as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chevallereau et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). However, the entry and exit of the hexagonal phages into the WC36 cells were not observed.</p>
<p>To further verify the release style of bacteriophages from strain WC36 in the presence of polysaccharide, we prolonged the incubation time of this strain up to 30 days in medium supplemented with 5 g/L or 10 g/L laminarin. Strain WC36 showed stable growth after it entered the stationary phase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Regardless of whether the laminarin was present, the bacterial cells kept their cell shape intact, indicating they were still healthy after 30 days (Supplementary Fig. 3A, panels I-III). Apparently, the replication and release of bacteriophages in strain WC36 did not kill the host cell, consistent with the key feature of chronic bacteriophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Howard-Varona et al., 2017</xref>). With an increase of culture time (5, 10, or 30 days) and laminarin concentration (5 or 10 g/L), the number of released bacteriophages increased (Supplementary Fig. 3A, panels IV-VI; Supplementary Fig. 4, panels IV-IX). Specifically, the average number per microliter of filamentous phages (9.7, 29 or 65.3) extracted from the supernatant of strain WC36 cultured in rich medium supplemented with 10 g/L laminarin for 5, 10 or 30 days was higher than that cultured in rich medium supplemented with 5 g/L laminarin (4.3, 13.7 or 35.3) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The average number per microliter of hexagonal phages (9, 30, 46.7) extracted from the supernatant of strain WC36 cultured in rich medium supplemented with 10 g/L laminarin for 5, 10 or 30 days was higher than that cultured in rich medium supplemented with 5 g/L laminarin (4, 11.3 or 17.7) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>

<title>Polysaccharides promote the growth of deep-sea <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strain zth2 and induce bacteriophage production</title>
<p>To explore whether the production of bacteriophages induced by polysaccharide is an individual case, we further checked the effect of polysaccharides on another cultured deep-sea <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strain zth2. Strain zth2 was isolated by the same polysaccharide degradation-driven strategy as that used for strain WC36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity calculation using the NCBI server indicated that the closest relative of strain zth2 was strain WC36 (90.4%), which was lower than the threshold sequence identity (94.5%) for distinct genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Yarza et al., 2014</xref>). Based on a maximum likelihood tree and similarity of 16S rRNA gene sequences, we propose that strain zth2 and WC36 are the type strains of two different novel genera, both belonging to the <italic>Lentisphaeraceae</italic> family, <italic>Lentisphaerales</italic> order, <italic>Lentisphaeria</italic> class. Consistently, laminarin indeed promoted the growth of strain zth2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Analysis of the differential transcriptome and RT-qPCR of strain zth2 cultured in either unsupplemented medium or with laminarin showed that many genes encoding critical factors associated with the phage life cycle were up-regulated (ranging from 4 to 200 fold) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, C</xref> and Supplementary Table 2), suggesting that phages might also be involved in the utilization of laminarin by strain zth2, the same as in strain WC36.</p>

</fig>
<p>To further confirm the existence of bacteriophages in the supernatant of strain zth2 cell suspension cultured in medium supplemented with polysaccharide, we performed bacteriophage isolation from the supernatant of strain zth2 cultures followed by TEM. Indeed, many filamentous-, hexagonal- and icosahedral phages were clearly observed in the culture of strain zth2 grown in the presence of laminarin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, panels I-III) and starch (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, panels IV-V), but not in rich medium short of polysaccharide (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, panel VI). This suggests that bacteriophages were induced by supplementation of polysaccharide to strain zth2.</p>
<p>In addition, transcriptome and RT-qPCR results showed that genes encoding bacterial secretion system-related proteins were up-regulated in strains WC36 (Supplementary Fig. 5A, B) and zth2 (Supplementary Fig. 5C, D) cultured in medium supplemented with laminarin. It has been reported that filamentous phages utilize host cell secretion systems for their own egress from bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Davis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bille et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, the filamentous phages induced from strains WC36 and zth2 might also get in and out of host cells using bacterial secretion systems. Taken together, we conclude that laminarin effectively promotes the growth of deep-sea <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strains WC36 and zth2, and induces the production of bacteriophages. Distinct from previous reports that bacteriophages are induced under traditional conditions such as low temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wang et al., 2007</xref>), mitomycin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mazaheri Nezhad Fard et al., 2010</xref>), and ultraviolet irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">McKay and Baldwin, 1973</xref>), here, we report for the first time that polysaccharides induce the production of bacteriophages.</p>

<title>Bacteriophages reprogram the polysaccharide metabolism of <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strains WC36 and zth2</title>
<p>In this study, we clearly show that polysaccharide effectively promotes bacterial growth and simultaneously induces the production of bacteriophages, suggesting a close relationship between bacteriophages and host polysaccharide metabolism. Therefore, we sought to ask whether bacteriophages could reprogram polysaccharide metabolism in deep-sea bacteria. For this purpose, we sequenced the genomes of the bacteriophages induced by polysaccharides in <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strains WC36 and zth2. Eventually, two incomplete assembled genomes (Phage-WC36-1, 6.3 kb; Phage-WC36-2, 28.3 kb) were obtained from the bacteriophages of strain WC36 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, B</xref> and Supplementary Tables 3, 4). Meanwhile, two incomplete assembled genomes (Phage-zth2-1, 6.3 kb; Phage-zth2-2, 40.4 kb) were obtained from the phages of strain zth2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, C</xref> and Supplementary Tables 3, 5). Subsequently, we carefully compared the bacteriophage genomes with those of the corresponding hosts (strains WC36 and zth2) using Galaxy Version 2.6.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://galaxy.pasteur.fr/">https://galaxy.pasteur.fr/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Afgan et al., 2018</xref>) with the NCBI BLASTN method and used BWA-mem software for read mapping from host whole genome sequencing (WGS) to these bacteriophages. These analyses both showed that the bacteriophage genomes are completely outside of the host chromosomes. Through comparison of genome sequence (Supplementary Fig. 6), IMG database analysis, and phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7), we confirmed that Phage-WC36-1 was the same as Phage-zth2-1 (inoviruses, belonging to the family <italic>Inoviridae</italic>, order <italic>Tubulavirales</italic>, class <italic>Faserviricetes</italic>), indicating that inoviruses might be common in the <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> phylum. Inovirus members were the dominant population in the active group of viruses from deep-sea sediments, and encode some proteins contributing to host phenotypes and ultimately alter the fitness and other behaviors of their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Engelhardt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mai-Prochnow et al., 2015</xref>). A maximum likelihood tree showed that both Phage-WC36-2 and Phage-zth2-2 belonged to the class <italic>Caudoviricetes</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 8). In addition to genes encoding phage-associated proteins within the assembled bacteriophage genomes, there are also many genes encoding proteins associated with polysaccharide transport and degradation, which were potential AMGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Shaffer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pratama et al., 2021</xref>). These polysaccharide metabolizing proteins include TonB-system energizer ExbB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Koebnik, 2005</xref>), O-polysaccharide acetyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lunin et al., 2020</xref>), glucosaminidase, glycoside hydrolase family 127 protein (best BLASTP hit e-value 3e-25), and transglycosylase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). GH127 is one of the CAZymes, which are specifically responsible for degrading polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cantarel et al., 2009</xref>). Energizer ExbB is an important part of the TonB-system, which is often present in <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and responsible for transport of oligosaccharides from the outer membrane into the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Foley et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is absent in the strain WC36 and zth2 genomes. In natural ecosystems, viral infections indirectly influence microbial metabolic fluxes, metabolic reprogramming, and energy homeostasis of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Howard-Varona et al., 2020</xref>). For example, cyanoviruses possess AMGs encoding core photosynthetic reaction centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>) which are highly expressed during infection, thus stimulating photosynthesis and enhancing viral abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lindell et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, these potential AMGs encoding TonB-system energizer ExbB and glycoside hydrolases might reprogram the polysaccharide metabolism of host cells (strains WC36 and zth2) by providing supplemental support to key metabolic processes. The above results provide stronger evidence that the relationship between Phages-WC36 and their host is not a fight to the death between enemies, but in contrast a mutualistic relationship between partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Shkoporov et al., 2022</xref>). Overall, bacteriophages induced by polysaccharides contain potential AMGs associated with polysaccharide degradation, which may play a key role in the degradation and utilization of polysaccharide by host cells.</p>

<p>Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that selfish bacteria, which were common throughout the water column of the ocean, could bind, partially hydrolyze, and transport polysaccharides into the periplasmic space without loss of hydrolysis products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Reintjes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Giljan et al., 2023</xref>). Based on our results, we hypothesized that these chronic phages might also enter the host through this “selfishness” mechanism while assisting the host in metabolizing polysaccharides, thus not lysing the host. On the other hand, these chronic phages might hijack this “selfishness” mechanism to improve their infectivity and entry, rather than helping their hosts to grow and proliferate, so they could reap the benefits of simply having more hosts to infect. In the future, we need to construct a genetic operating system of the strictly anaerobic host strain WC36 to detailedly reveal the relationship between chronic phage and host.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>I have previously reviewed this manuscript as a submission to another journal in 2022. My recommendations here mirror those of my prior suggestions, now with further added details.</p>
<p>This manuscript describes the identification and isolation of several phage from deep sea isolates of Lentisphaerae strains WC36 and zth2. The authors observe induction of several putative chronic phages with the introduction of additional polysaccharides to the media. The authors suggest that two of the recovered phage genomes encode AMGs associated with polysaccharide use. The authors also suggest that adding the purified phage to cultures of Pseudomonas stutzeri 273 increased the growth of this bacteria due to augmented polysaccharide use genes from the phage.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Interesting isolate of deep sea Lentisphaerae strains which will undoubtedly further our understanding of deep sea microbial life.</p>
<p>The revisions have addressed the weaknesses raised in the previous review.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper investigates deep-sea bacteriophage systems which appear to employ a chronic replication mechanism that is induced or enhanced by polysaccharide addition. Some preliminary evidence for the potential role of auxiliary metabolic genes in aiding phage and/or host proliferation is also provided. The hypothesis being tested is fully supported with solid and convincing evidence and the findings are potentially generalizable with implications for our understanding of polysaccharide-mediated virus-host interactions and carbon cycling in marine ecosystems more broadly.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper synthesizes sequencing and phylogenic analyses of two Lentisphaerae bacteria and three phage genomes; electron microscopy imaging of bacterial/phage particles; differential gene expression analyses; differential growth curve analyses, and differential phage proliferation assays to extract insights into whether laminarin and starch can induce both host growth and phage proliferation. The data presented convincingly demonstrate that both host culture density and phage proliferation increase as a result having host, phage, and polysaccharide carbon source together in culture.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The AMG-centered elements of the article would be strengthened by more &quot;mechanistic&quot; experiments focusing on identifying &quot;HOW&quot; the polysaccharide processing, transport, and metabolism genes are being used by the phages to either directly increase viral infection/replication or else to indirectly do so by supporting the growth of the host (via mutualism). The concept of &quot;selfishness&quot; in bacterial systems and its potential role in viral life cycles could be more developed. Selfish bacteria are active throughout the water column of the ocean. ISME COMMUN. 3, 11 (2023) (see for instance <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00219-7">https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00219-7</ext-link>) and such &quot;selfish&quot; bacteria sequester metabolizable polysaccharides in their periplasm to advantage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201726">https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201726</ext-link>). It is plausible that phages may be either hijacking such polysaccharide sequestration mechanisms to improve infectivity and ENTRY or else helping their hosts to grow and proliferate so they can reap the benefits of simply having more hosts to infect. The current work does not clearly distinguish between these two distinct mechanistic possibilities. The paper would be strengthened by a more detailed/clear discussion of this possibility.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript presents useful findings on several phage from deep sea isolates of <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strains WC36 and zth2 that further our understanding of deep sea microbial life. The manuscript's primary claim is that phage isolates augment polysaccharide use in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> bacteria via auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs). However, the strength of the evidence is incomplete and does not support the primary claims. Namely, there are not data presented to rule out phage contamination in the polysaccharide stock solution, AMGs are potentially misidentified, and there is missing evidence of successful infection.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary: This manuscript describes the identification and isolation of several phage from deep sea isolates of <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strains WC36 and zth2. The authors observe induction of several putative chronic phages with the introduction of additional polysaccharides to the media. The authors suggest that two of the recovered phage genomes encode AMGs associated with polysaccharide use. The authors also suggest that adding the purified phage to cultures of <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> 273 increased the growth of this bacterium due to augmented polysaccharide use genes from the phage. While the findings were of interest and relevance to the field, it is my opinion that several of the analysis fall short of supporting the key assertions presented.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Many of the findings are consistent with a phage contamination in the polysaccharide stock solution.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. We are very sure that the phages are specifically derived from the <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strain WC36 but not the polysaccharide stock solution. The reasons are as following: (1) the polysaccharide stock solution was strictly sterilized to remove any phage contamination; (2) we have performed multiple TEM checks of the rich medium supplemented with 10 g/L laminarin alone (Supplementary Fig. 1A) or in 10 g/L starch alone (Supplementary Fig. 1B), and there were not any phage-like structures, which confirmed that the polysaccharides (laminarin/starch) we used were not contaminated with any phage-like structures; in addition, we also observed the polysaccharides (laminarin/starch) directly by TEM and did not find any phage-like structures (Supplementary Fig. 2); (3) the polysaccharide (starch) alone could not promote the growth of <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> 273, however, the supplement of starch together with the extracted Phages-WC36 could effectively facilitate the growth of <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> 273 (Author response image 1). The above results clearly indicated the phages were derived from the <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strain WC36 but not the polysaccharide stock solution.</p>

<p>(2) The genes presented as AMGs are largely well known and studied phage genes which play a role in infection cycles.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. Indeed, these AMGs may be only common in virulent phages, while have never been reported in chronic phages. In virulent phages, these genes typically act as lysozymes, facilitating the release of virions from the host cell upon lysis, or injection of viral DNA upon infection. However, the chronic phages do not lyse the host. Therefore, the persistence of these genes in chronic phages may be due to their ability to assist the host in metabolizing polysaccharides. Finally, according to your suggestions, we have weakened the role of AMGs and added “potential” in front of it. The detailed information is shown below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The evidence that the isolated phage can infect <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> 273 is lacking, putting into question the dependent results.</p>

<p>Thanks for your comments.

It is reported that filamentous phages could recognize and bind to the host pili, which causes the pili to shrink and brings the filamentous phages closer to and possibly through the outer membrane of host cells. The possible mechanism of other chronic phages release without breaking the host might be that it was enclosed in lipid membrane and released from the host cells by a nonlytic manner. Thus, these chronic phages may have a wider host range. However, we were unable to further reveal the infection mechanism due to some techniques absence. Therefore, according to your suggestions, we have deleted this section in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>I have previously reviewed this manuscript as a submission to another journal in 2022. My recommendations here mirror those of my prior suggestions, now with further added details.</p>

<p>Thanks for your great efforts for reviewing our manuscript and valuable suggestions for last and this versions.</p>

<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>Comment 1: Line 32. Rephrase to &quot;polysaccharides cause the induction of multiple temperate phages infecting two strains of <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> (WC36 and zth2) from the deep sea.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your positive suggestion. We have modified this description as “Here, we found for the first time that polysaccharides induced the production of multiple temperate phages infecting two deep-sea <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strains (WC36 and zth2).” in the revised manuscript (Lines 31-33).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2: Line 66. &quot;Chronic&quot; infections are not &quot;lysogenic&quot; as described here, suggesting the former is a subcategory of the latter. If you are going to introduce lifecycles you need a brief sentence distinguishing &quot;chronic&quot; from &quot;lysogenic&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your positive suggestion. We added this sentence as “Currently, more and more attention has been paid to chronic life cycles where bacterial growth continues despite phage reproduction (Hoffmann Berling and Maze, 1964), which was different from the lysogenic life cycle that could possibly lyse the host under some specific conditions.” in the revised manuscript (Lines 66-69).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 3: Line 72. Please avoid generalized statements like &quot;a hand-full&quot; (or &quot;plenty&quot; line 85). Try to be at least somewhat quantitative regarding how many chronic phages are known. This is a fairly common strategy among archaeal viruses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion. Given that some filamentous phages also have a chronic life cycle that is not explicitly reported, we cannot accurately estimate their numbers. According to your suggestions, we have modified these descriptions as “however, to our best knowledge, only few phages have been described for prokaryotes in the pure isolates up to date (Roux et al., 2019; Alarcón-Schumacher et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022).” in the revised manuscript (Lines 73-75). In addition, the number of chronic phages in the biosphere cannot be accurately estimated, according to the latest report (Chevallereau et al., 2022), which showed that “a large fraction of phages in the biosphere are produced through chronic life cycles”. Therefore, we have modified this description as “Therefore, a large percentage of phages in nature are proposed to replicate through chronic life cycles” in the revised manuscript (Lines 87-88).</p>

<p>Comment 5: Line 137. I see the phage upregulation in Figure 1, however in the text and figure it would be good to also elaborate on what the background expression generally looks like. Perhaps a transcriptomic read normalization and recruitment to the genome with a display of the coverage map, highlighting the prophage would be helpful. Are the polysacharides directly influencing phage induction or is there some potential for another cascading effect?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. We have elaborated all expressions of phage-associated genes under different conditions in the Supplementary Table 1, which showed that the background expressions were very low. The numbers in Fig. 1C were the gene expressions (by taking log2 values) of strain WC36 cultured in rich medium supplemented with 10 g/L laminarin compared with the rich medium alone.</p>
<p>In addition, our RT-qPCR results (Fig. 1D) also confirmed that these genes encoding phage-associated proteins were significantly upregulated when 10 g/L laminarin was added in the rich medium. According to your suggestions, we have modified this description as “In addition to the up-regulation of genes related to glycan transport and degradation, when 10 g/L laminarin was added in the rich medium, the most upregulated genes were phage-associated (e. g. phage integrase, phage portal protein) (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Table 1), which were expressed at the background level in the rich medium alone.” in the revised manuscript (Lines 136-140). Based on the present results, we speculate that polysaccharides might directly induce phage production, which needs to be verified by a large number of experiments in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 6: Line 179. We need some assurance that phage was not introduced by your laminarin or starch supplement. Perhaps a check on the TEM/sequencing check of supplement itself would be helpful? This may be what is meant on Line 188 &quot;without culturing bacterial cells&quot; however this is not clearly worded if that is the case. Additional note, further reading reinforces this as a key concern. Many of the subsequent results are consistent with a contaminated starch stock.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. We are very sure that the phages are specifically derived from the <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strain WC36 but not the polysaccharide stock solution. The reasons are as following: (1) we have performed multiple TEM checks of the rich medium supplemented with 10 g/L laminarin alone (Supplementary Fig. 1A) or in 10 g/L starch alone (Supplementary Fig. 1B), and there were not any phage-like structures, which confirmed that the polysaccharides (laminarin/starch) we used are not contaminated with any phage-like structures. In addition, we also observed the polysaccharides (laminarin/starch) directly by TEM and did not find any phage-like structures (Supplementary Fig. 2). According to your suggestions, we have modified this description as “We also tested and confirmed that there were not any phage-like structures in rich medium supplemented with 10 g/L laminarin alone (Supplementary Fig. 1A) or in 10 g/L starch alone (Supplementary Fig. 1B), ruling out the possibility of phage contamination from the polysaccharides (laminarin/ starch).” in the revised manuscript (Lines 158-162) and “Meanwhile, we also checked the polysaccharides (laminarin/ starch) in rich medium directly by TEM and did not find any phage-like structures (Supplementary Fig. 2).” in the revised manuscript (Lines 178-180). (2) the polysaccharide stock solution was strictly sterilized to remove any phage contamination. (3) the polysaccharide (starch) alone could not promote the growth of <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> 273, however, the supplement of starch together with the extracted Phages-WC36 could effectively facilitate the growth of <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> 273 (Response Figure 1). The above results clearly indicated the phage was derived from the <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strain WC36 but not the polysaccharide stock solution.</p>
<p>In addition, given that polysaccharide was a kind of critical energy source for most microorganisms, we sought to ask whether polysaccharide also induces the production of bacteriophages in other deep-sea bacteria. To this end, we cultured deep-sea representatives from other four other phyla (including <italic>Chloroflexi</italic>, <italic>Tenericutes</italic>, <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, and <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>) in the medium supplemented with laminarin/starch, and checked the supernatant of cells suspension through TEM as described above. We could not find any phage-like structures in these cells suspension (Author reaponse image 2), which also confirmed that there was no phage contamination in the polysaccharides.</p>

<p>Thanks for your valuable comments. According to your suggestions, we have moved the discussion of AMGs to after the discussion of the phage genome identification.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 12: Line 312. It would be informative to sequence in-bulk each of your treatments as opposed to just sequencing the viral isolates (starch and no host included) to see what viruses can be identified in each. ABySS is also not a common assembler for viral analysis. Is there literature to support it as a sufficient tool in assembling viral genomes? What sequencing depths were obtained in your samples?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. In previous studies, we did sequence the starch or laminarin alone (no host included) and did not detect any phage-related sequences. The introduction of ABySS software was shown in these literatures (Jackman SD, Vandervalk BP, Mohamadi H, Chu J, Yeo S, Hammond SA, Jahesh G, Khan H, Coombe L, Warren RL, Birol I. ABySS 2.0: resource-efficient assembly of large genomes using a Bloom filter. Genome Res. 2017 May;27(5):768-777; Simpson JT, Wong K, Jackman SD, Schein JE, Jones SJ, Birol I. ABySS: a parallel assembler for short read sequence data. Genome Res. 2009 Jun;19(6):1117-23.), which were also used to assemble viral genomes in these literatures (Guo Y, Jiang T. First Report of <italic>Sugarcane Mosaic Virus</italic> Infecting Goose Grass in Shandong Province, China.

<p>Thanks for your comments. We have used the ABySS software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/abyss">http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/abyss</ext-link>) to perform genome assembly with multiple-Kmer parameters. VIBRANT v1.2.1 (Kieft et al., 2020), DRAM-v (Shaffer et al., 2020), VirSorter v1.0.5 (with categories 1 (“pretty sure”) and 2 (“quite sure”)) (Roux et al., 2015) and VirFinder v1.1 (with statistically significant viral prediction: score &gt; 0.9 and <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) (Ren et al., 2017) with default parameters were used to identify viral genomes from these assembly sequences by searching against the both cultured and non-cultured viral NCBI-RefSeq database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) and IMG/VR database (Camargo et al., 2023). The GapCloser software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/soapdenovo2/files/GapCloser/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/soapdenovo2/files/GapCloser/</ext-link>) was subsequently applied to fill up the remaining local inner gaps and correct the single base polymorphism for the final assembly results. All the detailed processes were described in the supplementary information. The virus sequences with higher scores are only these four, but they are not complete genomes. Some virus sequences with shorter sequences and lower scores were excluded.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 14: Line 328. We need some details about the host genomes here. How were these derived? What is their completeness/contamination? What is their size? If the bins are poor, these would not serve as a reliable comparison to identify integrated phage.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. For genomic sequencing, strains WC36 and zth2 were grown in the liquid rich medium supplemented with 5 g/L laminarin and starch and harvested after one week of incubation at 28 °C. Genomic DNA was isolated by using the PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (Mo Bio Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, CA). Thereafter, the genome sequencing was carried out with both the Illumina NovaSeq PE150 (San Diego, USA) and Nanopore PromethION platform (Oxford, UK) at the Beijing Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd. A complete description of the library construction, sequencing, and assembly was performed as previously described (Zheng et al., 2021). We used seven databases to predict gene functions, including Pfam (Protein Families Database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pfam.xfam.org/">http://pfam.xfam.org/</ext-link>), GO (Gene Ontology, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://geneontology.org/">http://geneontology.org/</ext-link>) (Ashburner et al., 2000), KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/">http://www.genome.jp/kegg/</ext-link>) (Kanehisa et al., 2004), COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/</ext-link>) (Galperin et al., 2015), NR (Non-Redundant Protein Database databases), TCDB (Transporter Classification Database), and Swiss-Prot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/</ext-link>) (Bairoch and Apweiler, 2000). A whole genome Blast search (E-value less than 1e-5, minimal alignment length percentage larger than 40%) was performed against above seven databases.</p>
<p>The completeness of the genomes of strains WC36 and zth2 were 100%, which were checked by the CheckM v1.2.2. The size of the genome of strains WC36 and zth2 were 3,660,783 bp and 3,198,720bp, respectively. The complete genome sequences of strains WC36 and zth2 presented in this study have been deposited in the GenBank database with accession numbers CP085689 and CP071032, respectively.</p>
<p>Moreover, to verify whether the absence of microbial contamination in phage sequencing results, we used the new alignment algorithm BWA-MEM (version 0.7.15) to perform reads mapping of host WGS to these phages. We found that all the raw reads of host strains (WC36 and zth2) were not mapping to these phages sequences (Author response image 3, shown as below). In addition, we also performed the evaluation of the assembly graph underlying the host consensus assemblies. Clean reads were mapped to the bacterial complete genome sequences by the Bowtie 2 (version 2.5.0), BWA (version 0.7.8) and SAMTOOLS (version 0.1.18). The results showed that the total mismatch rate of strains WC36 and zth2 were almost 0% and 0.03%, respectively (Author response table 1, shown as below). In addition, we also collected the cells of strains WC36 and zth2, and then sent them to another company for whole genome sequencing (named WC36G and ZTH, GenBank accession numbers CP151801 and CP119760, respectively). The completeness of the genomes of strains WC36G and ZTH were also 100%. The size of the genome of strains WC36G and ZTH were 3,660,783bp and 3,198,714bp, respectively. The raw reads of strains WC36G and zth2 were also not mapping to the phages sequences. Therefore, we can confirm that these bacteriophage genomes were completely outside of the host chromosomes.</p>

If you were to sequence your purified isolate cultures from the rich media alone and include all assemblies (not just those binned for example) as a reference, would you be able to recruit viral reads? The way this reads suggests that Chevallereau et al., worked specifically with these phage, which is not the case - please rephrase.</p>

<p>Thanks for your comments. We carefully compared the bacteriophage genomes with those of the corresponding hosts (strains WC36 and zth2) using Galaxy Version 2.6.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://galaxy.pasteur.fr/">https://galaxy.pasteur.fr/</ext-link>) (Afgan et al., 2018) with the NCBI BLASTN method and used BWA-mem software for read mapping from host whole genome sequencing (WGS) to these bacteriophages. These analyses both showed that the bacteriophage genomes are completely outside of the host chromosomes. Therefore, we hypothesized that the phage genomes might exist in the host in the form similar to that of plasmid.</p>

<p>Thanks for your comments. According to your suggestions, all the related information was shown in this section “Materials and methods” of this manuscript. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of Phage-WC36-2 and Phage-zth2-2 was constructed based on the terminase large subunit protein (terL). These proteins used to construct the phylogenetic trees were all obtained from the NCBI databases. All the sequences were aligned by MAFFT version 7 (Katoh et al., 2019) and manually corrected. The phylogenetic trees were constructed using the W-IQ-TREE web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iqtree.cibiv.univie.ac.at">http://iqtree.cibiv.univie.ac.at</ext-link>) with the “GTR+F+I+G4” model (Trifinopoulos et al., 2016).

<p>Comment 18: Line 346. How are you specifically defining AMGs in this study? Most of these are well-known and studied phage genes with specific life cycle functions and could not be considered as polysaccharide processing AMGs even though in host cells many do play a role in polysaccharide processing systems. A substantially deeper literature review is needed in this section, which would ultimately eliminate most of these from the potential AMG pools. Further, the simple HMM/BLASTp evalues are not sufficient to support the functional annotation of these genes. At a minimum, catalytic/conserved regions should be identified, secondary structures compared, and phylogenetic analysis (where possible) developed etc... My recommendation is to eliminate this section entirely from the manuscript.</p>
<p>Categorically:</p>
<p>- Glycoside hydrolase (various families), glucosaminidases, and transglycosylase are all very common to phage and operate generally as a lysins, facilitating the release of virions from the host cell upon lysis, or injection of viral DNA upon infection <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00745">https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00745</ext-link> (and citations therein) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2023.10.018">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2023.10.018</ext-link> etc... In order to confirm these as distinct AMGs we would need a very detailed analysis indicating that these are not phage infection cycle/host recognition related, however I strongly suspect that under such interrogation, these would prove to be as such.</p>
<p>-TonB related systems including ExbB are well studied among phages as part of the trans-location step in infection. These could not be considered as AMGs. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.00428-19">https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.00428-19</ext-link>. Other TonB dependent receptors play a role in host recognition.</p>
<p>-Several phage acetyltransferases play a role in suppressing host RNA polymerase in order to reserve host cell resources for virion production, including polysaccharide production. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3390/v12090976">https://doi.org/10.3390/v12090976</ext-link>. Further it has been shown that the <italic>E. coli</italic> gene <italic>neuO</italic> (O-acetyltransferase) is a homologue of lambdoid phage tail fiber genes <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0407428102">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0407428102</ext-link>. I suspect the latter is also the case here and this is a tail fiber gene.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your valuable comments. According to your suggestions, we have reanalyzed these AMGs and made some modifications (the new version Fig. 5A, shown as below). These genes encoding proteins associated with polysaccharide transport and degradation may be only common in virulent phages, and have never been reported in chronic phages. Unlike virulent phages, these genes typically act as lysozymes, facilitating the release of virions from the host cell upon lysis, or injection of viral DNA upon infection, chronic phages do not lyse the host. It is reported that, filamentous phages could recognize and bind to the host pili, which causes the pili to shrink and brings the filamentous phages closer to and possibly through the outer membrane of host cells (Riechmann <italic>et al</italic>., 1997; Sun <italic>et al</italic>., 1987). The possible mechanism of other chronic phage release without breaking the host might be that it was enclosed in lipid membrane and released from the host cells by a nonlytic manner. It has recently been reported that the tailless <italic>Caudoviricetes</italic> phage particles are enclosed in lipid membrane and are released from the host cells by a nonlytic manner (Liu et al., 2022), and the prophage induction contributes to the production of membrane vesicles by <italic>Lacticaseibacillus casei</italic> BL23 during cell growth (da Silva Barreira et al., 2022). Therefore, the persistence of these genes in chronic phages may be due to their ability to assist the host in metabolizing polysaccharides.</p>
<p>Finally, according to your suggestions, we have weakened the role of AMGs and added “potential” in front of it.</p>

<p>Comment 21: Line 380. This section needs to start with detailed evidence that this phage can even infect this particular strain. Added note, upon further reading the serial dilution cultures are not sufficient to prove these phage infect this Pseudomonas. We need at a minimum a one-step growth curve and wet mount microscopy. It is much more likely that some carry over contaminant is invading the culture and influencing OD600. With the given evidence, I am not at all convinced that these phages have anything to do with <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> polysaccharide use and I recommend either drastically revising this section or eliminating it entirely.</p>
<p>Line 386-389. Could this be because you are observing your added phage in the starch enriched media while no phage were introduced with the &quot;other types of media&quot; so none would be observed? This could have nothing to do with infection dynamics. Further, this would also be consistent with your starch solution being contaminated by phage.</p>
<p>Line 399. Again consistent with the starch media being contaminated.</p>
<p>Line 401-408. This is more likely to do with the augmentation of the media with an additional carbon source and not involving the phage.</p>
<p>Line 410. I am not convinced that these viruses infect the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strain. Extensive further evidence of infection is needed to make these assertions.  Figure 6A. We need confirmation that the isolate culture remains pure and there are no other contaminants introduced with the phage.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. We have proved that the polysaccharides (laminarin/ starch) didn't contaminate any phages above. Actually, we selected many marine strains <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=1224">(</ext-link><italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=1224">Pseudomonadota</ext-link></italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=1224">,</ext-link> <italic>Planctomycetes</italic>, <italic>Verrucomicrobia</italic>, <italic>Fusobacteria</italic>, and <italic>Tenericutes</italic> isolates) to investigate whether Phages-WC36 could assist them in degradation and utilization of polysaccharides, and found that Phages-WC36 could only promote the growth of strain 273. The presence of filamentous phages and hexagonal phages was detected in the supernatant of strain 273 cultured in basal medium supplemented with 5 g/L starch and 20 μl/mL Phages-WC36. After 3 passages of serial cultivation in basal medium supplemented with 5 g/L starch, we found that filamentous phages and hexagonal phages were also present in basal medium supplemented with starch, but not in the basal medium, which may mean that Phages-WC36 could infect strain 273 and starch is an important inducer. In addition, the Phages-WC36 used in the growth assay of strain 273 were multiple purified and eventually suspended in SM buffer (0.01% gelatin, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgSO4). Thus, these phages are provided do not contain some extracellular enzymes and/or nutrients. In addition, we set up three control groups in the growth assay of strain 273: basal medium, basal medium supplemented with Phages-WC36 and basal medium supplemented with starch. If the Phages-WC36 contains some extracellular enzymes and/or nutrients, strain 273 could also grow well in the basal medium supplemented only with Phages-WC36. However, the poor growth results of strain 273 cultivated in the basal medium supplemented with Phages-WC36 further confirmed that there were not some extracellular enzymes and/or nutrients in these phages.</p>
<p>Finally, the possible mechanism of the chronic phage release without breaking the host might be that it was enclosed in lipid membrane and released from the host cells by a nonlytic manner. Thus, these chronic phages may have a wider host range. However, we were unable to further disclose the infection mechanism in this paper. Therefore, according to your suggestions, we have deleted this section entirely.</p>

<p>Summary: This paper investigates virus-host interactions in deep-sea bacteriophage systems which employ a seemingly mutualistic approach to viral replication in which the virus aids host cell polysaccharide import and utilization via metabolic reprogramming. The hypothesis being tested is supported with solid and convincing evidence and the findings are potentially generalizable with implications for our understanding of polysaccharide-mediated virus-host interactions and carbon cycles in marine ecosystems more broadly.</p>

<p>Weaknesses (suggestions for improvement):</p>
<p>(1) The article would be strengthened by the following additional experiment: providing the phage proteins hypothesized to be aiding host cell growth (red genes from Figure 5...TonB system energizer ExbB, glycosidases, etc) individually or in combination on plasmids rather than within the context of the actual phage itself to see if such additional genes are necessary and sufficient to realize the boosts in host cell growth/saturation levels observed in the presence of the phages tested.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your valuable comments. It is a really good idea to express individually or in combination on plasmids to see the effects of those polysaccharide-degradation proteins in the host cell. However, at present, we failed to construct the genetic and expression system for the strictly anaerobic strain WC36, which hindering our further detailed investigation of the functions of those polysaccharide-degradation proteins. In our lab, we are trying our best to build the genetic and expression system for strain WC36. We will definitely test your idea in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The paper would also benefit from additional experiments focused on determining how the polysaccharide processing, transport, and metabolism genes are being used by the phages to either directly increase viral infection/replication or else to indirectly do so by supporting the growth of the host in a more mutualistic manner (i.e. by improving their ability to import, degrade, and metabolize polysaccharides).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your valuable comments. Indeed, due to the chronic phage genome is not within the chromosome of the host, it is very hard to disclose the exact auxiliary process and mechanism of chronic phages. At present, we are trying to construct a genetic manipulation system for the strictly anaerobic host WC36, and we will gradually reveal this auxiliary mechanism in the future. In addition, combined with the reviewer 1’s suggestions, the focus of revised manuscript is to emphasize that polysaccharides induce deep-sea bacteria to release chronic phages, and most of the content of phage assisting host metabolism of polysaccharides has been deleted.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The introduction would benefit from a discussion of what is known regarding phage and/or viral entry pathways that utilize carbohydrate anchors during host entry. The discussion could also be improved by linking the work presented to the concept of &quot;selfishness&quot; in bacterial systems (see for instance Giljan, G., Brown, S., Lloyd, C.C. et al. Selfish bacteria are active throughout the water column of the ocean. ISME COMMUN. 3, 11 (2023) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00219-7">https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00219-7</ext-link>). The bacteria under study are gram negative and it was recently demonstrated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201726">https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201726</ext-link>) that &quot;selfish&quot; bacteria sequester metabolizable polysaccharides in their periplasm to advantage. It is plausible that the phages may be hijacking this &quot;selfishness&quot; mechanism to improve infectivity and ENTRY rather than helping their hosts to grow and profilerate so they can reap the benefits of simply having more hosts to infect. The current work does not clearly distinguish between these two distinct mechanistic possibilities. The paper would be strengthened by at least a more detailed discussion of this possibility as well as the author's rationale for interpreting their data as they do to favor the &quot;mutualistic&quot; interpretation. In the same light, the paper would benefit from a more careful choice of words which can also help to make such a distinction more clear/evident/intentional. As currently written the authors seem to be actively avoiding giving insights wrt this question.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your valuable comments. According to your suggestions, we have added the related discussion as “Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that selfish bacteria, which were common throughout the water column of the ocean, could bind, partially hydrolyze, and transport polysaccharides into the periplasmic space without loss of hydrolysis products (Reintjes et al., 2017; Giljan et al., 2023). Based on our results, we hypothesized that these chronic phages might also enter the host through this “selfishness” mechanism while assisting the host in metabolizing polysaccharides, thus not lysing the host. On the other hand, these chronic phages might hijack this “selfishness” mechanism to improve their infectivity and entry, rather than helping their hosts to grow and proliferate, so they could reap the benefits of simply having more hosts to infect. In the future, we need to construct a genetic operating system of the strictly anaerobic host strain WC36 to detailedly reveal the relationship between chronic phage and host.” in the revised manuscript (Lines 305-316).</p>

<p>(4) Finally, I would be interested to know if the author’s sequencing datasets might be used to inform the question raised above by using bacterial immunity systems such as CRISPR/Cas9. For example, if the phage systems studied are truly beneficial/mutualistic for the bacteria then it’s less likely that there would be evidence of targeted immunity against that particular phage that has the beneficial genes that support polysaccharide metabolism.</p>

<p>Thanks for your comments. According to your suggestions, we have carefully analyzed the genome of strain WC36, and found that there were no CRISPR/Cas9-related genes.
