<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Orexin signaling in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra promotes locomotion and reward processing, but it is not clear whether dopaminergic neurons directly mediate these effects. We show that dopaminergic neurons in these areas mainly express orexin receptor subtype 1 (Ox1R). In contrast, only a minor population in the medial ventral tegmental area express orexin receptor subtype 2 (Ox2R). To analyze the functional role of Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons, we deleted Ox1R specifically in dopamine transporter-expressing neurons of mice and investigated the functional consequences. Deletion of Ox1R increased locomotor activity and exploration during exposure to novel environments or when intracerebroventricularely injected with orexin A. Spontaneous activity in home cages, anxiety, reward processing, and energy metabolism did not change. Positron emission tomography imaging revealed that Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons affected distinct neural circuits depending on the stimulation mode. In line with an increase of neural activity in the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) of Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice, we found that dopaminergic projections innervate the LPGi in regions where the inhibitory dopamine receptor subtype D2 but not the excitatory D1 subtype resides. These data suggest a crucial regulatory role of Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons in novelty-induced locomotion and exploration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Orexin neurons are exclusively located in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and adjacent regions in the brain, including the perifornical area, and dorsomedial and posterior hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Soya &amp; Sakurai, 2020</xref>). Abundant orexin fibers innervate the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN), which together contain the majority of dopaminergic neurons in humans and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fadel &amp; Deutch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30a">Hrabovszky et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Peyron et al., 1998</xref>). There are also some dopaminergic neurons in other brain regions, although not all of these neurons express the dopamine transporter (DAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Koblinger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sharples et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Turiault et al., 2007</xref>). Both the orexin and dopaminergic systems control food intake, locomotor activity, reward processing as well as energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Howe &amp; Dombeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c301">Inutsuka &amp; Yamanaka, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Narayanan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Palmiter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tsujino &amp; Sakurai, 2013</xref>). Dopamine was discovered as a neuro-active molecule approximately 70 years ago and the dopaminergic system has diverse functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Iversen &amp; Iversen, 2007</xref>). In a simplified model the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, containing the dopaminergic projections from SN to the dorsal striatum, predominantly regulates action selection and exploratory behaviors. In contrast, the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic systems, which consist of the dopaminergic pathways from the VTA to the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex, predominantly regulate motivation, cognition, decision making, reward, and aversive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kutlu et al., 2021</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Latif et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lerner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Roeper, 2013</xref>). Some VTA dopaminergic neurons also represent movements in trained animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lerner et al., 2021</xref>). Dopaminergic neurons modulate movement differently via direct and indirect pathways through the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kreitzer &amp; Malenka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Roseberry et al., 2016</xref>). Co-release of other neuro-active molecules by dopaminergic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barcomb &amp; Ford, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buck et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zych &amp; Ford, 2022</xref>) and the spatial and temporal dynamics of dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chantranupong et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Liu et al., 2021</xref>) could further affect the precision and diversity of dopaminergic functions.</p>
<p>Orexin A injection into the VTA increases cocaine- and morphine-related reward processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mahler et al., 2012</xref>), and intra-SN injection of orexin A induces hyperlocomotion and stereotypic behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Nakamura et al., 2000</xref>). On the other hand, systemic injection of dopamine receptor antagonists reduces orexin A-induced increase of hyperlocomotion, stereotypic and grooming behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Nakamura et al., 2000</xref>). However, whether the above effects of orexin signaling in the VTA and SN are mediated by dopaminergic or non-dopaminergic cells is not yet clear.</p>
<p>The orexin system consists of the two peptides orexin A and B, which are derived from the precursor, prepro-orexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">de Lecea et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sakurai et al., 1998</xref>). Both are endogenous ligands for two G-protein-coupled receptors, orexin receptor subtype 1 (Ox1R), and 2 (Ox2R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sakurai et al., 1998</xref>). Orexin A activates both receptors, while orexin B predominantly activates Ox2R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sakurai et al., 1998</xref>). The mRNA detection by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization revealed the expression of both receptors in the VTA and SN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Marcus et al., 2001</xref>). However, the cell-type specific expression of Ox1R and Ox2R in the VTA and SN is not well understood. Electrophysiological studies showed that orexin receptors are present in dopaminergic VTA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baimel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Korotkova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Tung et al., 2016</xref>), whereas data for the SN seem controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Korotkova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Liu et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we aim to map the expression patterns of Ox1R and Ox2R in dopaminergic VTA and SN neurons and investigate the functional role of Ox1R using conditional knockout mice.</p>

<title>Ox1R is the predominant orexin receptor in dopaminergic neurons</title>
<p>To analyze the expression patterns of orexin receptors in dopaminergic VTA and SN neurons, we performed fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (RNAscope) of tyrosine hydroxylase (<italic>Th</italic>), Ox1R (<italic>Hcrtr1</italic>) and Ox2R (<italic>Hcrtr2</italic>) in control (Ox1R flox/flox, DAT wt/wt) mice and Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> (Ox1R fl/fl, DAT-Cre tg/wt) mice, from the same breeding crossing mice carrying a loxP-flanked Ox1R-allele (Ox1R fl/fl) with DAT-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ekstrand et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In control mice, Ox1R was expressed in 44 - 58% of dopaminergic neurons in all VTA and SN sub-regions, including the interfascicular (IF), paranigral (PN), parainterfascicular (PIF) and parabrachial (PBP) subnuclei of the VTA and SN. In contrast, Ox2R-positive dopaminergic neurons were mainly located in the medial VTA, including IF, PN, and PIF, with 25 - 42% of dopaminergic neurons expressing the Ox2R (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, C, D, G-I</xref>; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). While the above data were calculated as the mean percentages in the investigated mice, we also calculated the mean dopaminergic neuron numbers separately for those expressing both or exclusively one of the orexin receptor types. Thus, we could analyze the distribution of Ox1R-, Ox2R-, Ox1R and Ox2R-, and none (of orexin receptors)-expressing dopaminergic neurons in each VTA subregion and the SN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). The results were similar to the above: 47 - 59% of dopaminergic neurons expressed Ox1R in all VTA and SN sub-regions, and Ox2R was mainly expressed by 26 - 41% of dopaminergic neurons in the medial VTA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). 19 - 25% of dopaminergic neurons in the medial VTA expressed both Ox1R and Ox2R (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). Of note, abundant Ox1R and Ox2R expression was present in Th-negative neurons in the VTA, SN, and neighboring regions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, C, D</xref>, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Since most dopaminergic neurons express Ox1R, we focused the functional analysis on Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, Ox1R was specifically inactivated in dopaminergic (DAT-expressing) neurons of mice (Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup>). As a prerequisite for the functional analysis (behavior and PET imaging) validation of the Ox1R deletion was necessary. In Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice, Ox1R expression was significantly reduced in dopaminergic neurons and remained unchanged in Th-negative cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, E-I</xref>; Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). In contrast, the Ox2R expression patterns remained similar to that in the control mice, indicating the successful and specific knockout of Ox1R in dopaminergic neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, E-I</xref>; Figure 1—figure supplement 1B).</p>

<p>Next, we used perforated patch clamp recordings to establish that orexin A activates dopaminergic neurons not only in the mouse VTA (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baimel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Korotkova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Tung et al., 2016</xref>), but also in the mouse SN (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). In dopaminergic SN neurons that were pharmacologically isolated from GABAerigc and glutamatergic synaptic input 100 nM orexin increased the action potential frequency in 75% (6 of 8) of the neurons. Increasing the orexin A concentration to 300 nM further increased the firing frequency. This finding is consistent with previous extracellular recordings in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Liu et al. 2018</xref>). To also validate the Ox1R knockout in dopaminergic neurons functionally, we performed Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in acute brain slices from control and Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice. We used the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6s to monitor [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> specifically in dopaminergic (DAT-expressing) neurons. This analysis focused on dopaminergic neurons in the SN, which we used as an “indicator population” because a large number of these neurons express Ox1R. During the experiments, GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic input was blocked and orexin A was bath-applied at 100 nM and 300 nM. Bath application of 100 nM orexin A already resulted in a clear and significant increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in dopaminergic SN control neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I-L</xref>, Figure 1—figure supplement 3, 4). For quantification, we tested each neuron whether it responded to 100 nM orexin A. A neuron was considered orexin-responsive if the change in GCaMPs fluorescence induced by orexin A was three times larger than the baseline fluorescence’s standard deviation (3 σ criterion ≙ Z-score of 3). We found that 56% of the neurons tested responded to 100 nM orexin A, while 44% of the neurons did not respond (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L</xref>, Figure 1—figure supplement 4). These data are in very good agreement with the number of Ox1R-expressing neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). To determine the “population response” of all analyzed neurons, we measured the orexin-induced GCaMP6s fluorescence of each neuron expressed as a percentage of the GCaMP6s fluorescence induced by applying high (40 mM) K<sup>+</sup> saline (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L</xref>, Figure 1—figure supplement 3). This is a solid reference point since it reflects the GCaMP6s fluorescence at maximal voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The “population response” of all analyzed neurons was expressed as the mean ± SEM of these responses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L</xref>). The significance of this mean response was tested for each group (control and Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup>) using a one-sample t-test. We found a highly significant and marked response of control neurons to 100 nM orexin A, while the Ox1R knockout neurons did not respond (control: p &lt; 0.0001, n = 71; Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup>: p = 0.5, n = 86; one sample t-test for each group) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, Ox1R is the main orexin receptor expressed in dopaminergic VTA and SN neurons and mediates their activation by orexin. Therefore, we wanted to determine further the functional role of Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons. By comparing control and Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mouse data, we first identified behaviors modulated by orexin via dopaminergic neurons. In a second step, we used PET imaging to define and map neuronal pathways modulated by orexin.</p>

<title>Ox1R in dopaminergic neurons regulates novelty-induced locomotion and exploration</title>
<p>The behavioral test included an analysis of locomotor behavior, novelty exploration, reward processing, anxiety, and energy homeostasis. Since sex differences exist in orexin- and dopamine-mediated behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Durairaja &amp; Fendt, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Freeman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lippert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zachry et al., 2021</xref>), we analyzed behavioral phenotypes in both males and females. Compared to controls, Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice did not show significant changes in spontaneous locomotor activity in home cages (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). When exposed to a novel open field, male and female Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice exhibited an increase in locomotion and exploration, with increased traveling distance, ambulating time, and vertical activity in the open field test (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C, E-G</xref>). Female Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice also showed increased stereotypic activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D, H</xref>). Furthermore, intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of orexin A (1 nmol) induced a more pronounced increase of locomotor activity in both female and male Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice, compared to control mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I-L</xref>).</p>

<p>In a hole-board test, female Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice showed increased nose pokes into the holes in early (1st and 2nd) sessions compared to control mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). This effect disappeared later when mice became familiar with the environment (3rd – 8th session) (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). In the novel object recognition test, female Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice spent more time with each of the two identical objects in an open field compared to control mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 2E). One hour later, when female mice were exposed to the same environment except that one object was replaced by a novel object, there was no significant difference between control and Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice in exploring the novel object (Figure 2—figure supplement 2F). In contrast, male Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice did not behave differently in the hole-board and novel object recognition tests from controls (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, C, D). This indicates that Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons is more important for females in novelty-induced exploration, which was independent of novel object discrimination.</p>
<p>The behavioral changes seemed not related to alterations in anxiety since there were no detectable changes in anxiety-related behaviors, including the time spent in and the times of entries into the center area, light side and the open arms in an open field test, dark/light box test and 0-maze test, respectively (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p>

In both of the control and Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> groups, the percentages of the consumption of 1% sucrose, 2% sucrose and 0.04% sucralose solution in the total drinking were higher than 50%, indicating the preference of sweet solution, though only female control mice showed significant preference of 0.5% sucrose solution, analyzed by a one-sample t-test (Figure 2—figure supplement 4A, D).

<p>For the conditional place preference test (CPP, cocaine-vs. saline-injection-paired compartment), CPP score was calculated to show how much cocaine injection changed the time that mice spent in the compartment.

<title>Dopamine receptors in the dorsal BNST and LPGi</title>
<p>Based on the PET imaging and behavioral findings, we further focused on the dorsal BNST and LPGi. They play a key functional role in regulating emotion, exploratory behaviors and locomotor speed, which are related to novelty-induced locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arber &amp; Costa, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Avery et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Capelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Crestani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Giardino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Takatoh et al., 2013</xref>). A schematic illustration of these analyzed brain areas is shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1. We analyzed the dopaminergic pathways into the dorsal BNST and LPGi that could have been affected by the Ox1R. To this end, we injected Cre-dependent AAV-EYFP bilaterally into the VTA and SN of DAT-Cre (DAT<sup>EYFP</sup>) and Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> (DAT<sup>ΔOx1R;</sup> <sup>EYFP</sup>) mice, and discovered dopaminergic projections in the dorsal BNST and LPGi (Figure 4—figure supplement 2), suggesting that VTA and SN dopaminergic neurons could directly modulate neuronal activity in the dorsal BNST and LPGi. To further explore this idea, we assessed the expression of Fos and dopamine receptors in the dorsal BNST and LPGi by immunostaining and RNAscope experiments.</p>
<p>Orexin A injection (1 nmol, ICV) induced higher c-Fos expression levels in LPGi of male Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice compared to control mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, C</xref>). Only the inhibitory D2 but not excitatory D1 subtypes of dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD1) could be detected in LPGi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, E</xref>). Both receptors were detected around the lateral ventricle (as positive control), whereas no signal was detectable in LPGi incubated with a negative control probe for mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F, G</xref>). Th-positive fibers were detected in LPGi but not Gi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kitahama et al., 2000</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study’s behavioral experiments provide important evidence that Ox1R deficiency in DAT-expressing neurons leads to an increase in novelty-induced locomotion and exploration without altering energy metabolism and anxiety- or reward-processing-related behaviors. We found that Ox1R is the main subtype of orexin receptors in DAT-expressing neurons in VTA and SN, though the expression patterns of orexin receptors in DAT-expressing cells in brain areas outside VTA/SN remains unclear. The essential prerequisites for these functional studies were RNAscope and <italic>ex vivo</italic> Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, which confirmed the successful knockout of Ox1R in dopaminergic neurons. Further PET imaging, along with c-Fos and DRD expression analyses, provided initial insights into the underlying mechanisms. These findings can serve as a basis for developing testable working hypotheses on the systemic physiological role of orexin signaling.</p>
<p>Earlier studies showed orexin-induced activation of VTA dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baimel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Korotkova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Tung et al., 2016</xref>). Whole-cell patch clamp recordings combined with mRNA measurement of the individually recorded VTA neurons revealed fewer Ox2R-than Ox1R-positive dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Korotkova et al., 2003</xref>), which is in line with our findings. While our electrophysiological and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data clearly show an orexin A-induced activation of dopaminergic SN neurons when GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic input is blocked, previous <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Korotkova et al., 2002</xref>) or <italic>in vivo</italic> extracellular electrophysiological recordings in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) studies were controversial about whether orexin A could activate dopaminergic neurons in the SN. Since Ox1R and Ox2R are expressed by non-dopaminergic neurons around the SN, recordings in the absence of synaptic blockers, could detect a mixed direct and indirect orexin-induced response in dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nair-Roberts et al., 2008</xref>). This may partially explain their controversial findings.</p>
<p>We found that Ox1R deficiency in dopaminergic neurons caused an increase in novelty-induced locomotion and exploration, which could indicate elevated arousal levels and hyperactivity. Interestingly, children with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have lower orexin A but unaltered orexin B levels in plasma compared to the healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baykal et al., 2019</xref>). ADHD patients exhibit impaired dopaminergic functions, and medicine improving dopaminergic signaling is used to treat ADHD in clinics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Feldman &amp; Reiff, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Volkow &amp; Swanson, 2013</xref>). Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons is important to limit novelty-induced arousal and hyperactivity, which are related to task performance and learning capability. Novelty-induced behavioral response should be at proper levels under normal physiological conditions. The orexin-dopamine interaction blunting novelty-induced locomotion could be important to keep attention on the main task without being distracted too much by other random environmental stimuli. When this balance is disrupted, behavioral deficit may happen, such as ADHD.</p>
<p>We did not observe significant impact of Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons on reward processing. Previous studies reported that Ox1R signaling in VTA promoted reward processing with pharmacological methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tsujino &amp; Sakurai, 2013</xref>). The difference could have resulted from the involvement of non-dopaminergic neurons in VTA or different behavioral models. It would be interesting to identify the effect under other conditions, such as obesity and operant reward learning, in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dabney et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wang et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The PET imaging results suggest that Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons affects separate and distinct neuronal circuits, depending on the stimulation mode. Orexin and dopaminergic systems are known to increase arousal in mammals’ sleep-wake transitions, locomotor activity, and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Furlong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mahler et al., 2014</xref>). The orexin system responds to various environmental stimuli, such as stress and novelty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gonzalez et al., 2016</xref>). Projection-defined dopaminergic populations in the VTA exhibited different responses to orexin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baimel et al., 2017</xref>). Our PET imaging experiments, without orexin application, indicate that Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons modulates brain regions (MPA, Pir, endopiriform claustrum, LSS, SubCV, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sp5, IRt and Gi) important for olfaction, eating, arousal and sleeping (Supplementary table 1).When central orexin levels were increased by orexin A injection, Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons regulates HDB, MCPO, Pir, DEn, S1, V2L, V1, BNST, LPGi and M2, which are important for sensation, emotion, exploration, and action selection (Supplementary table 1). In future studies, it would be interesting to investigate the direct and indirect downstream pathways of Ox1R-expressing dopaminergic neurons. Interestingly, in the fruitfly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, it has been shown that the dopaminergic system oppositely regulates sleep-wake arousal and environmentally stimulated arousal, and the authors discussed the possibility to identify similar patterns in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lebestky et al., 2009</xref>). It was further suggested that the dopaminergic system differentially regulates arousal levels under different stimulating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lebestky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lima &amp; Miesenbock, 2005</xref>). Emotion perception affects the decision how to respond to the novelty. We think that novelty activates the orexin system, and Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons promotes emotion perception and inhibits exploration.</p>
<p>DRD1 and DRD2 in the BNST regulate anxiety, fear, and addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">De Bundel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eiler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Giardino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Krawczyk et al., 2013</xref>).

We found a potential direct impact of dopaminergic neurons on LPGi and BNST. The inhibitory D2 receptor was mainly expressed in LPGi, and the expression levels of the excitatory D1 receptor were decreased in BNST after Ox1R deletion in dopaminergic neurons. Our findings suggested that Ox1R deletion in dopaminergic neurons results in the disinhibition of neural activity in LPGi via dopaminergic pathways and the decrease of dopamine-mediated neural activity in BNST. The expression levels of Th were not altered in dBNST or LPGi by Ox1R deletion in dopaminergic neurons. It remains unclear whether dopamine release is affected in these regions. It is possible that either the dopaminergic regulation of neuronal activity or the changes in dopamine release could lead to the decreased expression of dopamine receptors in dBNST. It would be very interesting to further investigate these pathways in future. There are few publications on the functional relevance of dopaminergic projections in the LPGi. Future studies would be very interesting in terms of functionally analyzing DRD2 signaling in the LPGi and how orexin interacts with DRD2 signaling.</p>

<p>Animals were kept under standard laboratory conditions, with tap water and chow available ad libitum, on a 12h light/dark cycle. The animals were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (B506; AbbVie Deutschland GmbH and Co KG) and decapitated. Coronal slices (280 µm) containing the SN were cut with a vibration microtome (VT1200 S; Leica) under cold (4°C), carbogenated (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>), glycerol-based modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (GaCSF).

<p>The orexin A (ab120212, Abcam) effect was analyzed by comparing the action potential frequencies measured during 4 min intervals recorded before and at the end of the peptide applications. To analyze the orexin A responsiveness, the neuron’s firing rate averaged from 10 s intervals was taken as one data point. To determine the mean firing rate and standard deviation, 24 data points were averaged. On the single-cell level, a neuron was considered orexin-responsive if the change in firing induced by orexin A was three times larger than the standard deviation (3 σ criterion ≙ Z-score of 3). The significance of the mean response (Δfrequency) was tested using a one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test.

<title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging</title>
<p>All imaging experiments were performed on acute brain slices using the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s. At least 4 weeks were allowed for GCaMP6s virus expression. The imaging setup consisted of a Zeiss AxioCam/MRm CCD camera with a 1388×1040 chip and a Polychromator V (Till Photonics) that was coupled via an optical fiber into the Zeiss AxioExaminer upright microscope (Objective W “Plan-Apochromat” 20x/1.0 DIC D=0.17 M27 75mm). The camera and polychromator were controlled by the software Zen pro, including the module ‘Physiology’ (2012 blue edition, Zeiss). The SN neurons were identified according to their anatomical location and expression of the GCaMP6s. Calcium signals in GCaMP6s expressing cells were monitored by images acquired at 470 nm excitation wavelengths with 20 ms exposure time at ∼0.2 Hz. The emitted fluorescence was detected through a 500-550 nm bandpass filter (BP525/50), and data were acquired using 4×4 on-chip binning. Images were recorded in arbitrary units (AU) and analyzed as 16-bit grayscale images. Orexin A (ab120212, Abcam) in the concentrations of 100 nM and 300 nM was applied for 8 min each. To analyze the orexin A effect, we compared the fluorescence measured in the cell bodies during 4 min intervals that were recorded immediately before and at the end of the peptide applications. This protocol was followed by applying high K<sup>+</sup> (40 mM) concentration saline (40 mM KCl; osmolarity adjusted by reducing the NaCl concentration) to identify cell bodies of neurons with functional GCaMP6s expression. Regions of interest (ROI) were defined after the experiment based on the high K<sup>+</sup> saline responses. The mean AU values of the ROIs were calculated in Image J. Time series analysis was performed with Igor Pro 6. To correct for bleaching artifacts, the baseline fluorescence (without orexin application) was fit. The extended fit was subtracted from the raw data. For each neuron, we tested whether it responded to orexin A. A neuron was considered orexin-responsive if the change in GCaMPs fluorescence induced by orexin A was three times larger than the standard deviation (3 σ criterion ≙ Z-score of 3) of the baseline fluorescence. To determine the “population response” of all analyzed neurons, we measured the orexin-induced GCaMP6s fluorescence of each neuron expressed as a percentage of the GCaMP6s fluorescence induced by the high (40 mM) K<sup>+</sup> saline application (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). This is a solid reference point since it reflects the GCaMP6s fluorescence at maximal voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The “population response” of all analyzed neurons was expressed as the mean ± SEM of these responses. The significance of this mean response was tested for each group (control and Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup>) using a one-sample t-test. Image analysis was performed offline using Image J (version 1.53a), Igor Pro 6 (WaveMetrics), and Prism 8 (GraphPad Software Inc.).</p>

Body temperature was maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5°C by a thermostatically controlled water heating system. For injection of the radiotracer, a catheter consisting of a 30G cannula connected to a polythene tubing (ID = 0.28 mm) was inserted into the tail vein and fixated by a drop of glue. After starting the PET scan, 7-8 MBq of [18F]FDG in 50-100 µl saline were injected per mouse. Emission data were acquired for 45 minutes. Thereafter, animals were automatically moved into the CT gantry, and a CT scan was performed (180 projections/360°, 200 ms, 80 kV, 500 µA). The CT data were used for attenuation correction of the PET data, and the CT image of the scull was used for image co-registration. Plasma glucose levels were determined from a tail vein blood sample using a standard glucometer (Bayer) after removing the tail vein catheters. PET data were histogrammed in time frames of 12×30s, 3×60s, 3×120s, 7×240s, Fourier rebinned, and images were reconstructed using the MAP-SP algorithm provided by the manufacturer.

Brain regions were identified according to the atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Franklin &amp; Paxinos, 2007</xref>). After alignment of the brain in the stereotaxic surgery platform, 1 or 4 small holes were drilled in the skull at specific coordinates. The virus, pAAV-Ef1a-DIO EYFP (∼1×10<sup>13</sup> GC/ml, 300 nl, Addgene) was bilaterally injected into VTA and SN of 10 wk old mice, with micropipettes pulled in house with a heating system. The coordinates from Bregma were: anterior-posterior, AP: -3.4 mm; medial-lateral, ML: ±0.5/1.25 mm; dorsal-ventral, DV: -4.2 mm. The GCaMP6s virus (AAV1.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40, ∼4×10<sup>12</sup> GC/ml, 300 nl, Penn Vector Core) was injected to left SN (AP: -3.4 mm, ML: 1.1 mm, DV: -4.2 mm) of 12 wk old mice, to specifically express GCaMP6s in dopaminergic neurons. After virus injection, mice received a bolus of meloxicam (5 mg/kg BW, s.c.), and tramadol in drinking water for 3 d after surgeries to relieve pain. BW was checked twice a day. Experiments started at least 4 weeks later than virus injection to allow virus expression.</p>

<title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>All numerical values are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad PRISM (version 8) unless stated otherwise. Datasets with only two independent groups were analyzed for statistical significance using an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test. Datasets subjected to two independent factors were analyzed using two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s post hoc test. All p-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant (*p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, and ***p &lt; 0.001, ****p &lt; 0.0001).</p>

<p>This manuscript describes <bold>valuable</bold> findings regarding the expression pattern of orexin receptors in the midbrain and how manipulating this system influences several behaviors, such as context-induced locomotor activity and exploration. The overall strength of evidence - which includes anatomical, viral manipulation studies, and brain imaging - is <bold>solid</bold> and broadly substantiates claims in the paper. However, there are several areas in which the conclusions are only partially supported by the combination of methods used. These results have implications for understanding the neural underpinnings of reward and will be of interest to neuroscientists and cognitive scientists with an interest in the neurobiology of reward.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the role of orexin receptors in dopamine transmission is studied. It extends previous findings suggesting an interplay between these two systems in regulating behaviour by first characterizing the expression of orexin receptors in the midbrain and then disrupting orexin transmission in dopaminergic neurons by deleting its predominant receptor, OX1R (Ox1R fl/fl, Dat-Cre tg/wt mice). Electrophysiological and calcium imaging data suggest that orexin A acutely and directly stimulates SN and VTA dopaminergic neurons but does not seem to induce c-Fos expression. Behavioral effects of depleting OX1R from dopaminergic neurons include enhanced novelty-induced locomotion and exploration, relative to littermate controls (Ox1R fl/fl, Dat-Cre wt/wt). However, no difference between groups is observed in tests that measure reward processing, anxiety, and energy homeostasis. To test whether the depletion of OX1R alters overall orexin-triggered activation across the brain, PET imaging is used in OX1R∆DAT knockout and control mice. This analysis reveals that several regions show higher neuronal activation after orexin injection in OX1R∆DAT mice, but the authors focus their follow-up study on the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi). Dopaminergic inputs and expression of dopamine receptors type-1 and -2 (DRD1 &amp; DRD2) are assessed and compared to control demonstrating a moderate decrease in DRD1 and DRD2 expression in the BNST of OX1R∆DAT mice and unaltered expression of DRD2, with absence of DRD1 expression in LPGi of both groups. Overall, this study is valuable for the information it provides on orexin receptor expression and function in behaviour, as well as for the new tools it generated for the specific study of this receptor in dopaminergic circuits.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of a transgenic line that lacks OX1R in dopamine-transporter expressing neurons is a strong approach to dissect the direct role of orexin in modulating dopamine signaling in the brain. The battery of behavioral assays used to study this line provides valuable information for researchers interested in the interplay between dopamine and orexin systems and their role in animal physiology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This study falls short in providing evidence for an anatomical substrate and mechanism underlying the altered behavior observed in mice lacking orexin receptor subtype 1 in dopaminergic neurons. How orexin transmission in dopaminergic neurons regulates the expression of postsynaptic dopamine receptors (as observed in the BNST of OX1R∆DAT mice) is an intriguing question not addressed in this study. An important aspect not investigated in this study is whether the disruption of orexin activity affects dopamine release in target areas.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript examines expression of orexin receptors in midbrain - with a focus on dopamine neurons - and uses several fairly sophisticated manipulation techniques to explore the role of this peptide neurotransmitter in reward-related behaviors. Specifically, in situ hybridization is used to show that substantia nigra dopamine neurons predominantly express orexin receptor 1 subtype and then go on to delete this receptor in dopamine transporter-expressing neurons using a transgenic strategy. Ex vivo calcium imaging of midbrain neurons is used to show that, in the absence of this receptor, orexin is no longer able to excite dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra.</p>
<p>The authors proceed to use this same model to study the effect of orexin receptor 1 deletion on a series of behavioral tests, namely, novelty-induced locomotion and exploration, anxiety-related behavior, preference for sweet solutions, cocaine-induced conditioned place preference, and energy metabolism. Of these, the most consistent effects are seen in the tests of novelty-induced locomotion and exploration in which the mice with orexin 1 receptor deletion are observed to show greater levels of exploration, relative to wild-type, when placed in a novel environment, an effect that is augmented after icv administration of orexin.</p>
<p>In the final part of the paper, the authors use PET imaging to compare brain-wide activity patterns in the mutant mice compared to wildtype. They find differences in several areas both under control conditions (i.e., after injection of saline) as well as after injection of orexin. They focus in on changes in dorsal bed nucleus of stria terminalis (dBNST) and the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) and perform analysis of the dopaminergic projections to these areas. They provide anatomical evidence that these regions are innervated by dopamine fibers from midbrain, are activated by orexin in control, but not mutant mice, and that dopamine receptors are present. They also show changes in receptor expression in the transgenic mice. Thus, they argue these anatomical data support the hypothesis that behavioral effects of orexin receptor 1 deletion in dopamine neurons are due to changes in dopamine signaling in these areas.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Understanding how orexin interacts with the dopamine system is an important question and this paper contains several novel findings along these lines. Specifically:</p>
<p>
(1) Distribution of orexin receptor subtypes in VTA and SN is explored thoroughly.</p>
<p>
(2) Use of the genetic model that knocks out a specific orexin receptor subtype from dopamine-transporter-expressing neurons is a useful model and helps to narrow down the behavioral significance of this interaction.</p>
<p>
(3) PET studies showing how central administration of orexin evokes dopamine release across the brain is intriguing, especially since two key areas are pursued - BNST and LPGi - where the dopamine projection is not as well described/understood.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The role of the orexin-dopamine interaction is not explored in enough detail. The manuscript presents several related findings, but the combination of anatomy and manipulation studies do not quite tell a cogent story. Ideally, one would like to see the authors focus on a specific behavioral parameter and show that one of their final target areas (dBNST or LPGi) was responsible or at least correlated with this behavioral readout. In addition, the authors' working model for how they think orexin-dopamine interactions contribute to behavior under normal physiological conditions is not well-described.</p>

<p>This study falls short in providing evidence for an anatomical substrate of the altered behaviour observed in mice lacking orexin receptor subtype 1 in dopaminergic neurons.

<p>We identified dopaminergic fibers and dopamine receptors in the dBNST and LPGi, suggesting anatomical basis for dopamine neurons to regulate neural activity and receptor expression levels in these areas. PET imaging scan and c-Fos staining revealed that Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic cells regulates neuronal activity in dBNST and LPGi. The expression levels of Th were unchanged in both regions. Dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2), but not DRD1, is expressed in LPGi. The deletion of Ox1R in DAT-expressing cells did not affect DRD2 expression in LPGi. The expression levels of DRD1 and DRD2 were decreased or showed a tendency to decrease in dBNST.</p>
<p>We included the comments in the discussion in this revised manuscript (lines 308-312): ‘The expression levels of Th were not altered in dBNST or LPGi by Ox1R deletion in dopaminergic neurons. It remains unclear whether dopamine release is affected in these regions. It is possible that either the dopaminergic regulation of neuronal activity or the changes in dopamine release could lead to the decreased expression of dopamine receptors in dBNST.’</p>

They find differences in several areas both under control conditions (i.e., after injection of saline) as well as after injection of orexin. They focus in on changes in dorsal bed nucleus of stria terminalis (dBNST) and the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) and perform analysis of the dopaminergic projections to these areas. They provide anatomical evidence that these regions are innervated by dopamine fibers from midbrain, are activated by orexin in control, but not mutant mice, and that dopamine receptors are present. Thus, they argue these anatomical data support the hypothesis that behavioral effects of orexin receptor 1 deletion in dopamine neurons are due to changes in dopamine signaling in these areas.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Understanding how orexin interacts with the dopamine system is an important question and this paper contains several novel findings along these lines. Specifically:</p>
<p>(1) Distribution of orexin receptor subtypes in VTA and SN is explored thoroughly.</p>
<p>(2) Use of the genetic model that knocks out a specific orexin receptor subtype from dopaminetransporter-expressing neurons is a useful model and helps to narrow down the behavioral significance of this interaction.</p>
<p>(3) PET studies showing how central administration of orexin evokes dopamine release across the brain is intriguing, especially that two key areas are pursued - BNST and LPGi - where the dopamine projection is not as well described/understood.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The role of the orexin-dopamine interaction is not explored in enough detail. The manuscript presents several related findings, but the combination of anatomy and manipulation studies do not quite tell a cogent story. Ideally, one would like to see the authors focus on a specific behavioral parameter and show that one of their final target areas (dBNST or LPGi) was responsible or at least correlated with this behavioral readout.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that exploring the orexin-dopamine interactions in more detail and focusing on the behavioral impact of their final target areas (e.g., dBNST or LPGi), would provide valuable data. While we are very interested in pursuing these studies, the aim of the present manuscript is to provide an overview of the behavioral roles of orexin-dopamine interaction and to propose some promising downstream pathways in a relatively broad and systematic manner.</p>

<p>In many places in the Results, insufficient explanation and statistical reporting is provided. Throughout the Results - especially in the section on behavior although not restricted to this part - statements are made without statistical tests presented to back up the claims, e.g., &quot;Compared to controls, Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> 143 mice did not show significant changes in spontaneous locomotor activity in home cages&quot; (L143) and &quot;In a hole-board test, female Ox1RΔDAT mice showed increased nose pokes into the holes in early (1st and 2nd) sessions compared to control mice&quot; (L151). In other places, ANOVAs are mentioned but full results including main effects and interactions are not described in detail, e.g., in F3-S3, only a single p-value is presented and it is difficult to know if this is the interaction term or a post hoc test (L205). These and all other statements need statistics included in the text as support. Addition of these statistical details was also requested by the editor.</p>

<p>We submitted all our source data as Excel spreadsheets to eLife during our first-round revision, and the full statistics, such as main effects and interactions, are presented alongside the source data in the respective spreadsheets. We thank the reviewer for pointing out our lack of clarity in the manuscript. In this revised manuscript, we included the statistical details of ANOVAs mentioned above in the figure legends. In the figure legends, we also explained that the full statistics were provided alongside the source data in the supplementary materials.</p>

<p>In the presentation of reward processing this is particularly important as no statistical tests are shown to demonstrate that controls show a cocaine-induced preference or a sucrose preference. Here, one option would be to perform one-sample t-tests showing that the data were different to zero (no preference). As it is, the claim that &quot;Both of the control and Ox1RΔDAT groups showed a preference for cocaine injection&quot; is not yet statistically supported.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Can the authors comment on overlap between DAT and Ox1R in brain areas outside VTA/SN? Is there any?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We only focused on the expression patterns of orexin receptors in VTA/SN, and we did not examine other brain regions. Additionally, little is known from the literature about the expression of Ox1R in DAT-expressing cells in brain areas outside VTA/SN. Further analysis is necessary to answer this question. We have added the comment in our discussion (lines 243 - 344).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For the Ca2+ imaging experiment, it is unclear to me why the authors do not show all the neurons (almost 160 in total) and just select 5 neurons to show for each condition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Heat maps of all recorded neurons are now shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There are other claims that still require a statistical justification to be included in addition to the passages on behavior mentioned above, e.g., &quot;Increasing the orexin A concentration to 300 nM further increased [Ca2+]i&quot; (L118).</p>
<p>Authors should ensure that all such claims are either presented with a statistical test or are phrased differently, e.g. &quot;Visual inspection of data suggested that there was a further increase...&quot;. In addition, when an ANOVA is conducted, full results including main effects and interactions should be described.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We emphasize now our statement that ALREADY 100 nM orexin A significantly increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i levels (lines 117 - 118).</p>
<p>We submitted all our source data as Excel spreadsheets to eLife during our first-round revision, and the full statistics, such as main effects and interactions, are presented alongside the source data in the respective spreadsheets.
