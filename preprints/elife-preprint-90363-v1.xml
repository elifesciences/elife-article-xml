<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Caesarean section scar diverticulum (CSD) is a significant cause of infertility among women who have previously had a Caesarean section, primarily due to persistent inflammatory exudation associated with this condition. Even though abnormal bacterial composition is identified as a critical factor leading to this chronic inflammation, clinical data suggests that a long-term cure is often unattainable with antibiotic treatment alone. In our study, we employed metagenomic analysis and mass spectrometry techniques to investigate the fungal composition in CSD and its interaction with bacteria. We discovered that local fungal abnormalities in CSD can disrupt the stability of the bacterial population and the entire microbial community by altering bacterial abundance via specific metabolites. For instance, <italic>Lachnellula suecica</italic> reduces the abundance of several <italic>Lactobacillus spp</italic>., such as <italic>Lactobacillus jensenii</italic>, by diminishing the production of metabolites like <italic>Goyaglycoside A</italic> and <italic>Janthitrem E</italic>. Concurrently, <italic>Clavispora lusitaniae</italic> and <italic>Ophiocordyceps australis</italic> can synergistically impact the abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus spp</italic>. by modulating metabolite abundance. Our findings underscore that abnormal fungal composition and activity are key drivers of local bacterial dysbiosis in CSD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Caesarean section (CS) is a prevalent surgery worldwide, and its rate has been increasing in recent decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Although CS can significantly reduce dystocia and stillbirths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], Caesarean section scar diverticulum (CSD) affect about 19.4-88% of women receiving this operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. CSD emerges from poor healing of the local uterine incision, forming a depression or cavity that connects with the uterine cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Recently, CSD has drawn widespread attention because of its potential damage to subsequent fertility. For example, Gurol and colleagues found that the possibility of subsequent pregnancy decreases by an average of 10% after CS relative to a previous vaginal delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. A niche can reduce the chances of embryo implantation and increase the likelihood of spontaneous miscarriages if the implantation occurs close to or in the CSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Our previous studies have shown that the persistent effusion of CSD is a key cause of failed embryo implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>The unique microbial community composition in the female reproductive tract plays an essential role in maintaining female reproductive health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the abnormal alterations in the local microbiota of Cesarean scar defects (CSD) cause continuous leakage through local inflammation and immune imbalance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Further investigations of ours revealed the underlying mechanism demonstrating that abnormal bacteria in CSD deplete protective fatty acids and generate N-(3-hydroxy-eicosanoyl)-homoserine lactone, thus leading to promoting apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells and endometrial epithelial cells, ultimately impairing women’s reproductive capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Nonetheless, the causative factors behind bacterial dysbiosis in complex microbial communities remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>Fungi and bacteria, as integral components of the human microbiome, establish complex interactions with each other and the host. The collection of genomes and genes carried by fungal species coexisting within a specific environmental or biological niche is commonly referred to as the “mycobiome” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. However, in CSD, the mycobiome remains poorly understood, particularly in comparison to the microbiome. The interaction between microbial communities in the reproductive tract, particularly between bacteria and fungi, plays a critical role in maintaining female reproductive health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Therefore, this study aims to examine the composition and function of fungi in CSD, as well as their interactions with bacteria, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of microbial communities in CSD. By building on current research, this study also aims to identify potential therapeutic approaches to enhance fertility.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Participant recruitment and sample collection</title>
<p>The subjects were recruited at the Reproductive Medical Center of the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were as previously described in previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. All participants were fully informed and volunteered to participate in this study and signed informed consent forms. All processes of this study were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University (IRB no. 2019ZSLYEC-005S).</p>
<p>The sample collection procedure is as described above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. In short, after cleaning the external genitalia and vagina, a sterile disposable swab is inserted into the cervical canal, and the swab is rotated five times to fully collect the sample. The sample is rapidly transferred to liquid nitrogen for quenching and then stored at -80°C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>DNA extraction and metagenomic sequencing</title>
<p>The total DNA was isolated from the sample using QIAamp® Fast DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA concentration and integrity were evaluated by NanoDrop2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. The DNA was fragmented with S220 Focused-ultrasonicators (Covaris, USA) and purified with Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter Co., USA). Then, the library was constructed using the TruSeq Nano DNA LT Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sequencing was performed using Illumina NovaSeq 6000.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Raw Data Preprocessing</title>
<p>Parallel computing in research is implemented with GNU Parallel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>
<p>The sequencing raw data was stored in FASTQ files. After trimming and filtering with Trimmomatic (v0.36) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], the clean paired-end reads were aligned to the host genome (hg38) with bowtie2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], and the matched reads were discarded. The clean reads were assembled into contigs using MEGAHIT software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] with a filtering threshold of 500 bp. The ORFs were predicted using Prodigal software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] and were translated into amino acid sequences. CD-HIT software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] was used to remove redundancy from the ORF predictions of each sample and mixed assembly, and to obtain non-redundant initial Unigenes. The clustering was performed with default parameters of 95% identity and 90% coverage, and the longest sequence was selected as the representative sequence. Bowtie2 software was used to align the clean reads of each sample to the non-redundant gene set (95% identity), and the abundance information of genes in each corresponding sample was calculated from the number of reads and the length of the genes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Taxa and functional annotation</title>
<p>The representative sequences of the redundant gene set were aligned with NCBI’s NR database using DIAMOND software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], and annotations with e &lt;1e-5 were selected to obtain proteins with the highest sequence similarity, thereby obtaining functional annotations and species annotations. The Valencia software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] was used to perform community state type (CST) assignment for each sample. The abundance of species is calculated using the sum of the gene abundance corresponding to the species. LEfSe (Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] was used to screen differentially abundant species. The calculation and visualization of species diversity and abundance are executed by the EasyMicroPlot R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] and EasyAmplicon pipline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Annotations were performed using the KO database, COG database, and CAZy database to explore changes in enzyme family related to the microbiome. Differential functional analysis was conducted using the STAMP software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>

<title>Construction of co-occurrence network</title>
<p>The construction and random robustness comparison of fungal and bacterial-fungal co-occurrence networks were executed by the ggClusterNet R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Metabolite detection using liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS)</title>
<p>A separation buffer (methanol/acetonitrile/water [2:2:1]) was used to extract metabolites from cervical swabs. 10 ul was taken from each sample and mixed to form a quality control (QC) sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], which was used to evaluate stability during the experiment. The metabolite signals in each sample were detected using liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) (ACQUITY UPLC I-Class plus, Waters). Progenesis QI v2.3 software was used for qualitative analysis of metabolites, with parameters of 5ppm precursor tolerance, 10ppm product tolerance, and 5% product ion threshold (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK). All output data were normalized using internal standards, and the results were displayed as peak values (test sample peak area/internal standard sample peak area). Compound identification was performed using human metabolome database (HMDB), Lipidmaps (V2.3), Metlin, EMDB, PMDB, and a self-built database based on mass-to-charge ratio (M/z), secondary fragmentation, and isotope distribution.</p>
<p>The screening of differential metabolites was performed using the OPLS-DA (orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis) method, with a VIP value&gt;1 for the first principal component and a P value&lt;0.05 for T-test as the threshold. MetPA was used for differential metabolic pathway analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. We used Spearman correlation analysis to evaluate the correlation between the microbial community and metabolites. The network was visualized using Cytoscape software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>].</p>

<title>The co-occurrence network among microbial community</title>
<p>We constructed co-occurrence networks for fungal species in the CSD and CON groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3 A</xref>). The network in the CSD group had fewer connections and weaker random robustness than that in the CON group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3 B</xref>), indicating greater fragility of the CSD fungal co-occurrence network. Subsequently, a cross-domain network between bacteria and fungi was constructed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3 C</xref>). The connection between bacteria and fungi in the CSD group was reduced compared with that in the CON group. At the same time, the CSD group had weaker random robustness than the CON group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3 D</xref>). We selected species with a sample coverage rate greater than or equal to 60% for Spearman correlation analysis and visualized the data using heatmaps (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3 E</xref>) and networks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3 F</xref>).

<title>Functional gene analysis</title>
<p>Functional gene analysis indicates that there are significant differences in the functional gene composition of microbial communities between the CSD and CON groups (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig.S1 A</xref>). The CSD group has two significantly higher KEGG modules than the CON group, including M00142 (NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase, mitochondrion) and M00151 (cytochrome bc1 complex respiratory unit) (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig.S1 B</xref>). The CSD group has significantly increased activity in the inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels and platelet activation, while the activity of the galactose metabolic process has decreased (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig.S1 C</xref>). The CAZy annotation results indicate that the activity of GH73 (glycoside hydrolase family 73) in the CSD group has decreased (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig.S1 D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Caesarean section scar diverticulum (CSD) significantly affects female fertility, posing a challenge to women who wish to conceive. Our research team conducted a preliminary investigation on bacteria-host interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Current findings suggest that fungi play crucial roles in the maintenance of bacterial community and microbiome stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. This study explores the intricate fungal-bacterial interactions within the microbiome of CSD, building on the findings of our team’s previous research.</p>
<p>Through the implementation of higher resolution metagenomics, we achieved more precise bacterial community compositions compared to our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. <italic>Lactobacillus jensenii</italic> of the <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genus exhibited the greatest discrepancy between the two groups. This species has been linked to integral aspects of women’s reproductive health. It has been demonstrated that a reduction in <italic>L. jensenii</italic> abundance has a close correlation with early-stage embryo arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, research suggests that <italic>L. jensenii</italic> may hold potential in facilitating vertical transmission from mother to infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Fungi and bacteria, as integral components of the human microbiome, establish complex interactions with each other and the host. The characteristics of fungal communities in CSD an CON group are similar, but there are differences in species composition. <italic>Clabispora lusitaniae</italic> is the species with the largest difference between the two groups. In addition, the co-occurrence network of fungal communities and the stability of bacterial-fungal cross-domain network in CSD group are both poorer than those in CON group, indicating that the cervical microbiota stability is disrupted in CSD, resulting in local microbial-immune imbalance. In a previous study, we confirmed that persistent exudation in CSD is a crucial factor affecting embryo implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Several studies have shown that microbial dysbiosis can affect local immune balance and cause local inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>].</p>
<p>Fungi play an important role in maintaining the stability of bacteria and the entire microbiome. Studies have shown that adding specific fungi can promote the growth of certain bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], while fungi also play an important role in improving the adaptability of bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. To further understand how abnormal fungal community status in CSD affects bacteria, leading to the disruption of local stability, we used LC/MS technique for metabolite detection. The results of metabolite analysis showed that there were differences in the metabolite spectra between the CSD and CON groups, and the regulatory mode of several different fungal species on metabolites was mainly negative regulation. By integrating fungal, bacterial, and metabolite information, we found that <italic>Lachnellula suecica</italic> played an important role in regulating the abundance of several <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species. <italic>Lachnellula suecica</italic> reduces the abundance of several <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species, including <italic>Lactobacillus jensenii</italic>, by decreasing the metabolites Goyaglycoside A and Janthitrem E. Meanwhile, <italic>Clavispora lusitaniae</italic> and <italic>Ophiocordyceps australis</italic> can also synergistically affect the abundance of Lactobacillus by influencing metabolite abundance.</p>
<p>So far, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of bacterial and fungal communities, as well as changes in environmental metabolites in Caesarean section scar diverticulum (CSD). Our results indicate that the local abnormal fungi in CSD affect the abundance of bacteria through specific metabolites, thereby destroying the stability of bacteria and the entire microbial community. This is an important supplement to the mechanism of the impact of CSD’s local persistent inflammatory exudate on embryo implantation. Currently, it is difficult to achieve long-term efficacy with treatment plans targeting bacteria in CSD’s treatment, which is a huge challenge in clinical treatment. The results of this study revealed that one of the important driving factors behind the local bacterial disorder in CSD is the abnormal composition and activity of fungi. This result has important implications for the update of clinical treatment plans. However, this study still has some limitations. The lack of analysis on the antibiotic sensitivity of key fungi and bacteria in this study can only provide preliminary ideas for clinical treatment.</p>

<p>This study has uncovered some interesting findings about the fungal composition and its interaction with bacteria in Caesarean section scar diverticulum (CSD). While the study's findings are <bold>valuable</bold> and with translation possibilities, the strength of the conclusions obtained is <bold>incomplete</bold> due to the small sample size and methodological issues indicated by the reviewers such as the lack of controls and the location of samples analyzed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Chen et al. describe the bacterial and fungal composition of cervical samples from women with/without Cesarean-section scar diverticulum (CSD) using whole metagenomic sequencing. Also, they report the metabolomic profile associated with CSD and built correlation networks at the taxonomical and taxonomic-metabolic levels to establish potential bacteria-fungi interactions. These interactions could be used, long-term, as therapeutic options to treat or prevent CSD.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
- The authors have used advanced techniques in shotgun sequencing which is a powerful tool able to characterize the microbiome at the species (or lower) level and metabolomics.</p>
<p>
- These are novel results showing the interaction of bacteria and fungi and present a wider view of the role of the microbiome in female infertility.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
- This is a pilot study with only 24 cases and 24 controls. Because the human microbiota entails individual variability, this work should be confirmed with a higher sample size to achieve enough statistical power.</p>
<p>
- The authors do not report here the use of blank controls. The use of this type of control is important to &quot;subtract&quot; the potential background from plasticware, buffer or reagents from the real signal. Lack of controls may lead to microbiome artefacts in the results. This can be seen in the results presented where the authors report some bacterial contaminants (Agrobacterium tumefaciensis, Aequorivita lutea, Chitinophagaceae, Marinobacter vinifirmus, etc) as part of the most common bacteria found in cervical samples.</p>
<p>
- Samples used for this study were collected from the cervix. Why not collect samples from the uterine cavity and isthmocele fluid (for cases)? In their previous paper using samples from the same research protocol ((IRB no. 2019ZSLYEC-005S) they used endometrial tissue from the patients, so access to the uterine cavity was guaranteed.</p>
<p>
- Through the use of shotgun genomics, results from all the genomes of the organisms present in the sample are obtained. However, the authors have only used the metagenomic data to infer the taxonomical annotation of fungi and bacteria.</p>

<p>Summary: Shotgun data have been analysed to obtain fungal and bacterial organisms' abundance. Through their metabolic functions and through co-occurrence networks, a functional relationship between the two types of organisms can be inferred. By means of metabolomics, function-related metabolites are studied in order to deepen the fungus-bacteria synergy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Data obtained from bacteria correlate with data from other authors.</p>
<p>
The study of metabolic &quot;interactions&quot; between fungi and bacteria is quite new.</p>
<p>
The inclusion of metabolomics data to support the results is a great contribution.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: Methodological descriptions are minimal.</p>
<p>Some example:</p>
<p>
*The CON group (line 147) has not been defined. I supposed it is the control group.</p>
<p>
* There are no statistics related to shotgun sequencing. How many reads have been sequenced? How many have been removed from the host? How many are left to study bacteria and fungi? Are these reads proportional among the 48 samples? If not, what method has been used to normalise the data?</p>
<p>
* ggClusterNet has numerous algorithms to better display the modules of the microbiome network. Which one has been used?</p>

<p>In the present study, Chen et al. revealed the fungal composition and explored its interaction with bacteria in Caesarean section scar diverticulum (CSD) patients. Performing metagenomic and mass spectrometry analysis, they found specific fungi could alter bacterial abundance through regulating the production of several metabolites such as Goyaglycoside A and Janthitrem E, which results in disruption of bacterial composition stability. Their study drew a conclusion that abnormal fungal composition and activity are essential drivers for bacterial dysbiosis in CSD patients. However, the results are not substantial enough and there are many format errors throughout the manuscript. In addition, I have some concerns or suggestions that may help to improve this work.</p>
<p>Major</p>
<p>
1. Smoke or drink conditions, as well as diseases like hypertension and diabetes are important factors that could influence the metabolism of the host, thus the authors should add them in the exclusion criteria in the Methods.</p>
<p>
2. The sample size of this study is not large enough to draw a convincing conclusion.</p>
