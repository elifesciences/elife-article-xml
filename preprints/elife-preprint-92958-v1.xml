<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The growing plus-end is a key regulatory site for microtubule dynamics. MCAK (mitotic centromere-associated kinesin), a microtubule depolymerizing kinesin, is an end-binding regulator of catastrophe frequency. It is intriguing how MCAK specifically binds to dynamic microtubule ends. Here, we measure the end-binding kinetics of MCAK using single-molecule imaging and reveal the end-binding preference. MCAK binds to the entire GTP cap, including the EB cap and the distalmost cap. Further analysis shows that MCAK strongly binds to GTPγS microtubules, suggesting that it could recognize the nucleotide-dependent feature of microtubules. Moreover, the binding preference is independent on the nucleotide state of MCAK, and this feature facilitates the high-affinity end-binding of MCAK. Finally, we show that despite partially sharing the binding regions, MCAK and XMAP215 function in an additive manner, demonstrating a simple logic of how the end-binding regulators work in co-ordination. In all, our results provide novel insights into understanding how MCAK regulates the dynamics of microtubule ends.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Microtubule is a major type of cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells and supports many cellular processes, such as cell division, polarization and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alberts, 2015</xref>). However, the properties of microtubules vary a lot in different cellular processes and structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Janke and Magiera, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wittmann et al., 2001</xref>). The plasticity implies that cellular microtubules are under complex and accurate regulations. Because microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are important components in the regulatory networks of microtubules, their functions and working mechanisms are key to understand cellular regulations on microtubules.</p>
<p>Not only do kinesin superfamily members move cargoes along microtubules, they also act as regulators of microtubule dynamics, for example, the depolymerizing kinesins (e.g. the kinesin-8 and kinesin-13 family members). Kinesin-13 was initially identified in studying spindle functions and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aizawa et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Noda et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Walczak et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wordeman and Mitchison, 1995</xref>). Later, the functions of kinesin-13 were revealed in more cellular processes, including spindle assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Walczak et al., 2002</xref>), chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kline-Smith et al., 2004</xref>), directional migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Zong et al., 2021</xref>), ciliary length control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Piao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Vasudevan et al., 2015</xref>), and neuronal polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ghosh-Roy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Puri et al., 2021</xref>). The loss of kinesin-13 often alters structural and dynamic properties of cellular microtubules, implying that the kinesin-13 class members play regulatory roles. In addition, the subcellular localizations of kinesin-13, such as growing microtubule ends, centrosome and centromere, are active regulatory sites of microtubule dynamics in cells, further suggesting the functions of the kinesin-13 class members in controlling the length, mass and polarity of microtubules in cells.</p>
<p>As a representative model for the kinesin-13 family, MCAK was shown to be a microtubule depolymerase and a catastrophe factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Desai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gardner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>). Biochemical and structural analysis suggests that MCAK could deconstruct the protective end structure of dynamic microtubules, and it does so by bending and then breaking off the underlying substrate (i.e. terminal tubulin dimers or protofilaments) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Moores and Milligan, 2006</xref>). It was proposed that MCAK targets microtubule ends by rapid lattice diffusion or binding to the end-binding proteins (EBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gouveia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Helenius et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Honnappa et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the direct binding of MCAK to growing microtubule ends was also observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gouveia et al., 2010</xref>), implying the presence of specific end-binding sites. Previous studies on the structures of MCAK, propose that MCAK targets to microtubule ends by recognizing the curved protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Asenjo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benoit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Trofimova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). This was mostly based on the findings on stabilized microtubules, short protofilaments or tubulin dimers. It still remains elusive how MCAK binds to dynamic microtubule ends.</p>
<p>In the present study, we characterize the direct binding of MCAK to growing microtubule ends using single-molecule imaging. The key finding is that MCAK binds to the entire GTP cap, including both the EB cap, where GDP‧Pi-tubulin dimers are thought to gather, and the distalmost cap, where XMAP215 binds to curved protofilament (mostly in GTP state). The high-affinity binding of MCAK to the EB cap was intriguing. Further analysis shows that MCAK strongly binds to GTPγS microtubules, thought to be the analogue of GDP‧Pi-tubulins. Therefore, we think that MCAK could recognize the nucleotide-dependent feature at dynamic microtubule ends. Moreover, the mutant studies show that the binding-preference of MCAK for GDP‧Pi-tubulins facilitates the end-binding and in turn the function of MCAK. Finally, we find that despite having partially overlapped binding regions, MCAK and XMAP215 could precisely specify their regulatory function at dynamic microtubule end, thereby providing novel insights in understanding how microtubule-associated proteins functionally orchestrate at growing microtubule ends.</p>

<title><bold>MCAK shows a binding preference for growing microtubule ends</bold></title>
<p>We set off by measuring the single-molecule binding kinetics of MCAK at growing microtubule ends using the <italic>in vitro</italic> microtubule dynamics assay. This experiment was performed in BRB80 supplemented with 50 mM KCl and 1 mM ATP, providing a nearly physiological ion strength. In this condition, the individual binding events of MCAK can be observed at both the end and the lattice (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). By measuring the fluorescence intensity of these binding events, we confirmed that they reflected individual MCAK dimers (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. s1</xref></bold>). Using an in-house software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Song et al., 2020</xref>), we determined the binding position of individual MCAK molecules at subpixel resolution by fitting a Gaussian function to their intensity profile along the long axis of microtubules (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). Using the position of the plus-end as the spatial reference, we overlaid the end-binding of 152 MCAK molecules (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>). The distribution showed that the binding regions of MCAK had a length of 162 nm (FWHM, the Full Width at Half Maximum), about 20 layers of tubulin dimers. We defined the binding events of MCAK within this region as “end binding” and those on the lattice as “lattice binding” (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To understand the binding kinetics, we first compared the apparent association rates of MCAK on the plus-end (<italic>k</italic><sub>on-P</sub>) and lattice (<italic>k</italic><sub>on-L</sub>) in the presence of ATP. The ratio (<italic>R</italic><sub>E/L</sub>) of <italic>k</italic><sub>on-P</sub> ((22. 6 ± 1.4) ×10<sup>-6</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> nM<sup>-1</sup>, per tubulin dimer, hereinafter) and <italic>k</italic><sub>on-L</sub> ((2.8 ± 0.3) ×10<sup>-6</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> nM<sup>-1</sup>) was 13 ± 1 (n=66 microtubules from 3 assays) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D-E</xref></bold>). We then measured the dwell time, which reflects the dissociation rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. s1</xref></bold>). The mean dwell time of MCAK on the lattice was shorter than that at the plus-end (plus end: 0.75 ± 0.02 s, n=966 events from 3 assays; 0.62 ± 0.02 s, n=702 events from 3 assays, p&lt;0.001) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref></bold>). Using these kinetic parameters, we calculated the dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) of MCAK for the plus-end (<italic>K</italic><sub>d-P</sub> =69 μM) and lattice (<italic>K</italic><sub>d-L</sub>=1057 μM), respectively. Therefore, MCAK shows a clear end-binding preference. We also observed single-molecule binding events of MCAK to the minus-end (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). Given the higher physiological relevance, we focused on the plus-end binding events (referred to as “end-binding” hereinafter) in the following analysis.</p>
<p>To understand the influence of the nucleotide state, we measured the end-binding kinetics of MCAK‧AMPPNP, MCAK‧ADP or MCAK‧APO (the nucleotide-free state). First, the <italic>k</italic><sub>on-P</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>on-L</sub> of MCAK‧AMPPNP were both reduced in comparison to that of MCAK‧ATP (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D-E</xref></bold>), resulting in an end-binding preference (<italic>R</italic><sub>E/L</sub>=11 ± 2, n=29 microtubules from 2 assays, p&gt;1) that is similar to that of MCAK‧ATP. Mean-while, the end-binding of MCAK‧AMPPNP showed a longer dwell time (3.32 ± 0.24 s, n=231 events from 2 assays, p&lt;0.001), indicating a lower <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. s1</xref></bold>). As a result of the proportionally reduced <italic>k</italic><sub>on-P</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>, the end-binding affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d-P</sub>=61 μM) of MCAK‧AMPPNP was similar to that of MCAK‧ATP. Second, MCAK‧ADP showed a nearly unchanged <italic>k</italic><sub>on-P</sub> and an increased <italic>k</italic><sub>on-L</sub>, leading to a smaller <italic>R</italic><sub>E/L</sub> (2 ± 0.3, n=21 microtubules from 2 assays, p&lt;0.001) and suggest a reduced, but not the absence of, end-binding preference (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D-E</xref></bold>). Meanwhile, it showed a significantly shorter end-binding dwell time (0.46 ± 0.02 s, n=327 events from 2 assays, p&lt;0.001) than MCAK‧ATP (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref></bold>). Therefore, MCAK‧ADP has a lower end-binding affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d-P</sub>=163 μM). Third, APO‧MCAK showed an increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>on-P</sub> and an even greater increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>on-L</sub>, thereby having a smaller <italic>R</italic><sub>E/L</sub> (2 ± 0.2, n=36 microtubules from 3 assays, p&lt;0.001) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D-E</xref></bold>). It also showed a significantly longer end-binding dwell time (1.89 ± 0.23 s, n=71 events from 3 assays, p&lt;0.001) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref></bold>), suggesting a lower <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. s1</xref></bold>). Therefore, in comparison to MCAK‧ATP, MCAK‧APO possesses a higher end-binding affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d-P</sub>=1.8 μM) but partially loses the end-binding preference. Based on these measurements, we conclude that the end-binding preference and affinity of MCAK depend on its nucleotide state (see <bold>Discussion</bold>).</p>
<p>Having measured the end-binding kinetics, we were able to calculate whether the binding of MCAK on dynamic microtubule ends is due to direct end-binding (3D diffusion) or 1D lattice-diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gouveia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Helenius et al., 2006</xref>). Note that these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. Using our dataset, we measured that the lattice-diffusion coefficient of MCAK (<italic>D</italic>) on the lattice of dynamic microtubules was 0.023 ± 0.001 μm<sup>2</sup>‧s<sup>-1</sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref></bold>), close to the previously reported value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cooper et al., 2010</xref>). Because the dwell time of the lattice-binding events was ∼0.6 s, the average length scanned by a MCAK molecule via 1D lattice-diffusion was ∼160 nm. Note that this is close to the length the GTP cap. Using a previously reported Fick’s first equation of diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Helenius et al., 2006</xref>), we calculated the flux of MCAK reaching growing ends via 1D diffusion was 0.004 s<sup>-1</sup>. This was significantly lower than the arrival rate of MCAK onto the plus end observed in our experiments (<italic>N</italic><sub>p</sub>= <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub>‧<italic>C</italic> =0.067 s<sup>-1</sup>. <italic>C</italic>: MCAK concentration). Therefore, in our experimental condition, 1D lattice-diffusion makes a minor contribution to the end-binding of MCAK (∼ 6%), and the end-binding of MCAK can be thought of as the direct interaction between diffusive MCAK and the end structure.</p>

<title>MCAK binds to the entire GTP cap</title>
<p>Having recorded and analyzed the end-binding events of MCAK, we wondered how MCAK could recognize the end of dynamic microtubules. Previous studies, mostly based on stabilized microtubules, proposed the idea that MCAK binds to microtubule ends by recognizing curved protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Asenjo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benoit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Trofimova et al., 2018</xref>). This model predicts that the binding site of MCAK is located to the distalmost tip of growing microtubule ends, where the XMAP215 family members are thought to bind (i.e. the distalmost cap) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>). We tested this prediction by measuring the end-binding regions of MCAK, EB1 and XMAP215 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). To our surprise, the binding region of MCAK was longer than that of XMAP215. It extended proximally towards the lattice, and covered the binding region of EB1 (i.e. the EB cap) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Maurer et al., 2012</xref>). To further understand if MCAK binds to the distalmost cap and the EB cap with different kinetics, we compared the dwell time of the distally located MCAK to that of the proximally distributed ones (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>). Note that we defined the MCAK molecules localizing to the left of the FWHM of XMAP215 binding region as the proximally distributed, while those localizing to the right of the FWHM of EB1 binding region was distally distributed. No significant difference was found (τ<sub>distal</sub>=0.8 ± 0.5, n=28 binding events; τ<sub>proximal</sub>=0.7±0.6, n=45 binding events; p&gt;0.3, the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction). Note that in all experiments, the morphologies of growing microtubule ends were comparable (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). Based on these results, we conclude that MCAK recognizes the entire GTP-cap. This result is intriguing as it suggests that in addition to the curved protofilaments, there are additional end-binding sites for MCAK. Moreover, this also provides an independent measurement for the size of the GTP cap at growing microtubule ends, which was previously determined using the tubulin dilution experiments or by measuring the binding region of EB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Duellberg et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>MCAK strongly binds to GTPγS microtubules in a nucleotide-independent manner</title>
<p>How could MCAK bind to the EB cap? The tubulin dimers in the EB cap are thought to be different from those in the distalmost cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Maurer et al., 2011</xref>). For example, the distalmost tubulin dimers (mostly GTP-tubulin) often lack lateral constrains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Vitre et al., 2008</xref>) and adopt a bent shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hoeoeg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">McIntosh et al., 2018</xref>), while those in the EB cap (mostly GDP‧Pi-tubulin) have formed at least some lateral contacts and had a more straight conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guesdon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Maurer et al., 2012</xref>). To address this issue, we first examined that to what extent, MCAK may adopt a similar end-binding mechanism as EB1.</p>
<p>We tested the contribution of GDP‧Pi-tubulins, which underlies the end-binding preference of EBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Maurer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Maurer et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we compared the binding affinity of MCAK‧AMPPNP on GTPγS, GMPCPP and GDP microtubules (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>), which mimics tubulin dimers in different GTP hydrolysis states. Because MCAK in the concentration required for a full-lattice decoration would rapidly disassemble microtubules, we cannot directly compare the total binding of MCAK on microtubules as what was previously done for the EBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Maurer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Maurer et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we took an alternative approach by recording the single-molecule binding of MCAK‧AMPPNP (1 nM) on microtubules and measuring fluorescence intensity summation over a period of time (1000 frames, 0.3 s per frame) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. s2</xref></bold>). Strikingly, we found that MCAK‧AMPPNP bound strongly to GTPγS microtubules (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A-C</xref></bold>). Quantitative analysis revealed a significantly stronger binding on GTPγS microtubules than on GMPCPP or GDP microtubules (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B-C</xref></bold>). Because the tubulin dimers in GTPγS microtubules were found to be the analogue of GDP‧Pi-tubulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Maurer et al., 2011</xref>), this result suggests that MCAK‧ATP has a binding preference for GDP‧Pi-tubulins.</p>

<p>Because the end-binding affinity and preference of MCAK depends on the nucleotide state, we wondered if the preference for GTPγS microtubules is similar. Therefore, we performed the same experiments using MCAK‧AMPPNP, MCAK‧ATP, MCAK‧ADP and MCAK‧APO. Although the MCAK variants bound to microtubules with different affinities (MCAK‧APO &gt; MCAK‧AMPPNP &gt; MCAK‧ADP &gt; MCAK‧ATP) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>), they all showed a clear binding preference for GTPγS microtubules over GDP or GMPCPP microtubules (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B-C</xref></bold>). These observations suggest that the binding preference to GTPγS microtubules (i.e. GDP‧Pi-tubulin) is, to a large extent, independent on the nucleotide state of MCAK.</p>

<title>MCAK binds to the end region of stabilized GMPCPP microtubules in a nucleotide state-dependent manner</title>
<p>We noted that MCAK showed a nucleotide state-dependence in the binding preference for dynamic microtubule ends, but the binding to GTPγS microtubules is nucleotide independent. Therefore, we wondered if the binding to curved protofilaments at the distalmost cap of dynamic microtubules could account for the nucleotide-state dependence. To address this issue, we measured the binding preference of MCAK at the end of stabilized GMPCPP microtubules (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>), where the length and curvature of protofilaments are thought to be similar to those at the end of dynamic microtubules but has no GDP‧Pi-tubulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Manka and Moores, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">McIntosh et al., 2018</xref>).

<p>Compared to MCAK, MCAK<sup>K524A</sup> showed a significantly reduced binding intensity on microtubules. Meanwhile, it still showed a binding preference for GTPγS microtubules (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-C</xref></bold>), but the ratios between the binding intensity on GTPγS microtubules and that on GMPCPP or GDP microtubules were both reduced (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref></bold>). This suggests that MCAK<sup>K524A</sup> had a lower preference for GTPγS microtubules. On the contrary, we found that MCAK<sup>K524A</sup> showed a higher binding to the end than to the lattice of GMPCPP microtubules (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E-F</xref></bold>), suggesting that the binding preference for curved protofilament is maintained. Therefore, MCAK<sup>K524A</sup> could be a candidate variant to test how the preference for GDP‧Pi-tubulin contributes to the end-binding preference of MCAK.

<title>Functional specification of MCAK and XMAP215</title>
<p>Having revealed the novel binding sites of MCAK in dynamic microtubule ends, we wondered how MCAK may work in coordination with other microtubule plus tip-binding proteins, for example EB1 and XMAP215. It has been shown that EB1 interacts with and recruits MCAK to growing microtubule ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gouveia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Honnappa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lee et al., 2008</xref>), so it is straightforward that EB1 would facilitate the function of MCAK as a catastrophe factor. On the contrary, MCAK and XMAP215 were shown to antagonistically regulate the assembly of microtubules, and it was thought that these two molecules may compete directly for the growing ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tournebize et al., 2000</xref>). Here, we showed that the binding regions of MCAK and XMAP215 in growing microtubule ends are partially overlapping. In addition, previously resolved structural models suggest that MCAK and XMAP215 likely bind to similar regions on tubulin dimers (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. s4</xref></bold>). Therefore, these two molecules could indeed compete for the binding sites in the distalmost cap. However, it is not yet clear to what extent, the competition from XMAP215 would antagonize the function of MCAK, especially given the recent finding that XMAP215 itself could promote the catastrophe of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Farmer et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, it is intriguing what would be the collective effect of MCAK and XMAP215.</p>
<p>To address this issue, we studied how they together regulate microtubule grow rate and catastrophe frequency. Based on our pilot experiments, we chose 20 nM for MCAK and 50 nM for XMAP215 as the representative concentrations. In the presence of 20 nM MCAK, the dynamic microtubules could grow but showed a significantly increased catastrophe frequency and shorter lifetime (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A-B</xref></bold>). Meanwhile, 50 nM XMAP215 increased growth rate by more than four times (control: 0.8 ± 0.1 μm min<sup>-1</sup>, n=97 microtubules from 6 assays; 50 nM XMAP215: 3.7 ± 0.4 μm min<sup>-1</sup>, n=50 microtubules from 3 assays). We noted that XMAP215 alone caused a mild shortening in the lifetime of dynamic microtubules (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A-B</xref></bold>). This is consistent with the previous report and suggesting the enhanced fluctuations in the end structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Farmer et al., 2021</xref>). We then added both 20 nM MCAK and 50 nM XMAP215. In this case, microtubule grew in a similar rate as if there was no MCAK (3.9 ± 0.4 μm min<sup>-1</sup>, n=52 microtubules from 3 assays, p=0.5, the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction), suggesting that MCAK has no major effect on the function of XMAP215 as a polymerase. Meanwhile, the lifetime of dynamic microtubules became shorter than that with only MCAK or XMAP215 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref></bold>). To understand if this reflects the simple summation of the separate contributions of MCAK and XMAP215 or their synergistic effect, we calculated the probability-based catastrophe frequency in all conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gardner et al., 2011</xref>).We found that the effects of MCAK and XMAP215 on the probability of microtubule catastrophe were only additive, showing that there was no synergic effect in regulating catastrophe frequency (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study provides mechanistic insights into understanding the end-binding mechanism of MCAK. The previously established view on the end-binding mechanism of MCAK is based on specific recognition of curved protofilaments at the distalmost tip of growing microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Asenjo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benoit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tan et al., 2008</xref>). The findings in the present study add to the model by showing that MCAK strongly binds to the EB cap, and this binding preference could facilitate the end-binding and in turn the depolymerizing activity of MCAK. We now discuss our main findings and their implications.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>MCAK preferentially binds to the GDP‧Pi-tubulin in a nucleotide state-independent manner</title>
<p>Our main finding is that MCAK preferentially binds to the EB cap where the GDP‧Pi-tubulins gather, in addition to the previously known binding preference for the curved protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Asenjo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benoit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tan et al., 2008</xref>). This conclusion is based on several lines of evidence. First, MCAK‧ADP or MCAK‧APO shows a significant reduction but not a complete loss in the binding preference for dynamic microtubule ends. However, their binding preference for stabilized microtubule ends is completely absent. The different binding behavior to dynamic and stabilized microtubule ends suggests that other end features, in addition to the curved protofilament, also contribute to the end-binding of MCAK. Second, the localization analysis of MCAK shows that MCAK binds to the entire GTP cap, including the EB cap and the distalmost cap. Third, MCAK shows a binding preference for GTPγS microtubules over GDP or GMPCPP microtubules. Because the tubulin in GTPγS microtubules is considered to be the analogues to the GDP‧Pi-tubulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Maurer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Maurer et al., 2012</xref>), MCAK is expected to have a high affinity to the EB cap. Fourth, the loss of the binding preference of MCAK<sup>K524A</sup> for GTPγS microtubules, but not for the ends of GMPCPP microtubules, suggests that the binding preference for GDP‧Pi-tubulins is required for the optimal end-binding affinity and preference.</p>

<title>Implications for the working mechanism of MCAK</title>
<p>We think that our findings add to the current working model of MCAK in four aspects. First, the nucleotide state-independent binding preference for GDP‧Pi-tubulins provides a mechanism for MCAK staying bound to the GTP cap after ATP hydrolysis. For example, in a speculative scenario (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref></bold>), when one of the motor domains of MCAK is converted to the ADP or APO state after the breakage of the terminal tubulin dimers, it loses the binding affinity to the curved protofilaments (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref></bold>). However, it still preferentially binds to GDP‧Pi-tubulins, so it has a larger chance binding back to the EB cap than to the lattice and thereby remains within the GTP cap (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref></bold>). Then, while the ADP is being replaced by a new ATP, this motor domain could diffuse around to explore the working site for the next round of catalysis. In this way, the nucleotide state-independent binding feature of MCAK would facilitate the binding to the dynamic microtubule ends. This idea is consistent with the findings that MCAK<sup>K524A</sup>, a mutant showing reduced preference for GDP‧Pi-tubulins, had disrupted end-binding affinity, preference and dwell time.</p>

<p>Second, the previous studies showed that MCAK has a direct interaction with EB1, and EB1 increases the end-binding rate of MCAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gouveia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Honnappa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). Intuitively, there is a gap here that after the arrival of MCAK at the binding region of EB1, how it could reach the high-affinity binding site or working site, previously known as the curved protofilament at the distalmost tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Asenjo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benoit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tan et al., 2008</xref>). Our finding fills this gap by showing that MCAK also binds strongly to the GDP‧Pi-tubulins where the EBs bind (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref></bold>). Moreover, MCAK could explore the entire length of GTP cap (∼160 nm) by 1D lattice diffusion within the binding dwell time. In this way, we argue that MCAK could find the precisely catalyzing site at dynamic microtubule ends by a combination of 3D diffusion (to first reach the GTP cap) and 1D lattice diffusion (short range, within the GTP cap).</p>
<p>Third, a previous study showed that the association on-rate is an important regulated parameter for the functions of MCAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cooper et al., 2010</xref>). The binding affinity and preference for the EB cap, in addition to the distalmost cap, would intuitively provide more binding sites, thereby further increasing the binding on-rate of MCAK. This idea is also consistent with the finding that MCAK<sup>K524A</sup>, a mutant with a reduced preference for GDP‧Pi-tubulins, had a reduced end-binding on-rate.</p>
<p>Fourth, despite having partially overlapped binding regions, MCAK and XMAP215 provide independent controls for catastrophe frequency and growth rate of microtubules, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref></bold>). The free combination of these two regulators suggests a straightforward strategy in the regulations on the length and mass of microtubules, i.e., simply by controlling their amount (i.e. expression level) or activity (e.g. via phosphorylation). In this sense, the working scenario of MCAK and XMAP215 provides a molecular paradigm to understand how the regulators of microtubules orchestrate their behaviors at the nanoscopic end structure of dynamic microtubules and reflects a clear logic in the regulatory network of microtubule dynamics.</p>

<p>The diffusion coefficient of MCAK on dynamic microtubule lattices was calculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Helenius et al., 2006</xref>). Firstly, we gained the position coordinates of MCAK at its molecular trajectory on dynamic microtubule lattices using the plugin of imageJ (Fiji), TrackMate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>). Note that the minimum track length was kept at 400 ms (100 ms/frame).

<title>Localization analysis at growing microtubule ends</title>
<p>The analysis on the single-molecule localization at growing microtubule ends was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Song et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, we determined the position of growing microtubule end by considering the microtubule lattice as a Gaussian wall and its end as a half-Gaussian. This model was used to fit the microtubule end and determined the position of microtubule end in every frame. The peak position of the half-Gaussian was used as the origin of the positional axis, which was used as a reference to measure the localization of individual single-molecule binding events. We estimated that the accuracy of microtubule end tracking was ∼6 nm by measuring standard error of the distribution of the estimated error in microtubule end position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Demchouk et al., 2011</xref>). To measure the precise localization of individual binding events at growing microtubule ends, a Gaussian function was used to fit the intensity profile of individual molecules. We estimated that the accuracy of the measured position was ∼2 nm by measuring standard error of the fitting peak location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Maurer et al., 2014</xref>). The peak location was recorded as the position of each molecule in every frame. The average peak location over the entire binding period was recorded as the position of the molecule. The positional distributions of GFP-MCAK, EB1-GFP, XMAP215-GFP at growing microtubule ends were plotted along the longitudinal axis of microtubule. Finally, the plots of GFP-MCAK and XMAP215-GFP were fitted to a Gaussian function and the plots of EB1-GFP was fitted to an exponentially modified Gaussian function, from which we calculated the FWHM as an estimation for the length of the binding region of each molecule.</p>

<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>1. Is the direct binding of MCAK to the microtubule cap important for its in vivo function?</p>
<p>a. The authors claim that their &quot;study provides mechanistic insights into understanding the end-binding mechanism of MCAK&quot;. I respectfully disagree. My concern is that the paper offers limited insights into the physiological significance of direct end-binding for MCAK activity, even in vitro. The authors estimate that in the absence of other proteins in vitro, ~95% of MCAK molecules arrive at the tip by direct binding in the presence of ~ physiological ATP concentration (1 mM). In cells, however, the major end-binding pathway may be mediated by EB, with the direct binding pathway contributing little to none. This is a reasonable concern because the apparent dissociation constant measured by the authors shows that MCAK binding to microtubules in the presence of ATP is very weak (69 uM). This concern should be addressed by 1) calculating relative contributions of direct and EB-dependent pathways based on the affinities measured in this and other published papers and estimated intracellular concentrations. Although there are many unknowns about these interactions in cells, a modeling-based analysis may be revealing. 2) the recapitulation of these pathways using purifying proteins in vitro is also feasible. Ideally, some direct evidence should be provided, e.g. based on MCAK function-separating mutants (GDP-Pi tubulin binding vs. catalytic activity at the curled protofilaments) that contribution from the direct binding of MCAK to microtubule cap in EB presence is significant.</p>
<p>b. As mentioned in the Discussion, preferential MCAK binding to tubulins near the MT tip may enhance MCAK targeting of terminal tubulins AFTER the MCAK has been &quot;delivered&quot; to the distal cap via the EB-dependent mechanism. This is a different targeting mechanism than the direct MCAK-binding. However, the measured binding affinity between MCAK and GMPCPP tubulins is so weak (69 uM), that this effect is also unlikely to have any impact because the binding events between MCAK and microtubule should be extremely rare. Without hard evidence, the arguments for this enhancement are very speculative.</p>
<p>2. The authors do not provide sufficient justification and explanation for their investigation of the effects of different nucleotides in MCAK binding affinity. A clear summary of the nucleotide-dependent function of MCAK (introduction with references to prior affinity measurements and corresponding MCAK affinities), the justifications for this investigation, and what has been learned from using different nucleotides (discussion) should be provided. My take on these results is that by far the strongest effect on microtubule wall and tip binding is achieved by adding any adenosine, whereas differences between different nucleotides are relatively minor. Was this expected? What can be learned from the apparent similarity between ATP and AMPPNP effects in some assays (Fig 1E, 4C, etc) but not others (Fig 1D,F, etc)?</p>
<p>3. It is not clear why the authors decided to use these specific mutant MCAK proteins to advance their arguments about the importance of direct tip binding. Both mutants are enzymatically inactive. Both show roughly similar tip interactions, with some (minor) differences. Without a clear understanding of what these mutants represent, the provided interpretations of the corresponding results are not convincing.</p>
<p>4. GMPCPP microtubules are used in the current study to represent normal dynamic microtubule ends, based on some published studies. However, there is no consensus in the field regarding the structure of growing vs. GMPCPP-stabilized microtubule ends, which additionally may be sensitive to specific experimental conditions (buffers, temperature, age of microtubules, etc). To strengthen the authors' argument, Taxol-stabilized microtubules should be used as a control to test if the effects are specific. Additionally, the authors should consider the possibility that stronger MCAK binding to the ends of different types of microtubules may reflect MCAK-dependent depolymerization events on a very small scale (several tubulin rows). These nano-scale changes to tubulins and the microtubule end may lead to the accumulation of small tubulin-MCAK aggregates, as is seen with other MAPs and slowly depolymerizing microtubules. These effects for MCAK may also depend on specific nucleotides, further complicating the interpretation. This possibility should be addressed because it provides a different interpretation than presented in the manuscript.</p>
<p>5. It would be helpful if the authors provided microtubule polymerization rates and catastrophe frequencies for assays with dynamic microtubules and MCAK in the presence of different nucleotides. The video recordings of microtubules under these conditions are already available to the authors, so it should not be difficult to provide these quantifications. They may reveal that microtubule ends are different (or not) under the examined conditions. It would also help to increase the overall credibility of this study by providing data that are easy to compare between different labs.</p>
<p>6. Are there other published studies that report MCAK binding affinity to microtubules? I find it quite surprising that the authors have reported the apparent dissociation constant for MCAK as 1mM. Such a high Kd value suggests no interaction under normal conditions, given that the intracellular concentrations of most proteins are orders of magnitude lower. If this information is inaccurate, it raises questions about the accuracy of other quantifications in the study.</p>
<p>7. Experimental and data analysis techniques are described superficially, and in some cases, only references to the prior work by others are provided. More direct evidence for these techniques and the corresponding controls should be provided.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, Chen et al. investigate the localization of microtubule kinesin-13 MCAK to the microtubule ends. MCAK is a prominent microtubule depolymerase whose molecular mechanisms of action have been extensively studied by a number of labs over the last ~twenty years. Here, the authors use single-molecule approaches to investigate the precise localization of MCAK on growing microtubules and conclude that MCAK preferentially binds to a GDP-Pi-tubulin portion of the microtubule end. The conclusions are speculative and not well substantiated by the data, making the impact of the study in its current form rather limited. Specifically, greater effort should be made to define the region of MCAK binding on microtubule ends, as well as its structural characteristics. Given that MCAK has been previously shown to effectively tip-track growing microtubule ends through an established interaction with EB proteins, the physiological relevance of the present study is unclear. Finally, the manuscript does not cite or properly discuss a number of relevant literature references, the results of which should be directly compared and contrasted to those presented here.</p>

<p>The authors revisit an old question of how MCAK goes to microtubule ends, partially answered by many groups over the years. The authors seem to have omitted the literature on MCAK in the past 10-15 years. The novelty is limited due to what has previously been done on the question. Previous work showed MCAK targets to microtubule plus-ends in cells through association with EB proteins and Kif18b (work from Wordeman, Medema, Walczak, Welburn, Akhmanova) but none of their work is cited.</p>
<p>It is not obvious in the paper that these in vitro studies only reveal microtubule end targeting, rather than plus end targeting. MCAK diffuses on the lattice to both ends and its conformation and association with the lattice and ends has also been addressed by other groups-not cited here. I want to particularly highlight the work from Friel's lab where they identified a CDK phosphomimetic mutant close to helix4 which reduces the end preference of MCAK. This residue is very close to the one mutated in this study and is highly relevant because it is a site that is phosphorylated in vivo. This study and the mutant produced here suggest a charge-based recognition of the end of microtubules.</p>
<p>Here the authors analyze this MCAK recognition of the lattice and microtubule ends, with different nucleotide states of MCAK and in the presence of different nucleotide states for the microtubule lattice. The main conclusion is that MCAK affinity for microtubules varies in the presence of different nucleotides (ATP and analogs) which was partially known already. How different nucleotide states of the microtubule lattice influence MCAK binding is novel. This information will be interesting to researchers working on the mechanism of motors and microtubules. However, there are some issues with some experiments. In the paper, the authors say they measure MCAK residency of growing end microtubules, but in the kymographs, the microtubules don't appear dynamic- in addition, in Figure 1A, MCAK is at microtubule ends and does not cause depolymerization. I would have expected to see depolymerization of the microtubule after MCAK targeting. The MCAK mutants are not well characterized. Do they still have ATPase activity? Are they folded? Can the authors also highlight T537 and discuss this?</p>
<p>Finally, a few experiments are done with MCAK and XMAP215, after the authors say they have demonstrated the binding sites overlap. The data supporting this statement were not obvious and the conclusions that the effect of the two molecules are additive would argue against competing binding sites. Overall, while there are some interesting quantitative measurements of MCAK on microtubules - in particular in relation to the nucleotide state of the microtubule lattice - the insights into end-recognition are modest and do not address or discuss how it might happen in cells. Often the number of events is not recorded. Histograms with large SEM bars are presented, so it is hard to get a good idea of data distribution and robustness. Figures lack annotations. This compromises therefore their quantifications and conclusions. The discussion was hard to follow and needs streamlining, as well as putting their work in the context of what is known from other groups who produced work on this in the past few years.</p>
