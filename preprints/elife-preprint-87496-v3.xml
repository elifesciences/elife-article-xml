<title>Abstract</title><p>High-altitude polycythemia (HAPC) is a chronic condition prevalent in individuals residing at high altitudes (HA), characterized by an augmented production of red blood cells (RBCs) due to hypoxic conditions. Despite its prevalence, the pathophysiological basis and molecular mechanisms driving HAPC remain largely unelucidated. In our study, we utilized a mouse model exposed to hypobaric hypoxia (HH), replicating the environmental conditions experienced at 6000 m above sea level, coupled with <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of primary splenic macrophages under 1% O<sub>2</sub> to investigate these mechanisms. Our findings revealed that HH exposure significantly stimulates erythropoiesis, leading to erythrocytosis. This was accompanied by a notable sequence of splenic changes, initially characterized by splenic contraction, which subsequently progressed to splenomegaly over 14 days. A key observation was the impairment on the capacity of spleen to process RBCs, primarily attributed to a reduction in splenic macrophages located in the red pulp. Extended HH treatment over 7 and 14 days precipitated increased iron mobilization and the onset of ferroptosis within the spleen. This was evidenced by altered expression levels of iron metabolism and ferroptosis-related proteins, paralleling gene expression patterns observed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Single-cell sequencing of splenic tissue post-HH exposure demonstrated a marked decrease in macrophage populations after 7 days. Our study further disclosed a significant increase in RBCs retention in the spleen following HH exposure, likely a consequence of diminished red pulp macrophages (RPMs) and erythrophagocytosis. This hypothesis was corroborated through comprehensive analyses involving flow cytometry, histological staining, and immunostaining, which collectively provided a detailed understanding of RBCs dynamics under HH conditions. <italic>In vitro</italic> analyses substantiated the decline in primary splenic macrophages and induction of ferroptosis under hypoxic treatment, effects that were relieved by pre-treatment with the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1. Collectively, our data suggest that HH exposure initiates splenic ferroptosis, leading primarily to a decrease in RPMs. This decrease potentially impacts erythrophagocytosis, contributing to increased RBCs retention and subsequent splenomegaly. Such changes could potentially foster continuous RBCs production and accelerate the progress of HAPC. In conclusion, our study highlights the important role of the spleen and splenic macrophages in the pathogenesis of HAPC, providing crucial insights into the disease progression and potential therapeutic targets.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>A plateau is a special environment characterized by low atmospheric pressure and low partial oxygen pressure. Long-term exposure to plateau environments may lead to chronic mountain disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. High-altitude polycythemia (HAPC) is a common and widespread chronic mountain sickness characterized by excessive erythrocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Hypobaric hypoxia (HH) is the main cause of erythrocytosis, which in turn alleviates hypoxic conditions in tissues under high-altitude (HA) exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. In a healthy organism, a balance is maintained between erythropoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) and erythrophagocytosis in the spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Even though HA/HH exposure can disrupt the equilibrium between RBCs formation and clearance, healthy individuals can swiftly establish a new steady state of RBCs homeostasis in chronic hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. This adaptation is a critical response to the altered oxygen availability characteristic of HA environments. However, in patients with HAPC, RBCs homeostasis is disrupted, failing to reach a state of equilibrium, which ultimately leads to a persistent increase in RBCs count [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. This deviation from the normative adaptation process implies a pathological deviation from the usual compensatory mechanisms employed under chronic hypoxia conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. It is well-established that exposure to HA/HH can induce erythropoiesis, yet the pathogenesis of erythrophagocytosis under these conditions remains poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>The spleen plays a crucial role in maintaining erythropoietic homeostasis by effectively clearing impaired and senescent RBCs from circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Particularly, red pulp macrophages (RPMs) within the spleen, serving as primary phagocytes, are responsible for clearing senescent, damaged, and abnormal erythrocytes from circulation to recycle iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. RPMs initiate the process of RBCs endocytosis and lysosomal digestion into heme, following the recognition of the RBCs earmarked for removal via their cell surface signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Subsequently, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) decomposes the heme into biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Most of the iron recycled from heme is transported out of the cell through a protein called ferroportin (Fpn). This iron then binds to transferrin (Tf), a plasma protein that transports iron in the blood. The iron-transferrin complex interacts with the transferrin receptor (TfR) on the cell membrane, contributing to the formation of RBCs in the erythroid compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. A portion of the released iron is loaded into cellular ferritin (Ft; including Ft-H and Ft-L). In the presence of oxygen, the Ft-H facilitates the oxidation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> (ferrous ion) to Fe<sup>3+</sup> (ferric ion). Subsequently, the Ft-L stores this Fe<sup>3+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. The Ft-L features a nucleation site, consisting of a cluster of cavity-exposed carboxyl residues, which readily bind to Fe<sup>3+</sup>, thereby simplifying the storage process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. When the iron metabolism is vigorous, nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) can recognize Ft-H, bring Ft into the lysosomal pathway for degradation, and release iron in Ft for iron utilization in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. However, some iron exists in cells in the form of ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>), which is well known to be an important initiator of free radical oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Moreover, the accumulation of large amounts of Fe<sup>2+</sup> in cells may cause ferroptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite the extensive study of erythropoiesis under HA/HH conditions, the precise effects of HA/HH on erythrophagocytosis within the spleen remain largely unexplored. Considering the significant role of the spleen in RBC processing and the crucial function of RPMs in iron recycling from RBC clearance, we evaluated the impacts of HA exposure on the spleen/splenic macrophages using an HH-exposed mouse model (simulating 6000 m exposure conditions). In the current study, we sought to further investigate whether HA/HH can influence the erythrocyte disposal and iron recycling processes in macrophages. More specifically, we aimed to determine the potential impact of HA/HH exposure on the integrity of the erythrophagocytosis process. We discovered that exposure to HH triggered ferroptosis in the spleen, particularly in macrophages. This led to a reduction in macrophage numbers, which was subsequently followed by disruptions in erythrophagocytosis and iron recycling within the spleen. These findings may hold clinical significance, particularly in the context of continuous pathological erythrocytosis and the progression of HAPC under HA exposure.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>HH mouse exposure model</title>
<p>Male C57BL/6 male mice (at 8 weeks of age) were obtained from the animal experimental centre of Nantong University. Mice were adapted to the facilities for 3 days before experiments. Mouse models of HH exposure were established by placing the mice in the decompression chamber (TOW-INT TECH, ProOx-810, China) for 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 days. The parameters were set as follows: 6000 m above sea level, oxygen partial pressure of 11 kPa, lifting speed of 20 m/s, chamber pressure of 54 kPa, temperature of 25 ℃, humidity of 40%, and 12-h light/dark cycles. The hypobaric chamber was configured to ensure a ventilation rate of 25 air exchanges per minute. Tuftsin (0.15 mg/kg, MCE, HY-P0240, USA) was used to stimulate the phagocytosis of macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], and was injected at 7 and 11 days during the 14-days period of mice exposed to HH. The control group animals were maintained in a similar chamber for the same amount of time under normobaric normoxia (NN) conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Splenectomy</title>
<p>After anesthesia, the mice were placed in a supine position, and their limbs were fixed. The abdominal operation area was skinned, disinfected, and covered with a sterile towel. A median incision was made in the upper abdomen, followed by laparotomy to locate the spleen. The spleen was then carefully pulled out through the incision. The arterial and venous directions in the splenic pedicle were examined, and two vascular forceps were used to clamp all the tissue in the main cadre of blood vessels below the splenic portal. The splenic pedicle was cut between the forceps to remove the spleen. The end of the proximal hepatic artery was clamped with a vascular clamp, and double or through ligation was performed to secure the site. The abdominal cavity was then cleaned to ensure there was no bleeding at the ligation site, and the incision was closed. Post-operatively, the animals were housed individually. Generally, they were able to feed themselves after recovering from anesthesia and did not require special care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Splenic macrophage culture and treatments</title>
<p>After isoflurane anaesthesia, mice were transcardially perfused with precooled PBS, and then splenic tissue was collected. The spleen was then dissected into minuscule fragments, each approximately 1 mm<sup>3</sup> in volume, and separated in cold, phenol red-free Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS; Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). The cell extracts were centrifuged at 500 rpm for 5 min at 4 ℃. The pellets were then resuspended and incubated with ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysing buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) for 3 min at room temperature. Next, cell extracts were purified in a four-phase Percoll (Sigma‒Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) gradient: 0, 30, 40, and 50% in HBSS. After centrifugation at 500 rpm for 20 min at 4°C, the macrophage-enriched fraction was collected at the interface between the 30% and 40% phases. Cells were washed in two rounds with HBSS and then resuspended in AIM V medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cells in this medium were cultured at 37 ℃ and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 12 h. After the cells were treated with ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1, 2 μm; Selleck Chemicals, S7243, USA) 1 h in advance, the cells were placed in a hypoxia workstation (Invivo2, Ruskinn, UK) for 24 h.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Blood smear and hematological indices</title>
<p>The collected blood was gently mixed with EDTA (15 g/L) to obtain anticoagulant blood, which was detected by a hematology analyser (XE-5000, Sysmex Corporation, Japan). Blood smear preparation method: a blood sample is dropped onto a slide, and another slide is used to push the blood sample into a uniform thin layer at a constant speed. After the blood samples were dried, Wright stain solution (G1040, Solarbio, China) was added and incubated for 1 min. Then, the slide was rinsed with water. Blood smears were photographed with a DM4000B microscope (Leica, Germany).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Lillie staining and Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining</title>
<p>The Lillie staining method was employed to ascertain Fe<sup>2+</sup> deposition within the spleen, according to the protocol delineated by Liu et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Briefly, paraffin-embedded spleen sections underwent a process of dewaxing and rehydration via xylene and gradient alcohol. Then, the Lillie staining solution (G3320, Solarbio, China) was applied at 37°C for 50 min in a light-restricted environment, improved by a 5-min PBS wash. Subsequently, a mixture comprising 30% hydrogen peroxide and methanol was incubated for 20 min, and then the sections were subjected to two 5-min washes with PBS. The DAB developing solution, which is not included in the Lillie bivalent iron staining kit, was applied for light-sensitive staining. The sections were stained with a nuclear fast red solution in a light-restricted setting for 10 min, followed by a 5-second wash with ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Lastly, the sections were dehydrated with gradient alcohol, cleared with xylene, and mounted with neutral resin. HE staining was employed in the spleen according to our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Wright-Giemsa composite stain</title>
<p>Mice were anaesthetized and perfused with saline. The spleen was subsequently excised to prepare a single cell suspension, achieved by filtering through a 70 µm filter. Samples were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min for cell separation. The cell pellet was subjected to three PBS washes. The suspension was then smeared onto a slide and air-dried. Following this, the slide was stained with Wright-Giemsa composite stain (G1020, Solarbio, China) for 3 min. An equivalent volume of pH 6.4 phosphate buffer was introduced, and the slide was gently agitated to allow mixing with the Wright’s stain solution for 5 min. After washing and drying, a microscope (DM4000B, Leica, Germany) was utilized for visualization and image acquisition.</p>

<sec id="s2g">
<title>Western blot</title>
<p>Tissue and cell samples were homogenized on ice after cell lysates and protease inhibitors were added. Centrifugation was performed at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C to collect the supernatant. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA detection method. A sample containing 30 μg protein was loaded and run in each well of SDS‒ PAGE gels. The membranes were incubated with the following antibodies: HO-1 (1:2000, Abcam, ab13243, USA); Ft-L (1:1000, Abcam, ab69090, USA); Ft-H (1:1000, Novus, NBP1-31944, USA); NCOA4 (1:1000, Santa Cruz, sc-373739, USA); TfR (1:1000, Thermo Fisher, 13-6800, USA); Fpn (1:1000, Novus, NBP1-21502, USA); ACSL4 (1:1000, Santa Cruz, sc-271800, USA); xCT (1:1000, Proteintech, 26864-1-AP, USA); Gpx4 (1:1000, Abcam, ab125066, USA); CD206 (1:1000, RD, AF2535, USA); and β-actin (1:1000, Sigma‒Aldrich, A5316, USA). The secondary antibodies were as follows: goat anti-mouse (1:10000, Jackson, USA) and goat anti-rabbit (1:10000, Jackson, USA). The gray value of specific blots was scanned and analysed using ImageJ software (National Institute of Health, USA).</p>

<p>Spleen sections of 9 μm thickness were flash-frozen and stored at -80°C. Before immunofluorescence staining, these sections were allowed to acclimate to room temperature for 30 min, then incubated in 10% BSA-PBS for 10 min. Next, the sections were incubated overnight with F4/80-PE (1:200, Biolegend, 123110, USA) or F4/80 (1:100, ab16911, Abcam, USA) and then washed thrice with PBS. Due to the limitations of F4/80 as a definitive macrophage marker, we concurrently conducted immunohistochemical analysis for heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (1:200, Abcam, ab13243, USA), CD11b (1:100, 14-0112-82, Thermo, USA) and CD68 (1:100, ab125212, Abcam, USA), respectively. In the RBCs detection experiment, Band3 primary antibody (1:100, 2813101-AP, Proteintech, China) and PKH67 green fluorescent cell linker (1:250, MIDI67, Sigma, USA) were used. Following this, sections were washed thrice with 0.05% PBST, incubated with secondary antibodies DAR-Alexa555 at room temperature for 2 h, washed thrice with PBS again, and finally sealed with 50% glycerine-PBS. Fluorescence microscopy images were captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope (SP8, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). To quantify the immunostaining intensity of F4/80, HO-1, CD11b, CD68, we utilized ImageJ software. Specifically, we captured multiple fields of view for each slide, and the software was used to measure the mean intensity of the fluorescent signal in these images.

<title>Single-cell RNA Sequencing</title>
<p>The spleen tissues were surgically removed and stored in MACS Tissue Storage Solution (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) until processing. Single-cell dissociation was performed by the experimentalists at the GENECHEM laboratory (Shanghai, China). Dissociated single cells were then stained for viability assessment using Calcein-AM (BD Biosciences, USA) and Draq7 (BD Biosciences). The BD Rhapsody system was used to capture transcriptomic information from single cells. Single-cell capture was achieved by random distribution of a single-cell suspension across &gt;200,000 microwells through a limited dilution approach. Beads with oligonucleotide barcodes were added to saturation so that a bead was paired with a cell in a microwell. The cells were lysed in the microwell to hybridize mRNA molecules to barcoded capture oligos on the beads. Beads were collected into a single tube for reverse transcription and ExoI digestion. Upon cDNA synthesis, each cDNA molecule was tagged on the 5′ end (that is, the 3′ end of an mRNA transcript) with a unique molecular identifier (UMI) and cell barcode indicating its cell of origin. Whole transcriptome libraries were prepared using the BD Rhapsody single-cell whole-transcriptome amplification (WTA) workflow, including random priming and extension (RPE), RPE amplification PCR and WTA index PCR. The libraries were quantified using a High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape (Agilent) and High Sensitivity D1000 Reagents (Agilent) on a 4150 TapeStation System (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and the Qubit High Sensitivity DNA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

<title>HH exposure promotes erythrocytosis in mice</title>
<p>To mimic 6000 m HA exposure, we placed C58BL/6 mice in an animal hypobaric oxygen chamber and detected the blood indices in the blood of the mice after HH exposure for different times. The blood smear showed that the number of RBCs was increased from 3 to 14 days after HH exposure compared with the NN group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Routine blood tests further confirmed the results in blood smears, which showed that the RBC number (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), HGB content (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) and HCT value (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) were all increased significantly to varying degrees, while MCH was not changed after HH exposure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). We further performed flow cytometry using TO staining to detect reticulocytes after 3, 7, and 14 days of HH treatment. The results showed that the proportion of reticulocytes increased after 7 and 14 days of HH exposure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, F-G</xref>), and the number of RBCs reached the peak after 7 days of HH exposure. These results suggested that the HH-treated mouse model effectively mimics HA exposure, which promotes erythropoiesis and results in erythrocytosis in mice following HH exposure.</p>

<title>Spleen inhibits the immoderate increase in RBCs under HH conditions</title>
<p>To determine the roles of the spleen in RBC homeostasis under HA/HH, we investigated the effects of HH on the morphology, volume, and weight of the spleen as well as erythrocyte indices. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, the spleen volume and weight were decreased significantly after HH exposure for 1 day compared to NN treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, A-C</xref>). However, the spleen was obviously enlarged from 2 to 14 days after HH exposure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, A-C</xref>). The results indicated that the spleen contracted, the stored RBCs in the spleen were released into the blood at 1 day, and the RBCs were produced and/or retained in the spleen from 2 to 14 days after HH exposure. In our research, we also examined the influence of the spleen on RBCs homeostasis under HH conditions. We investigated whether the role of spleen in RBCs clearance under HH conditions could be compensated by the liver or other components of the mononuclear macrophage system. To conduct this, we performed splenectomies on mice and subsequently exposed them to HH conditions for 14 days. This allowed us to monitor RBCs counts and blood deposition. Our findings indicated that, in comparison to both the splenectomized mice under NN conditions and the sham-operated mice exposed to HH, erythrocyte deposition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) and counts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), as well as HGB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>) and HCT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>) levels, significantly increased 14 days post-splenectomy under HH conditions. Meanwhile, MCH levels remained stable (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). These indices did not vary in mice, regardless of whether they had undergone a splenectomy, under NN conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D and E</xref>). These results indicate that in the splenectomized group under NN conditions, erythrophagocytosis is substantially compensated for by functional macrophages in other tissues. However, under HH conditions, our data also suggest that the spleen plays an important role in managing erythrocyte turnover, as indicated by the significant impact of splenectomy on erythrophagocytosis and subsequent RBCs dynamics.</p>

<title>HH exposure leads to a decrease in splenic macrophages</title>
<p>Considering macrophages as the primary cell type responsible for processing RBCs within the spleen under physiological conditions, we subsequently investigated the population and activity of these macrophages after exposure to HH for 7 or 14 days, employing flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing techniques. Calcein/PI double staining, examined via flow cytometry, revealed a significant decrease in viable splenic cells and a concomitant increase in dead cells following 7 and 14 days of HH exposure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, A-C</xref>). This observation was further substantiated by single-cell sequencing, which elucidated a pronounced reduction in the population of splenic macrophages after 7 days of HH exposure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, D-F</xref>). Additionally, flow cytometry results indicated a marked decrease in the population of RPMs, identified as F4/80<sup>hi</sup>CD11b<sup>lo</sup>, in the spleen post 7 days of HH exposure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Complementary to these findings, immunofluorescence detection demonstrated a significant diminution in RPMs, characterized by F4/80<sup>hi</sup>CD11b<sup>lo</sup> and F4/80<sup>hi</sup>CD68<sup>hi</sup> cell populations, after both 7 and 14 days of HH exposure (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). Furthermore, our single-cell sequencing analysis of the spleen under NN conditions revealed a predominant association of RPMs with Cluster 0. Intriguingly, HH exposure led to a notable reduction in the abundance of RPMs within this cluster. Pseudo-time series analysis provided insights into the transitional dynamics of spleen RPMs, indicating a shift from Cluster 2 and Cluster 1 towards Cluster 0 under NN conditions. However, this pattern was altered under HH exposure, where a shift from Cluster 0 and Cluster 1 towards Cluster 2 was observed (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

<title>HH exposure suppresses erythrophagocytosis of RPMs in spleen</title>
<p>We investigated the influence of HH exposure on erythrocyte phagocytosis and heme iron recycling within splenic macrophages. To this end, we implemented a dual approach: administering NHS-biotin intravenously to mice, followed by HH exposure, and subsequently introducing PKH67-labelled RBCs into the mice, also followed by HH treatment <italic>in vivo</italic>. This methodology allowed us to monitor the clearance of RBCs by tracking the retention of both biotin-labelled and PKH67-labelled RBCs using flow cytometry in the blood and spleen of the HH-treated mice. Our findings (as detailed in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) indicated a pronounced decrease in the presence of both biotin-labelled and PKH67-labelled RBCs in the blood and spleen at 7- and 14-day intervals post HH exposure. Notably, while a natural decline in labelled RBCs over time was expected, the rate of decay was significantly more acute in the NN exposure group as compared to the HH group. This observation was consistent across both blood (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">G</xref>) and spleen samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, F</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">H</xref>).

<title>Reduced erythrophagocytosis leads to RBCs retention in the spleen under HH exposure</title>
<p>Based on the reduced RPMs and erythrophagocytosis caused by HH exposure in spleen, we next investigated whether RBCs were retained in spleen after HH exposure.

HE staining (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, A-B</xref>) and Band 3 immunostaining in situ (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, C-D, G-H</xref>) revealed a significant increase in RBCs numbers in the spleen following 7 and 14 days of HH exposure. Furthermore, we quantified RBCs retention by employing Wright-Giemsa composite staining on single splenic cells post-perfusion at both 7- and 14-days post HH exposure.

Fluorescence detection techniques was utilized, revealing a marked increase in PKH67-labeled RBCs post HH exposure (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, I-J</xref>). These results collectively confirm a pronounced impairment in erythrophagocytosis within the spleen under HH conditions. This is evidenced by the observed increase in RBCs deformation and retention following 7 and 14 days of HH exposure. The data thus suggest that HH exposure leads to an increase in RBCs retention in the spleen, highlighting significant alterations in splenic function and RBCs dynamics under hypoxic conditions.</p>

<title>HH induced reduction in erythrophagocytosis leads to a decrease in the capacity of iron processing in the spleen</title>
<p>To investigate the hypothesis that increased retention of RBCs in the spleen due to HH exposure is a result of impaired erythrophagocytosis by RPMs, we employed a series of experiments. Initially, RBCs were labelled with PKH67 cell linker and then injected into mice. Subsequently, Tuftsin was administered to stimulate the phagocytic activity of macrophages. After 1 h, 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, or 7 days of NN exposure, PKH67 fluorescence was analyzed via flow cytometry. The findings demonstrated a gradual reduction in PKH67 fluorescence over the course of NN exposure; however, a significant decrease in PKH67 fluorescence was noted in the spleen following Tuftsin administration compared to the NN group. This observation suggested that RBC lifespan is diminished following enhanced erythrophagocytosis (as presented in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7, A-B</xref>). Further investigation was conducted on the ability of the spleen to regulate heme iron recycling under HH conditions through immunofluorescence and iron staining (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). The results, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>, indicated that both F4/80 expression and iron deposition in the red pulp of the spleen were notably reduced following HH exposure, compared to the NN group. Contrastingly, Tuftsin administration under HH conditions resulted in an upsurge in F4/80 expression and iron deposition in the red pulp (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7, E-F</xref>). These findings collectively suggest that the splenic capacity for erythrocyte phagocytosis and subsequent heme iron recycling is significantly compromised under HH conditions, primarily due to a reduction in RPMs. This reduced erythrophagocytic capacity of the spleen under HH exposure is a critical factor contributing to the decreased efficiency of iron processing and increased RBCs retention in this organ.</p>

<title>HH exposure induces iron mobilization and ferroptosis in the spleen</title>
<p>To elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying the macrophage reduction caused by HH, we examined the expression of proteins related to iron metabolism and ferroptosis in mice treated with HH and analyzed the corresponding gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy humans acutely exposed to HA conditions using GEO data (No. GSE46480). The results showed that, compared to the NN group, the expression levels of HO-1, Ft-L, Ft-H, NCOA4, and xCT were decreased, while Fpn, TfR, and ACSL4 expressions were significantly increased after 7 and 14 days of HH exposure (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8, A-B, D-E</xref>; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3, A-D</xref>).

<title>Hypoxia induces ferroptosis in primary splenic macrophages</title>
<p>To investigate whether hypoxia exposure can trigger ferroptosis in macrophages, we measured alterations in Fe<sup>2+</sup> and lipid ROS levels, cell viability, phagocytosis, and ferroptosis-related protein expressions in primary splenic macrophages under hypoxia in the presence of a ferroptosis inhibitor (Fer-1). As depicted in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>, compared with the normoxia control group (Nor), Fe<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9, A-C</xref>) and lipid ROS (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9, D-E</xref>) levels significantly increased, whereas the number of viable cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9, G-H</xref>) and phagocytosis ability (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9I</xref>) significantly decreased after 24 h of hypoxia (Hyp) treatment. In addition, prolonged hypoxia exposure led to a gradual increase in ACSL4 expression, while xCT and GPX4 expressions decreased (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9F</xref>). Fer-1 mitigated the increase in Fe<sup>2+</sup> content (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9, J-K</xref>) and reversed the expression changes in ACSL4, xCT, and GPX4 induced by hypoxia exposure (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9, L-O</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore the effects and mechanisms of HA/HH exposure on erythrophagocytosis and iron circulation in mouse spleens. Here, we used an HH chamber to simulate 6000 m HA exposure and found that HH exposure induced iron mobilization and activated ferroptosis in the spleen, especially in RPMs, which subsequently inhibited the phagocytosis and clearance of RBCs. Finally, chronic exposure to HA/HH may promote the retention of RBCs in the spleen, cause splenomegaly, advance RBC production, and promote the occurrence and development of HAPC.</p>
<p>RBCs/erythrocytes are the carriers of oxygen and the most abundant cell type in the body. Erythrocytes are rapidly increased by triggering splenic contraction in acute HA/HH exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] and stimulating erythropoiesis in subsequent continuous or chronic HA/HH exposure. Changes in spleen morphology and size are closely related to the spleen’s ability to recover RBCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], and studies have shown that the spleen is in a contraction state after short-term exposure to HA/HH, and approximately 40% of the increase in RBCs is due to the contraction of the spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. In the present study, mice were treated under HH to mimic HA exposure (mainly mimicking the low oxygen partial pressure environment of 6000 m HA) for different times according to other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Our results showed that HH exposure significantly increased the number of RBCs and HGB contents. However, short-term (1 day) HH exposure caused spleen contraction and induced splenomegaly after 3 days of HH treatment. This contraction can trigger an immediate release of RBCs into the bloodstream in instances of substantial blood loss or significant reduction of RBCs. Moreover, elevated oxygen consumption rates in certain animal species can be partially attributed to splenic contractions, which augment haematocrit levels and the overall volume of circulating blood, thereby enhancing venous return and oxygen delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that the body, under such conditions, is incapable of generating sufficient RBCs promptly enough to facilitate enhanced oxygen delivery. Consequently, the spleen reacts by releasing its stored RBCs through splenic constriction, leading to a measurable reduction in spleen size. These results are consistent with other research results; that is, HH or HA exposure affects spleen morphology and further affects RBCs counts and HGB levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>].</p>
<p>HAPC is a common chronic HA disease characterized by excessive proliferation of RBCs caused by HH conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Under physiological conditions, RBC homeostasis is maintained by balancing erythropoiesis and erythrocyte clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. The ability of RBC disposal in the spleen for iron recycling under HA/HH exposure was important to RBC regeneration in BM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that erythrophagocytosis and iron recycling in the spleen were altered by HA/HH exposure and further disturbed RBC homeostasis and affected the progression of HAPC. We found that compared with sham group mice, HH significantly increased the contents of RBCs and HGB in the blood of splenectomy mice. This strongly verified that the spleen is a key organism that maintains RBC magnitude within a certain range of physiological statuses under HA/HH conditions.</p>
<p>As originally proposed by Metchnikoff in the 19th century, macrophages, especially RPMs, play a pivotal role in the regulation of RBCs and iron homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. We detected the macrophage population in the spleen and found that HH exposure for 7 and 14 days reduced the total macrophages in the spleen. We next observed whether the migration and differentiation of monocytes from the BM to the spleen supplemented the reduced macrophages after HH treatment and maintained their homeostasis. It is well known that splenic erythrophagocytosis is a dynamic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Upon phagocytosing erythrocytes in macrophages, spleen tissue (including macrophages and fibroblasts) produces the chemokine C–C motif chemokine ligand 2 and 7 (CCL2 and CCL7) to recruit blood monocytes to the spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. In our study, the expression of CCL2, CCL7, and Csf1 in the spleen decreased after 7 and 14 days of HH exposure. Furthermore, we found that HH exposure inhibited Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocyte migration from the BM to spleen, where these cells subsequently differentiated into RPMs. The combination of decreased splenic RPMs, along with the reduced BM-derived Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, suggests that the homeostasis of the RPMs population in circulating monocytes was also inhibited after the depletion of RPMs induced by HH exposure. The observed decrease in monocytes within the BM is likely attributable to the fact that monocytes and precursor cells for RBCs both originate from the same hematopoietic stem cells within the BM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. As such, the differentiation to monocyte is reduced under hypoxic conditions, which may subsequently cause a decrease in migration to spleen.</p>
<p>HO-1 is a pivotal antioxidant and cytoprotective enzyme, instrumental in catalyzing the degradation of heme, thereby maintaining heme homeostasis and mitigating free heme-induced toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Notably, it has been posited that mice deficient in HO-1 exhibit a significant depletion of RPMs, emphasizing the important role of this enzyme in the development and maintenance of RPM after RBCs clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. In our study, the observed decrease in HO-1 protein levels in the red pulp suggests a potential reduction in the number of macrophages induced by HH exposure. This inference is made despite the general understanding that HO-1 expression is typically upregulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) under hypoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Along with the decrease in the number of macrophages caused by HH, we also noticed that the phagocytic ability of macrophages in the spleen is inhibited, as evidenced both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, the administration of tufftsin markedly enhanced heme iron processing in the spleen under HH conditions. However, our findings appear to diverge from those reported by Anand et al., which suggested an increase in macrophage phagocytosis under hypoxic conditions, mediated by HIF-1α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. This discrepancy may stem from the differing methodologies employed; whereas Anand et al. utilized intermittent hypoxia in their research, our study was characterized by consistent hypoxia. However, it should be acknowledged that using HO-1 expression as an alternative marker to quantify macrophage numbers is not without limitations. Variations in HO-1 expression per cell can yield misleading results, and the localization of this effect to the red pulp does not definitively equate to a conclusion applicable to macrophages, given the inherent heterogeneity of this region and the spleen overall. Considering the multifaceted nature of spleen function and cellular dynamics under hypoxic stress, this complexity requires careful interpretation of our data.</p>
<p>Macrophages play a crucial role in maintaining erythrocyte homeostasis, partially due to their function in digesting the HGB content of cleared RBCs and recycling the iron back to erythroid progenitors for heme synthesis and HGB production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. In mammals, most of the bodily iron exists in the form of heme, with the most substantial pool comprising HGB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. HGB contains four prosthetic hemoglobins, and each mature RBC is thought to contain approximately 1.2 × 10<sup>9</sup> heme moieties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. As previously mentioned, most of the iron required to sustain erythropoiesis is derived from recycled RBCs. In general, RPMs are equipped with molecular machinery capable of neutralizing the toxic effects of heme and metabolizing iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Nonetheless, any disruptions in the process of erythrophagocytosis, the uptake and degradation of erythrocytes by macrophages, could potentially result in abnormal iron metabolism, potentially manifesting as conditions such as anemia or iron overload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. The release of heme upon processed RBCs constitutes a permanent and considerable threat for iron cytotoxicity in macrophages and may eventually result in a specific form of programmed cell death termed ferroptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>], which may cause decreased cell counts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>].</p>
<p>Accordingly, we investigated the iron metabolism status and explored ferroptosis in spleen/macrophages after HH/hypoxia treatment and found that HH exposure prompted iron mobilization, especially in ferritinophagy and lipid peroxidation in the spleen. Interestingly, we found that all gene expression changes in PBMCs after acute HA exposure in humans, except for NCOA4, were similar to those in the spleen of mice exposed to HH for 7 and 14 days. This is probably because NCOA4 in the spleen mediates iron release from Ft-L and facilitates iron reuse, while PBMCs do not possess this function <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results not only indicated that HH exposure induces spleen ferroptosis but also implied that the gene expression changes in PBMCs under HA/HH may reflect RBC processing functions in the spleen and further indicate the iron metabolism status in the clinic. We further found that the exact mechanism of macrophage ferroptosis induced by HH exposure was caused by increased Fe<sup>2+</sup> and decreased antioxidative system expression, which finally resulted in lipid peroxidation of macrophages. It has been proposed that heme catabolism by HO-1 protects macrophages from oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. The enhanced ROS and lipid peroxidation <italic>in vivo</italic> were also consistent with the decreased HO-1 expression in the spleen. In addition, 1% hypoxia treatment induced ferroptosis <italic>in vitro</italic>, which was reduced by treatment with ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor. However, our data were inconsistent with the study of Fuhrmann <italic>et al</italic>., which reported that hypoxia inhibits ferritinophagy and protects against ferroptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. We hypothesized that the enhanced iron demand for new RBCs regeneration in BM caused by HH leads to a decrease in the expression of NCOA4 and Ft-L proteins in the spleen. On the other hand, hypoxia inhibited anti-ferroptosis system expression, including reduced Gpx4 expression and increased lipid ROS production. The results were supported by the group of Youssef LA <italic>et al</italic>, who reported that increased erythrophagocytosis induces ferroptosis in RPMs in a mouse model of transfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. However, as most studies have reported, ferroptosis is not only characterized by increased lipid ROS but also significantly shrinking mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. We never found shrinking mitochondria in RPMs after HH exposure (data not shown). Gao <italic>et al</italic>. proposed that mitochondria played a crucial role in cysteine deprivation-induced ferroptosis but not in that induced by inhibiting glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4), the most downstream component of the ferroptosis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. Interestingly, in our <italic>in vivo</italic> study, Gpx4 expression was also not changed after HH exposure. It is still not clear whether mitochondria are involved in ferroptosis. Whether HH treatment caused mitochondrial swelling directly and the exact mechanism involved in this process still need to be further investigated.</p>
<p>It is also possible that the spleen may adapt to the increased load of RBCs by provide new avenues for treating HAPC and other conditions related to HA exposure.</p>
<p>Based on the above experiments, we propose the “spleen theory” of HAPC as depicted in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>. It hypothesizes that HH exposure precipitates ferroptosis within the spleen, particularly affecting RPMs. This process, in turn, impedes erythrophagocytosis, RBCs clearance, HGB processing, and iron recycling. Consequently, this leads to an accumulation of RBCs within the spleen, exacerbating splenomegaly and perpetuating the production of RBCs under HH conditions. The “spleen theory” of HAPC provides a novel perspective on the physiological responses to hypoxia and highlights the role of the spleen as a vital organ in managing erythrocyte homeostasis under high altitude/hypoxic conditions. These findings may be clinically relevant to the pathological conditions of HAPC progression.</p>

<caption><title>HA/HH exposure suppresses erythrophagocytosis by inducing macrophages ferroptosis in the spleen.</title>
<p>This figure summarizes the multifaceted impact of HA and HH exposure on splenic macrophage function. HA/HH exposure is demonstrated to trigger significant iron mobilization, notably increasing Fe<sup>2+</sup> levels, which are further elevated in the spleen and macrophages of mice. Concurrently, HA/HH exposure is associated with an upregulation of ACSL4 expression, coupled with a suppression of xCT expression and GSH production. This alteration results in enhanced lipid peroxidation, culminating in the escalation of macrophage ferroptosis. Additionally, the exposure adversely affects monocyte migration and differentiation from BM to the spleen. Collectively, these effects of HA/HH exposure contribute to a notable inhibition of erythrophagocytosis, thereby promoting erythrocytosis and potentially exacerbating the progression of HAPC. This comprehensive analysis underscores the intricate interplay between environmental factors and cellular mechanisms in the spleen, which could significantly influence the pathogenesis of HAPC.</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study reports that a week or more of hypoxia exposure in mice increases erythropoiesis and decreases the number of iron-recycling macrophages in the spleen, compromising their capacity for red blood cell phagocytosis – reflected by increased mature erythrocyte retention in the spleen. Compared to an earlier version, the study has been strengthened with mouse experiments under hypobaric hypoxia and complemented by extensive ex vivo analyses. Unfortunately, while some of the evidence is <bold>solid</bold>, the work as it currently stands only <bold>incompletely</bold> supports the authors' hypotheses. While the study would benefit from additional experiments that more directly buttress the central claims, it should be of interest to the fields of hemopoiesis and bone marrow biology and possibly also blood cancer.</p>

<p>The authors aimed at elucidating the development of high altitude polycythemia which affects mice and men staying in a hypoxic atmosphere at high altitude (hypobaric hypoxia; HH). HH causes increased erythropoietin production which stimulates the production of red blood cells. The authors hypothesize that increased production is only partially responsible for exaggerated red blood cell production, i.e. polycythemia, but that decreased erythrophagocytosis in the spleen contributes to high red blood cells counts.</p>
<p>The main strength of the study is the use of a mouse model exposed to HH in a hypobaric chamber. However, not all of the reported results are convincing due to some smaller effects which one may doubt to result in the overall increase in red blood cells as claimed by the authors. Moreover, direct proof for reduced erythrophagocytosis is compromised due to a strong spontaneous loss of labelled red blood cells, although effects of labelled E. coli phagocytosis are shown.</p>
<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>The authors have partly addressed my comments.</p>
<p>(1) The response to my question regarding unchanged MCH is a kind of &quot;hand waiving&quot; - maybe it would require substantially more extensive work to clarify this issue</p>
<p>(2) The moderate if not marginal difference in normal vs splenectomy argues against a significant role of the spleen - even if the difference was slightly larger in HH</p>
<p>(3) There is still overinterpretation of data. My Q was: Is the reduced phagocytic capacity in Fig 4B significant? Response: &quot;This is indicative of a diminished phagocytic capacity, particularly when contrasted</p>
<p>
with NN conditions.&quot; I guess that is a &quot;no&quot;</p>
<p>(4) I assume my question with respect to bi- or trivalent iron chelators was misunderstood.</p>
<p>In general, as indicated above, it is an interesting hypothesis which is corroborated by data in several instances. Maybe the scientific community should decide whether it is all in all conclusive.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Yang et al. investigated in mice how hypobaric hypoxia can modify the RBC clearance function of the spleen, a concept that is of interest. Via interpretation of their data, the authors proposed a model that hypoxia causes an increase in cellular iron levels, possibly in RPMs, leading to ferroptosis, and downregulates their erythrophagocytic capacity.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The manuscript has now improved with all the new data, supporting the model proposed by the authors. However, it remains not very easy to follow for the conclusions and experimental details. Some of the most important remaining comments are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Lines 401-406 - The conclusions in this new fragment sound a bit overstated - the authors do not directly measure erytrophagocytosis capacity, only the total RBC parameters in the circulation. The increase is also very mild biologically between sham and splenectomized mice in HH conditions.</p>
<p>(2) scRNA seq data are still presented in a way that is very difficult to understand. The readers could not see from the graphics that macrophages are depleted. The clusters are not labelled - some clusters in the bin 'macrophahes+DC' seem actually to be more represented in Fig. 3E; Fig. 3F does not correspond to Fig. 3D. It would be maybe more informative to present like in Figure D side by side NN versus HH? The authors could consider moving the data from supplements that relate to RPMs to the main figure and making it consistent for the Clusters - eg, the authors show data for Cluster 0 in the supplement, and the same Cluster is not marked as macrophages in the main figure. This is quite difficult to follow.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 3G has likely mislabeled axis for F4/80 and CD11b - such mistakes should be avoided in a second revised version of the manuscript, and this data is now redundant with the data shown as new Figure 5A.</p>
<p>(4) The data from new Figure 4 should be better mentioned in the main body of the manuscript - all panels are mentioned twice in the text, first speaking about the decline of labelled RBCs and second referring to phagocytic capacity, whereas this figure only illustrates the decline of labelled RBCs, not directly phagocytic capacity of RPMs. What is lacking, as opposed to typical RBC life span assay, is the time '0' ('starting point') - this is particularly important as we can observe a big drop in labelled RBCs for eg 7 days between NN and HH group, actually implying increased removal of labelled RBCs within the first days of hypoxia exposure. What should be better labelled in this figure is that the proportion of RBCs are labelled RBCs not all RBCs (Y axis in individual panels). Overall, the new Figure 4 brings new data to the study, but how it is presented and discussed is not at the 'state-of-the-art' level (eg, missing the time '0') and is not very straightforward to the reader.</p>
<p>(5) In Figure 7, the experiments with Tuftsin are not very easy to follow, especially for the major conclusions. In panels A and B, the focus is the drug itself under NN conditions, with RBC removal as a readout. Then, in the next panels, the authors introduce HH, and then look at the F4/80 and iron staining. What was exactly the major point the authors wanted to make here?</p>
<p>(6) The data from Figure 8 are informative but do not address the individual cell types - eg, a drop in HO1 or FT may be due to the depletion of RPMs. An increase of TFR1 could be due to the retention of RBCs, the same as maybe labile iron. The data from PBMC are only very loosely linked to these phenotypes observed in the total spleen, and the reason for the regulation of the same proteins in PBMC might be different. It goes back to the data in Figure 3A-C, where also total splenocytes are investigated for their viability.</p>
<p>(7) Can the authors provide the data for the purity (eg cell surface markers) of their primary splenic macrophage cultures? Only ensuring that these are macrophages or addressing the readouts from Figure 8 in RPMs could link ferroptosis to RPMs under HH conditions.</p>
<p>(8) All the data are not presented as individual data points which is not widely applied in papers.</p>
<p>(9) No gating strategies are nicely illustrated or described.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p>(1) Substantial revision of the claims and interpretation of the results is needed, especially in the setting of additional data showing enhanced erythrophagocytosis with decreased RBC lifespan.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback and suggestion for a substantial revision of the claims and interpretation of our results. We acknowledge the importance of considering additional data that shows enhanced erythrophagocytosis with decreased RBC lifespan. In response, we have revised our manuscript and incorporated additional experimental data to support and clarify our findings.</p>
<p>(1) In our original manuscript, we reported a decrease in the number of splenic red pulp macrophages (RPMs) and phagocytic erythrocytes after hypobaric hypoxia (HH) exposure. This conclusion was primarily based on our observations of reduced phagocytosis in the spleen.</p>
<p>(2) Additional experimental data on RBC labeling and erythrophagocytosis:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Experiment 1 (RBC labeling and HH exposure)</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>We conducted an experiment where RBCs from mice were labeled with PKH67 and injected back into the mice. These mice were then exposed to normal normoxia (NN) or HH for 7 or 14 days. The subsequent assessment of RPMs in the spleen using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence detection revealed a significant decrease in both the population of splenic RPMs (F4/80hiCD11blo, new Figure 5A and C) and PKH67-positive macrophages after HH exposure (as depicted in new Figure 5A and C-E). This finding supports our original claim of reduced phagocytosis under HH conditions.</p>
<fig id="sa3fig1">

<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-87496-sa3-fig1.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>-Experiment 2 (erythrophagocytosis enhancement)</p>
<p>To examine the effects of enhanced erythrophagocytosis, we injected Tuftsin after administering PKH67-labelled RBCs. Our observations showed a significant decrease in PKH67 fluorescence in the spleen, particularly after Tuftsin injection compared to the NN group. This result suggests a reduction in RBC lifespan when erythrophagocytosis is enhanced (illustrated in new Figure 7, A-B).</p>

<p>(3) Revised conclusions:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The additional data from these experiments support our original findings by providing a more comprehensive view of the impact of HH exposure on splenic erythrophagocytosis.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>The decrease in phagocytic RPMs and phagocytic erythrocytes after HH exposure, along with the observed decrease in RBC lifespan following enhanced erythrophagocytosis, collectively suggest a more complex interplay between hypoxia, erythrophagocytosis, and RBC lifespan than initially interpreted.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>We think that these revisions and additional experimental data provide a more robust and detailed understanding of the effects of HH on splenic erythrophagocytosis and RBCs lifespan. We hope that these changes adequately address the concerns raised and strengthen the conclusions drawn in our manuscript.</p>

<p>(2) F4/80 high; CD11b low are true RPMs which the cells which the authors are presenting, i.e. splenic monocytes / pre-RPMs. To discuss RPM function requires the presentation of these cells specifically rather than general cells in the proper area of the spleen.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your feedback requesting a substantial revision of our claims and interpretation, particularly considering additional data showing enhanced erythrophagocytosis with decreased RBC lifespan. In response, we have thoroughly revised our manuscript and included new experimental data that further elucidate the effects of HH on RPMs and erythrophagocytosis.</p>
<p>(1) Re-evaluation of RPMs population after HH exposure:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Flow cytometry analysis (new Figure 3G, Figure 5A and B): We revisited the analysis of RPMs (F4/80hiCD11blo) in the spleen after 7 and 14 days of HH exposure.

<p>We further confirmed the decreased population of RPMs through in situ co-staining with F4/80 and CD11b, and F4/80 and CD68, in spleen tissues. These results clearly demonstrated a significant reduction in F4/80hiCD11blo (Figure S1, A and B) and F4/80hiCD68hi (Figure S1, C and D) cells following HH exposure.</p>

<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>We conducted a single-cell sequencing analysis of spleen samples post 7 days of HH exposure (Figure S2, A-C).

</list-item>
<list-item><p>Pseudo-time series analysis indicated a transition pattern change in spleen RPMs, with a shift from Cluster 2 and Cluster 1 towards Cluster 0 under NN conditions, and a reverse transition following HH exposure (Figure S2, B and D).

<p>In conclusion, our revised manuscript now includes additional experimental data and analyses, strengthening our claims and providing a more nuanced interpretation of the impact of HH on spleen RPMs and related erythrophagocytosis processes. We believe these revisions and additional data address your concerns and enhance the scientific validity of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) RBC retention in the spleen should be measured anyway quantitatively, eg, with proper flow cytometry, to determine whether it is increased or decreased.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your query regarding the quantitative measurement of RBC retention in the spleen, particularly in relation to HH exposure. We have utilized a combination of techniques, including flow cytometry and histological staining, to investigate this aspect comprehensively. Below is a summary of our findings and methodology.</p>
<p>(1) Flow cytometry analysis of labeled RBCs:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Our study employed both NHS-biotin (new Figure 4, A-D) and PKH67 labeling (new Figure 4, E-H) to track RBCs in mice exposed to HH. Flow cytometry results from these experiments (new Figure 4, A-H) showed a decrease in the proportion of labeled RBCs over time, both in the blood and spleen. Notably, there was a significantly greater reduction in the amplitude of fluorescently labeled RBCs after NN exposure compared to the reduced amplitude of fluorescently labeled RBCs observed in blood and spleen under HH exposure. The observed decrease in labeled RBCs was initially counterintuitive, as we expected an increase in RBC retention due to reduced erythrophagocytosis. However, this decrease can be attributed to the significantly increased production of RBCs following HH exposure, diluting the proportion of labeled cells.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>Specifically, for blood, the biotin-labeled RBCs decreased by 12.06% under NN exposure and by 7.82% under HH exposure, while the PKH67-labeled RBCs decreased by 9.70% under NN exposure and by 4.09% under HH exposure. For spleen, the biotin-labeled RBCs decreased by 3.13% under NN exposure and by 0.46% under HH exposure, while the PKH67-labeled RBCs decreased by 1.16% under NN exposure and by 0.92% under HH exposure. These findings suggest that HH exposure leads to a decrease in the clearance rate of RBCs.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<fig id="sa3fig7">
<label>Author response image 7.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-87496-sa3-fig7.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>(2) Detection of erythrophagocytosis in spleen:</p>
<p>To assess erythrophagocytosis directly, we labeled RBCs with PKH67 and analyzed their uptake by splenic macrophages (F4/80hi) after HH exposure. Our findings (new Figure 5, D-E) indicated a decrease in PKH67-positive macrophages in the spleen, suggesting reduced erythrophagocytosis.</p>
<fig id="sa3fig8">
<label>Author response image 8.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-87496-sa3-fig8.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>(3) Flow cytometry analysis of RBC retention:</p>
<p>Our flow cytometry analysis revealed a decrease in PKH67-positive RBCs in both blood and spleen (Figure S4). We postulated that this was due to increased RBC production after HH exposure. However, this method might not accurately reflect RBC retention, as it measures the proportion of PKH67-labeled RBCs relative to the total number of RBCs, which increased after HH exposure.</p>
<fig id="sa3fig9">
<label>Author response image 9.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-87496-sa3-fig9.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>(4) Histological and immunostaining analysis:</p>
<p>Histological examination using HE staining and band3 immunostaining in situ (new Figure 6, A-D, and G-H) revealed a significant increase in RBC numbers in the spleen after HH exposure. This was further confirmed by detecting retained RBCs in splenic single cells using Wright-Giemsa composite stain (new Figure 6, E and F) and retained PKH67-labelled RBCs in spleen (new Figure 6, I and J).</p>
<fig id="sa3fig10">
<label>Author response image 10.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-87496-sa3-fig10.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>(5) Interpreting the data:</p>
<p>The comprehensive analysis suggests a complex interplay between increased RBC production and decreased erythrophagocytosis in the spleen following HH exposure. While flow cytometry indicated a decrease in the proportion of labeled RBCs, histological and immunostaining analyses demonstrated an actual increase in RBCs retention in the spleen. These findings collectively suggest that while the overall RBCs production is upregulated following HH exposure, the spleen's capacity for erythrophagocytosis is concurrently diminished, leading to increased RBCs retention.</p>
<p>(6) Conclusion:</p>
<p>Taken together, our results indicate a significant increase in RBCs retention in the spleen post-HH exposure, likely due to reduced residual RPMs and erythrophagocytosis. This conclusion is supported by a combination of flow cytometry, histological staining, and immunostaining techniques, providing a comprehensive view of RBC dynamics under HH conditions. We think these findings offer a clear quantitative measure of RBC retention in the spleen, addressing the concerns raised in your question.</p>

<p>We appreciate your question, which highlights the importance of using multiple analytical approaches to understand complex physiological processes. Please find below our point-by-point response to the methodological comments.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Decreased BM and spleen monocytes d/t increased liver monocyte migration is unclear. there is no evidence that this happens or why it would be a reasonable hypothesis, even in splenectomized mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for highlighting the need for further clarification and justification of our hypothesized decrease in BM and spleen monocytes due to increased monocyte migration to the liver, particularly in the context of splenectomized mice. Indeed, our study has not explicitly verified an augmentation in mononuclear cell migration to the liver in splenectomized mice.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, our investigations have revealed a notable increase in monocyte migration to the liver after HH exposure. Noteworthy is our discovery of a significant upregulation in colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) expression in the liver, observed after both 7 and 14 days of HH exposure (data not included). This observation was substantiated through flow cytometry analysis (as depicted in Figure S4), which affirmed an enhanced migration of monocytes to the liver. Specifically, we noted a considerable increase in the population of transient macrophages, monocytes, and Kupffer cells in the liver following HH exposure.</p>
<fig id="sa3fig11">
<label>Author response image 11.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-87496-sa3-fig11.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Considering these findings, we hypothesize that hypoxic conditions may activate a compensatory mechanism that directs monocytes towards the liver, potentially linked to the liver’s integral role in the systemic immune response. In accordance with these insights, we intend to revise our manuscript to reflect the speculative nature of this hypothesis more accurately, and to delineate the strategies we propose for its further empirical investigation. This amendment ensures that our hypothesis is presented with full consideration of its speculative basis, supported by a coherent framework for future validation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) While F4/80+CD11b+ population is decreased, this is mainly driven by CD11b and F4/80+ alone population is significantly increased. This is counter to the hypothesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for addressing the apparent discrepancy in our findings concerning the F4/80+CD11b+ population and the increase in the F4/80+ alone population, which seems to contradict our initial hypothesis. Your observation is indeed crucial for the integrity of our study, and we appreciate the opportunity to clarify this matter.</p>
<p>(1) Clarification of flow cytometry results:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In response to the concerns raised, we revisited our flow cytometry experiments with a focus on more clearly distinguishing the cell populations. Our initial graph had some ambiguities in cell grouping, which might have led to misinterpretations.</p>

<list-item><p>The revised flow cytometry analysis, specifically aimed at identifying red pulp macrophages (RPMs) characterized as F4/80hiCD11blo in the spleen, demonstrated a significant decrease in the F4/80 population. This finding is now in alignment with our immunofluorescence results.</p>

<list-item><p>The results presented in new Figure 3G and Figure 5 (A and B) consistently indicate a notable reduction in the RPMs population following HH exposure.

</list-item></list>
<p>We’ve updated our manuscript to reflect these new findings and interpretations. The revised manuscript details the revised flow cytometry analysis and discusses the potential mechanisms behind the observed changes in macrophage populations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) HO-1 expression cannot be used as a surrogate to quantify number of macrophages as the expression per cell can decrease and give the same results. In addition, the localization of effect to the red pulp is not equivalent to an assertion that the conclusion applies to macrophages given the heterogeneity of this part of the organ and the spleen in general.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comments regarding the use of HO-1 expression as a surrogate marker for quantifying macrophage numbers, and for pointing out the complexity of attributing changes in HO-1 expression specifically to macrophages in the splenic red pulp.

<list-item><p>In our study, HO-1 expression was not utilized as a direct marker for quantifying macrophages. Instead, it was considered an indicator of macrophage activity, particularly in relation to erythrophagocytosis. HO-1, being upregulated in response to erythrophagocytosis, serves as an indirect marker of this process within splenic macrophages.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>The rationale behind this approach was that increased HO-1 expression, induced by erythrophagocytosis in the spleen’s red pulp, could suggest an augmentation in the activity of splenic macrophages involved in this process.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>(2) Limitations of using HO-1 as an indicator:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>We acknowledge your point that HO-1 expression per cell might decrease, potentially leading to misleading interpretations if used as a direct quantifier of macrophage numbers. The variability in HO-1 expression per cell indeed presents a limitation in using it as a sole indicator of macrophage quantity.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>Furthermore, your observation about the heterogeneity of the spleen, particularly the red pulp, is crucial. The red pulp is a complex environment with various cell types, and asserting that changes in HO-1 expression are exclusive to macrophages could oversimplify this complexity.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>(3) Addressing the concerns:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To address these concerns, we propose to supplement our HO-1 expression data with additional specific markers for macrophages. This would help in correlating HO-1 expression more accurately with macrophage numbers and activity.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>We also plan to conduct further studies to delineate the specific cell types in the red pulp contributing to HO-1 expression. This could involve techniques such as immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry, which would allow us to localize HO-1 expression to specific cell populations within the splenic red pulp.</p>

<p>(5) Eryptosis is not defined in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for highlighting the omission of a definition for eryptosis in our manuscript. We acknowledge the significance of precisely defining such key terminologies, particularly when they play a crucial role in the context of our research findings.
Eryptosis, a term referenced in our study, is a specialized form of programmed cell death unique to erythrocytes. Similar with apoptosis in other cell types, eryptosis is characterized by distinct physiological changes including cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and the externalization of phosphatidylserine on the erythrocyte surface. These features are indicative of the RBCs lifecycle and its regulated destruction process.</p>
<p>However, it is pertinent to note that our current study does not extensively delve into the mechanisms or implications of eryptosis. Our primary focus has been to elucidate the effects of HH exposure on the processes of splenic erythrophagocytosis and the resultant impact on the lifespan of RBCs. Given this focus, and to maintain the coherence and relevance of our manuscript, we have decided to exclude specific discussions of eryptosis from our revised manuscript. This decision aligns with our aim to provide a clear and concentrated exploration of the influence of HH exposure on RBCs dynamics and splenic function.</p>
<p>We appreciate your input, which has significantly contributed to enhancing the clarity and accuracy of our manuscript. The revision ensures that our research is presented with a focused scope, aligning closely with our experimental investigations and findings.</p>

<p>(6) Physiologically, there is no evidence that there is any &quot;free iron&quot; in cells, making line 89 point inaccurate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for highlighting the concern regarding the reference to &quot;free iron&quot; in cells in line 89 of our manuscript. The term &quot;free iron&quot; in our manuscript was intended to refer to divalent iron (Fe2+), rather than unbound iron ions freely circulating within cells. We acknowledge that the term &quot;free iron&quot; might lead to misconceptions, as it implies the presence of unchelated iron, which is not physiologically common due to the potential for oxidative damage. To rectify this and provide clarity, we’ve revised line 89 of our manuscript to reflect our meaning more accurately. Instead of &quot;free iron,&quot; we use &quot;divalent iron (Fe2+)&quot; to avoid any misunderstanding regarding the state of iron in cells.
We also ensure that any implications drawn from the presence of Fe2+ in cells are consistent with current scientific literature and understanding.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your critical evaluation of the relevance and presentation of the M1 vs. M2 macrophage experiments in our manuscript. We appreciate your insights, especially regarding the use of specific markers and the lack of statistical analysis, as well as the relevance of bone marrow monocyte data to our study's main focus.</p>
<p>(1) Removal of M1 and M2 macrophage data:</p>
<p>Based on your feedback and our reassessment, we agree that the results pertaining to M1 and M2 macrophages did not align well with the main objectives of our manuscript. Consequently, we have decided to remove the related content on M1 and M2 macrophages from the revised manuscript. This decision was made to ensure that our manuscript remains focused and coherent, highlighting our primary findings without the distraction of unrelated or insufficiently supported data.</p>
<p>The use of only CD16 and CD86 markers for M1 and M2 macrophage characterization, without appropriate statistical analysis, was indeed a methodological limitation. We recognize that a more comprehensive set of markers and rigorous statistical analysis would be necessary for a meaningful interpretation of M1/M2 macrophage polarization. Furthermore, the relevance of these experiments to the central theme of our manuscript was not adequately established. Our study primarily focuses on erythrophagocytosis and red pulp macrophage dynamics under hypobaric hypoxia, and the M1/M2 polarization aspect did not contribute significantly to this narrative.</p>

<p>(10) Biotinolated RBC clearance is enhanced, demonstrating that RBC erythrophagocytosis is in fact ENHANCED, not diminished, calling into question the founding hypothesis that the manuscript proposes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your critical evaluation of our data on biotinylated RBC clearance, which suggests enhanced erythrophagocytosis under HH conditions. This observation indeed challenges our founding hypothesis that erythrophagocytosis is diminished in this setting. Below is a summary of our findings and methodology.</p>
<p>(1) Interpretation of RBC labeling results:</p>
<p>Both the previous results of NHS-biotin labeled RBCs (new Figure 4, A-D) and the current results of PKH67-labeled RBCs (new Figure 4, E-H) demonstrated a decrease in the number of labeled RBCs with an increase in injection time. The production of RBCs, including bone marrow and spleen production, was significantly increased following HH exposure, resulting in a consistent decrease in the proportion of labeled RBCs via flow cytometry detection both in the blood and spleen of mice compared to the NN group. However, compared to the reduced amplitude of fluorescently labeled RBCs observed in blood and spleen under NN exposure, there was a significantly weaker reduction in the amplitude of fluorescently labeled RBCs after HH exposure. Specifically, for blood, the biotin-labeled RBCs decreased by 12.06% under NN exposure and by 7.82% under HH exposure, while the PKH67-labeled RBCs decreased by 9.70% under NN exposure and by 4.09% under HH exposure. For spleen, the biotin-labeled RBCs decreased by 3.13% under NN exposure and by 0.46% under HH exposure, while the PKH67-labeled RBCs decreased by 1.16% under NN exposure and by 0.92% under HH exposure.</p>
<fig id="sa3fig14">
<label>Author response image 14.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-87496-sa3-fig14.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>(2) Increased RBCs production under HH conditions:</p>
<p>It's important to note that RBCs production, including from bone marrow and spleen, was significantly increased following HH exposure. This increase in RBCs production could contribute to the decreased proportion of labeled RBCs observed in flow cytometry analyses, as there are more unlabeled RBCs diluting the proportion of labeled cells in the blood and spleen.</p>
<p>(3) Analysis of erythrophagocytosis in RPMs:</p>
<p>Our analysis of PKH67-labeled RBCs content within RPMs following HH exposure showed a significant reduction in the number of PKH67-positive RPMs in the spleen (new Figure 5). This finding suggests a decrease in erythrophagocytosis by RPMs under HH conditions.</p>
<fig id="sa3fig15">
<label>Author response image 15.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-87496-sa3-fig15.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>(4) Reconciling the findings:</p>
<p>The apparent contradiction between enhanced RBC clearance (suggested by the reduced proportion of labeled RBCs) and reduced erythrophagocytosis in RPMs (indicated by fewer PKH67-positive RPMs) may be explained by the increased overall production of RBCs under HH. This increased production could mask the actual erythrophagocytosis activity in terms of the proportion of labeled cells. Therefore, while the proportion of labeled RBCs decreases more significantly under HH conditions, this does not necessarily indicate an enhanced erythrophagocytosis rate, but rather an increased dilution effect due to higher RBCs turnover.</p>
<p>(5) Revised interpretation and manuscript changes:</p>
<p>Given these factors, we update our manuscript to reflect this detailed interpretation and clarify the implications of the increased RBCs production under HH conditions on our observations of labeled RBCs clearance and erythrophagocytosis. We appreciate your insightful feedback, which has prompted a careful re-examination of our data and interpretations. We hope that these revisions provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the effects of HH on erythrophagocytosis and RBCs dynamics.</p>

<p>(11) Legend in Fig 4c-4d looks incorrect and Fig 4e-4f is very non-specific since Wright stain does not provide evidence of what type of cells these are and making for a significant overstatement in the contribution of this data to &quot;confirming&quot; increased erythrophagocytosis in the spleen under HH exposure (line 395-396).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful observations regarding the data presentation and figure legends in our manuscript, particularly in relation to Figure 4 (renamed as Figure 6 in the revised manuscript) and the use of Wright-Giemsa composite staining. We appreciate your constructive feedback and acknowledge the importance of presenting our data with utmost clarity and precision.</p>
<p>(1) Amendments to Figure legends:</p>
<p>We recognize the necessity of rectifying inaccuracies in the legends of the previously labeled Figure 4C and D. Corrections have been meticulously implemented to ensure the legends accurately contain the data presented. Additionally, we acknowledge the error concerning the description of Wright staining. The method employed in our study is Wright-Giemsa composite staining, which, unlike Wright staining that solely stains cytoplasm (RBC), is capable of staining both nuclei and cytoplasm.</p>
<p>(2) Addressing the specificity of Wright-Giemsa Composite staining:</p>
<p>Our approach involved quantifying RBC retention using Wright-Giemsa composite staining on single splenic cells post-perfusion at 7 and 14 days post HH exposure. We understand and appreciate your concerns regarding the nonspecific nature of Wright staining. Although Wright stain is a general hematologic stain and not explicitly specific for certain cell types, its application in our study aimed to provide preliminary insights. The spleen cells, devoid of nuclei and thus likely to be RBCs, were stained and observed post-perfusion, indicating RBC retention within the spleen.</p>
<p>(3) Incorporating additional methods for RBC identification:</p>
<p>To enhance the specificity of our findings, we integrated supplementary methods for RBC identification in the revised manuscript. We employed band3 immunostaining (in the new Figure 6, C-D and G-H) and PKH67 labeling (Figure 6, I-J) for a more targeted identification of RBCs. Band3, serving as a reliable marker for RBCs, augments the specificity of our immunostaining approach. Likewise, PKH67 labeling affords a direct and definitive means to assess RBC retention in the spleen following HH exposure.</p>

<p>Based on these enhanced methodologies, we have refined our interpretation of the data and accordingly updated the manuscript. The revised narrative underscores that our conclusions regarding reduced erythrophagocytosis and RBC retention under HH conditions are corroborated by not only Wright-Giemsa composite staining but also by band3 immunostaining and PKH67 labeling, each contributing distinctively to our comprehensive understanding.</p>

<p>The following questions and remarks should be considered by the authors:</p>
<p>(1) The methods should clearly state whether the HH was discontinued during the 7 or 14 day exposure for cleaning, fresh water etc. Moreover, how was CO2 controlled? The procedure for splenectomy needs to be described in the methods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your inquiry regarding the specifics of our experimental methods, particularly the management of HH exposure and the procedure for splenectomy. We appreciate your attention to detail and the importance of these aspects for the reproducibility and clarity of our research.</p>
<p>(1) HH exposure conditions:</p>
<p>In our experiments, mice were continuously exposed to HH for the entire duration of 7 or 14 days, without interruption for activities such as cleaning or providing fresh water. This uninterrupted exposure was crucial for maintaining consistent hypobaric conditions throughout the experiment. The hypobaric chamber was configured to ensure a ventilation rate of 25 air exchanges per minute. This high ventilation rate was effective in regulating the concentration of CO2 inside the chamber, thereby maintaining a stable environment for the mice.</p>
<p>(2) The splenectomy was performed as follows:</p>
<p>After anesthesia, the mice were placed in a supine position, and their limbs were fixed. The abdominal operation area was skinned, disinfected, and covered with a sterile towel. A median incision was made in the upper abdomen, followed by laparotomy to locate the spleen. The spleen was then carefully pulled out through the incision. The arterial and venous directions in the splenic pedicle were examined, and two vascular forceps were used to clamp all the tissue in the main cadre of blood vessels below the splenic portal. The splenic pedicle was cut between the forceps to remove the spleen. The end of the proximal hepatic artery was clamped with a vascular clamp, and double or through ligation was performed to secure the site. The abdominal cavity was then cleaned to ensure there was no bleeding at the ligation site, and the incision was closed. Post-operatively, the animals were housed individually. Generally, they were able to feed themselves after recovering from anesthesia and did not require special care.</p>
<p>We hope this detailed description addresses your queries and provides a clear understanding of the experimental conditions and procedures used in our study. These methodological details are crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reproducibility of our research findings.</p>

<p>(2) The lack of changes in MCH needs explanation? During stress erythropoiesis some limit in iron availability should cause MCH decrease particularly if the authors claim that macrophages for rapid iron recycling are decreased.

<p>Thank you for your inquiry regarding the lack of changes in Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) in our study, particularly in the context of stress erythropoiesis and decreased macrophage-mediated iron recycling. We appreciate the opportunity to provide further clarification on this aspect.</p>
<p>(1) Explanation for stable MCH levels:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Our research identified a decrease in erythrophagocytosis and iron recycling in the spleen following HH exposure. Despite this, the MCH levels remained stable. This observation can be explained by considering the compensatory roles of other organs, particularly the liver and duodenum, in maintaining iron homeostasis.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>Specifically, our investigations revealed an enhanced capacity of the liver to engulf RBCs and process iron under HH conditions. This increased hepatic erythrophagocytosis likely compensates for the reduced splenic activity, thereby stabilizing MCH levels.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>(2) Role of hepcidin and DMT1 expression:</p>
<p>Additionally, hypoxia is known to influence iron metabolism through the downregulation of Hepcidin and upregulation of Divalent Metal Transporter 1 (DMT1) expression. These alterations lead to enhanced intestinal iron absorption and increased blood iron levels, further contributing to the maintenance of MCH levels despite reduced splenic iron recycling.</p>

<p>(3) Fig 2 the difference between sham and splenectomy is really marginal and not convincing. Is there also a difference at 7 days? Why does the spleen size decrease between 7 and 14 days?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your observations regarding the marginal differences observed between sham and splenectomy groups in Figure 2, as well as your inquiries about spleen size dynamics over time. We appreciate this opportunity to clarify these aspects of our study.</p>
<p>(1) Splenectomy vs. Sham group differences:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In our experiments, the difference between the sham and splenectomy groups under HH conditions, though subtle, was consistent with our hypothesis regarding the spleen's role in erythrophagocytosis and stress erythropoiesis. Under NN conditions, no significant difference was observed between these groups, which aligns with the expectation that the spleen's contribution is more pronounced under hypoxic stress.</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>(2) Spleen size dynamics and peak stress erythropoiesis:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The observed splenic enlargement prior to 7 days can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the retention of RBCs and extramedullary hematopoiesis, which is known to be a response to hypoxic stress.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>Prior research has elucidated that splenic stress-induced erythropoiesis, triggered by hypoxic conditions, typically attains its zenith within a timeframe of 3 to 7 days. This observation aligns with our Toluidine Blue (TO) staining results, which indicated that the apex of this response occurs at the 7-day mark (as depicted in Figure 1, F-G). Here, the culmination of this peak is characteristically succeeded by a diminution in extramedullary hematopoiesis, a phenomenon that could elucidate the observed contraction in spleen size, particularly in the interval between 7 and 14 days.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>This pattern of splenic response under prolonged hypoxic stress is corroborated by studies such as those conducted by Wang et al. (2021), Harada et al. (2015), and Cenariu et al. (2021). These references collectively underscore that the spleen undergoes significant dynamism in reaction to sustained hypoxia. This dynamism is initially manifested as an enlargement of the spleen, attributable to escalated erythropoiesis and erythrophagocytosis. Subsequently, as these processes approach normalization, a regression in spleen size ensues.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>We’ve revised our manuscript to include a more detailed explanation of these splenic dynamics under HH conditions, referencing the relevant literature to provide a comprehensive context for our findings. We will also consider performing additional analysis or providing further data on spleen size changes at 7 days to support our observations and ensure a thorough understanding of the splenic response to hypoxic stress over time.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful questions regarding the details of our data presentation in Figure 3, particularly about the identification of cell clusters and the implications of macrophage reduction. We appreciate the opportunity to address these aspects and clarify our findings.</p>

<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In the revised manuscript, we have included detailed notes for each cell population represented in Figure 3B (Figure 3D in revised manuscript). These notes provide a clearer understanding of the cell types present in each cluster, enhancing the interpretability of our single-cell sequencing data.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>This detailed annotation will help readers to better understand the composition of the splenic cell populations under study and how they are affected by hypoxic conditions.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>(2) Impact of splenectomy vs. macrophage reduction:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The interplay between the reduction in macrophage populations, as evidenced by our single-cell sequencing data, and the ramifications of splenectomy presents a multifaceted scenario. Notably, the observed decline in macrophage numbers following HH exposure does not straightforwardly equate to a comparable alteration in overall splenic function, as might be anticipated with splenectomy.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>In the context of splenectomy under HH conditions, a significant escalation in the RBCs count was observed, surpassing that in non-splenectomized mice exposed to HH. This finding underscores the spleen's critical role in modulating RBCs dynamics under HH. It also indirectly suggests that the diminished phagocytic capacity of the spleen following HH exposure contributes to an augmented RBCs count, albeit to a lesser extent than in the splenectomy group. This difference is attributed to the fact that, while the number of RPMs in the spleen post-HH is reduced, they are still present, unlike in the case of splenectomy, where they are entirely absent.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>Splenectomy entails the complete removal of the spleen, thus eliminating a broad spectrum of functions beyond erythrophagocytosis and iron recycling mediated by macrophages. The nuanced changes observed in our study may be reflective of the spleen's diverse functionalities and the organism's adaptive compensatory mechanisms in response to the loss of this organ.</p>

<p>(5) Is the reduced phagocytic capacity in Fig 4B significant? Erythrophagocytosis is compromised due to the considerable spontaneous loss of labelled erythrocytes; could other assays help? (potentially by a modified Chromium release assay?). Is it necessary to stimulated phagocytosis to see a significant effect?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your inquiry regarding the significance of the reduced phagocytic capacity observed in Figure 4B, and the potential for employing alternative assays to elucidate erythrophagocytosis dynamics under HH conditions.</p>
<p>(1) Significance of reduced phagocytic capacity:</p>
<p>The observed reduction in the amplitude of fluorescently labeled RBCs in both the blood and spleen under HH conditions suggests a decrease in erythrophagocytosis. This is indicative of a diminished phagocytic capacity, particularly when contrasted with NN conditions.</p>
<p>(2) Investigation of erythrophagocytosis dynamics:</p>
<p>To delve deeper into erythrophagocytosis under HH, we employed Tuftsin to enhance this process. Following the injection of PKH67-labeled RBCs and subsequent HH exposure, we noted a significant decrease in PKH67 fluorescence in the spleen, particularly marked after the administration of Tuftsin. This finding implies that stimulated erythrophagocytosis can influence RBCs lifespan.</p>
<p>(3) Erythrophagocytosis under normal and hypoxic conditions:</p>
<p>Under normal conditions, the reduction in phagocytic activity is less apparent without stimulation. However, under HH conditions, our findings demonstrate a clear weakening of the phagocytic effect. While we established that promoting phagocytosis under NN conditions affects RBC lifespan, the impact of enhanced phagocytosis under HH on RBCs numbers was not explicitly investigated.</p>
<p>(4) Potential for alternative assays:</p>
<p>Considering the considerable spontaneous loss of labeled erythrocytes, alternative assays such as a modified Chromium release assay could provide further insights. Such assays might offer a more nuanced understanding of erythrophagocytosis efficiency and the stability of labeled RBCs under different conditions.</p>
<p>(5) Future research directions:</p>
<p>The implications of these results suggest that future studies should focus on comparing the effects of stimulated phagocytosis under both NN and HH conditions. This would offer a clearer picture of the impact of hypoxia on the phagocytic capacity of macrophages and the subsequent effects on RBC turnover.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings indicate a diminished erythrophagocytic capacity, with enhanced phagocytosis affecting RBCs lifespan. Further investigation, potentially using alternative assays, would be beneficial to comprehensively understand the dynamics of erythrophagocytosis in different physiological states.</p>

<p>(6) Can the observed ferroptosis be influenced by bi- and not trivalent iron chelators?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your question regarding the potential influence of bi- and trivalent iron chelators on ferroptosis under hypoxic conditions. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss the implications of our findings in this context.</p>
<p>(1) Analysis of iron chelators on ferroptosis:</p>
<p>In our study, we did not specifically analyze the effects of bi- and trivalent iron chelators on ferroptosis under hypoxia. However, our observations with Deferoxamine (DFO), a well-known iron chelator, provide some insights into how iron chelation may influence ferroptosis in splenic macrophages under hypoxic conditions.</p>
<p>(2) Effect of DFO on oxidative stress markers:</p>
<p>Our findings showed that under 1% O2, there was an increase in Malondialdehyde (MDA) content, a marker of lipid peroxidation, and a decrease in Glutathione (GSH) content, indicative of oxidative stress. These changes are consistent with the induction of ferroptosis, which is characterized by increased lipid peroxidation and depletion of antioxidants. Treatment with Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) and DFO effectively reversed these alterations. This suggests that DFO, like Fer-1, can mitigate ferroptosis in splenic macrophages under hypoxia, primarily by impacting MDA and GSH levels.</p>

<p>(3) Potential role of iron chelators in ferroptosis:</p>
<p>The effectiveness of DFO in reducing markers of ferroptosis indicates that iron availability plays a crucial role in the ferroptotic process under hypoxic conditions. It is plausible that both bi- and trivalent iron chelators could influence ferroptosis, given their ability to modulate iron availability within cells. Since ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of cell death, chelating iron, irrespective of its valence state, could potentially disrupt the process by limiting the iron necessary for the generation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation.</p>
<p>(4) Additional research and manuscript updates:</p>
<p>Our study highlights the need for further research to explore the differential effects of various iron chelators on ferroptosis, particularly under hypoxic conditions. Such studies could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of iron in ferroptosis and the potential therapeutic applications of iron chelators. We update our manuscript to include these findings and discuss the potential implications of iron chelation in the context of ferroptosis under hypoxic conditions. This will provide a broader perspective on our research and its significance in understanding the mechanisms of ferroptosis.</p>
